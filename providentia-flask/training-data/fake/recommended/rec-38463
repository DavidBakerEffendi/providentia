I'm waffling on this, because our server and the food were both really, really good. But the wait and the lies from the host team were infuriating and incredibly unprofessional. Breakdown: I went with a group of 7 for my brother in-laws birthday. We had stone bowls, the stew, a slew of fresh tofu and pancakes (the kimchi pancake and stone bowl were incredible, if the second needed salt). The food and Jenny, our server, were phenomenal. I haven't had much experience with korean food, but like, damn, everything was so flavorful. Really stellar food experience. HOWEVER. Our reservation was for 7:30, and being dutiful diners we showed up 5 minutes early to sign in and to get an eta on our table. I was told 5 minutes, they were just finishing resetting the table. 10 minutes later I ask again and I'm told that it will be 2 minutes. Okay, whatever, I've been a host for 4 years and I know how unpredictable it can be, but it seems strange that the table they were clearing off 10 minutes ago is now seated with a group of girls. 15 minutes later and I ask again, and I'm told that the group ahead of us is paying. At this point I'm just sort of lost for words and let my MIL deal with it, but come on. Pro-tip, just be on point with your guests. Be straight forward and honest, tell me it's going to be a half-hour wait because the table before us is taking longer than expected. Don't lie because it's easy enough to catch. Regardless, I will definitely go back, but probably earlier and with a smaller group so we don't get screwed around for 40 minutes.
