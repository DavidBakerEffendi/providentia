Jerry's Subs makes a better Cheese Steak.. What is all the hype about it was butchered meat that was extremely dry with no flavor. Is it really hard to put some S&P before you cook something and the cheese is not melted they just stick it in your bread. The employees are rude most people that come to this place where from out of town you moron no one cares about your stupid "rules". And they only except cash really what kind of business are you running that doesn't allow you to pay with credit cards. Save your time don't wait in line for some crappy cheese steak and they don't even serve fries
