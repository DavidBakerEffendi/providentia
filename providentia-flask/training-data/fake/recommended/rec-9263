A real Chefs' Restaurant! The food was amazing, and the breadth, the variety on the menu made my heart leap in food loving joy. Where else can you order Matzo Ball soup and Lobster or Steak? The Fondue, a great start while getting a drink at the bar... Open until 4am, you will find a mix of late nighters, Bar tenders, Chefs, and celebs in the late hours. Earlier in the evening you will find a packed house of regulars and those looking for a special place on a special occasion. The Best Part? Equal service for all. No snobbyness, nothing over-looked, just great attention to detail. The wait, understandably, can be on the long side. Don't expect to walk in and get seated righ off the bat at 9pm on Saturday or Friday. An easy 30 minutes or more is a good starting point to keep in mind when you decide to eat here. Other than that, I don't know what to say. A great place for a drink w/ a bite, or a full meal.
