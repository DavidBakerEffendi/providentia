Post-theater? looking for a great sit down place that's doesn't fit the mold? Well, this place is perfect choice. The Asian theme decor is simply gorgeous. On a Sunday night, we sat right next to the huge chandelier in a box. Service was great,surprisingly since many people said the contrary. For apps had the curry puffs(excellent).As entrees, the mister ordered the Pad Thai with sun dried shrimp (their specialty) while I had the Pad See Euw (which came out wrapped in a egg sack). Beautiful presentation. Delicious meals.So far, the best Thai I've had in the city.
