We took the drive, went during their off season ( before Labor Day). So it wasn't packed.  The waitress was super friendly and we ordered.  Food came out quickly and was awesome.   My hubby gets eggs etc and I got the strawberry pancakes.  Omg, so amazing.   Huge portions too.   Please try the home fries.   They are  awesome !  But they won't tell you how they make em.
