El Fuego reminds me of Freebird's burrito in Texas.  I feel the food and service is pretty good for a burrito assembly line restaurant.  The happy hour posted looked like a good value, and will surely bring me there after work some day.  The only real flaw I noticed was in the meat.  I found my beef somewhat not tender & seasoned as I have had before, but other than that the place is great!  Kudos!
