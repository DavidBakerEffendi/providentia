Fun Thursday night! Came around 8pm for my boyfriend's birthday and were treated to a live flamenco show. Food was delicious and the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria was amazing. I had called ahead to see if they could bring out a dessert for the birthday celebration. INSTEAD, my boyfriend and I were both surprised when the live band called his name over the mic to have a birthday dance with one of the flamenco dancers. Definitely recommend for a fun date night.
