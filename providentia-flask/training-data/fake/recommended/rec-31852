We ordered a dozen sandwiches and some salads for our office today from Banh Mi Zon.  We're not in their delivery zone so we ordered delivery using WunWun (wunwun.com).  The folks at Banh Mi Zon were extremely careful with taking our order, and even came in earlier than their usual hours to prepare the food neatly.   Since we were using a third party delivery service, Tai at Banh Mi Zon even called us to give us updates on the pick up time and gave us a heads up on potential delays/problems since we had ordered too much to be delivered by bike (the poor Wunwun guy had to take the subway). Some of us at the office have had their sandwiches before (best banh mi in New York!) so the quality of food was no surprise, but the quality of the service was truly exceptional.  We'll definitely think of them for events or stop by their shop to pay our compliments. Thanks Tai!
