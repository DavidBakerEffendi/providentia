We stopped in here for dinner on a Sunday night and could not have been more pleased.   Happiness started with a stellar beer list and amazingly fast and friendly service.  We ordered a plate of french fries with smoked cheddar and possibly the best gravy I've ever eaten.  It didn't last long.   I ordered off the specials menu: a smoked duck, cashew butter and sweet pepper jelly sandwich.  My mind: blown.  I couldn't finish it all, but I also couldn't stop thinking about it.  El Husband-o ordered BBQ pork, loved the North Carolina sauce (he's from there), and we both adored the mac and cheese.  All in all the only thing I would change is the volume of the music, but that's because I'm an old.
