I often say that I like certain restaurants but that I wouldn't travel to get there. This isn't one of those restaurants. I actually live pretty close to this place but even if I didn't, I would still take the subway or whatever to get here. Food is always really good, albeit sometimes a little on the heavier side. The service is always very attentive, though sometimes maybe they can come across as a little pushy and in your face, but I think it's cause they generally have a real passion for the food that they're serving, which is nice. My one negative for La Pulperia is that while their drinks are good, I think the $14 price tag on their drinks is a bit much. It's nothing especially amazing, though unique, to be charging nice lounge/bar manhattan prices. But definitely recommend this place.
