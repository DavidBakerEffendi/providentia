wishhhhh this place had more table space!!!!! I came with my bf after dying to go for months.  We came after the lunch crowd, around 2, but all of the three tables in the place were packed.  We waited for about 5 minutes, but it looked like everyone was really settled in there, so we left and figured we'd come back in a bit.  After returning, we found that all the tables were still full and there was additional people waiting for tables.  Its all first come first serve so u literally have to stand in the tiny cramped corner while u wait for a table.   Once we were seated, though, it was heaven.  We had fresh juices, a strawberry and a mint juice, and they were so refreshing.  We ordered the summer rolls- which were solo delicious, then a roll with jalapeño, one with mango, .... who are we kidding, we ordered about five rolls, I can't even remember which ones, but they were all so delicious.  The first time eating 'sushi' with NO soy sauce or dressings on it! the black rice was incredible, and everything was extremely fresh and tasty.  Cant say a bad thing about the food and the really sweet woman who rung us up.  We ended up leaving with two desserts, and all i have to say is the chocolate coconut ball was one of the best desserts I've ever eaten- even though i was very skeptical as it sat wrapped in a plastic bag in their refrigerator.  you HAVE GOT to taste this stuff!
