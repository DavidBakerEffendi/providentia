Beyond Sushi...beyond awesome.  Incredibly delicious combinations of flavors...and the rice, which with conventional sushi can be somewhat plain, is done here with a six grain rice that was incredibly delicious.  The rice paper wraps are amazing as well.  Small place but extremely friendly and helpful staff.   We are excited to go back again!
