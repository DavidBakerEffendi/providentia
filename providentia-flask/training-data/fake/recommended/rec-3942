Small, very very casual, and executed really well. Location is great if you're down town and don't want to line up at Lombardi's (why on earth would you?). The space is tiny but I liked the communal tables and the design is great considering it's size. The food is simple: burgers, chicken paninis, salads etc.. The burgers are very good. Be warned you need a couple of napkins to mop up the juices.They come with a small salad to offset the meat!! Do expect the aussie casual approach which I don't mind but some reviews mention this is a bad thing.. I'm amazed that a place of this size can execute an idea so well. Maybe we need more aussies in town..?
