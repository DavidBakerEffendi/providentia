I visited some of my best college friends in NYC this weekend, and UVA was the final dinner before my flight Monday morning. And wow, what a way to end a really fantastic weekend! Eight of us spent almost three hours enjoying food, wine, and great conversation around a dark wood table next to a fireplace, the atmosphere was perfectly cozy and intimate. I'm a huge Riesling fan, and thoroughly enjoyed the Mercer Estates Riesling that we shared - Â notes of apricot and lime, delicious. Those were the elements that really won me over, but the food was good too - though not the best I've ever had. I ordered the homemade ravioli stuffed with artichoke and ham, served in a goat cheese tomato sauce. I thought the pasta itself was a little too thick for the delicate sauce and filling. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I'd definitely recommend it...actually I've already told everyone else I know that lives in NYC to check it out :)
