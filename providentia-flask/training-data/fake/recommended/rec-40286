Valley Shepard Creamery has wonderful fresh mozzarella and roasted tomato sandwiches. I swear there was a pound of cheese on my sammy. This place is just wonderful. We went on a Sunday, and although some places were indeed closed, there was still more than enough going on to slightly overwhelm me. Â The high star rating this place has is well deserved.
