I lived in Montville for 4 years before relocating to South Florida. Better than average diner. Nothing super great, nothing super bad. Pretty darn consistent. I only had one negative experience here. I ordered an ice tea with my meal, and for whatever reason after a few refills, when I got the check they charged me for every refill. After asking for the manager, I got my check reduced. The food is better than the personalities of the wait staff. Been here about 40+ times, and never had anyone serve me that had any type of personality. But the food is good, and for a diner, what more can you ask. Plenty of parking, although looking onto route 46 isn't exactly a breaktaking scene.
