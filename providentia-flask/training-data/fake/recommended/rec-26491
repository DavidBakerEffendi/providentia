Friendly service, tons of food, attractive atmosphere and attentive staff. Interesting table side rice preparation followed by a serving of unique toasted rice soup (broth-like). But prepare for a 15 minute wait minimum, and without expectations of anything new or different. The menu is the same as the same as any other place in KTown, except more limited and cluttered by Korean symbols (confusing, clearly, if you're not a native speaker). And despite their note about adapting to those with food allergies on the menu, don't expect any accommodations. I am allergic to oil - yea yea, I've heard all the commentary before - but was told there was absolutely NOTHING on the menu that they would serve without oil. The waitress actually gestured to the fried fish that comes as an appetizer and suggested I eat that with my rice... As a note to people who find my request unreasonable, I'd like to mention that I've been to almost every restaurant in KTown and almost all of them already have, or can cook something on the menu, without oil. And, it makes you wonder, is BCD so strict because they make big vats of food ahead of time, and simply scoop it out like mush as ordered? Personally, I like my food fresh. But again, to restate after this negativity, the service was friendly, speedy, and attentive to the table nonetheless, and plenty of appetizers are doled out before the main meal even comes (somewhat more than other restaurants on the block). My boyfriend enjoyed his mixed seafood-meat soup, so the food is probably pretty good. I think it's worth a try. See what you think.
