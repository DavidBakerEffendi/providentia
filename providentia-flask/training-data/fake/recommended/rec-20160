Bijans was delcious. Came here before seeing the Nutcracker at BAM. We took advantage of happy hour (2 fancy cocktails for $10!). The drinks were great. We had the calamari which were crispy and fried beautifully. We also had the smoked eggplant dish which wasn't my fave, but for our entree we split the stake and frittes, it was amazing. Our waitress was lovely and I was very impressed - she was the only one working the small space, but she did a phenomenal job. Def worth a trip!
