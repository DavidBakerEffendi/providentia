My boyfriend and I used to come to the spot when we worked at the sock man on St Marks Place several years ago... We sometimes still venture into the city just to have a Sunday brunch there from New Jersey.. And we order almost the same thing every single time we go there.. I get the omelette with tomatoes spinach and goat cheese with a side of mescaline greens and potato salad...So good Omfg!!! A pretty decent size plate also! My boyfriend orders the cinnamon spiced pumpkin pancakes with a side of Taylor ham.. Those are the best pancakes I think I've ever tasted, definitely for those with a sweet tooth but none-the-less amazing!! We like to sit outside when we get the chance, even though inside is big there a lot of small tables they're making it hard to move around. The service is pretty good there once in awhile I have to wait a few minutes for a cup of coffee, the taste of the food makes up for that... the hummus and baba ganoush are also very good. I need to remind my boyfriend that were due for a brunch date there lol...
