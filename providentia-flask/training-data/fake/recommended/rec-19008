When tapas are bad, they are really bad, but when they are good, they really effing good. Such is the case with Tia Pol. I'll even trek all the way out there to 10 Ave. to enjoy the little zingers. We sat at the bar and only got a peek inside but the ambience is definitely relaxing and awesomely cool. The tapas we got were: lamb skewers with moorish spices, the potato bravas with aioli sauce, the chorizo with sherry and the potato/onion/egg omelet, no cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious. Some people commented that the chorizo was too salty but I thought it was just right. The portions are pretty big and the potato bravas alone was enough for a full meal. The sauce was omg good. Last time I had such good aioli sauce was in Peru. Didn't get to try the wines, will save that for next time. I don't regularly eat tapas because a lot of tapas has cheese and/or seafood which I can't eat, but I'm testament to the fact that even if you don't eat tapas regularly, your taste buds will appreciate this gem of a tapas joint. Do yourself a favor and just GO.
