A very, very special place. Wonderful ambiance all around, especially the dining area upstairs which is a perfect balance of cozy and elegance.  It was refreshing to find a place in nyc where you can enjoy a delicious meal and have an intimate conversation (noise level was rather low despite the full capacity and music selection was wonderful).  FOOD was so flavorful...no holding back on spices or love.  I would go back just for Katayef & Veal Bacon (double yum!). Munti and Kafta were also delicious. Lamb Chops were highly recommended but they were not my personal favorite. For dessert I ordered "From Lebanon with Love" and White Coffee...there were better choices for dessert but I was feeling playful and it hit the spot for me. I walked away with renewed love for orange blossoms. The whole dining experience was exceptional and we believe our server, Mark, played a huge role in making it extraordinary.. with his expert suggestions, attentive demeanor and great sense of humor.  We shall return!!
