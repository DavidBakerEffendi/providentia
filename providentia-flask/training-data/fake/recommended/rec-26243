Unfortunately I could not give them zero stars. IF YOU HAVE SHRIMP ALLEGERYS MAKE SURE YOU ASK WHAT IS IN EACH DISH. Rushed to the hospital because the vegetable spring rolls had Shrimp. I am allergic to shrimp. The manager said "we occasionally put shellfish in our food. If you don't like it don't come back." So much for customer service. This place is not sanitary and would not refund my money. This place is a lawsuite waiting to happen.
