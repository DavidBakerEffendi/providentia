Been meaning to check it out for a while and finally popped in on a Wednesday night.  No problem getting a table.  I had no problems with the service- our waitress was quiet but friendly and attentive.  I had gone with the intentions of trying the much raved about couscous but I got sucked into the baked pasta. I have a hard time turning down anything with gorgonzola.  The pasta was good, but not great.  The chocolate bread pudding with whipped cream was tasty.  The best part is $30 got me a glass of wine, an entree, a split dessert (shared with my friend) and tip.  That's a decent price point for a nice meal out.  O and the music selection was awesome 90s music that I really enjoyed!
