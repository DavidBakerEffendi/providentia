Just had an odd dinner experience. None of the tables were set, the dining room was freezing, and a party was in the back. We were told the furnace was out, and our bill was kindly reduced! That said, the food was almost universally fantastic. All of the proteins were great, excellently cooked. The only aberration was the pulled pork. Initially not brought to the table, it was strangely spiced. Overall, would highly recommend the food--it would be amazing for a catered an event, maybe takeout!
