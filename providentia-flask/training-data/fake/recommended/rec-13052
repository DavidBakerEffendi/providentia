Totto Ramen has probably the best bowl of ramen in the city, and even the country for that matter. Hands. down. Every time I go, it is a superb experience, aside from the wait. But hey, you have to expect that, especially when the ramen is that good. Something that makes this place unique is the stringy noodles, very different than the other ramen places. The piece de resistance however, is the broth. Whether you get chicken or pork, it's to die for. My tastebuds are not extremely accustomed to spicy food so I would order the basic ramen they have and then have them give you the spicy stuff on the side to add as needed. You'll come to realize that you'll be adding the spicy sauce as you eat through the bowl. Oh my goodness, I'm getting hungry! They know how to make a good bowl of ramen, and truly a cut above. A must for any New York trip.
