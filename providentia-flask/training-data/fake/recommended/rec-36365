went there for breakfast / brunch on a sunday. lovely french vibe, especially earlier before it got mobbed. you can read the other reviews about the food, but.... big problem: cloth napkins very linty. both my friend and i were wearing black and ended up speckled with  white stuff from the schmottas --  not cool. time for new cloth napkins, balthazar!
