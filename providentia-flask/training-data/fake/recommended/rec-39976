Love the location and the atmosphere, but both times I've been here the service has been awful. The first time a bartender was rude with me for ordering leaving a $2 tip on a $8 drink. Thinking maybe it was just an off day I came back for dinner and drinks a second time. My waiter was rude, didn't help with any questions, and was at my table a total of 2, maybe 3, times throughout the night (730pm). Will not be coming back here. Cool location but not worth the hype.
