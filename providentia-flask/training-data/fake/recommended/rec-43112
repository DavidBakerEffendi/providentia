This huge place is a hidden gem in Brooklyn! Was there today for the first time. Had little trouble finding a parking space however worth the wait! We also got a chance to meet the owner, a really nice gentleman. Inside is very spacious and nicely decorated. Bathrooms are so clean and modern. I loved every corner of this place. Their display cases are very organized and makes you want to eat everything. Very large selection of cakes and pastries.! We ordered breakfast platter with an omelette. Everything was fresh and done so nicely. Delicious food, very friendly staff. Our waitress was very helpful. This place could be a great place to celebrate all kinds of events.
