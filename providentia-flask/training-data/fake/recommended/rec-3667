I have mixed feeling about my brunch at Bijan's. We arrived at 11 am, but the staff complained that they couldn't open up yet because of a late waitress. We came back 20 minutes later to get a seat. Unprepared management, unhappy staff. Not the best way to start your morning. The space is charming in a cozy Brooklyn meets Bedouin kinda way. Its rustic, but industrial, and filled with lots of kitsch, succulent plants, and modern art pieces. There are small tables, as well as one long communal table. If the place is full, it would feel very crowded. Our tables and chairs were very wobbly, which drove the OCD in me a little crazy. The lack of uniformity and polish actually makes the place look a bit gritty. I ordered the: Lemonade Saffron semolina pancakes Lamb burger Coffee (which the poor staff kept complaining was going to be a tiny bit of a wait because SOMEBODY didn't show up on time, and wasn't she so sorry that SOMEBODY was completely ruining her day) The pancakes sucked. They tasted like baking soda, not like saffron. They were remedied only by the blueberry compote on top. But if you can't serve a pancake that tastes good on its own, you shouldn't be serving it. However, Perry absolutely loved his lamb burger with feta. He polished it off faster than your momma can say your full name. So his happiness with his meal counters mine. I can see how this place would be awesome for cocktails and lounging around. But that's not why I was here. The service was whiny. The unprepared opening. The pancakes. So this gets a giant MEH from me.
