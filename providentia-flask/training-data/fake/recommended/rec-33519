Habana Outpost, I miss you! The neighborhood is quieter, sadder, and far more lonesome without your eclectic cool.  How does one cope with a cold Saturday after having tasted your summertime thrills?  What does one do on a Sunday night when there aren't any outdoor 80's films to enjoy (Free Popcorn! Star Wars! Cute Boys!)?  Where can one find that automatic answer to boredom?  The palate yearns for sweet corn coated with cheese, for spicy black beans and mojitos that, after only a few sips, will cause more than a brain freeze.  The corner of Fulton & S.Portland now feels like a ghost town - deflated and waiting for the color and life to return from hibernation.  We stand at the gates, hoping for them to open and restore us all. Oh, and if you forget to bring cash - there's a painted atm-machine, just in case.
