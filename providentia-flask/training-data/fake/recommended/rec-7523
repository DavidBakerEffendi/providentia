Blue Point is on point - to the max. This place has GREAT oysters. Plus, the staff is such smarty-pants about them, making it easier to choose from their extensive collection. I have NEVER had fish here that was not fresh .. always perfectly fishy. And lots of fish to choose from - gives you that opportunity to try something that you may not have had before. BYOB .. don't forget to tote along your bottle of white !
