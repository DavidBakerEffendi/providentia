My ALL TIME FAVE RESTAURANT EVER! I never had Lebanese food before.. but this is apparently a mix between Lebanese and Mediterranean. Their pita chips and bread bowl are amazing! All of their appetizers are so good! I've had the wings, the hummus, warm eggplant, fries (best fries ever, especially with the dip!), falafel, fried oysters (AMAZING!!), lamb sausage, mussels (kinda too salty), green lentil puree, and veal sweetbreads (MMMM!!!!). My favorite item on their menu is actually only on their RW menu, which is the Ilili Burger. BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD!!! I've also had their lamb, SO JUICY! For dessert, I tried the traditional lebanese dessert, which is basicallyl a cheese dessert. It was ok. The lebanese beignet and the candy bar were SO DELICIOUS! Always a favorite restaurant.. I look forward to coming back here again!
