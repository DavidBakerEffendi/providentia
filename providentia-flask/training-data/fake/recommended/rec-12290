It is unfortunate that I chose to come here on a really cold night, hungry and as my first food choice in New York. After walking for blocks from my hotel on canal, I decided to come here because I had bookmarked it and it was "walking distance" from my hotel. Well, it wasn't as close as I thought, we were pretty tired and hungry, and this hole in the wall (literally a hole in the wall) "restaurant" if you can even call it that, is hidden in an obscure alley in Chinatown. The place was so small and cramped, we couldn't even go inside, and it was freezing outside, so i decided to order to go. It seemed that the cashier wanted to hurry things up and I felt pressured to order and hurry along since the space was so limited. So I ordered the popular items, and I watched as they bathed my meal in grease, and packaged it all up in a matter of seconds, except for the wait for my vegetable dumplings which apparently are uncommon and took more time to prepare. So I was so hungry I ended up eating my meal outside as I walked to my hotel because I didn't want it to get cold. Yes, the food is pretty cheap, but in this case I'd rather have quality over quantity. Too greasy, too fast and the restaurant space/environment is terrible. I'm only giving this place 3 stars because I was so hungry and it was so cold, that it was somewhat of a relief to eat something hot, even if I felt like crap afterwards for eating so quickly. Bottom line, it is not worth the effort to come here, as "authentic" as they claim to be, doesn't necessarily make them the best tasting.
