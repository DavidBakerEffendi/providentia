Being a vegetarian, I had never really tried Caribbean food because I didn't think there was anything I could eat. Well, I was wrong... I'm so glad I found this place! I had the vegetable Roti wrap for lunch, which was amazing... Well I should say I had half the wrap. It was huge! The vegetables inside were so good... all very soft and flavorful. I called for pick up and the food was ready immediately when I got there about five minutes later. I definitely want to go back and try some of their other vegetarian options!
