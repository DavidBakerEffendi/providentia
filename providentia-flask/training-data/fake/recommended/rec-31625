Nothing about this place is like a diner. The inside is beautifully decorated and clean. The problem is that you can't go there hungry. I waited ten minutes to get seated and probably about another 40 for my food. How breakfast and lunch takes 40 minutes to cook, I have no idea. I also don't think they use regular eggs, it tasted like egg beaters. I've gotten Â paninis that were very tasty but not good enough to wait 40 minutes for. I will most likely never go back there. Very disappointing
