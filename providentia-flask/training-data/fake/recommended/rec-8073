After living on the West Coast for several years, I worried that I would never again test the delectable taste of fresh, delicious guacamole.  I was so happy to find what I dubbed "California-style" Mexican.  Yes, it is pricey for Mexican food, but where else can you find guacamole that is even good in winter in Philly? Great Mahi-Mahi Tacos.  The Mexican Chopped salad is great.  It is light and refreshing (do add the chicken).  I think it tastes best with just fresh squeezed lime juice. Margaritas are good (but a lot of places have good margaritas).  Don't order more than a guac and app to share with the group and one entree.  It seems likes it's not a lot of food, but it's easy to overorder. Always a wait, so make reservations at least a week in advance for a group larger than 4.  They usually say two hour waits on Saturday and Friday nights, but it usually is shorter and most restaurants on 13th Street have waits.  Like most of Stephen Starr restaurants half the restaurant is reserved and the other half is for walk-ins.   Do get the big booth seats.  They seem to be reserved for groups 5 and up.   El Vez is one of my go-to restaurants for out of town guests.   And if you can't stand the wait or the take-out!! Do a picnic or just bring it back to your hotel, apt, house.  You won't be disappointed!
