Not only my favorite Pizza in NYC, or the United States...but my favorite pizza on earth! Pizza is my favorite food by far, I take it pretty seriously :) and Paul's pies are works of art. I love the Hellboy and the Delboy, the porkypineapple and the hometown brisket. Really all of them. The perfect flame kissed pillowy crust and just a thin enough bottom without loosing it's integrity. Fresh, seasonal and mostly local toppings. There's a really great organic food store a block away called The Garden which I remember they get a lot of their ingredients from. Paul "Paulie Gee" is the quintessential host, there pretty much every single night saying hello and thank you to every patron who comes in. He has such a passion for the craft, which he found later in life. When we were there last, he came over and picked up on a conversation we had shared last and brought us over some cold sweet butter which he thinks goes great with any leftover crust (none on my plate). He also recommended the two other Pizza places which come in 2nd and 3rd on my top 5 list, Pizza Loves Emily and Prince St. Pizza. You're in for a treat!
