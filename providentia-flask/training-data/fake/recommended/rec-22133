So many high and low points. LOW: The back garden is beautiful, but beware: they not only permit smoking, they more or less encourage it with "Smoking Permitted" signs dotting the entire patio. What?? Why are we regressing to 1980? Moreover, because of the (albeit pretty) water features installed in the back, space is limited. So expect to sit inches away from your neighbor and for all the second hand smoke to ruin your time. HUGE bummer. HIGH: The food was great and cheap. The cheeseburhers were done perfectly, though they could stand for some real lettuce in place of the limp, single, leaf of iceburg. Â Fries were great and worth the extra $3. LOW: The bartender was pretty lame. Had no sense of order while helping anyone who happened to be in front of his face before those who had clearly been waiting longer. (mind you we were there at an extremely slow time- would hate to imagine what he's like when it gets busy) He also added two drinks to our bill that we had not ordered. When we pointed it out he simply said, "Oh, you didn't order those?" No apologies, just a silent transaction when we told him to take it off the bill. Um... sorry? HIGH: The server who brought out the food was super friendly and helpful. All in all, I probably wont be back. I can find a decent burger and beer list elswhere without subjecting my lungs to 2nd-hand smoke. Oh, and I may even get a smile out of another bartender.
