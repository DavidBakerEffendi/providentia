My boyfriend and I were in Philly this past weekend running the marathon. It hadn't occurred to us that we might need a reservation for just about any restaurant in the city. After getting turned away or being told there would be an incredible wait time we stumbled upon Little Fish. They were very very busy, but still managed to make room for us. Our waitress was so sweet, knowledgeable and just overall great at her job. We had told her that we would be running the next day, so she kept a constant flow of bread and water at our table. I had ordered a dish that had spaghetti, scallops and truffle. It was amazing! My boyfriend had ordered the tuna- he said it was probably the best fish he'd ever had. The service was excellent, as was the food. We'll definitely be coming back the next time we're in Philly!
