Something happened to this place. The chef must have left. Food is no where close to what it used to be. Papaya salad is neither crisp nor fresh. The rich flavors I was used to haven't been there the last 3 times I've gone. Even the different groups of friends I went with each time made the same comments. Still great vibe and prices, but the quality of the food is just not there anymore. Disappointing. Looks like I'll be going to Pure Thai a few blocks away. Or to Thai Market on 107th street.
