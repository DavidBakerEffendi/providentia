More like 4.5 stars. The food is wonderful.  American comfort food done well - you will gain 5 pounds but it will be worth it. We had: Mac and Cheese with Bacon Meatloaf Sandwich Brussels Sprouts Kale Salad Chocolate Bread Pudding Really everything was delicious.  I can't say I really liked the bread pudding, but I don't like bread pudding in general.  Portions are huge there - not the typical small plates kind of place.  You will leave FULL. Service was pretty good in the restaurant (bar service was kind of lame). Easy location right near the subway station. Will likely return for brunch the next time I'm in BK.
