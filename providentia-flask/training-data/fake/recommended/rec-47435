I went here this past weekend on a trip back to NYC. I always love finding new places in the hidden streets of the west village. There is no better neighborhood for a weekend brunch in my opinion. Extra virgin was a cute little place on West 4th, with an airy, wooden interior - perfect for a summer day. I was hung over from the night before so was looking for an egg dish - a good hang over cure. I settled on the eggs benedict with smoked salmon - yum yum! It hit the spot without being too much food. I would say ambiance and food were worth 4, but I thought our waitress was a bit rude, so I have to take it down to 3.5.
