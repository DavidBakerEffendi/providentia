Went to Tinto for a Birthday celebration with a fairly large group, which can be challenging for a tapas style restaurant.  The bar is very narrow and there is constant traffic as food is served when ready, which makes for mingling in the bar while waiting for our table was difficult at best. Many parts of dinner were delicious.  The highlights: Please have the duck!!!  Delish! We had to order a 2nd this was  such a great flavor combination and perfectly assembled.  Duck was juicy and simply delightful.  A must have.  And cheese: boucheron and petit basque....very flavorful and left me wanting more. I would recommend to steer clear of the tuna tartare.  This was a MAJOR disappointment.  Why would you destroy such a lovey flavor with a gherkin pickle and an over baked tasteless croissant. Epic failure in my opinion. Overall, a fine experience.  Expensive for what they are offering.  And that includes the beverages.  Sangria was far great.  Only truly wowed by the duck.  I would go back to have that and that alone.
