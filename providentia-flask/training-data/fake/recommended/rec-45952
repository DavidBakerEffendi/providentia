Ok...  First time we went it was a 45 min wait.  We didn't stay.  Second time, 12:30 Sunday, we were seated immediately, but after we sat, my boyfriend was asked to remove his hat.  For sunday brunch?  Fine...  Drinks - I ordered a standard bloody Mary.  Holy salt.  First time in my life I returned a beverage.  You'd think any place open on Sunday would have that recipe down pat.  The menu - not too many choices, so we settled on "the Rockefeller" their famous spinach artichoke dip.  Creamed spinach + cheese = dip here and isn't nearly as good as the frozen kind.  I chose a fish sandwich for an entree - generic and greasy. And that includes the shoestring fries that accompanied the sandwich. Again, wayyyyyyy to salty and not special at all.  Another irritation - having the little spills that occur while eating, cleaned, while I'm eating.  Not too cool in my opinion, but that could just be me.  The two stars are for being sat down immediately and that it quelled my starving tummy.
