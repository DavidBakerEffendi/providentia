gotta agree with a lot of the folks on here: this place just makes me uncomfortable.  all the anti-immigration, pro-philly police propaganda was unnerving.   the food's terrible as well.  the steaks are sloppy and undercooked and the roast pork is pretty much flavorless.   you could certainly do worse than this place but i would never recommend it.
