Just had my first experience here. It was the end of a brunch day and the restaurant was less than half full. I love the space and vibe. But the service was unnecessarily slow. I feel as if the manager was our server, because we never had another person help us, except for the food runner. The manager seemed a little confused and unsure of what he was doing. Perhaps it was because he was also eating at the bar. The coffee and mimosa took well over ten minutes to arrive. And I know the manager was able to make a quicker mimosa because I saw him pour himself one and then drink it all before we got our drinks. It was just a little odd. However, the food was incredible. The steak and eggs were so flavorful and served in a really unique way (black bean omelet!?). While I typically love a runny egg with my "steak and eggs", this version worked perfectly. A spicy salsa and well-prepared potatoes finished the dish. I ate it all! I can't wait to come back for dinner and try more of the menu. The service could have been much better, though. And as a final little kink in my experience, they ONLY take American Express. How bizarre is that? I understand a place taking any card except AmEx, but the opposite is just... Weird.
