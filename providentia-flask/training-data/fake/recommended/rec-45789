Amazing fish. Definitely worth the price. BYOB :) We ordered the Crab & Guacamole Martini to share and for dinner, I had the Gulf of Mexico Yellowfin Tuna. Possibly the best ever. My tuna was seared so it was raw in the middle and just the way I like it. Tip: they are extremely busy and there were many groups waiting for a table. I would say definitely make a reservation and do it early! We tried to make it on the day of (Friday evening) and it was booked completely until 9pm.
