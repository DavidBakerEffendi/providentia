We stopped tonight on the way home from a weekend in NYC to see if Seoul had opened yet. And they have.  And I will be back again - a lot!  I have been to Korea about a dozen times on business travel and developed an obsession with Korean food.   After a long, cold day we enjoyed our first meal at Seoul.  I'm always cautious on my first visit to a Korean restaurant - I have a strategy for assessing how much I will like the place, before committing to a huge banquet.  So, we started with the Mandu - just awesome, crispy outside and moist inside.  Pretty sure these were deep fried and not pan fried. The ban chan were incredibly fresh tasting.  The kimchee (regular, ban chan, and pickles) was the freshest I can recall eating anywhere outside of Seoul city.   And we were served the small dried fish, which we love. The real test of a Korean restaurant for me is how they do with their Kimchee Chigae and Soon DuBu Chigae.   So, we got one of each.  Hot, tasty, spiced perfectly and thickly packed with veggies, tofu, and flavor.  Perfect comfort food for a cold New England evening. Can't wait to go back and work through the other menu staples, like kalbi jjim, jingo hokum, kimchee djbu hokum, huedubap, and dolsot bibimbap.  Then, I'll try the BBQ - the true test for me will be whether they serve it with sesame leaves!
