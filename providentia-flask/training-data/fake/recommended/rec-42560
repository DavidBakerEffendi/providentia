This place was a great find!! My husband and I are vegetarian and we were staying in the theater district, looking for a great place that had awesome food(with lots of flavor/spice), as well as decent atmosphere that was reasonably priced. Most of the midtown restaurants we've found are overrated, touristy, and just not worth the money. This place however, had us leave with a big smile on our face! 9th ave is definitely the place to go if you're looking for good food in an area, otherwise surrounded by chains and overpriced, bland food. We walked in, without reservations on a Monday night and were seated immediately(though the place was packed!). There is a beautiful chandelier in a glass case in the middle of the restaurant(see the pictures), which definitely made the atmosphere very date night appropriate. We ordered the corn spring rolls to split as an appetizer, which were good, but we had to ask for more of the plum sauce(there was barely half a teaspoon of sauce, when it was initially served). I had the lychee martini, I believe, which was packed with fruit flavor and also chili flakes! The salt rimmed glass definitely enhanced the drink. Â My husband ordered the spicy thai basil with imitation duck, which was very flavorful and decent sized portion. I had the red curry with imitation duck and was really enjoying all the veggies and spices! Both entrees came with a side of rice, which was nice. Also, the bathrooms were immaculate( at least for the ladies). There was mood lighting and I believe a bird like water fixture! The service was also great even though they were very busy. We will be returning to room service, and I'm glad we found such a nice Thai restaurant in the city!
