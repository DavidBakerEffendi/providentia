I normally never go to this area for dinner but my aunt was visiting and staying next door to this restaurant. Very nice atmosphere. Â Live music was very nice. We ordered the tuna tartare which was very fresh and delicious and my aunt ordered the fried calamari which I thought was just ok...a little spicy which I like but I didn't think it was anything special. We all ordered the salmon dish which was also very fresh and delicious. If I'm ever in this area I would go back. The waitresses were very nice and attentive.
