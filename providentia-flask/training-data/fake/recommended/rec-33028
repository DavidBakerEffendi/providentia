Their food was OK. For the price it was decent. However, for a self proclaimed Greek restaurant, Â the food was a little safe and bland. Spices are absent and made for the non Greek eating customer. The service was very proactive to the point where we thought they wanted us to finish quickly and leave, but there was no line of people waiting. I would probably go back for a simple wrap or cheap salad, but with low expectations. To put it in perspective, my lady friend just told me that if I bring her here again, she will not go. But I would go with the boys. This could be a five if the food was more ambitious and closer to their Greek roots. It's like a kids menu for Greek food. (And I usually don't give poor reviews)
