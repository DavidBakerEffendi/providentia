Spanish tapas at its best! The place is small & kind of smokey (if you're sitting towards the back), but once the plates start arriving, you get whisked away in tapas-land and forget about all the other stuff! The tapas here are spectacular.  Having traveled various regions in Spain last year, I sampled an enormous variety tapas dishes ranging from the usual patatas bravas to more eclectic ones like squid in ink.  Having since been back, I have not found a tapas place of equal or close to equal calibre until I stepped into Tia Pol yesterday!   My dear friend and I sampled plenty of dishes including the following: Gildas of anchovies, pickled peppers, & onion: A small but tasty bite with crunch Salad with fried artichoke and white asparagus- Simply delicious! Blistered green peppers- Good addition to our meal but some peppers were super spicy Squid in Ink: One of my favorite tapas to order.  It was good but kind of bland.   Embutidos Ibericos:  A good sized plate of 3 different and savory meats accompanied by a baguette with yummy tomato puree! Our favorites for the night were: Chicken liver mousse: AMAZING!  I don't really eat liver, but made the exception for this.  It was soo smooth but rich in flavor!  Definitely try it! The other was a special which had pureed eggplant, roasted pepper, with an anchovie on top! YUM! Oh and do save room for dessert. The Leche Frita for dessert cannot be missed!   I heart Tia Pol.  Thanks for bringing authentic Spanish tapas close to home!
