Are you looking for a place that has almost every single topping available for your hot dog?!? Don't look any further because this place has it all! Even things you would never have thought of putting onto a hot dog is done. Decided to come to South Street because my husband wanted to check out some tattoo shops. I decided to yelp "fries" and Hot Diggity was one of the places that popped up. So, in we go. Soooo overwhelming. I had no idea what to order. Like I said earlier, they have tons of toppings. You could make your own, or order from a set menu they have. I went with the Cinncinnati. It was a 3 cheese sauce with beef chili and onions and scallions. It was great! The sauce and chili was so flavorful. I normally do not get full off of one hotdog, but they stuff these things to the max that I was overly stuffed 3/4 of the way through. I also ordered fries (cause that's what I was currently craving) with a cilantro lime mayo. Loved the sauce! I don't know how to describe the sauce, so you just have to get it. My husband ordered he surf n turf dog. It was fried fish with a hot dog and topped with veggies. I too really enjoyed this. For my son, I ordered just a plain dog. I don't really recommend it though. The dog is very very thin compared to the bread. You definately need toppings with the type of bread that is used. I mean, it's great for children, but an adult might be pretty dissappointed. Decor...so cool! I liked all the animation of the hot dogs on th walls. Way creative on how to promote the menu!
