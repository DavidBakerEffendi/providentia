Awesome place. Kind of tough to find and in a rando locale - but you kind of forget about that because everything else is great. Awesome views of the River....Ambiance and service were stellar. The food was unreal.- very fresh and seasonal. My gfs and I shared the mushroom consomme (amaze), swiss chard ravioli (very lemony but delish) and the scallops. The scallops were excellent and a unique combination of flavors and ingredients - butternut squash, pear and hen of the woods. They came together unexpectedly well. For dessert we got the Molasses Pound Cake...OMG - I can still taste the strong molasses flavor - SO GOOD! This spot is great and totally worth the hike.
