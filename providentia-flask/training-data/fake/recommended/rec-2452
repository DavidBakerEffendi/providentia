There are better steaks in Philly and even in South Jersey.  If you want to experience the Pat's vs. Geno's war, though, please go to Pat's.  By all means, if you are not a local get one from each and compare and hopefully like Pat's better.  To each his own, though, and this is just my opinion.  A friend of mine from Cali did the taste test and was a fan of Pat's.  I tried his Geno's steak and my vote was for Pat's as well.
