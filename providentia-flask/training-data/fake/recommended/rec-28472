my friends and i were in the area for a party, but we wanted to grab a bite to eat first.  we were on the corner of union and frost, on a cold and rainy night, trying to decide which direction to turn in our search for food (none of us were familiar with the area), when a random dude walking down the street asked us what we were looking for.  when we told him we wanted to eat, he pointed across the street, said "you can get good food right there at jimmy's," and continued walking.  with such a vote of confidence, we walked in and found southern food heaven in williamsburg! we shared fried pickles and tater tots for the table, the pickles were delicious and the tater tots were more like hush puppies, but still yummy.  i had grits and eggs for my entree, the eggs were a little too salty and topped with way too much cheese, but the grits were perfectly creamy and buttery.  service was friendly and helpful.  surprisingly good beer selection for such a small place, too.
