Went to Fat Buddha after looking up stuff on yelp and have to say it did not disappoint. Happy hour prices very reasonable for drinks. Decent sized well drinks and a very tasty and unique Lychee cocktail. I really liked that they cut both beers and well drinks in half during happy hour. Food also made me happy. The pork buns were the best thing on the menu that we tried (had friends and tried almost everything on menu). The only problem was they were very small. $10 for only 3 little buns, should have been at least 4 for that price. Other then that flank stake was good, duck was good, and chicken was good. So overall everyone in my group was very happy with the meal and drinks and the overall experience. The one thing that would have made this place a 5 is if they had a few items of food on a happy hour menu. I think I'd go again next time I go to New York.
