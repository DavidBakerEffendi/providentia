Pros:  The food is actually very good Cons:  Someone who doesn't drink wine or any alcohol for that matter must have picked the wines on that list... I don't see how it could be any other way.  We ordered a bottle of white and I swear it tasted like someone poured out half the bottle and refilled it with Milwaukee's Best or Natty Lite.  Also, the service was not very good or pleasant, which is very strange considering you can't possibly fit more than 15 people in the entire restaurant.
