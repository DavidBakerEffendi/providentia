This place is exactly like it's brother/sister Littleneck: Great on ambiance and vibe, but awful in service and mediocre in content. Saturday night no wait. We never got the amuse-bouche everyone else seemed to be having. The bread was nice and warm --the best thing of the night, unfortunately. I made several attempts to see if the chef would serve the wagyu or the pork well done since I'm pregnant, however he refused since he "liked to present it his way" according to the waitress. Listen, I'm a foodie, I know you eat wagyu medium rare, the tuna seared, etc, but would be too much to ask if he could as a favor leave it in the pan for just a bit longer? It' s not like one single dish will spoil his "work of art". Anyway, ordered the Green salad which was incredibly spicy, inedible for me. The Garganelli were hand made (at least) but AFTER we ordered they come back saying they had run out of mussels and were replacing it with some other seafood. Not only did it not have mussels, but they didn't add any other seafood and served it anyway. Hum. The wine for my husband never came and it was charged regardless. No apologies from waitstaff. The truth, it's the same problem they have with Littleneck, which really has little to offer other than the vibe (meaning decor and music, mainly). Although I am a huge supporter of the Brooklyn food scene -especially in Gowanus since I live so close by- I don't think this place is or will be all it promised.
