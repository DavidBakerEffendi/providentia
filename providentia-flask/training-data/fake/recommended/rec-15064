Went one late afternoon to check this place out. With a name like Wishing Well, how could you go wrong? It was a Saturday and wasn't crowded at all. We ordered the arugala salad. The first I've ever had. It may be the last. But I know it will be the best. So good. I probably would come back just for it. Beer selection was good. Dogfish, etc. Shit, i can't remember what else we had, but it was a while ago. I wouldn't call this place a gastro pub. It seems more like a restaurant that is a bar.
