I was really excited to try out Tommy DiNic's at the Reading Terminal Market from all the rave reviews and the fact that they were featured on TV shows for best eats in Philly.  The place has a rich history, with the Nicolosi's fame on sandwiches with roasted pork/beef; eventually, it came down to two cousins splitting up shop, where Tommy, one of the cousins, opened up at the Market back in '80.  They offer roast pork, roast beef, Italian sausage, homemade meatballs, pulled pork, beef brisket, as well as toppings (sharp provolone, broccoli rabe, sauteed spinach, and roasted peppers).  The line for this place literally wrapped throughout the whole Market, a good sign!  My husband and I finally found a spot at the counter to order - we shared their famous Roast Pork sandwich with the provolone and the broccoli rabe.  The meat was very juicy, but it was just overly wet and unflavorful.  I wasn't really much of a fan of either the pork nor the broccoli rabe, as they were just quite bland.  Also, since there was no excess 'juice' shaken off, the bread itself was soaked to the core, no matter how fast you can shove it in your mouth!  I did like the provolone, but even the cheese didn't really help the flavors.  It was disappointing as the big twined-rump roast of pork looked really delicious, with all the carving action going on.  I'm glad I was able to check this place out, but not sure if I'd go back!
