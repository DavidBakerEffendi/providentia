This is my favorite new haunt! The atmosphere, the food, the service and of course the wine, is excellent and will not disappoint! I met a couple of friends at this cozy bar for drinks and gossip! We had a fabulous time. Easily accessible from either the 1/2/3/B/C lines at 72nd St., Riposo 72 is quietly tucked away between Central Park West and Amsterdam.  The selection of wines and other cocktails are generous and the food is delicious. My friends and I had the grilled flatbread with goat cheese,  carmelized onions and wild mushrooms, steamed mussels in a tomato and wine broth and pears and Brie served on warm walnut bread. So delicious. The Pinot Noir was our choice of wine; so smooth and complimented our food really well. I was in heaven. Whether you are with a group of friends or on a romantic date, Riposo 72 is the perfect place to relax with a glass or two and take in life on the UWS.
