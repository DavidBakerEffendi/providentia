i usually can count on one hand how many times I eat meatballs a year - most of the time during rare or random occasions. BUT after hearing about this place i had to check it out! it was random actually since me and my friends were couple blocks down at a bar and got hungry so we all decided to hop over -- of course wait was 2 hours long on a Saturday night! BUT that didn't stop us Asians from eating here so we decided to stalk people at the bar until they leave and YES our wait was down to 15 mins. As soon as we got our seats, we started enjoying the old skool hip hop music playing - BIG plus for me!! and made me love this place even more! Its a cozy place and very packed and loud but that's the fun of waiting to eat all the meatballs you can imagine. We got some sangria and then started ordering the balls and sides they have to offer. We got so many kinds but my favorite was the spicy pork slider and the original meatball. Got to taste everyone's balls and singing to 'Regulate' was priceless! I'll definitely come back here if i have enough patience I will wait for a table!! This place opens late so would be a fun thing to do btw bar hops! Great excuse to fill up your tummy with some good carbs :)
