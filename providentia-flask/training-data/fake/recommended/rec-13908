I knew this place would be great because there was a huge crowd outside the place. Fortunately I was there by myself so I skipped the 2-hour wait time. I ordered the cheese grits and the banana walnut pancakes. The cheese grits were okay, but the pancakes were delicious. There was an overload of bananas and walnuts inside and out and the syrup was divine. I also had a cup of hot chocolate with home-made whip cream, which was amazing! My only complain is the price. The pancakes alone were $14!, the hot chocolate $4 and the cheese grits $5. I mean they're just pancakes and I am a poor college student...I guess I will only go on a very very special occasion, such as Valentine's Day! Note: yes I went out to eat all by myself on Valentine's Day and it was awesome!
