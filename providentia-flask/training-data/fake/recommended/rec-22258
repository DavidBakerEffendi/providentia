Pepe's is worthy of a last request on earth. The best pizza I've ever had and I defy any New York pizza apologist to prove me wrong. Easily my favorite of the "big three" in New Haven, with Sally's an admirable number two. Every topping is incredible. The dough and crust have the perfect texture and flavor, and the sauce perfect and appropriately portioned. Â  The long lines move very quickly, as the wait staff is on point and the oven is large enough to handle the massive demand. In the last five years, I don't think I've waited more than 35 minutes to get in and I rarely wait more than 15. The "long wait" excuse is just a cop-out for those who aren't particularly interested in quality. Pepe's has earned every ounce of its legend, and despite the trendy Modern/Bar-is-better rhetoric, Pepe's rules all.
