WOW~~~!!! GREAT~!!! I have been to so many different style of Japanese restaurant, but never this kind. What a wonderful experience! Everything we ordered were great~!! The salmon and salmon roe rice was unbelievable~!! It was so good and I couldn't not to think about it the next couple days. All their food captured the beauty of Japanese culture. They kept the food's natural favor and let you truly enjoy the taste of food,not the taste of cooking. I loved it so much. It is kind of expensive, but worth every penny~!
