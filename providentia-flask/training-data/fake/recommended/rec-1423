This place has a great "chat with your friends" ambiance and tasty bar bites. The Bavarian warm pretzel with mustard ... the best in Philly! While they have a good beer selection they (hashtag) FAIL on the temperature of their drafts! The beer is not cold enough and it's served in warm beer glasses which, to me, is a criminal act.
