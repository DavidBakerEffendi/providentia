My one and only cheesesteak when I visited Philly.  Everything I imagined?  Yes.  I opted for the meat, onions, provolone (not sure how I feel about cheese wiz), ketchup, salt and pepper (as recommended by the guy behind the counter). The sandwich is definitely big enough to share, and it's a carnivore's dream.  Good amount of onions, cheese, meat, and the ketchup was nice to subtly cut through the rich flavors. The place is pretty limited in space to sit/stand to eat, but they have a huge window to order to-go.  The guys behind the counter working the kitchen were great and super friendly!
