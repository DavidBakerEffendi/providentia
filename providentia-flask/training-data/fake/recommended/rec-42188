I've always had a theory that you can predict the quality of a meal to come by the free bread they serve beforehand. I've never been wrong, and Bouley just makes my case stronger. The selection of breads and butters presented before and throughout the meal are so good I could have left satisfied even if I hadn't tasted the actual courses. But I'm glad I did. The flavor of each course is an exquisite journey into a new land unlike any I'd ever visited. And just as I started to come down from the high and settle into a sense of normalcy, the course would be finished and they'd be topping up my wine and preparing me for the next. Special attention seems to have been paid to the texture, density and crispiness of every ingredient. I'm still not sure exactly what the amuse-bouche was, but I will never forget the implosion of airy buttery awesomeness that came from that single bite. Service did not disappoint either. I live in a 1-bedroom Brooklyn apartment, but during this meal I was treated like the king of a relatively large country. Overall, one of the best dining experiences of my life. And did I mention I went there for the lunch? Possibly the best value for money fine dining in the city.
