Holy Ramen noodles on steroids I say! Every culture has their own version of who is better, or what is better. My way or their way, it almost like a "Who makes the better cheesesteak" battle. The battle or challange would be Ramen against Pho, who would win. I love theses challanges, it is like a scene from "West Side Story" , the Jets vs the Sharks, but its with food! I believe another yelper debated this, but its is a challange everyone should atleast try. Terakawa Ramen , pretty much set the bench mark on what Ramen should taste like. Oh Boy this  is a great way to start any type of challanges I say. My Ramen of choice was called the  "Mayu Ramen" which was pretty interesting and intense.  I chose egg noodles, instead of the rice noodles for this masterpiece . My bowl of perfection I feel is probably the best one , but I could be wrong was simply amazing. The Mayu Ramen dish is a pork bone soup, so already I know this is gonna be good. The soup also has dark roasted leek with crushed garlic oil with also a mayu oil,  throw in some bamboo shoots, roast pork , chopped scallions (extra scallions), red ginger, kikurage mushroom and a seasoned boiled egg.  That is what I call ,the bowl of champions. If you add some Sriracha along with some other toppings provided to you, you just kicked up another knotch. A delicious,fulfilling bowl of happiness waiting to be slurped up, basically it's your happy ending . The service our waitress was on point, making sure we had everything we needed. So the battle will continue between the cultures, because I will continue to enjoy going to both.  So go in and try for yourself, you will not be dissappointed.
