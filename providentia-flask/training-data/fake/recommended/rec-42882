I'm flat out embarrassed to admit how many times I've rolled in here and ordered the cobb salad. SO GOOD. Not too much (if any) dressing. Not too big. Finely chopped. Lots of chicken and avocado. A lovely place for a casual local dinner, solo or with a friend or 2. Also excellent for boozy brunch. The menu and venue are small but mighty-big local fan here!
