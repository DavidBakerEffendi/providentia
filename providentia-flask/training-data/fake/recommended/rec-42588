Move into the jersey are 2 years ago from NYC.   I was immediately disappointed in the quality of the pizza I was trying.  Every spot was absolutely horrible.. (please keep in mind I'm from NYC so kinda a hard act to follow) I walked into pompei with my wife and we ordered a pie.  The young man at the counter was great, always smiling and offered us a seat while the food was ready.  Needless to say, this has become a main stay for us.  As good as it gets in Bayonne.  If you were like my wife and myself and you are withdrawing from a slice of fantastic pizza.... this is the place for you.
