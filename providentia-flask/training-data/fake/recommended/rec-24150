If there's one thing I love it's hot dogs.  Well, and bacon.  Okay and french fries.  Anyways, you can get all of these here so it works out well.  My husband actually claims the fries are his favorite in philly.  Let's be real, I love most french fries, but these are definitely up there.  It's always hard to decide between the standard menu dogs and the hot dog of the month.  I can say that I've never been disappointed in my choice though.  I think my favorite is the Seattle Grunge.  The dipping sauces are tasty and fun to try, and I love the art work inside (shout out to the Dirty O in Pittsburgh!)  Also, can't beat BYO and hot dogs.  Definitely a favorite spot in our casual dinner repertoire.
