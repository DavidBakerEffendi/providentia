Kimchi. Stone Pot Bibimbap. OMG. Love it here. Got sushi here once which was awesome. Steamed mussels, also awesome. Bibimbap sooo good I also cried with joy. Brought home leftovers and ate them cold for breakfast and they were just as delicious if not more delicious than the previous night. Do it.
