Came here for an early dinner on a Sunday with 6 people and had no problems getting seated.  Their guacamole is good, and they actually listen to you when you say you like it medium / spicy.  They had a great selection of margaritas too.  I ordered the enchiladas suizas and sweet plaintains, it was so filling!  I'll definitely be back!!
