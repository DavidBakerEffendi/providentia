Wow. You get a refill on green tea and you pay per each cup. That's like asking for a refill on your water.  0 stars for that one, 3 stars average.  They don't even tell you there's a charge for that.  Never have I experienced any charge at a sushi place for that one... Overall the fish was tender, but kind of mild tasting.  Not chewy so that's good and I'm a straight up chirashi bowl eater. The flavor was sort of lacking, price was high, service was good, but nothing too exciting to come back for.   The king crab eel roll was tasty but the eel was really flavorless... Again about the mild tasting fish. Right amount of spiciness though. Most of all, that green tea charge really caught me off guard.  There are TVs here for any sports fans.  Atmospheres nice at night but in the day likely not the most refinished setting. Some seating outside. A lot of guests with BYO wine (not sure what the charge is).  They do provide nice wine glasses though.
