Alla Spina has one of the coolest environments I've experienced at a restaurant in the Fairmount/Spring Garden area. I've always passed by while running and finally got around to having a meal there. We originally sat outside which is a great spot right along Mount Vernon and Broad, until it started to rain. The staff was very attentive and seated us at another table indoors very promptly. The inside is visually appealing, especially the bar area which has a large ceramic pig hanging over top of it. There were a few TVs but that didn't take away from the original feel of the place. The menu was a bit confusing for me, just because I hadn't heard of most of the things on the menu before, then again I do not consider myself overly cultured when it comes to food so those of you that are may love it. The beer and wine menu is robust. Great selection. The service was above average. Our food came out extremely fast and it was delicious. The waitress checked in periodically but knew when we were mid-conversation and never interrupted. The only complaint I had is the beer we ordered was kicked. I didn't expect it to be kicked at 7:30pm. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place for a relaxed but classy dinner, perfect for a casual/fun date.
