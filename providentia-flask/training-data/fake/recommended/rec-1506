Never EVER again. Philly definitely needs a new claim to fame. Lol. These cheesesteaks were TERRIBLE. Dry, flavorless, super salty cheese, and cheap with their onions...could you spare a little, please??? If you're going to choose between Pat's and Geno's pick Geno's - although I don't think they offer anything impressive (the rolls are the best part!), I definitely think they're hands down better than Pat's. Seems like Pat's is nothing but hype, and the staff lacks the friendliness factor altogether.
