Had a great, fun evening at Bar Ciccio Sat. night. Love this small neighborhood osteria. Nothing fancy or pretentious, not the place to be seen, just a place to EAT! We shared the pollo terrine, the octopus on polenta, the delicious meatballs and the pork jowls (guanciale) with potatoes.  All appetizers were delicious. Drinks are interesting and they have a great, reasonable Italian wine list. I had the strische pasta w/ chiantigiana sauce, which was amazing.  A chianti wine sauce over strips of homemade melt in your mouth pasta w/ cooked red onions.  Loved it. The homemade paparadelle w/ lamb ragu, also outstanding, as was the special Lasagne al Forno with vegetables.   This is not a red sauce place, the menu favors Tuscany, the owner is from Bologna, so there will be no chicken parm or Vodka Rigatoni here (sorry fellow Jerseyans). Excellent desserts and service. Very reasonably priced. Glad we found this nice little place in Soho.  (I remember it as an antique store years back).
