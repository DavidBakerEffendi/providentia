Went for business lunch. Food good. Service a bit strange as when we came in we were seated right next to the only other party in the restaurant. We asked to move and there was no problem with it. Food took about 30 minutes to come out. Was originally told no french fries about 20 min after ordering but then they ended up coming out with the food and tasted good.
