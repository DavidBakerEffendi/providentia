I ordered the crab cake sandwich and my hubby ordered the fried oysters.  Both were cooked perfectly and tasted awesome.  The lunch portion is huge!  I bet the dinner portion is even bigger.  We also shared a bowl of the New England Clam Chowder and we weren't too impressed.  It tasted like it came from a can.  I guess after having the best clam chowder in Portland, ME, nothing else compares.
