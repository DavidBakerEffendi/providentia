Its a nice spot but they need better management. I went there for my first and last time this summer. It was overly crowded, I put my name on that stupid paper for a table of two. After waiting 30 minutes a couple that just walked in got a seat. Ok whatever no big deal right, so i got the managers attention and I explained the situation. I was told Â I had a seat, I followed the waiter and there was still no seat for us. After waiting another 30 mins while standing over people while they ate, we got a table in the old front entrance. I made a scene , I don't care. I didn't wait over an hour to sit at the door. It was clearly the front door, I had an exit sign over my head. I wished I didn't spend my money . There was nothing memorable about the food at all or the drinks.
