The corned beef sandwich is the SHIIIIIIET!  Also, while I was waiting for my food, the owner kept giving me samples of their best meats, macaroni salad and potatoes.  I was somewhat full by the time I got my order, but I still scarfed it all down in ten minutes because it was so perfectly moist and delicious and everything you can ever ask for in a sandwich.  Joey Tribbiani would give the thumbs up.
