We stayed in NYC for a few days before and after our trip to Rome last year because we were flying out of JFK. I am not a huge fan of crowds or dirty streets but I did see what could be seductive about NYC - the hundreds of people you meet in a day between cabbies, people you run into on the streets, and people you meet randomly in restaurants AND the food! I loved the food in this city every-time I've visited...but this place has been my most favorite place EVER! Each trip here has been worth the stop and go in a smelly cab with a somewhat interesting driver! The Hazelnut Waffles served with fruit have been my favorite!!! Please make it a point to eat here so that you can find yourself happily stuffed and smiling during your stay in NYC :o)
