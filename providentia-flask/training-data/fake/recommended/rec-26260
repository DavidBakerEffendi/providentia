Nice restaurant !  I came to this place for dinner with my family last week.  We chose this place among many others in  K town because we love Tofu dish and heard this restaurant  has a good reputation  for Tofu. We had vegetable, Kim chi and seafood Soondobu. I personally chose seafood one. The broth was rich and full of fresh seafood. Tofu was very fresh and tasted like real home made one. They were served with  various small side dishes of Ban Chan.  Kimchi was especially good and fermented proper. Fried Covinia  and the rest of seasoned vegetable were mostly good .I chose a moderate level  for spicy. However, Kim chi Soondobu with hot spicy selected by my sister  was really hot. We 'd better avoid it next time.   They served all Soondubu with rice cooked in individual stone pot.   The rice was was very different from the regular one in a bowl. The rice alone was worth coming.  It was crispy with fresh taste. The service was attentive .
