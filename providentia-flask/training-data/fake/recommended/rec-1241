I couldn't wait to try these burgers and I was not disappointed. I ordered a Shake Stack which is the combination of a Cheese burger and 'Shroom burger. This included the Shake sauce (which is delicious), a portabello mushroom, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. The flavors mixed so well together and it all tasted freshly made. The bread also tasted great. The staff was very friendly and accommodating which made the experience better. Cons: -The dine-in area is small and it was very crowded. So patrons had to wait for seats before they could sit down to eat. -The fries aren't the best. They were a little cold when served and weren't like the ones I've seen in pictures. Not very flavorful. -If you do not like medium burgers make sure to state how you would prefer your burger cooked. Overall it was a great place to dine-in for a good entree.
