I love this place.  It's comfort food at its finest.  They serve two salsas in the beginning and the one is made with roasted tomatoes and it is very unique. I've never had a flavor like it before. I enjoy chips & salsa as much as the next person but like to change it up. If they served a cabbage salsa like I'm used to then it'd be a double-salsa win! I enjoy starting with the ceviche. It's wonderfully done with beautiful seafood. I could probably just eat this on its own and skip everything else! The queso fundido with huitlacoche is also a treat. It's rare to find a place that serves the huitlacoche  - in fact I've only had it once before at Millennium in San Fransisco (another great place to eat!). My go-to meal is easily the Sabana Invierno de Pollo. It's simple fine at its finest. Chicken covered with beans and cheese. Yum. It reheats well too which is always a plus. The timbale of rice is a nice touch because you get a little bit without it overwhelming the plate. Molcajete De Pollo or Beef is also fantastic and served in the great lava pig bowl. Who can resist? Everything I've had here has been wonderful and it's on my list of "places I can be bribed with". Unrelated to the food, I do like the decor. It's fun and creative and yet very classy as well. The staff has always been incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. I've never had poor service there.
