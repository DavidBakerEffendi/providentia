This is a very cute neighborhood Italian restaurant - great for small groups or large parties up to 6 or so.  Call ahead for reservations. Very friendly staff - I was greeted by the chef on my way in.  My friend and I were seated immediately.  For my meal, I ordered the Cannelloni Rustica (housemade cannelloni; ground veal, pork and sirloin; in tomato and cream sauce) which comes with some greens on the side.  My friend ordered the Spaghetti Integrale con Vegetable (organic whole-wheat pasta, vegetables, garlic and oil).  Our main dishes were pretty tasty.  However, I was definitely wowed by my dessert!  I got the carmamelized apple tart with vanilla gelato.  DELICIOUSNESS!!!  Paired with a mug of coffee and I was a happy camper.  My friend got the coffee gelato, which was also tasty.   Reasonable prices and very good service.  I recommend coming here for a low key meal!
