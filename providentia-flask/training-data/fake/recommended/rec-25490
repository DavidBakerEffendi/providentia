Last Saturday, following an Angelique Kidjo concert, my friends and I were on the hunt for a place to grab dinner. In the pouring rain we walked from restaurant to restaurant looking for somewhere with good food and no (or minimal) wait. On our walk from Bar to Prime 16, we saw a bunch of Santa Clauses at Russian Lady; so when Prime 16 had a 45 minute wait, we decided to dine with 20+ Santas. It was a pretty low key dinner. Three of our group ordered the buffalo chicken quesadillas and a side of ranch, while two people ordered burgers. All in all, it was a good experience and an okay dinner. Verdict: The many Santas made the night!
