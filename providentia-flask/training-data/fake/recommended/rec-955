Go to this place hungry. If you're a vegetarian, find something else to do...because as far as you're concerned, this place is the Antichrist. I ate so much here, I woke up the next morning feeling like I was hungover. If this place was around in prehistoric times, you would surely find T-Rex and Megalodon here, with gobs of charred mammal flesh drooping down their chins. This place is good...damn good, I've never eaten at a steak house like it. And to be honest, the prices are surprisingly good. Check it out, and have fun!
