this place is AMAZING!!!  Definitely have to try the enchilada verde. its, amazing. a little kick to it but it isnt too spicy.  The fried chips and guac are super addicting as well, and we had to order it twice because the food was taking a little longer to get to us.. their drinks were really good as well, great selection of margaritas.  The coconut margarita was surprisingly amazing, i think it was better than the grapefruit one but the grapefruit was was amazing as well.  Cute ambiance, small small restaurant with asian reference and little asian plates.  it was a little odd that the servers were standing right next to you as you were eating since the place was so small but other than that no complaints! AMAZING! AMAZING!!! probably not great for parties bigger than 4 people. they have a middle bench area but that seems to be shared with randos.
