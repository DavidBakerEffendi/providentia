When you walk up to this place, you think "bar." When you walk though the place to your seat, you think "bar." When you look at the menu, you think "wait..." They are attempting some serious fare. And they pull it off. We had cheesesteak empanadas, beet salad, caesar salad, BLT, blue cheese stuffed burger and special flatbread of the day. Cheesesteak empanadas were oddly good. Beet salad was just okay. Caesar salad was outstanding. All entrees were really, really good. I cut my burger in half and the blue cheese oozed out like it was a supermodel writhing on a sofa (what?). My daughter thought the flat bread was awesome (high praise). Great downtown lunch spot that I would highly recommend.     Smiley face
