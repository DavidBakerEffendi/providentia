Waiting. Waiting for a table. Then waiting for the food, which was good but in my opinion not worth coming back and waiting in line for. We had the blueberry pancakes, which were fluffy and buttery. It came with a maple butter, which was tasty but was so heavy I stopped using it towards the end of my meal. My fiance had the Southern breakfast. The candied bacon was a great balance of salty and sweet, and I like my bacon super crisp... but parts of these were burnt. The fried tomatoes and grits were good as well, just a tad on the salty side. The coffee con leche was decent as well. It was a must try for me since I've heard from several people how good this place is. But the food just doesn't make it worth the wait, so I probably won't come here again.
