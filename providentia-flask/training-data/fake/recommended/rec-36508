Eataly is huge Italian market and 7 independent restaurants. Concept is interesting! but so crowed and disorganized everything! The lay out of the store is confusing. I had lunch at Il pesce(fish section), food was just mediocre nothing special, and overpriced. unfortunately my side dish came out after i finished my main dish. can you imagine? service was horrible.
