I Ordered the bimbimbap, which was bland, and boring. It had barely any beef. I wound up drenching it in soy sauce (which i got a look from our waitress on) The waitress was RUDE and extremely inattentive. She did not smile once. She was extremely busy.... playing on her phone. The place maybe had 3 taken tables. Perhaps if they hired better waitstaff that wouldnt be. I would never suggest this to a friend. poor service, bland food, and overall bad atmosphere.
