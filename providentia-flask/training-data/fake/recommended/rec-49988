We decided to go here after we had checked Totto Ramen ( a block away) out. First off, the decor here is very good. The lights, floor, and seats are very inviting. It has the feel of a Japanese restaurant. He waiters greet you with the Japanese version of "Welcome" and the place is buzzing with people coming in and out. As for the dining experience, it was good. We ordered the pork buns and also the restaurant specialty, Miso Ramen. The pork buns were good. they were a small portion but they were screaming with flavor. The Miso Ramen however was a disappoint in my book. The Ramen noodles run $14-18 here. For the price, you expect an amazing bowl of soup, noodles, and a generous portion of meat. Reality, the noodles were below average, the portion of meat was average at best, and the broth was actually quite good. The broth, I believe saved the noodles. I enjoyed the rich taste of the broth. The noodles were too thin for my liking. Thin noodles = easy to overcook. Soft and too chewy noodles. The pork meat seemed to be boiled. Tasted okay, but I prefer charred pork like at Totto Ramen. After our meal, I was still hungry. I needed a slice of pizza afterwards. I would rather go to Totto Ramen than here. Totto Ramen has better noodles, similar quality broth, and the prices are more reasonable. Only catch is you have to wait longer to sit down at Totto (much smaller place).
