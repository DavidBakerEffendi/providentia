Based on the reviews on Yelp, I stopped in for lunch before heading to an appointment in the neighborhood. I ordered the meatball soup, which was delicious. Although the place is as bar-bones as folks suggest, I felt like the soup and noodles were very fresh and simple. I was in and out in under a half-hour because of my appointment, which was a pity because I was enjoying watching the crowd and the television, which dominated the seating area.
