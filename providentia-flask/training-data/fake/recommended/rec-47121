Reading Market could single-handedly convince me to relocate to Philly. Every time I go--which is pretty much every time I visit Philly--I leave there blissed out and I always discover something new. I've eaten at Carmen's (no relation to Carmen's in Bellmawr, N.J., which is a shame because they have the best mixed cheese sub on the planet) which is only passable as far as hoagies go. Rick's Steaks, however, is the culinary equivalent to a mind-blowing one-night stand. You know what you want, you get it, you can't get enough during, and you leave feeling fully sated and definitely sure you'd do it again (even though you shouldn't). There is a Mexican food stall that makes killer nachos, and way in the back this time I discovered a bakery that makes the most delicious little cupcakes that blows away any I've found in D.C. or New York. I'll need to look up the name. They said they do mail order for brownies but not cupcakes--bummer--but make sure you stop by for one.
