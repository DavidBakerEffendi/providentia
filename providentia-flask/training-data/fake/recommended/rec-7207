Absolutely love the savory crepes ESPECIALLY the goat cheese, fig, rosemary and onion. Had the sweet crepes too but those aren't as special since its available at every other crepe place. Small place, great food so be prepare to wait unless you make reservations. Cute & Friendly staff who speaks French but not snobby (the female ones at least). Will def return and taste every one of the crepes.
