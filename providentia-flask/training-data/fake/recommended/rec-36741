its not what it used to be thats for sure ! By the way, Bouley has FAILED several healtn inspections ( with flying colors) in both his restaurant and the bakery.  CHECK WIKIPEDIA The prices are obscene as is the food.  I find this place to be insulting. David Bouley, a Connecticut native, not at all French, prepares the same crap night after night.  The desserts suck, especially those unmemorable petit fours and  overly saccharine souffles  which are nauseatingly sweet and that awful armagnac ice cream.  (its truly vile).  Shouldnt a place of this caliber hire a decent pastry chef?  One would think so !  The service is lame as well.  They will change your silverware 9000 times but will leave you without  utensils  as well and never change your napkin ,  not even once !    Food has a tendency to come out cold and you will never see a decent vegetable on your plate. The portions are nouvelle (miniscule). Doesnt this guy know nouvelle cuisine went out in the late 70's?   If you opt to spend tons of wasted money on just   bread , then this is the place for you.  i would rather find a decent boulangerie and get myself a good hot crusty baguette, a hunk of  good cheese and a healthy portion of fish and some wonderful wine and stay home. They try to fill you up with all this bread so that you dont realize that there really is no food! If you didnt have the bread you would truly starve  The portions are obscenely small and the prices are exorbitant.  This place truly became the place for tourists who believe everything they read in the Zagat guide or Michelin.  Dont.  Its all lies.  Trust me.
