It's a great place to go if you are nearby, but it's not so delicious that it deserves a trip out of your way  The already reasonable prices drop $1 per taco during happy hour.  2 tacos hit the spot for a ravenous 130 pound girl.  1 taco allowed my friend to make it from 4pm to an 8pm dinner .  This place would have deserve 3.5 stars, but remains comfortably at 3 because the restaurant advertises delivery, but upon request, the delivery biker was late for work, never called, and did not show up for 20 minutes.
