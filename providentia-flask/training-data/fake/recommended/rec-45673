I had a wonderful time here at Volcano. I visited on a weekday, so we were seated very quickly. That night we only ventured there to fill a sushi craving but the restaurant does offer hibachi as well if you are interested. It's not a large establishment however the service and food was definitely of a high standard. We started with an order of edamame that was on the house courtesy of Volcano. Then I ordered the special eel roll and the special dragon roll. Both were very delicious as well as the edamame. The staff was attentive and helpful too. To top it all off when we received our check there was a small discount applied as well. That was so thoughtful and nice of them!! I wouldn't have mind paying without it with the experience I had. When I return I must try the hibachi.
