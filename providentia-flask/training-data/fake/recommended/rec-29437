I've often stopped in here for coffee or a quick bite and been happy with the quality of both and the friendly folks behind the counter.  After having dinner there recently, however, I'm kicking myslef for not sampling the Ethiopian fare sooner.  It was outstanding.  I've since order to-go and eaten in - either way,  it's top-notch.
