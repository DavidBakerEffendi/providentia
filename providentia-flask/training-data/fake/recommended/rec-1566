Well I went to have a Cheese Steak Sub at the Infamous Geno's. It was OK. I'm not a fan of the Cheese Whiz on my sandwich but it was not bad but it was not something to write home about either. To me it was more the factor of " Yeah I'm"m eating a Cheese Steak in South Philly at Geno's"!!! I have had better Cheese Steak Subs in the Northeast that where bigger, cheaper, & fresher.
