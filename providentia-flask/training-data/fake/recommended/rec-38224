Went for a sunday brunch.  It was the BEST brunch I had in Philadelphia thus far.  Didn't hurt that they offer unlimited memosas, bellinis or champagne in their $35 fixed menu.  1st course is the standard soup/salad buffet.  The lobster bisque was yummy and they had a great antipasta dish.  Loved that you could choose between the breakfast or lunch/dinner menu for second course.  They won me over on their chocolate fountain for the 3rd course.  Only complaint was that our waiter wasn't very personable.
