A disturbingly awesome lil' Cafe. the menu is a respectable size and well varried for the standard coffee shop/cafe set. Which sets it well above a lot of the downtown competition. the portions are way larger than i would have expected, and additively tasty. The bookstore portion was of course a bit small, but given the square footage allocated to it, they manage to pack in a decent amount of worthwhile material without making it look like a packrat's fire sale. so massive bonus points to that.     Oh and The Black Bean MoFo'ing soup is easily worth taking a human life for.
