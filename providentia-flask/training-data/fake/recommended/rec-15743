I really love this place, and can remember how much I loved my first taste of their pizza - a two day old slice at a friend's house. Since then I've been back many times, and usually order a small margherita pizza with pepperoni (the small is 14"), which feeds 2-3. Delicious thin crust, squares of fresh mozzarella (too soft to shred), and a charcoal oven taste, I don't understand how people could compare Lombardi's to a random slice anywhere in town. Overrated? Depends on how you look at it. Let's all be honest, we all Â know each other (in the broadest sense of the term): the people quick to call 'overrated' are usually the ones who run from tourist areas on principle. Of course I'd love this place to be a well kept secret, but the tourists don't have any bearing on the taste of the food. Sorry it's not Brooklyn ;). The place is usually crowded, but it also often doesn't have much of a wait because of the size of the restaurant. Definitely would recommend Lombardi's to anyone who hasn't been there yet.
