Rizzuto's is fantastic. It's our primary restaurant for a night out that's not super fancy. The food is delicious, the service is friendly and prompt, and the prices are totally reasonable (especially for lunch). My husband and I particularly love the piccata dishes and the chop salad. Portions are large enough that we sometimes split an order of each, especially if we want one of their tasty desserts. This plan is derailed whenever their special ravioli or gnocchi show up on the menu, though, as I can no longer be persuaded to order anything else. The outdoor seating is also a great bonus. It faces green space, so you don't feel too crowded, but about half the tables have enough of a street view for evening people-watching.
