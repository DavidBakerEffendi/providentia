I've always been given two snippets of advice when coming here: 1) Drench it with all the white sauce you can get. 2) Go easy on the red sauce. If you get it to-go, they give you this little container of red sauce that is WAYYYYY hotter than what's in the communal bottles.  After a 45 minute cold ace wait, this round container of hot chicken, rice, lettuce, and pita was worth every penny of my $6.  I do admit that it needs a lot of white sauce.  Even if you think you have put a lot, it gets absorbed by all the rice and you'll find yourself needing more. You may think that with all the halal carts around, maybe people just want to wait in a line that's already long... which in turn just makes it longer... and draws more people.  But in this case, it's not a matter of monkey-see-monkey-do, it's JUST THAT GOOD!!!
