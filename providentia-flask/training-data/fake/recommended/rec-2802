Love this place, excellent food and a great atmosphere.  Definitely get the oysters here.  I would give it 5 stars except you can only eat here for dinner on weekend nights if you pay the cover fee for the bar & music.  Then again that may be for the best being it gets swamped then so it would be hard to enjoy a nice meal anyways.
