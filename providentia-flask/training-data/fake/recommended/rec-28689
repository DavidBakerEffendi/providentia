Went to Umami Burger for lunch today.  5 stars.  Bang.  Right there. Got there right around noon and there was no wait for a 2-top.  We sat down, ordered a nice cold beer, and perused the menu.  After the helpful waitress pointed out several options and explained how they make their burgers, we settled on an original Umami Burger and a Truffle Burger, thinking we'd split them and get half of one each (this proved to be an excellent decision).  Also threw in an order of fries "truffled". In short, both burgers were the bomb.  I liked the truffle burger a bit more, but man, both of them were just awesome.  I'm not one to get caught up in hype, but this got me. Fries were decent enough.  Nothing super special but enjoyed the truffle cheese on them. For dessert I had the Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich thing and it was pretty good.  Didn't love it but it was good enough for something sweet to end the meal. Burgers alone elevate this to 5 stars no problem, despite the fries and dessert that were probably more in the 4 range. Go.
