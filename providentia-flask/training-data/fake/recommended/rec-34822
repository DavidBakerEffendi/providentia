Small restaurant, but great food. Ordered 2 appetizers of scallops covered in olive oil and lemon; heirloom tomatoes, panchetta, arugala and watermelon. Scallops were raw so I couldn't eat it, but the heirloom tomatoes were delicious! Â  Then i had the bacatini which was delicious as well. Noodles were aldente and everything tasted superb! Make reservations or else you'll be waiting
