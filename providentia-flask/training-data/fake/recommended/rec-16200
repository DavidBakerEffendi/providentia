Really cute little restaurant in the middle of well..um..you'll see.  We were walking down the street on a muggy Saturday night, people BBQ'ing on the sidewalks, sitting out front chit chatting, just hanging out and then I see the restaurant before I even get to the corner. I say to my boyfriend, "Oh, it's the place where all the White folks are."  Yes, this was the only place that I saw within a mile radius where White people were sitting out front chomping down on food and chugging beer.  Let's just say, Peaches Hot House definitely stood out.  Not only that, but the waitstaff was White too.  Very strange for a neighborhood that was damn near 99% Black. It's funny that my boyfriend blended in more than I did once we stepped inside. But, yes, this was my first observation of the place. Oh and that the service was friendly and fun. I opted to go for the catfish with the Goddess dressing here and it was tasty, however the red rice tasted fresh out of a box of Zataran's. I barely touched the rice, but the blackened catfish was good.  I also tried the fried grits which came with three different dipping sauces. That was tasty and that sweet and moist cornbread was also fabulous. I was already kind of full from all those carbs before they brought out my main.  Good sweet tea with free refills!  Nearly a homerun meal but in order to finish off my night of gluttony,  we decided to share the double chocolate cake which came with a dollop of cinnamon whipped cream and fresh berries.  Now, that was a belly buster and fantastic to share. Even with three people, we still didn't finish the entire slice. All around good food, not so good sides, yummy dessert and good service. A-okay in my book!
