I had authentic Brazilian food for the first time and the food here was spectacular. My Brazilian date was very impressed. Great service with authentic dishes. Add kick with the malagueta that this restaurant is named for. One of the best meals I have ever had, appetizer to dessert. There was definitely a party in my mouth. Flavor flavor flavor!
