I'm from California, where Umami Burger originated, so I was excited to go here.  Their menu is a bit different - they have three truffle burgers!!  I tried the Truffle Especiale and expected there to be more of a truffle taste, but it was still good ... the fried egg on top is what lured me to get this burger.  Prices are obviously more expensive here than in CA because it is Manhattan after all
