I believe my past review was a rare occasion for honeygrow. I went back today and ordered a salad and a honey bar. Although it was pretty crowded, it only took about 5 minutes max. The salad was much better than last time - enough veggies and chicken to make me happy. The honey bar was also better - I ordered strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, wildflower honey and dark chocolate chips - very tasty. I am obviously still a big fan even though that one visit was a bit disappointing.
