These are good burgers . . .when they're on.  i went with an ex one day and she kept bitching about her burger.  "Christ, this woman is never satisfied with anything!" I think to myself in a very exasperated inner voice.  "My burger's good!"  But she made me take a bite out of hers and it was ass, totally bland.  That kind of inconsistency keeps it out of the four/five star range. However, french fries fried in bacon grease is like a blowjob wrapped up in a kick-ass movie.
