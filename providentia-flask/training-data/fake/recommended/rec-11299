i think the existence of Frankford Hall is conclusive proof that lower Fishtown has officially jumped the gentrification shark. we were first here in July for a couple friends' engagement party. we arrived early on a weekday, the party was outside, we had a great time and were impressed with the food and the beer selection (which is also very reasonably priced). since we had just moved to Fishtown, we figured this would get put on the regular rotation. we were warned, however, to stay away from the place on Friday and Saturday nights, as it was taken over by large packs of meatheads and guidos from Jersey. so we did, but we figured today we would be safe early on a Saturday afternoon. my partner and i like to go out to eat, but we like to do it at a chill place with a good vibe and respectful people who are not assholes. we walked into a environment that was more suited to a frat party than a restaurant. while we were eating, what seemed to be an entire fraternity (with matching t shirts) walked in. with the large screens, jenga and ping pong tables, i guess that's more the vibe they're going for. it's one of the first times i've ever been turned off by the crowd at a restaurant SO much that i don't think i will actually come back. the food and the beer are good, but they aren't better than any of two dozen gastropubs in NorLibs / Fishtown. this is listed as "German" food here on Yelp and on their website. at best, it's New American gastropub fare with a slight German bent. if you want real, legit, amazing German food, i would suggest you go to Brauhaus Schmitz instead. their curry ketchup, however, is to die for. i'm really, really disappointed this place has become Finnegan's Wake North. probably won't be back, unless the bridges from NJ get blown up or something.
