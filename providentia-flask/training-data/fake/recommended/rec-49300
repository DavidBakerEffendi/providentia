This was the best brunch place I have been to, hands down. You will not regret it. We were coming back to Connecticut from a trip to Montreal and Burlington sounded like a good and convenient spot to grab some food. The town itself is beautiful. It has a college atmosphere and you will enjoy walking around. Magnolia has a very cozy atmosphere. There was a sign in front that noted that Magnolia is Vermont's first green certified restaurant, and it showed. Even the bathroom had recycled paper towels. The food provided a healthier take on typical brunch items. I had the Egg Benedict on rye bread and it was tasty. But what was absolutely to die for was their oatmeal pancakes. The texture of the pancakes is heavy and hearty and it tastes amazing with their homemade strawberry sauce. They even had homemade ketchup. The cocktails are amazing as well. If you're into really fruity drinks, try the mighty bunny (I think that's what it's called). Awesome!! The service was also very good. We asked the waitress to take a photo of us and she took three different photos to make sure that we looked perfect. We will definitely be returning back if we are ever near Burlington again.
