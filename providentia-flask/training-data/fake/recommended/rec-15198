All around great food. I started with donuts as I waited for my chicken and biscuits. The donut was enormous and tasted like it was dipped in candy. The chicken was moist and the skin was cooked well, not to crunchy and seasoned nicely. Not as good the second day. The biscuit was big and fluffy and I smothered it with the sausage gravy which was probably the highlight for me.
