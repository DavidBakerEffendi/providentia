was a decent place. a little crowded and noisy during lunch hours on a saturday. actually extremely cramped and very loud. food came out fast and tasted fresh. everything looked clean. I got a zucchini omelet with munster and bacon, a side a hashbrowns and some multigrain toast. the hashbrowns weren't great, a little underseasoned, not crispy enough for my taste, but they were alright. big portions too. I couldn't finish. they had a good menu. everyone can find something they want. interesting specials that make me want to come back to try them. our waitress was quick and nice. The water tasted like pool water, I wouldn't advise ordering a glass. Cranberry juice was very good though. not much else to say. check them out.
