Dumplings: 5 stars Service: 3 stars We had a 40 minute wait, but shopped around for the first 25 minutes, so it wasn't bad at all. Also, we completely forgot that it was a cold and windy wait outside as soon as we took a bite into the shanghai dumplings. oh my god. it was good. First of all, $6.95 for a huge steamer of juicy, JUICY crab dumplings is a feel-good price already. Then we saw the pork dumplings are $4.95 and equally delicious, bf and I didn't stop praising the dumplings the whole time we were there! Note that the bf loooves his shanghai dumplings and we have been spoiled with some good dumplings before, but this tops everything we've ever had in the states! must go..again :p my tip? don't get anything else besides the dumplings. we had a plate of stir-fried veggies and it was $13 :-( Edit: forgot to write about the service while I rave on about the JUICY SOUP DUMPLINGS... haha. Anyway, this is a chinese restaurant, remember the employees are there on long shifts in this loud environment where people come and go, put their names on the wait list and then disappear, so be patient as they coordinate and seat you. while we were there we saw a party of 7 get called inside 3 times, finally being seated the third time. They were in good spirit though, and as we were leaving, we exchanged satisfying smiles because everyone had a good meal. obviously don't come here expecting to be pampered by your waiter.
