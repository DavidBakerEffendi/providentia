I was excited to try this place after reading the reviews.  Our experience could not have been worse.  The waitresses were in the dining room a lot, but always seemed to be correcting things that were wrong.  They frequently forgot utensils for tables, were taking back food, brought incorrect drinks and seems frazzled.  The restaurant was busy, but had plently of open tables. Hubby was excited to try the corned been hash.  It looked "well done", but he quickly founf it to be more overcooked, hard, salty and not at all homemade.  My biscuits and gravy were bland and sent me to the bathroom.  The pancakes were not tastly at all, but my son ate them because we ordered them with chocolate chips.  The coffee was terrible.   I would not return here.
