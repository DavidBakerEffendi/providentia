An absolutely lovely spot.  The outdoor seating makes this an ideal choice for a Frenchy brunch on a warm weekend, and the mid-range prices make it do-able to visit on a fairly regular basis.  A wonderful place to take your family when they are in town and want to buy you dinner, or a nice choice for a classy date.  Open all night on Friday and Saturday for great people-watching.
