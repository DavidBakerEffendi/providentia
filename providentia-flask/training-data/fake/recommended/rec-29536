Great casual place near convention center. We were recommended Zios by the Hampton Inn. Sicilian and white pizza with spinach slices were awesome, so was the chicken parm sandwhich--great bread, and not too heavy on the sauce. The service was wonderful. We topped off a dinner that hit the spot with some great canolis.
