i am bummed to write a less-than-good review for a vegan spot in philly, but i was disappointed by this place.  it is so tiny that you run into at least 4 people while trying to put sugar in your coffee.  i think the organization of the limited space could definitely be improved upon. also, a female barista was rude AND got my order wrong.  i get it--you have blue hair and you work at a coffee shop--you are a  very special snowflake!  i'm sorry for ordering a sandwich and inconveniencing you, but please learn to listen to your customer and at least feign some semblance of friendliness. the menu is fairly extensive (juices, sandwiches, smoothies, etc) and the food was pretty good, but the layout and service was so sub par that i will likely not return.
