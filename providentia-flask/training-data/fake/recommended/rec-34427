We are so fortunate to have this restaurant in Burlington.  The pizza crust is great, with an ideal thickness and lightness at the same time.  Tasty toppings- many made in-house, such as the Mozzarella and sausage.   And when you order a salad, you are served a salad........The mixed greens salad was a heaping fresh portion with an excellent light olive oil dressing a la European style.  Nice decor too, featuring the imported Italian pizza oven at work.
