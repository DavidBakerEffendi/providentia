Simply fantastic. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn.  At my latest visit, we had the tasting menu for 2 and enjoyed every bite! We also did the pairing, which was fun but probably could definitely do without and save a little cash.  We gave the chefs carte blanche with the menu and had some amazing treats! What's great is that they give each person a different item each course so you really get to try a wide variety of food. Everything is delicious, well presented and the flavors all blend together from some of the freshest, organic ingredients.  The service was friendly and the atmosphere romantic and cozy.  Defnitely not cheap, but a must if you want to enjoy food and the experience of eating.
