The food is delicious. Be it, the gourmet pizza, tasty paninis, or risotto it's thoroughly enjoyable. The bread sticks are flaky and the staff is very helpful with their recommendations, you can always trust that when they tell you their favorite it will be delightful. The wine list is lacking, but that doesn't mean there isn't something available for everyones' pallet. I personally always opt for pizza or a panini over the risotto because it's not so often I can get a good GF sandwich. The last time the Italian sausage, mozzarella, olive and cotto ham was recommended to me. It was tasty, but not the most flavorful sandwich I have ever had - the sausage's spice kind of outweighed all of the other tastes. The next time I go back, I am going to stick with my signature lamb, Gorgonzola and spinach panini. The dessert variety is nice but I have found better GF textures out there (this is a VERY mild complaint because the cream stuffed cupcakes really are something to write home about). The other fabulous thing is their to-go freezer. Well, hello delicious frozen pizza.
