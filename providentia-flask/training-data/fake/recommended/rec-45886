Absolutely excellent food!! Vegan veggie burger was out of the world! My hubby ordered the shrimp and avocado wrap and it was yum!! Chef Vasantha is amazing. He uses his own recipe made dressing that just makes everything yum. Also he gave us butternut squash soup on the house! And it was just yum again!! I am going back again soon!
