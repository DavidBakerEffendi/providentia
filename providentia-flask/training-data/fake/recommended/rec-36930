Market Table is fantastic. The ambiance is very homey, lots of dark woods and candle-lit tables with cute flowery centerpieces. They definitely cater their menu to reflect the seasons because it was full of fall comfort food action. I chose the soup special - potato leek soup which was wonderfully delicious (I did enjoy the chunks of potatoes and crispy croutons thrown in there for added texture!) Then I got the endive salad with goat cheese and carmelized pecans - do I even need to say more?? - amazing. For my entree I actually got the appetizer of diver scallops which were cooked to perfection - brown and crispy on top, served on a bed of sauteed butternut squash, carmelized onions and brown sugar. Loves it! Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert, but there was a chocolate pecan brownie-type item that caught my eye. Next time! Oh, and I'd like to note that the service was super friendly and very accommodating.
