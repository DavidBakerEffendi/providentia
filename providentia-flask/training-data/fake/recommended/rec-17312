I made a reservation on a Thursday evening for a group of 10 friends to meet for a glass of wine.  I recommend a reservation for a larger group, because the last time we tried to go without a reservation, we were turned down due to lack of room to accommodate us.  I arrived 20 min before our reservation and was led to the area in the back with couches and low tables.  Only 6 friends showed, but unlike other restaurants that constantly hound the customer if their entire party doesn't show up, I experienced excellent, prompt service.  We all sat around and enjoyed our wine without any badgering.  It's a cozy spot for a glass of wine- I'd like to try the tapas next time!
