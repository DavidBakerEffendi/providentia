Best lobster rolls anywhere bar none--even in New England! Great value for $20 lunch--includes glass of wine or beer and you get a full half a lobster in your toasted buttered roll w/ either homemade chips or fries and salad or cole slaw--unfortunately have to wait till next summer to try as today was last day for this special this year! Â Also had pan grilled skate for dinner last year in brown butter that was to die for. . .
