Crap! I am dying for some blue crabs! There are virtually no places in NYC that serve them. Was excited this place was opening so close to Carroll Gardens ... and then ... the reviews came in. We decided to go one day early, walked over and there was indeed a 4 hour wait. We walked away disappointed but not surprised. Anyone know of a place that serves decent blue crabs, could ya let me know??? Born and raised in New Orleans and I'm getting crabby :::sigh::: As for AM D's comment. You're crazy! When I go home and order Blues, I ALWAYS request as many females as I can get! They have the most meat and that "gross" stuff inside is yummy buttery fat! One star: 'cause I haven't been able to get a table yet, been waiting 3 weeks now. ;o)
