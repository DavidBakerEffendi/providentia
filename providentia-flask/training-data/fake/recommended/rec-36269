If you have a hankering for fresh seafood, go to Balthazar and get the 3-tier tower. Just do it. It's a splurge, but you will be so happy. Plenty of food for 3-4 people. You can make a meal out of it with 2 people. Add a bottle of champagne and you've got yourself an awesome and decadent dining experience! *Expect looks of envy from other diners.
