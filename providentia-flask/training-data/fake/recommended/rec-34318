Figuring out whether to give Saveur Creole a three or a four star rating was a very difficult choice.  While we enjoyed our meal the restarurant was run very poorly, apparently the chief overbooked them for the night and threw everything into disarray. On one hand all of the food my family and I had was very good.  I had the chicken etufee and it was quite good.  My mom had the shrimp etufee and my dad had the haitiana with eggplant and shrimp and both seemed to enjoy their dishes.  All of our dishes came with a well done salad and the choice of two soups, but we all picked the bouillon creole and all felt like we made a great choice. Our problems came with the service.  We had to specifically ask for someone to give us menus and pour our wine.  Once we figured out what we wanted we needed to specifically ask the manager to get the waitress to take our orders.  Our waitress never gave us their list of specials.  Before we started eating our main courses a large party came in and took control of the restaurant, it was very hard to hear what dish the server was bringing to us none the less talk to someone else at your table. In short I was not thrilled with my time at Saveur Creole but would be willing to give them a second chance.
