I went to Rye a week ago with my boyfriend, using a 30% off coupon we got from Blackboard Eats.  I'd recently read a review of the place in NY Mag, and wanted to give it a try.  After nearly walking past the front door due to its austere dark wood and frosted glass front, we stepped inside for an early dinner.  The decor reminds me of the simple, scrubbed and charming interior of a dining room in the only hotel in town in a old Western film -- there's a different set of antique salt and pepper shakers and mixed silverware on the tables, and everything is pretty much dark brown woods and white linens.   We were greeted and seated immediately (we were some of the first to arrive for dinner that night, but even as the place filled up, I never saw people ignored at the door), and thus began one of the best dining experiences we've had in a while.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the menu, and gave his recommendations based on his personal dining experience when we asked.  I ordered a special of the night: lime-cured and then grilled ceviche with citrus, and my boyfriend had a braised short rib sandwich and the handcut fries.  We also split two plates (12 in all) of eastcoast oysters, and sampled 2 cocktails each from Rye's creative cocktail list.  All was scrumptious!  For dessert we ordered the donuts (a nice old fashioned cake donut) with vanilla ice cream, and a Brandy Milk Punch to go with it.  Really delicious, and perfect for a hot summer night.   All in all, I don't have a bad thing to say about Rye, and my boyfriend and I have vowed to go back enough times to try everything on the menu.
