Yum! This place continues the ascent of South Slope into the top of Brooklyn's eating destinations. It's a literal hole-in-the-wall - a tiny storefront on a section of 5th Avenue that is sloooooooowly transforming from 99 cent stores to something better. The interior is well designed, wtih a long bar and table seating in the rear. We had a few sausages, but the kaisekraner (sp?) cheese brat really stood out. Totally delicious and full of melted cheese. So good with spicy mustard. The amazing draft beer selection sealed the deal. A perfect spot for lunch or a late night snack! My only beef: they put on a fairly violent kung fu movie on the huge tv just after we entered. Our kids sat there, enthralled, but seeing as how we were the only patrons (aside from another family with a toddler) I wish they could have been more sensitive to what they put on.
