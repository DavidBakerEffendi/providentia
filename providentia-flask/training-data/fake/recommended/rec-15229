The steak is chopped instead of sliced. So sad that many do not know what this means. It has nothing to do with preference. It has to do with the need to chop inferior meat so the consumer does not snap and pull and chew on gristle and fat. Always go for the sliced meat. Sliced = Superior Quality and Taste. Secondly, could there be a more plain pedestrian tasting roll than Amoroso? In a city filled with rich Italian bakeries like Carangi and Sarcone, this fraud of a place chooses Amoroso. Pass on them.
