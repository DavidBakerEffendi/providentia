One of my fav Indian Restaurants. I usually get delivery but decided to actually head out to dinner there. It's close to my home and BYOB which is great. The food is fantastic. I had the lamb madras with garlic naan. The ambiance of the restaurant was nothing special. Just a small mom and pop restaurant. The servers were very nice. Plus I love BYOBs! If you order delivery please be aware that it takes @ least 1.5 hours. It's worth it though.
