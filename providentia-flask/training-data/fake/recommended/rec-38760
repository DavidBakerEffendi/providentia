This review is regarding brunch only. That being said brunch was awesome. We were sat immediately. They open early whichis nice because we are early risers I hate waiting until 11 for brunch.  Let's start with the ambiance which is perfect for a Sunday. Although they could probably squeeze in another couple tables I'm glad they haven't.  The fireplace in the winter totally sets the tone. Next up, coffee. Great, fresh,and tasty. Note, if you have any decaf drinkers in your crowd, decaf only comes in french press because they don't sell a lot and want to make sure its fresh. Service was quick friendly and dead on. Could not have been better. Food service wasremarkably fast but there was no pressure to give up the table. Food was outstanding though we both had specials - pancakes and fried egg with maple sausage between bread pudding. Side potatoes were nice and well seasoned with roasted peppers and rosemary. Far better than MoGo down the street. We will be back for sure.
