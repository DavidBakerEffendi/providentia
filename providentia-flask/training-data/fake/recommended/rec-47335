While the burger is certainly good, it is so thick that the grocery store bun falls apart, as others have suggested.  A leetle disappointing and I don't agree with Jacob. (sorry Jacob).  I guess that's why the place is all "larger" male patrons. No lady-like woman should eat here. (Ha. like that would stop me, esp. after a night on the town.) But seriously, I prefer thinner burgers, the way that west coast men prefer their women. (Sucks to be me!) It was well--cooked but get the onions grilled. (Do they even do that here? I forgot to ask as I was so ashamed to be ordering something so decadent.) The toppings consisted of just the right amount. I felt like an absolute pig after I ate it, however. It was so big that I walked all the way to a secluded park off Hudson to eat it. ***Note***- Do not do this before going shopping in the Meatpacking or you will feel even worse. Still, the taste was better than Shake Shack. I'm not sure anything surpasses In-N-Out in Cali. Really, where are the "best burgers" in NY these days, I mean, the kind that can match In-N-Out? Also, they should really update their website, as I paid about $3 more than the listed price. (Bit of a shocker, there!) So, I have made the trek here for burgers twice now, but I doubt that I'll return unless I plan on buying bigger sized trousers. Try it and see for yourself.
