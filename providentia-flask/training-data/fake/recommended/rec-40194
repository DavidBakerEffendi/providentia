Went here for dinner and drinks after a comedy show at Helium. Awesome service, food and drinks! Must try the wood fired wings and duck confit flatbread. They have wine on draught ... What?!?! Atmosphere is intimate, would be great for dates or friends catching up. I would definitely recommend checking this place out.
