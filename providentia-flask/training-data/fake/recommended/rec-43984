Used to hang out In New Haven alot and the Anchor was a regular stop. One time I was at the bar and I realize the guy next to me was none other then "Mr Lawrence Fishburn " Turns out he was doing a play in town . I said hey (trying to be cool ) He was real down to earth.He was also alot slimmer then. I remember that he had a huge head. I mean his skull was humongous . I tried not to stare but it was hard(funny). I'm glad the place is still there. It was actually the last place I had a beer with me Best Mate Frankie(RIP)having those beers listening to that great jukebox couldn't have been better.
