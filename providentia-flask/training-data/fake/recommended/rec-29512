The bartenders/waitresses here are EXCELLENT! Yes, they're gorgeous (as every other male reviewer has commented lol) but they're actually very sweet as well! We ordered the fried calamari...five stars on that! The dipping sauce was amazing. The hubby ordered the bifee (beef sandwich) and loved it. I had the salmon a la plancha and it was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was served w potatoes and bok choy. Food is a little on the salty side, but I love salt...so no complaints on that! The restaurant has tv screens and the games playing. Definitely a plus! Â Great spot for game night. Overall, I highly recommend this spot.
