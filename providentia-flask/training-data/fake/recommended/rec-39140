So I typically check out a bar or two thats not too far from this place and, needless to say, if it's a sunday night, if I'm there, I'm usually 10 sheets to the wind! The bartender there, the medium height Asian guy, makes a killer french martini...ok yeah you can laugh, big brown man with a purple drink...whatever kiss my a@@ it's f'n good and goes really well with any type of Thai food...especially the eggroll skin wrapped deep fried shrimp things....RIIDIC!!  I typically have a couple of these while watching people line up against the brick wall and wait to be seated.   I've never been completely dissatisfied with the food I've had here, except that sometimes, the beef dishes can be a little salty. The pad thai is pretty good here, nice and saucy! The curries are above par but nothing to go crazy about. In terms of decor, I like to sit outside or in one of the middle tables, as it gets really busy and those spaces afford a little bit more space. There is usually a DJ that spins house funk or some a little hip hop but I've never been completely unhappy with the music. Going back to the drinks...I also like the Thai Ice Tea with some Stoli Vanilla Vodka....there is a slight aftertaste but a couple of those makes your dining experience much better!
