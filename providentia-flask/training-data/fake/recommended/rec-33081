Came here for the first time a few Weeks ago for a birthday lunch and wasn't disappointed by the food and service. I really enjoyed the food and the portion sizes were perfect. The chef even took the time to interact with guests which was pretty nice for a small restaurant. The only thing was that it seemed as if the restaurant caters to or attracts more couples. I felt like we might be intruding on the intimate setting with our girl girl talk. But overall it was a lovely experience and we even got a complimentary dessert. Its a great option for a lunch date or dinner with your hunny.
