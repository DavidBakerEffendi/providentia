The Great Wazu - as the name says is a great place. The menu options are fantastic (being a vegetarian, you don't always see so many options at most places, let alone a Deli). The the sandwich and the panini were good to taste and were served fast, considering the line and how busy the place is. However I do wish that their portion sizes were larger for veggie options, as they have to understand that the meat in meat food is filling, but veggies are not. Overall, I liked the place and do not forget to use the coupons on their website.
