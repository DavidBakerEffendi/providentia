- really a 3.5, but i'd have to round down... - decor is gorgeous.. the gorgeous chandelier in the center, the cool palette of colors and molding on the walls.. framed mirrors on the ceiling.. oh and that ginormous mirror in the bathroom that forces you to watch yourself in your most private moments on the pot haha... really cute staff if youre an asiaphile.. - the good:  cocktails were delicious.. and OMG - the lychee sangria tastiest sangria i've had yet.. i will attempt to make it this summer.. my pad se ew was perfect.. the papaya salad refreshing.. we had a party of 12 and they gave two of my friends a complimentary carafe of sangria because they had to wait so long for the food.. ohyeah.. many items on the menu seemed appetizing.. the best part.. the prices are great! they were able to seat a party of 12 without a reservation (shame on us..) - the bad: most of the dishes were oversauced.. like really oversauced.. this is coming from a condiment junkie.. the main ingredients of the food itself should not be smothered, but complimented by the sauce.. the avocado summer rolls, tuna tartar, imitation duck, pomegranate walnut duck, and the tamarind red snapper were just drowning in sauce.. granted we had a large party of 12, but the time between the first entree was set (mine) til the time the last entree was delivered was WAY TOO LONG.. am i being picky or critical? could it be that i am a service industry veteran? regardless, we all had a good time and nobody complained..  the complimentary carafe of sangria made up for it.. overall fun time.. - will i come back? with these prices and a beautiful spot, sure.. but i know what to order next time.. and i wont bring 11 of my nearest and dearest..
