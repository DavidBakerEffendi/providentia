Stupid.  That's what I am for not realizing this place was vegetarian! But, after the initial shock that their delicious sounding mac and cheese and their grilled cheese gooey sandwiches would be meatless, baconless, missing the components of every meal that I ever had truly enjoyed, I had to calm down.  Heart almost stopping, I looked at the menu further, and I decided to get the grilled cheese with Gouda black bean hummus, guava jam, pickled jalapeños, green salad with jalapeño vinaigrette.  The combination of all of these items was delicious.  It was spicy, sweet, salty, savory, and all without any of the traditional meats that get thrown in to add flavor and substance.  My wife had the mushroom shepherd's pie and she basically licked the entire bowl and table - anything that touched her entree.
