Do you have 6$ for a round trip to your happy place and back? Perfect This isnt just any street cart people. This is the street cart of all street carts formulated for only one thing, World Peace. For six dollars you get a plate of rice lettuce and 1 or 2 meats of your choosing (lamb and chicken) then you will douse this plate with the white sauce crafted from the gods themselves and maybe if your feeling frisky splash a tid bit of the hot sauce made from the devil himself. Seriously dont mess around the hot sauce is not a joke. Then you will find a nice place to seat and you will go all Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally Restaurant scene. (Movie reference CHECK). Then you will eat the whole thing, look down at your plate and weep one single tear. Until the next journey to your happy place.
