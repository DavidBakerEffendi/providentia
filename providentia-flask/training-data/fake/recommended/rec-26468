A food truck that has almost 3,000 reviews?! Seems unheard of! Until you have Halal Guys. That is their official name. But yelp having the streets as the name is pretty helpful. I don't even know what to say about it. You just have to try it for yourself to understand the words that are coming out of my mouth. It's delicious, it's super filing, it's tasty, and most importantly it's cheap!
