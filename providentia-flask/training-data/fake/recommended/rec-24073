No wait for a table for brunch at 12:00 on a Sunday morning?! What luck! Dined with a bunch of friends, and everyone agreed that the vibe and decor was cool and laid back - hipster in the best way. The menu is on the wall, so they don't give you a menu for the table. If you are in the main room this isn't really a problem but our table was a little bit off to the side so we had to stand up in the main room to read it. Though we thought this was a little big off-putting and rushed our decisions a bit, we decided it fit the vibe of the place and was a cute quirk. The service was excellent! Our waitress was super friendly and helpful, even after she had to explain the JB Breakfast to us 3 times... Waters and coffees constantly refilled! Food was good too and generous portions. Two of my friends had the smoked salmon hash and really liked it, plenty of salmon. The JB Breakfast wasn't as large as we expected it to be, but it was tasty and you get to try a little bit of everything. I really enjoyed my eggs Benedict but it was a tad cold and english muffin was a little thick and under-toasted for me. The eggs Benedict burger is basically what it sounds like - burger with hollandaise sauce, and a fried egg - I would say the best of the meals.
