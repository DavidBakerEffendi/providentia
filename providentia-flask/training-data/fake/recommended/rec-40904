My boyfriend lives in crown heights and we have had a struggle finding decent food joints. That search is over because we found Chop Chop on Nostrand Ave! Small, yes, but the service and food are AMAZING!!! Â Sophisticated menu, with incredible breakfast and dinner options. Super reasonable prices too. Please go immediately!!!
