My family and I come here very often.  If you have a craving for American Chinese food, this is the place to come.  We always tend to get chow fun, chicken or beef.  We also enjoy the Kung pow and chicken with cashews.  They do have Thai options on the menu, however, do no expect authentic Thai from this.  Come here for old reliable comfort of Chinese food.  The crab Rangoon and egg rolls are great.  The family that owns the place is very friendly and sweet. 15% off coupons are frequently in the Valpacks....and the family doesn't even need to see them from us as we come so often.
