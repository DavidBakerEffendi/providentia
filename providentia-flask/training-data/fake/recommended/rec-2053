I traveled three thousand miles for this? I walked from the nearest train station to 9th and Passyunk, and was hungry enough to eat one from both places. Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest, but I know what good beef is supposed to taste like, but this wasn't it. I found it to be very tough and gristly. The roll was very good, as was the cheese. Unfortunately, it was difficult to get past the beef (literally!) The ordering process is reminiscent of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. You buy your sandwich at one window, and God help you if you don't already have your cash out, then move on to the next window to get fries and drinks, and pay again. It's all rather silly, really. Nothing I say should stop you from going here, though. Skip over Independence Hall and head south. You'll never know until you try it for yourself. I could have just been there on a bad day.
