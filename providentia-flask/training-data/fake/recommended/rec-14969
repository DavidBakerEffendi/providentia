Ate here recently on a business trip to Philly. Was looking for a nice quiet dark place for a few beers and some food. I read good reviews so figured I would stop in. Definitely a keeper. The beer on tap was great and it looks like they continually have new ones on special. I tried a few wheat beers and finished up with an imperial stout from Dogfish Head (one of my favorite micro breweries). Decided to try one of the sandwiches on special after a recommendation from the bartender. It was a smoked duck sandwich served on toasted wheat bread. Very tasty indeed. Will go back!
