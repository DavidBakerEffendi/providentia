This is the perfect case of over relying on Yelp to pick a restaurant. The reviews are made by over-hyped bandwagon riding yuppies that don't know Thai food. This place absolutely sucks and I wish I didn't even step foot in this place. First, I walk into the restaurant with my lady and two little kids to get dinner. Great, a random couple that knows the owner I guess walks in and gets seated right in front of my face after we waited forever. I should've walked out but everyone deserves a second chance. Then the only white guy working there is a complete DOUCHEBAG, oh the irony he's the F____ing owner!!!! I had a what the f___ moment. He sees us sitting there for god knows how long then comes over and doesn't say a word and points at us to order our food. Literally not a word was said and looked at us as if we were peasants. The beef  came out with the basil sauce and tasted like throw up. The 5 pieces of beef were hard as rocks and were bland. The Pad Thai was terrible, chicken was dryer than the owner's personality. Our last entrée, shrimp and noodles, maybe a total of 3 shrimps were on the plate and outright tested like sauteed garbage. On top of that I had to wait an hour for the food to come out and just to eat something terrible. The owner stands by the bar and drinks beer and could give 2 sh__ about your experience. You make me feel like just opening a Thai restaurant right next door so you could see how it's suppose to be done.
