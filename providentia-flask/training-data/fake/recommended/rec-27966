Cafecito is a great little neighborhood Cuban place. It's cheap, cute, and tasty. The Cuban sandwich is perfectly balanced, garlicky and delicious. The appetizer sampler is highly recommended, it's a cornucopia of fried treats...and who doesn't love a good Mojito? The staff is really nice and service is quick. This place gets extra points in the warm weather when the storefront opens, and palm trees on the sidewalk make you quickly forget you're sitting on Avenue C 2 blocks from the ConEd plant.
