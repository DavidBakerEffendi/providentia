I would say it's one of the best brunch spots in New York City! It's located near Saint Marks. I came here with a couple of my friends and the wait wasn't that long, it was pretty decent. The decor was pretty nice and the place was quite spacious. It felt very warm. Our server was extremely kind! I ordered a special which came with orange juice and tea/coffee. The tea was unique, it came in a lightbulb like cup in which you have to pour the tea to a different cup. I didn't get coffee but my friend did and she didn't want it, so I drank hers instead. I actually like the coffee a lot. It wasn't too bitter or too sweet, it was just right, the way I like it. I would come back here again only if the lines aren't long!
