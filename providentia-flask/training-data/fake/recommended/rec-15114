We had our first meal in Philadelphia here and it was perfect!  We flew in from AZ and just wanted to relax and not have to go in search of food so we opted to eat here.  The decor is very attractive and really fits this hotel.  It was restaurant week so we ordered our dinner from the special menu and couldn't believe the deal!  For $35/person you can create your own 3 course meal and you can't go wrong with any of their options.  The two of us had the ham appetizer and a potato soup, trout and steak and then the German chocolate cake and I believe it was a custard as the other option.  I can't even say enough about everything it was all so great!  The trout was served over pureed parsnips that resembled potatoes and I had never had anything like it, I loved it.  Steak was cooked perfectly and was devoured before I could take a picture of it.  The chocolate cake was cooked and assembled perfectly, not too much of anything and the other dessert was delicious as well and i think it had goat cheese in it?  Our cocktails were memorable too, I think we stopped in almost every night for one that kinda resembled a mule but with brandy and peaches.  If you are in the area I highly recommend stopping in for a drink and a bite.
