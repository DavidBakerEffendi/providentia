I came to the area to eat at another restaurant. Luckily it was closed and I was forced to come here since it was close and I was pressed for time. This place is fantastic. They had a reservation in an hour and a half but sat my party of four if we promised to order quickly. The four of us ordered different dishes and shared everything family style. Every single bite of everything from the chicken to the gnocchi to the lamb ragu sauce was amazing. If you're in the area you should definitely try this restaurant out. P.s. The cannolis are delicious!
