Who woulda thunk it? A quality crepe place in Queens...and in Woodside?? It was a pleasant surprise. They have a variety of crepes to choose from, there were about 6 of us so we tried quite a few. The nutella with strawberries, the crepe special with salmon, the Pepper Chic, the special berries and the omelet crepe...all were quite tasty, tasty enough that some of us went back for seconds. A dash of hot sauce really complimented the salty crepes. Good size portion at non exorbitant prices.
