It's a hit and miss with this place. I came here to visit some friends and we all met up at Atticus. They never been there either so we thought we would give it at try. The set up was nice and the food was great. BUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS WORK. Our waitress never came by to fill up our waters or check on us, and it took her FOREVER to come by with the check. It was obvious that we had a good portion of of meal that we uneaten and required take-out boxes. She never asked us if we needed them. I needed to flag her down before she rushed off. She also go our checks mixed up and we didn't realize it till a couple of day later when one of us checked our statements.
