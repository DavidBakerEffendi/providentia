TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE BAR SERVICE I give this place one star because the decorations and patio are designed beautifully, but other than that never revisiting this place. I was denied a drink because the rude bartender felt it wasn't my own when I provided several credit cards to prove my identity. Unbelievable. You're a bartender you're not investigating identity theft. Valid identification is all that is required whether you feel it's me or not. I'm insulted especially as I left the place all I saw were my younger brother's 19 year old buddies sitting by the wall. Take your money somewhere else people. There are several bars in Bay Ridge that would love to have you, not love to kick you out and embarrass you completely. What a shame I was stoked to visit this place to.
