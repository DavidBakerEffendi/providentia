Based on the thousands of pizzas I've had across the US, this is better than average. I can't imagine giving them less than 4 stars. I had the white clam with half spinach garlic Gorgonzola. It was pretty salty. Both halves. The fresh tomato pie was similarly overly salty. That's all I can fault them for. They were perfectly charred , crispy and delicious. The food quality was very good and we loved the place and service.
