ooh market table how i love you... My friend made reservations a month in advance for 9:00 on a Friday night. I was super excited since I had wanted to come to Market table since it opened. You immediately walk into a market with a large variety of foods. It was a great place to wait until we got seated which took about 5 minutes. The dining room is small and intimate. Very nice atmosphere. We split the scallops wrapped in bacon. That's always a good choice. I got the arctic char and we also ordered the hush puppies on the side. Oh my goodness, those hush puppies are amazing. Just absolutely delicious. They melted in your mouth. I neeeed to go back just to have those hush puppies. Too bad reservations are so hard to come by...
