It was crowded on a weekday, so you know it has to be good! But fortunately we didn't have to wait too long. The place was small but cozy and the food was definitely great. I would recommend the Sukhothai Pork Noodle Soup. The pork was delicious, the broth was nice and spicy, although I do wish it came in a bigger bowl. The service was very friendly and quick.
