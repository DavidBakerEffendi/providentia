More like Crummy Sushi. Went in for lunch the other day.  An overwhelming fish smell as soon as we walked in, so I decided on something cooked.  My husband braved it and got a few rolls.  The good news: It didn't make him ill.  He wasn't too impressed with them at all though and he's an avid sushi eater.   I got pineapple fried rice, which had mushy rice and raisins in it!!  WTH??  The rice was an odd orangish color, without any flavor. I had one bite of it, then went to get ice cream down the street to fill me up. Still on the hunt for a decent sushi place around here...
