Touring Brooklyn in December, my buddies took me to Gueros. As a Californian, I can say that none of this food was unfamiliar to me at all, but above my expectations. "Oh DUDE!, You gotta get the fried avocado and jalapeno taco, OH MY GOD I ORGASMED" -- This is my buddy in Brooklyn, who recommended this taco to me. I also got the grilled chicken and hanger steak tacos, which were no biggie. The people I went with wouldn't know - they were vegetarian. Fried Avocado/Jalapeno Taco: Yeah, this was as good as my friend said it was. Grilled Chicken: Nothing too special, as I've had way too many of these back in CA. Hanger Steak: Dang son! I didn't need a third taco, but this was undeniable - good stuff! I also had to get a Margarita. "DUDE, you have to get the Margarita's here, but ONLY get it half frozen/liquid!" My friend is a genius.
