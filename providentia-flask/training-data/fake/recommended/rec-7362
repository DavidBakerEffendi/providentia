Not what it used to be. Mediocre food. Moody, rushed waitress. After realizing the restuarant had expanded, we were seated in a cold room which smelled odd. Mussels were bland, steak su poivre was drowning in way-too-peppery sauce. Nothing felt special. This used to be my favorite restaurant in NY. Hadn't been for 2 years and went last night. Our waitress looked like she wanted to be anywhere else but there. Was hopong for the warm, romantic, deliciously simple experience I fondly remember. Very sad.
