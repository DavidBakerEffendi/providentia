Love the food and variety option! I got the "built your own stir fry" and got shrimp with mushrooms onions and edamame. The food was delicious and healthy but i do wish they had more options to add to the sitrfry instead of just three so i added more veggies and got charged extra. The food portions are pretty big too. One thing that would help this establishment is putting calories up? Also ordering was quick and easy and loved using the touch screen
