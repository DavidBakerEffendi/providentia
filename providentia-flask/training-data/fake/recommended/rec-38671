Run of the mill Chinese eat in/ take out restaurant, but I've had better at most other restaurants for the same price. The food was OK but not very fresh and the flavor did not grab me. I had a Four seasons plate meaning rice with chicken beef pork and shrimp. The meat was average but the vegetables didn't taste very fresh.
