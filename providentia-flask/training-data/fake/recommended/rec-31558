I stopped in the other day and was a bit skeptical since it was a Mexican Chinese Combo restaurant. I got the lunch special ground beef tacos and they were great as other reviews here say the ground beef was delicious and they also included salsa on the side to add to the tacos. I got Mexican rice on the side and it was ok.  I chose the soda instead of a soup so I can't vouch for how good their soups are. The only complaint i had was that tortillas on the tacos were soggy which was odd for a hard shell taco(I am thinking they either fry or bake the tortillas there and it just didn't cook long enough) which is the only reason I gave 3 stars and not 4. In summery the food is great and the portions are well worth the price(the lunch special is a steal at $5.50) The owners are also very friendly.  I definitely plan to order from them again in the future.
