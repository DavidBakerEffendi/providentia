I ate at Palma for the first time on Saturday night with a friend.  Loved the atmosphere, casual & laid back yet trendy.  The restaurant is tiny & very busy.  I heard it's difficult to get a reservation but my friend & I got one at the last minute.  The service seems very Mediterranean - they take forever but are super friendly & helpful!  And it works out well because you sit, take your time and get to enjoy the evening. The menu is mouth-watering, and everything was DELICIOUS, from the cocktails (peach martini & bloody mary)  to the meal (fried artichokes, eggplant parmigiana, linguine with truffles) soooooo tasty!  Although it's pricey, it's worth it & I am definitely coming back!
