This restaurant was delightful. The service was great and the food was spectacular. I ordered the Basil's Mixed Grill w/New Zealand lamb chops were delicious, the steak was a generous portion cooked perfectly i had sweet potatoe fries were great. My husband ordered the lasagne which was the special and it too was delicious. We also had appetizers that were great. Overall is was a pleasant dining experience.
