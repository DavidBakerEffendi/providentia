Just found out about this spot in nj. There arent many places to hang out at night to relax and talk. But this place was great. Came here twice after 9pm. They would open up the windows. Can be crowded but I didnt have to wait long. Great specials for drinks and food. Half off appetizers. Loved the avocado egg rolls. The service has been good. I like how I can just hang out with a group of people and not be rushed out. Good place if you want to sit down, talk, and enjoy good drinks/food.
