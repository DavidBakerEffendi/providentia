What an awesome brunch place! Haven't stopped telling my friends about this place. Stumbled upon here after we found out the wait for Clinton st bakery was going to be 2.5 hours (you read that right - 2.5 hours!!), but we are so glad we came to Maharlika instead. Got the Filipino twist of chicken n waffles, and mannnn was that waffle to die for! Also got the sizzling sisig with egg, which was a wonderful savory breakfast dish. Make sure to bring cash!
