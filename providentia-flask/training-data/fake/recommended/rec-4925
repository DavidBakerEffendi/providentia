Food was too salty. waitress brought wrong dish. We ordered 65 but they brought 66, and blamed on us not pointing the right one. Also, they refused to change our dish. Owner is very rude and food become very salty and overcooked compared with other Thai food around this area. I wouldn't give it a star at all.
