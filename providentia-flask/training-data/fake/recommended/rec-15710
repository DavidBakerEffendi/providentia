I love the ambience of this restaurant, although it does get quite noisy on a Sunday night so if you're looking for a place to have a conversation this probably isn't it. Â The food was good, but not my favorite Italian. The parmesian cheese in the antipasto misto was probably the worst I've ever had, definitely not top quality which makes me question the rest of their dishes. All-around okay meal, probably will not return.
