Came here for brunch. We got to sit outside in the garden which was really nice. Unfortunately, the french toast was really bitter and didn't have much of a flavor to it. My boyfriend couldn't even finish eating it. In addition, our waiter had serious ADD and walked away while we were still ordering. It was a very strange dining experience.
