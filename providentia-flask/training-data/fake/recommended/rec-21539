Only food price keeps this place from an enthusiastic 5 stars with lots of !!! after it.  We went randomly on our first night in Philly for drinks.  They have plenty of good cheap drinks and a great variety of places to hang out.  In the diner, in the club, on the patio, on the back of the patio, at the cabana... pretty sweet.  Drinks are as cheap as you need, with pbr/miller/tecate cans for about $2 and a pint of yuengling for $3.  They have badass pint glasses too.   We half-joking said we should go back here for breakfast.  The joke didn't last long as we were soon on our way there.  I had the huevos rancheros which were awesome.  Tasted awesome and was pretty healthy so you don't have to leave with that all-day diner hangover.  My brother liked his food and we enjoyed the free refills on the coffee.   Of additional note, their bathrooms are also useable, which isn't always true in some places.   Overall, this place had a great vibe, eclectic crowd, and good prices.  The meals were all basically in the $10 range, which isn't bad, but a little rich for my extremely poor blood.   Highly recommend anyone to check this place out.  I'll definitely go back if I'm in Philly again.
