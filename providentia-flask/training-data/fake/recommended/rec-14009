1. chorizo with bittersweet chocolate 2. razor clams 3. squid ink 4. asparagus with paramesan 5. tuna with anchovies 6. fried fish 7. 8. I don't remember the rest, but all time favorite was the razor clams.  Maybe I'm a big seafood fan, but the soup in that bowl was delicious!  We kept asking for my bread to soak up the yummy goodness. The only downside was the 1.5 hour wait, but I'd always wait in a long line for great food.  The sangria was a nice complement, and all my friends were (azn) glowing by the end of the night.
