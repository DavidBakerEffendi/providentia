I got a seafood tofu. It came in a hot stone bowl, still bubbling, and I put in a raw egg to cook for a bit. I also liked that the rice came in a stone bowl too, though there was a ton of it even for the 2 of us to share, and I think they give exactly that much for just 1 person also. The soup wasn't very flavorful (I got "spicy", which was 3rd on the 4 pepper scale). The appetizers (kimchi, bean sprouts, and spicy pickles), also weren't exceptional. Good experience, but I was disappointed by the taste.
