the wait is ridiculous & the ramen is okay. i honestly would only go back for those damn pork buns (they are AMAZING)!!! in which case, i'd be forced to order an overly priced bowl of ramen since i probably waited at least an hour to get seated. sadly, this was my only favorite restaurant in new york when i first visited back in april 2011, & i didn't even like it THAT much. =\
