In another city, maybe I'd give quick fixx 4 stars. I however, as someone who lives by himself and has been disappointed by Philly's delivery scene, think quick fixx deserves five stars. The food is great - my favorite is the macaroni and cheese with a side caesar. BUT the best part is that they are quick to deliver, on bikes, and when they call they introduce themselves and are genuinely polite "hi, this is john from quick fixx, i'm rounding the corner now". Good food, quickly, reasonably priced with nice folks.
