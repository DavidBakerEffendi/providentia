Mmmmmm....my meal of Marabella's meatballs melted magnificently in my mouth. Actually, I'm a little worried about giving too positive a review: then too many people might know about this place and I'll have to wait in line! Just a little tip, it's BYO, too.  A bottle of wine (I hear a Côtes du Rhône pairs especially well with meatballs!) and a couple sandwiches is the perfect cheap, low-key dinner out!
