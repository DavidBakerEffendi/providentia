For starters, we had no wait to our total surprise. We walked in to a loud, hustling restaurant expecting to have to turn around and go elsewhere and instead we got seated at the counter right away. We ordered the fried chicken buns and a ramen to split. The buns were soft with spicy, crunchy chicken. Loved those and wished there were more of them in a $9 order. We chose the spicy ramen, added soft boiled egg. Broth was good, noodles were soft but less chewy than I thought they'd be. Overall, a belly filling, warming meal in the middle of our trip through the city. I would return if I didn't have to wait. The atmosphere is hectic, the employees yell things to each other and greetings (I'm guessing since it's foreign) at diners as they enter the dining room. Price for what we ate was decent. $32 with tip.
