My cousin took my husband and I here because she likes their sandwiches. The store is pretty cute located in Burlington and walking distance to Lake Champlain. Â It does have a market setup with some grab and go grocery items, but also a sit down section for a bite to eat. My husband ordered a turkey BLT with maple bacon which he said was delicious and I had fish tacos which were fresh and a manageable size. My husband ordered a local beer which has been his favorite so far this vacation, Switchback. I tried a really good root beer, made in New York. They are pretty fast making our made to go orders. Didn't get a creemee from here because I felt I had just the right amount of lunch.
