Pio Pio!  Hard to forget a name like that... in fact it sounds much like when kids play and pretend to fire guns at each other... It's also hard to forget because it's my first time having chicken with a South American twist.   My honest first thoughts were "Peruvian chicken? What could be so great about it?" I could not have been more wrong.  I believe we ordered 2 Matador combos for the 8 of us.  Each combo included a chicken cut into fours, fries, avocado salad, rice and beans and tostones.  We also ordered ceviche and sangria. Let me describe in order of consumption... The sangria is really good here.  Now I say this because most sangrias have a really strong wine taste which is too much for me but this sangria was more sweet, less bitter and smooth tasting.  The ceviche was really good, not outstanding but pretty solid.  Big enough for the 8 of us to get a good tasting of it. On to the main course... Chicken!!  I was pretty skeptical going in and even as the food came out it looked pretty standard.  I picked a piece of the dark meat, dived in with my fork and knife and came out pleasantly surprised.  All I could say was, "OMG this is so good!!" Although I am a potato gal the french fries needed to be eaten with some sauce to help get them down but not too bad.  Green sauce had a nice kick to it so I used it for the french fries instead of the chicken. Avocado salad was okay.  It's literally avocado on top of some iceberg lettuce pieces.  I was the least impressed with the presentation and components of this dish but doesn't affect my overall view.  Afterall it's just salad. :) Definitely worth checking out.  Walking in it looks really small but then you get downstairs and I loved the space!!  Great atmosphere for enjoying a good meal with good friends!
