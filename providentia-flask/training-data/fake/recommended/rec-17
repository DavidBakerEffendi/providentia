Fantastic time at Toast! The omelet of the day had spinach, goat cheese and Capri tomatoes--Yum! Spritzers were fab and the perfect quencher for a warm day. I also had a bowl of fresh fruit and unlike some caf√©s the fruit was FRESH! It hadn't been in the fridge dying an icy death but perfect strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and banana. My kids (3 x 13y + 1(24y) 1 gal pal (13y)) ate everything on their plates and want to return. Above all the service was wonderful!
