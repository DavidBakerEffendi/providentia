Wow I can't believe this place gets business considering that there are better establishments in the neighborhood.  We came her on a Saturday at 2:30 and it wasn't a ghost town, so that was a reassuring sign.  We were promptly seated and that was when the troubles began. Our waitress was extremely odd and asked us to repeat our orders multiple times.  A friend and I both ordered the clam linguine with white sauce, only to find out 5 minutes later that they were out of seafood!  Kind of taken aback we browsed the menus given to us, only to find out it was the wrong menu.  I ordered the wild mushroom with chicken dish and per the previous review, the mushrooms were definitely not wild...they were plain ole button mushrooms.  I thought my dish came with pasta so when it came out pasta-less I was surprised.  However, they were nice enough to quickly cook up some for me, so I appreciated that.  The food tasted ok.  Nothing special.       After finishing our food we sat around and waited, and waited, and waited until our server appeared from the back and plopped our check down.  She then promptly disappeared again.  We had to flag down another waitress to help us pay.   Overall I'd say the food here is 3 stars.  Very standard, typical food that you can definitely find at Olive Garden.  What brings it down is the odd service and even worse, the fact that they were out of seafood on a Saturday.  It does not bode well and I don't think they'll survive much longer.
