Went here for a business lunch. We had reserved but it was really empty, which was good for us as we wanted to talk without being interrupted. The waitress was friendly and didn't harass us when we ate slowly.  The food was good - it's all local/organic ingredients.  I had the cheese & ham grilled sandwich, which was really tasty. The fries were ok, nothing amazing. The dessert menu was really good though! I had the chocolate peanut butter cup and it was amazing. Very rich though so I couldn't quite finish it.  The others had the buttermilk panna cotta and the carrot cake - we all enjoyed them! Food is a little on the pricy side, although at lunch they do a soup and half-a-main combo for $15 which is probably a good deal.
