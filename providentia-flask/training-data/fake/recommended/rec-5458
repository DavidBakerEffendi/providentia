I've been to the Continental Midtown several times for various meals, and the food and drinks have always been phenomenal, if a little pricey. The brioche French Toast is delightful, and the eggs Benedict with salmon isn't nearly as salty as other places. We have brought various friends from out of town here over the years, and no one's had a complaint ever until today. Our server was seemingly uninterested in... well, serving. Our friend has a gluten allergy, and she asked if she could substitute something for the toast with her omelette; our server - we never got his name or a smile - said he'd check with the chef and let us know. The next thing we know, brunch is coming out, with butter, no toast, and nothing instead of toast. Our server said that the chef could give her extra potatoes - after we're halfway done with our meal - and that someone else could have her toast. Still waiting on all of that to come out. We had to flag down another server for coffee and water refills, and rarely saw our server. We were pretty embarrassed about the service today, especially with visitors in tow. Here's hoping it's better the next time we go... Five stars for the food, two for today's service.
