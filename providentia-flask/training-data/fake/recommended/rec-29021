Don't order anything but chocolate. We ordered a light lunch before we got down to chocolate business.  Our three meals came out 5 to 10 mins apart?? Dip trio w/ pita- Hummus was good.  The babaganoush and other eggplant dip had strange, unappetizing tastes Fish tacos- rice was near raw, beans were bad Margarita pizza panini- yum A+ for the hot chocolate and peanut butter/chocolate sundae, but the start of our meal was an odd pace and strange taste...
