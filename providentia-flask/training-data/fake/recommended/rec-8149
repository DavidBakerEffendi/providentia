Three of us had a nice leisurely dinner in a cozy room there last night. The service was friendly.  The climate control was uneven. We started with "Autumn Spiced Butternut Squash Soup with Braised Pastured Lamb smokey bacon fritter, heirloom apple and walnut salad" which was NOT a soup.  It was a large fritter (which was NOT fried) with squash sauce.  The sauce was delicious and all of it was too salty. The entrees: * Mustard Grilled Organic Raised Lamb from Neptune Farm with an Oregano-Garlic Chive Pesto Teens for Good Farm's sunchoke puree and organic spinach sauteed with zucchini  - good and the artichoke puree was great * Vegetarian Roundup of Assorted Local Seasonal Vegetables, Pilafs, Salads, and Sides stir-fried, steamed, sautéed and more; served hot and room temperature on one plate - excellent melange but too salty * Low Country Spiced Crispy Pekin Duck Breast from Jurgielewicz Farms Cajun spoonbread, smothered greens, with crawfish etouffee sauce - the best of the lot When we gave negative feedback to waitress, the item was dealt with with grace and top notch customer service. The three deserts were great: * pumpkin cake with apple cinamon icecream * brownie sundae with earl gray ice cream * lime spiced goat cheesecake Be sure to checkout the restrooms
