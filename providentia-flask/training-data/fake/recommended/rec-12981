This place obviously doesn't need my vote of confidence to succeed, but like a true Philadelphian I'm gonna tell you what I think anyway. I loved it the first few times we visited, but my enthusiasm has waned a little over the years because: .:. Parking sucks. We get lucky sometimes, but there have also been visits when we circled for close to an hour. .:. It's cash only. The last time we went there, we were amused to see this policy provoke a fight between two friends, one of whom didn't have any cash. Come on, guys. It's not quaint; it's inconvenient. .:. People are rude there, both staff and patrons. I know, I know, it's their Philly thing, but it gets old after awhile. .:. Long lines. Sometimes longer than others, but always pretty long. .:. No bathroom. Last time we went there we had to go across the street and buy a beer to relieve ourselves in the bar's bathroom. Which was fine, since we were pretty thirsty after not having enough cash to afford sandwiches AND sodas. Okay, I sound like a big complainer now, so let me say that their cheese steaks really do produce spontaneous cravings. I've never had a better one. The bread is chewy and light, similar to a French baguette. The steak is thinly shaved, although a little bland (and there's almost always a couple of tough pieces I have to discretely spit into my napkin.) Whiz is a pretty great compliment to the other ingredients. Provolone? Don't fall for it. Ditto mushrooms, peppers and other condiments. It's overkill. The thrill is cheap simplicity. And what a thrill it is!
