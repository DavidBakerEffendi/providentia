Overall, New Haven pizza changed my palate and made so that now, back here on the west coast, I have no real desire to go out for pizza anymore. Â But of all New Haven pies Bar makes THE BEST. The crust is thin and crispy but maintains a chewy toothiness that is just right. Their toppings are unique and varied and you can build the exact pie of your dreams on either a red (marinara) or white (garlic and oil) base. DO NOT turn your nose up to the mashed potato/bacon pie (and also do not get talked into ordering it as a red pie...just my opinion). I couldn't in good conscience give it 5 stars because the service (all of the 50 times I went) is always between mediocre and piss poor. The waitstaff are pretty slow and often times too cool for you. The pies can get a tad pricey too once you start adding up the toppings but it is worth every cent...in fact, if they knew what I would pay for a white/MP/bacon/mozz pie they might just deliver to Seattle!
