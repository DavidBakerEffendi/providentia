This is a really great Indian place in my neighborhood!  I just tried it for the first time and definitely recommend a visit.  Great food, great prices, excellent service.  Cozy atmosphere.  We were served by the owners who were extremely nice and talked to us about our food and gave us a few extras (including a yummy mango lassi) so we would get the entire experience.  I would definitely go back or order from there!
