i'm sorry that i can't give higher stars. i had fantastic service, loved the ambience, and the food was good. ... just good. this place is really expensive, which is fine with me. but for the price, you're getting tiny portions that make you wish your $20 shrank to a $2 so that when you paid, it would seem worth it. but it wasn't bad. at all. we got the bread basket, my friend and i shared the omelette (don't share if you're hungry), and my friends shared the benedict with extra hollandaise sauce. and dont get me wrong. it tasted good. not amazing. just good. our service was FANTASTIC. our waiter was funny, nice, and charming. it was crowded on a saturday brunch morning, but everything else was great. i guess i could bump this up to 4 stars, but i'm not really a fan. i wouldn't go there on my own accord just because i didn't feel like the money matched the food. oh and yes. the bread basket was good. just good? yes. just good. i've had better. i can understand why prices are so high. but am i supposed to expect this in new york? we're not in france... but then again... new york tries.
