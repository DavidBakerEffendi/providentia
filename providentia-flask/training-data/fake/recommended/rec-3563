My previous experience with Taim was at their original location in the Village, so when I happened upon this new location I was absolutely delighted.  While seating is relatively limited, there are many more seats in this shop than their sibling store.  I'd say about ten people (maybe fifteen) could squish in here before it gets out of hand.  On this particular day however i was taking my food to go. I ordered the Taim Falafel "sampler" side.  This gives you two of each flavor: traditional, harissa and red (with roasted red pepper).  The sampler was served with a small container of tahini (more than enough to dip each one in more than once).  The traditional is tasty, but there aren't many surprises there.  The roasted red pepper is tasty and quite different than your typical falafel.  The standout for me however is the harissa, which has a lovely bite to it you don't expect from falafel.  The tahini dipping sauce was delicious and helped offer a nice counterpoint to the flavor of the falafel.   Taim is simply awesome.  Service is quick, friendly and the food is great.
