Hmmmm where to begin  So much to say that I think Ill just lay it out like this

 Looks tacky from the outside but when you walk in it has a really nice casual set up  They really need to open it up so that you can see inside from the outside

 we were seated and promptly greeted  When the waitress asked us how we heard of the restaurant we informed her that we had a Groupon  The place was very busy and she told us that several others had groupons too  we ordered four tacos and two kids quesadillas

 we waited waited waited waited waited watched a table that came in at least  minutes after us receive their food waited waited waited and waited  After  minutes our food arrived

 it was good really really good but the tacos were very tiny  The waitress came by and asked if everything was okay and we told her we would love more tacos but couldnt wait  more minutes  She said shed bring them right out and she did  A mere  minutes later  tacos magically appeared  So  WTF took  minutes the first time

 So besides the horrible inexplicable wait comes the zinger  When the waitress brought back our check she said that it was  taco night but since we had the Groupon wed have to pay  per taco  DOUBLE WTF  Does that make any sense to you  So I wouldve got over  off if I didnt use the Groupon which gave me less than  off Shouldnt we have been told it was  taco night when the waitress spent  minutes explaining all the specials at the beginning of the meal  Shouldnt it be listed on the specials board  If we wouldve been told we would have tried something else on the menu  Perhaps one of the tortas  I really wish that I never knew that it was  taco night because I left really pissed off

And FYI they charge for chips and salsa  Which I really dont mind  they looked delicious and the portion was generous but thought Id mention it if youre used to complimentary chips and salsa

Good things  waitress (she really was apologetic and obviously given way too many tables to handle) food (I would love to try more on the menu but scared to return and a little pissed off) not a chain

bad things  manager  obviously knew they fed up on our table but never bothered to stop and say anything even though he kept flitting about from table to table but obviously avoiding ours slooooow service
