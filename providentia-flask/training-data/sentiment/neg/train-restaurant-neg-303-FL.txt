Sashimi wasnt cut correctly and all fish had a funny flavor The tuna was pink instead of red We ordered through door dash and if wed been in the restaurant I would have sent it back and requested that we not pay for the meal The wasabi is an odd color and Im not sure what it was made from Im honestly a little worried about food poisoning There are so many better places to eat sushi Seriously Pick somewhere else The price is too high for such low quality
