First I should let everyone one know to check your bank account after eating there they like too give themselves  tips even if you had a horrible waitress They have done it to me twice now Im not sure if they know this but that is against the law Im waiting for them to open today and they will be returning my money to my card ASAP And this time Im reporting this to the police We had horrible service and its my right to leave a small tip for bad service if I want Remember check your bank accounts Never will I eat here with my family again
