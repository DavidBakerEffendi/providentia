I like to stick to positive reviews however with this Dunkin Donuts that will be impossible This is the worst restaurant Ive ever been to The wait is rediculous The people working here are idiots They consistently screw up orders During my first encounter  a stupid teenage manager rolled her eyes and walked away from me when I asked for some help She was to busy working the drivethru and texting on her phone They screwed up my order I just wanted to get it fixed so I could sit back down and eat with my family The older manager tried to smooth things out but she seemed to be ill prepared for her job It looked like the nonexistent owner stuck her with some dumbass lazy rude kids and expected her to pull a miracle out of her butt 

Their drivethru is easily a  minute endeavor  Today when I got to the sign to place my order I was told their latte machine is broken Normally that wouldnt be an issue however it took me  minutes to get to the sign Now I had to wait another  minutes to get out of the drivethru line Aholes 

Later I called to ask for their store number The young kid who answered the phone responded to my question with you want my store number Well no sht Thats what I asked you idiot 

I was so excited when they built the Dunkin Donuts within walking distance from my house Now I cringe every time I drive by If my wife sends me there to get her a coffee  I get angry before I even arrive knowing that something will go wrong Im usually a very positive person but this store is such a freakn mess that I need to scream 

I only told you about two bad incidents I had Ive had more because my dumbass keeps going back That ends today
