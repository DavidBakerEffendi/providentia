I was looking forward to trying this restaurant When I finally had an opportunity to try it with some of my coworkers we were very disappointed with this place The customer service was good but very chaotic Our order was taken by one person then another served our drinks and yet another took payment for the orders Once the food was brought out it was clear this place is an absolute joke The server stated to us that  we added some extra tenders on the plate for you they are a bit small Small is an absolute understatement These tenders were very thin and the coating had absolutely no flavoring whatsoever The gravy that accompanies the tenders also lacked in flavor and tasted more like something that was in a can and reheated The fries I had ordered as a side were pathetic soggy and completely over salted Perhaps the tenders lacked in flavor because they seemed to have used all the salt on the fries After we had all managed to eat or food one of the employees politely asked if we were done with our trays and offered to dispose of our trash to which we said yes Before the employee picked up our trays he asked if we knew the  story of the restaurant We replied no He began to tell us the story The short version is that they were voted  chicken place in Texas and had beat out rival Raising Canes At the end of the employees story he said  Thats why we built this location across the street from Raising Canes so we can put them out of business Well from my experience I am going to say that this place will undoubtedly be out of business long be for Raising Canes I will likely never return to this restaurant due to the pathetic overpriced food and the even more pathetic mentality that they are the superior chicken restaurant
