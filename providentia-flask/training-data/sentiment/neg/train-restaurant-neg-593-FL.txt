Consistently terrible service (even for a Dennys) at this location I hadnt been for years because I have always had such awful service here but after a winning streak at several surrounding Dennys I thought Id give the bad Dennys a try again

Bad mistake We left before even ordering food and I wont be back again Went across the street to Olive Garden which really knows how to elevate mediocre food with excellent service

If you hate food enjoy depressing scenes of humanity and waiting endlessly for service that doesnt arrive this is the Dennys of your dreams

All snotty snark aside the server was very genuinely apologetic for the bad service I actually felt bad for her Just not bad enough to waste sixty dollars on awful food

Nice try Dennys
