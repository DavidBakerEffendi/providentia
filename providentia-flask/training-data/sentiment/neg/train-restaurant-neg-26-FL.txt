Meh just really meh my sandwich was greasy and my girlfriend didnt think her sandwich was very good either The staff is the only reason this place gets two stars Over the top nice however we ordered two sandwiches and a side salad to go and it took  min to get our food The when we got home we enjoyed finding out instead of a salad they gave us over salted chips I see them trying to be hip and different but you need the food to be tasty as well Disappointing first try hope they figure it out
