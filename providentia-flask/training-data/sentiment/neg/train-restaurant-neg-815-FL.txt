I was not impressed with this place  The salsa was horrible  Bland  Tasteless  Watery  Like tomato sauceor juice  Food was nothing special either  Even the margaritas left a lot to be desired  Service was a little on the slow side and their patio is depressing  Im not sure why so many people like this place  There are way better Mexican restaurants out there  We wont be back
