Dont waste your time or money if you are actually looking to practice your swing   You cant use any drivers woods or hybrid irons unless you are in the bottom floor However you can use their drivers woods etc on any floor When we inquired as to the reason we received some unclear confusing response Apparently the nets can be damaged if you hit from a nd or rd floor vs the st floor Obviously people generate more club head speed which in turn causes the ball to travel faster when you are  feet or  feet higher than the ground floor (sarcasm)

This place is more like a version of dave and busters mixed with hooters The process to even get to the point of hitting a ball is ridiculous Stand in line for a membership (cost money) then go to the concierge and get assigned to a bay then work through a computer system to get the balls to eventually dispense

We asked for a refund and received some push back in the form of attitude from Christopher K He then tried to only refund us for the time we purchased for hitting balls instead of the whole purchase of membership fees and play time  During this time he made snide remarks to other employees about my family and I  I didnt realize that asking for a refund after being mislead about a product or service constituted the added need of being a jerk Great way to ensure people never come back and put the word out to avoid this business
