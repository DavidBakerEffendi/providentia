I finally tried cassanova bros today Had to see what all fuss was about Now im not from New York but ive visited many times and eaten there and nor am i a ridiculous pizza snob so with that being saidI got two cheese slices for about    The service was good and prompt so no complaints there  The pizza i got litteraly tasted like frozen pizza There is no way in hell anybody can convince me that this is even remotely close to new york pizza There was absolutely NOTHING special about it It was very disappointing I had heard that the cheese was incredible but it wasnt This is  like the th place on yelp ive tried because of GREAT yelp reviews and ive come to the conclusion that people get hyped up for anything Honestly no joke Venezias is way better and tastier I even prefer a costco pizza over this place  AWFUL and never again will i eat there Waste of time and money Order dominos and do yourself a favor
