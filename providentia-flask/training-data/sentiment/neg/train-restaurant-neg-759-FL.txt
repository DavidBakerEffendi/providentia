I love Chipotle I can eat it everyday if I could Ive been going to this location pretty much since I moved into my house and their service and quality of food have gotten worse 

Last time I was here I wanted guacamole in my bowl They were out of it I simply asked if they meant for now or theyre going to make more for the entire evening The girl looked at me like I was crazy and didnt understand what I meant because I had to repeat myself three times I came back today to get a bowl for myself and a steak burrito for boyfriend After they did the burrito as they came to my bowl they were out of both steak and white rice I told them I dont even want it then 

Note to chipotle order make enough food to last you the entire day Half the line behind me walked out Distance doesnt matter at this point because I wont be back to waste my time if they dont even have half the items I want in my bowl
