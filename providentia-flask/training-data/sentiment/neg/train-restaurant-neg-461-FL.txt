I ordered  large pizzas because they have a great deal going My boyfriend and I eat pizza about once a week Id like to think Im a connoisseur of pizza Decided to order Dominos for something different Pizza was doughy almost raw Nasty tasting sauce and no flavor Took a big bite and spit it out Ive never done that with pizza before My boyfriend tried to put ranch and hot sauce to make his taste better Honestly was the worst pizza weve ever had I immediately called the manager back He kindly asked if I wanted something else We decided on an order of hot wings Italian sandwich and a Philly I was a bit reluctant to try anything else The wings and sandwiches were alright So this dominos can make mediocre sandwiches wings but horrible pizza hmmm I was pleased with the manager and his attempt to make things right This is the only reason for giving two stars Will I order from them again NO
