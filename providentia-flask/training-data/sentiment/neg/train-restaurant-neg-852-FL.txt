Mediocre food terrible service We went to the restaurant expecting a wait since we were a party of  and it was a Saturday night The hostess told us that it would be a  minute wait which we had no problem with  minutes later she came to tell us that the only way they could seat us was to split us into two parties of four We asked to have the two empty tables in the bar pushed together instead and they agreed It was another  minutes before someone came to take our order and we never had a consistent server To top off the evening they forgot to put in one of the food ordersThe server did apologize comp that particular order and bring a free ice cream When our food did finally arrive it was okay  not bad but not good enough to justify a two hour wait At no point did a manager stop by to check in or apologize for the lack of service and forgotten order We will not be visiting this restaurant again
