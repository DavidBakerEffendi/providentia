This is one of my boyfriends favorite restaurants and Ive tried to like it too  Sadly Ive had too few good experiences to want to return  Last visit was Friday evening after a baseball game  We arrived a little before pm on Friday  I worked as a server  Good restaurants are hoping on a Friday so dont expect to be cut from the floor before pm  Apparently the restaurant wasnt as busy so the servers cut themselves  We were sat as soon as we walked in (good sign) server took our drink order right away( another good sign) drinks were dropped off right away (still good) and then our server disappeared   minutes later after numerous times turning around to look at the host stand and to try to spot my server still no order taken  In the meantime he was sat three more times  Great this means he will be taking all of our orders at once submitting and serving  So we can now expect a  min wait for food (by this time we are sitting  mins)  He finally takes the order and the other tables and we wait  When dinner arrives it seems like they got my order correct  They didnt  I order a meatless tamale and received one with shredded chicken  I had hoped to tell my server (he stopped by once after dinner was served prior to my finding the mistake and we told him things looked good)  We didnt see him again until after he finished rolling his silverware (he walked past us with it) and by then I didnt want to waste anymore time there   We told him it was fine and asked for the check  Busser had removed my plate so the evidence was gone  He was friendly enough just not attentive enough for me at pm on a Friday   There are too many other choices for Mexican food to keep going  back  

We were seated close to computer so the servers were all chatting which is how I know some of them cut themselves off the floor
