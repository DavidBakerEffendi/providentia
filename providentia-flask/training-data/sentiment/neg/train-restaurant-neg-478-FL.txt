Blah that pretty much says it all  Mediocre at best  Theres just nothing to say about it  I got the butter noodles  Well they were cooked right not to much not to little but barely warm  They werent busy and the food came out in a reasonable time so why was it boarder line cold  My husband had buffalo chicken Mac and cheese Mac and cheese with chicken and than they doused it in some kind of nasty hot sauce over everythingnot just chicken with buffalo sauce on it but they drowned the whole bowl in it  Yuck It didnt even look good  Oh and it was barely warm too
