We had a horrible experience The food was flavorless and over priced The staff was rude with no personality 

I was unaware the dish I ordered chili rellano included nuts After explaining that I was allergic to nuts our server said ok and asked if I wanted it boxed up Of course I did not need it boxed up since I could not eat it 

I did not want to wait for another dish since everything was made to order Especially since my husband received his food first and he was finished eating by the time my food came out 

When our bill came the chili rellano was still included We questioned the server He told me he was sorry I was allergic to nuts Since we were charged for the entree I ended up taking a flavorless cheese chili rellano to go The two bites were a complete waste of calories and it ended up in the garbage  

We were really hoping for a quality restaurant since we live around the block
