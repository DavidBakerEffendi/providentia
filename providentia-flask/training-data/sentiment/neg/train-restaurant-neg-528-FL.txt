I dont usually review chain restaurants because their food all tastes the same (at least it should) but my experience at this El Pollo Loco has been horrible Every time I have gone to this location the food has been good (or as expected) but the service is horrible So bad that each time I leave I ask myself why I go back I like El Pollo Locos food and this one is close to my house I just have never had a pleasant experience at this location Either they get my order wrong dont have what I want to order or their service is horrible This time I went the cashier trashed me behind my back in Spanish What kind of service is that
