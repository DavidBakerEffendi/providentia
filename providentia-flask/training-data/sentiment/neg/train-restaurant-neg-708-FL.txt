We are giving it a shot We are hungry for fish and Petes Fish and Chips is not open on Sunday Weird that the building is  Taco Bell and  Long John Silvers The menu is combined and everything comes out of the same kitchen The fish shrimp and hush puppies were okay but the fries were awful limp  old The main issue was the girl taking our order No personality she failed to smile or react in any way unfamiliar with the menu and television specials being offered The Customer Service experience was horrible Ill not be going back
