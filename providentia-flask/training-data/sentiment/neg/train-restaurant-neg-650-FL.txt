This place needs more and better hired help Been here over  minutes to get a combo that they argued I need to specify I wanted to come with coffee that it is supposed to come with One  lady working orders and no one filling them The line is out the door and they move slow as molasses I will stick with my usual DD on Power Rd Rittenhouse Way more organized and they get my daily orders right

Oh and the more disgusting thing was the lady prepping food with the same vinyl glove she counted money and change with wiped her gloved hands on the clothes and face threw trash away and since I was there so long I got to see her serve donuts and stock with the same dirty glove on the whole time Yuck
