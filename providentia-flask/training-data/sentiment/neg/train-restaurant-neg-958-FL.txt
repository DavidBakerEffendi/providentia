Food is over priced for what is being served I got a BBQ chicken salad that was  lacked flavor everything is served in plastic and baskets lined in tin foil very carnival food looking Got my kid a plain hotdog  over charred he spit it out the special was a pork tenderloin sandwich which had no seasoning to their batter wife did not finish it To top it off cashier girls were snooty and one went out of her way to let me know that I placed my empty tray in the wrong spot If you enjoy sitting on old park benches on the dirt and paying  for Mediocre food have at it
