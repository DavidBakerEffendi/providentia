Im only giving it a two because of the food mostly Our waitress wasnt too bad but the owners should at least hire more waiters Many customers ended up waiting  minutes and the waitress took a while to come to our table even the other waitress for other tables We ordered Salmon roll(was Very warm bland and smelled bad) tuna rolls (was warm bland and also smelled bad) spicy tuna was actually very good and was cold like it was supposed to be and the Alaskan roll Without Scallions is decent The Las Vegas Roll was bland and more cream cheese than anything else The Sapporo and blue moon beers on tap were the other things with flavor And the pickled ginger was warm and tasted like rotten fish There is better options out there and they overcharge for sushi thats not worth it Sad to say I wont come back here again
