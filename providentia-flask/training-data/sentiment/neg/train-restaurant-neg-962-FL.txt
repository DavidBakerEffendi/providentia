My family and I came in at  after a baseball game It is Lent so we decided to have cheese pizza The cashiermanager was very rude and complained that he had to make all  pizzas by hand They had no pizzas ready and he made it very clear that he DID NOT want to accommodate us He told us it would be at least  minutes He was visibly frustrated and annoyed that we agreed to wait He went to his coworker and started the pizzas Then he would glance back at us as if he was talking crap As we were waiting another group came into the store and he chased them away One wanted breadsticks and he told them no you dont want thosethey have been there all day When we got home our breadsticks were undercooked The marinara sauce was given to us cold as well We went back to the store and he complained AGAIN that it would take  minutes to make new breadsticks and said the store was closed It was  NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS STORE
