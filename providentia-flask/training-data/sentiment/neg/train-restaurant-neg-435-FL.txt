I was really hungry for lunch and craving hummustoo bad that I wasnt able to eat here because  I was completely ignored by the hostesscashier  I wanted to place an order to go stood looking at the menu put it down waited and waited and then she walked by and gave me a dirty look WTF  So I walked out  

Plus the hummus with grilled chicken appetizer is now over  when it used to be about I understand inflation but the timing seems off   Take your money someplace else  In the same shopping center is Filibertos and CK Chinese Gourmet both of which will actually serve you when youre hungry and ready to order
