Dear Nando I am very disappointed today after visiting this restaurant I have been out of the country for a year and decided I needed to get my Nandos fix I used to love this place but now I do not know if I will ever return The service was terrible First the hostess did not know where to seat us I was confused and she walked us around just as confused until finally deciding on where to put us Then as we waited for our server we got our chips and salsa from the bus boy Then we waitedand waitedand waited Finally we were asked if we would like anything to drink I was on the verge of walking out of the restaurant up to that point I wish I had After receiving our drink I noticed the server had sat down at a booth to have a conversation with a customer It appeared he knew him  I have to admit that my meal was good but my wife ordered a chimichanga that was for some reason watery My waiter promptly refilled my soda but at no point did he ever introduce himself or ask us if everything was alright I felt as if he just wanted us out of there Then we waited for our billand waitedand waited Finally it arrived and I was so happy to pay because I just wanted to get our of there Now I sit here wondering if I will ever go back Perhaps if I do I will try the other location I was told that the waiter was training someone but I never saw him interacting with another person as if he was training them He didnt even offer that as an excuse for his poor performance Either way I was sad to see one of my favorite establishments reduced to a place that I do not even want to visit again So Nando I hope that you can get this right If I ever do return you have a lot of work to convince me to add this establishment to my favorites list again I hope you can do it because if you do not then you will surely see business leaving for another place that services their customers with a smile and a greeting A place that shows it cares A place that shows that we are welcome
