Sorry family butNandos is Nada   An extreme exercise of the gluttonous Gilbert Arizona restaurant fest  Same typical timeline after fighting for a spot in an overfilled parking lot push through the huge crowd standing (hardly enough seats) in the hot lobby to hear that it will take  minutes to be seated (after it takes them  minutes to figure that out) then try to stay awake while sitting among people staring at the wall and kids running around  Finally get seated and given cavernous Diet Cokes (standard) and chips (which you eat the whole bottomless basket of since you are waiting so long)   The waitress looks busy as hell and takes another  minutes to take our order meanwhile I drink  diet cokes  Already having comsumed enough calories for  people the main meal arrives  my fish tacos are  mini strips of tough fish laid in lessthanfresh tortillas with  of the rest of the plates filled with cheese beans and rice  I have had better Mexican at holeinthe wall joints at am   This time we ordered the fried ice cream for dessert one order of which was big enough to feed the entire table   As the night went on I glanced around and noticed that the average BMI in the place was around    I would be the same if I did this place even once a week
