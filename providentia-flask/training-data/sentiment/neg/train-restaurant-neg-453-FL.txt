This was my first experience with Casa Reys and my last  I usually stroll down to the food truck lineup by the Capitol on Fridays just to get out of the office  occasionally to eat if I forget my lunch which was my misfortune today  Reys menu looked alright and was reasonably priced I thought

I ordered the Charro Completo specialty burro  advertised on their menu for  (this detail is important)  I handed the man (if it was Rey hes an idiot and if it wasnt Rey hires idiots  bad news either way) a  and he said   I asked if there was tax because the menu said   He said No it doesnt  My screen an iPad says   I again explained to him that the MENU said   I had to turn my head just slightly to confirm  I invited him out of the truck to take a look for himself  His silence indicated his refusal of my offer

Then he hands me  in change (again Rey or his staff member is an idiot)  I have more pressing things to quibble about than   The poor rating has more to do with the mess of a burrito I ultimately choked down (I would compare the quality to Filibertos but that would be unfair to Filibertos) than the  and utter refusal to even acknowledge a mistake or apologize
