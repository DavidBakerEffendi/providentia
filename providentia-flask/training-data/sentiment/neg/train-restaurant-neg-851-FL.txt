Food was delicious Service beyond subpar We waited over an hour for food on a Thursday afternoon only to be told by the server that our ticket was never even put in Did not give us anything to compensate for our time spent waiting for food Charged me  for a small side kids quesadilla Complained and the manager would only lower it to the kids meal price I didnt even order a kids meal because I knew my son wouldnt finish the whole thing and I didnt want to spend extra money I simply wanted a small side cheese quesadilla Very disappointed with the customer service
