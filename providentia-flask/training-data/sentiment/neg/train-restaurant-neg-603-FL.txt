I ordered a mushroom burger with bacon for takeout  When I got home the bacon was missing but I was charged for it on the receipt  When I called to let them know I was told the next burger would be on the house  A few days later I placed another takeout order for my free burger plus wings and an appetizer  Rather than comp my burger they compd my appetizer which was  cheaper  It was a total BAIT  SWITCH

Also when I placed the order I asked if I can get  different flavors on the  count wings to which they said yes  Instead of charging me for  wings they charged me for two  count wings which is more expensive  Who does this  Normally I would let something like this slide but when added to the bait  switch they pulled on me for the burger this was extremely annoying  

Im giving  stars because the food is okay (not great just okay)  Otherwise wouldve only given  star  I will not be returning
