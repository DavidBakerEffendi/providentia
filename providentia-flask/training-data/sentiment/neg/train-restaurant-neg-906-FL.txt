I have to say Im really confused by all of these great reviews This place was not good The pizza was mostly crust with almost no sauce What sauce there was had no taste It was so bland we couldnt believe it A lot of people were mentioning the meatball sub so my wife and I tried that too If those meatballs werent frozen store bought I would be shocked They were honestly some of the worst meatballs Ive ever had And again there was almost no sauce on it and what was on it was bland as could be We both agreed that we wont be coming here again If you want actual good pizza go to Vitos or Spinatos
