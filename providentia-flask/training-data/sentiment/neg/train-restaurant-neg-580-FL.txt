So after a long long time I decided to give this Dennys a second chance BAD IDEA The is is THE WORST Dennys in Arizona right across the highway from the worst Jimmy Johns in Arizona  The service is very bad and the food is inedible Dennys should fire the manager of this location immediately and clean house I love going to Dennys in Tempe and Scottsdale Why does this location have to be so awful
