We chose to drive through the DQ on our way home for a tasty treat Well with the size of vehicles in front of us our vehicle was about  feet back from where the intercom was to order However the DQ employee took us for idiots We just didnt want to yell Sir we cant hear you the guy says to us So this frustrated us They didnt say sorry even when we got to the window and tried to explain she looked at us dumbfounded I never ever expect  star (yelp  star) service from these franchises that employ high school students for minimum wage So as I write this I know I will be back one day but I would hope I can give you guys a better rating because the employees will be more cheerful and understanding One could hope but I do love my strawberry chocolate dip blizzard So slap a smile on your face for  you are earning cause the happy customers will come back and youll get good reviews Oh and my blizzard was definitely not the frozen treat you can turn up side down she didnt even do it we were given our blizzards in a paper bag Yeah I know AZ weather sucks
