Dont order online I made the mistake thinking it would save me time but I showed up when at the pickup time it showed online which was about  mins from the time of order and then sat over  mins longer in the dinning area because it seemed no one had even started on my order If I hadnt of paid online I wouldve walked out And then when I spoke to the manager on the phone after I left she just told me she would address it with the staff and was not very apologetic at all Ive enjoyed driving through this place many times but I wont be fooled again
