OK the vibe at this place is pretty cool They have done a fantastic job of creating an outside dining space However the organization leaves a lot to be desired We waited in a looooong line One one person taking orders reallythey even have two windows In addition to the long line the two people in front of us kept welcoming their friends into line with them  all eight of them Wait time in line   minutes Now interacting with the staff there was pleasant so I do not want to take anything away from them it really is just the organization that needs work 

If you are hoping to find something healthy you are going to have limited choices Pretty much fried everything and some salads The food gets three stars but the items above and the cost take it down to two All in all an interesting experience that is worth the trip just needs some tweaking to get them across the finish line
