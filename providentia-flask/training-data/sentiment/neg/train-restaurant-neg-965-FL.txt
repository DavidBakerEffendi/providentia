This location is a major disappointment Today they forgot my order of cheesy fiesta potatoes didnt provide napkins and sloppily prepared the rest of my order The staff employee at this location was also very rude when the mistake was brought to her attention No apology whatsoever The location on Val Vista and Baseline is worth the few extra minutes of travel time because they take orders accurately are friendly and their food tastes better
