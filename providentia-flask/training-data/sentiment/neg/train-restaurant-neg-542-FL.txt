I just discovered this place a few weeks ago and loved it But I just went today and my chicken fingers needed salt  The lady at the drive through with pink hair was extremely rude  She was speaking to quietly and I dont her I couldnt hear You could hear in her voice that she was annoyed  I told her I just wanted chicken fingers anf she automatically said we dont do that  But the sign said  per chicken finger So I told her and she said how many then and it doesnt come with any sauce I said no thank you and a large sweet tea  She was telling me to pull up and I said did you happen to get my sweet tea You can hear her sigh and say so you want sweet tea Small or large  Of course I wanted sweet tea why would I ask for it When I pulled up she wouldnt even look at me Then she practically threw my food at me Which was bland a gross She didnt even say have a good day or thank you Idk who ever is the manager you need to retrain the chick with pink curly hair  If she doesnt like her job (thats how she acted)  maybe she should just quit  She was working on  at  something am I give it  stars because I like the tea
