I am so disappointed  Ive been here many times and have previously left great reviews but my recent order was a big let down

I placed a Yelp order to go for pick up and ordered my usual Sauce favorite the Chicken Caesar Salad Pizza on hand tossed crust  I also ordered caprese bruschetta  While I didnt take a picture of the bruschetta it was made so sloppily  I was surprised by the presentation but it still tasted delicious  

However the pizzasalad is basically inedible  This isnt the usual quality of food I have come to expect from Sauce  Ive ordered this menu item a dozen times at least over the years  But this time the lettuce is brown and wilted and there is an excess of dressing making it goopy and inedible  Im so bummed  Sauce how did this pass your usual flawless quality control  Thats what I love about Sauce its been consistently good food dont fail us now
