I wanted to give this place  stars SoI will give it another try one day 

First we walked in and we were greeted by no one Literallynot one person said anything Multiple people made eye contact Finally an older women (thinking the owner) came out and sat us 

The waiter was very nice and helpful 

We enjoyed our soup and my wife said the sushi was not the best she had ever had 

NOWMy foodI started eating my chicken and it seemed a little weird I spit it out and it was raw all of it was still raw I sent it back and waited for another  mins At this point everyone had finished eating They brought it back outand it was still RAW At this point I was done They brought it out again and I just boxed it up 

The flavor and all was good Just not the experience Kind of crazy that they did not offer any compensation I am not want to want free things but raw chicken is kind of serious The woman (ownermanager) was very nice but not once did she apologize or even acknowledge what happened 

Again food tasted good Sushi was ok Will definitely give them another trymaybepossibly
