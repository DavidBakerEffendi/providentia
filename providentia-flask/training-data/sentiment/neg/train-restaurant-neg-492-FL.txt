Not recommended at all Ive been here twice and tried two different dishes and both were absent of good flavor The second time I visited my meal came with a little something extra included As I reached the bottom of my bowl of pesto pasta I found plastic shrink wrap mixed in Needless to say I did not finish the rest Its just disappointing that I already finished  of the meal before I found my prize I for one will not be coming back Take this review for what its worth from the opinion of one guy Like I always tell myself give any place at least one chance to decide for yourself
