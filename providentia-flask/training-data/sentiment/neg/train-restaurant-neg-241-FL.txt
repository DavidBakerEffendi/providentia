Food is excellent  My low rating is for the poor customer service  I was getting something to go and stood by the st register for at least  min  No acknowledgement from any staff  The girl at the nd register was taking someones payment and when they were finished I walked over to her and asked if I was supposed to order at st register  She replied Its closed  There was no sign to state that  She was not rude but not pleasant either  My order came out pretty quickly and it was correct  But I never go back to a place that has poor customer service
