Each time we come here seems like the food  service gets worse and the prices increase
The menu and prices say we are an above average Mexican restaurant but the food says we are a fly by night taco shop
The tacos on the menu are fancy and expensive without the taste of fancy and expensive  Many other menu items are similar
Overall we do not care of Cantina Laredo and do not understand how they have made it all these years

Sorry for the bad review but just being honest
