Service is going downhill  usually feel very rushed by servers and the check shows up despite wanting another couple cocktails You need to show up early for happy hour because they wont honor happy hour prices u less you sit at the bar (if its full  too bad)  New serve Jose seemed very green to the food service industry and came across as rude and disinterested Sunday brunch can be a good value if you get the right server  otherwise Id venture elsewhere
