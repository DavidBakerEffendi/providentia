First time to eat here Stopped for lunch ordered Chicken Fingers with fries and a small side order of onion rings Every chicken finger was stringy and fatty a little undercooked Onion rings were greasy and fell apart Worst lunch I have eaten out in a long time My friend that I met there had made the suggestion to go there I asked him if he had ever eaten there before and he said it was his first time to eat there Next time I will make the suggestion to go elsewhere Maybe other items on the menu are good or maybe it is just a good place for drinking but I will not be back
