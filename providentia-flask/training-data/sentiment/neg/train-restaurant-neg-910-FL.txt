I used to love this place when I had a place just down the street a few years ago
Recently called to order a medium Sicilian (twenty five dollars by the way)
Both the toppings  the extra cheese we paid for were light to unrecognizable on the pie  the pizza was not as good as I remember (couldnt say exactly why just disappointed)  But the biggest turn off was the new help  The gal on the phone when ordering seemed impatient  confused (high) this was at pm on a weekday by the way  When entering I was immediately disgusted by what I assume was the same lady resembling something from a nightmare before christmas or a kiss concert scary  And her bad attitude when I presented my god forbid American Express Card was unwarranted but not surprising at that point  Needless to say no gratuity was given  I do not believe that we will be going back
