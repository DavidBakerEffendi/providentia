Meh I would say the service and the food were equally average Yup let us now We were expecting stellar food and service with foreign a half star reviews however that was not our experience at all The host presented us with menus and water and hung around so I assumed he was our waiter and began to order and then he let us know that he was not our waiter so I apologized He came back a few minutes later and said he would be our waiter I was confused but OK About  to  minutes later our food came out but no silverware We requested it from our makeshift waiter Three of us stoned I ordered the California eggs Benedict and they forgot the avocado smoked pep Rica or whatever the seasoning is overthetop as this picture When I brought it to my waiters attention requesting the avocado he said he should sure we could probably forgot it and came back with avocado We also ordered corn beef hash which boasts of fresh corned Beef however it was quite lackluster and very dry Whats the name Crowned Egg you would expect the egg game to be on point play after our meals were brought out the waiter delivered another egg over easy as requested because the chef messed up with the egg that was served with the meal Quite a few blunders The restaurant was very drab and had no decor I felt like I was at a soft opening of a restaurant thats meant only for family and friends because of all of the errors and that three of the six on staff working on the curtain hanging from PVC rod that looked like it was being made into a backdrop for a quincinera in the corner of the dining room Zero ambience as there is no music no decor and no television I would compare the food to a condensed knockoff version of Waffle House
