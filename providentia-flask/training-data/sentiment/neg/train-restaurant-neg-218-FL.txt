Hmm not good  No response just a blank stare when I finally made it to the orderregister after waiting behind some giggly folks that were pointing and talking about the pastries while not really in line  Should have another way to view the display case so people can browse and not disrupt the flow  Upon final discovery that the order girl was not deaf mute I placed an order for french toast  What I recd was certainly different  It is made like a monkey bread casserole with globs of korintje cinnamon and maybe an egg or two somewhere in the batter  Far too sweet and oily in some way not butter but did not taste lardbased either  Unable to eat all of it disappointing  The dining attendant was personable and had a great smile that was nice
