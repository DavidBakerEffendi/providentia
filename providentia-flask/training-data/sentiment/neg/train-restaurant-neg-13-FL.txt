Not sure what they hype is all about My husband and I went here for lunch today and it wasnt anything to write home about We upgraded for Mac n cheese and tots Mac n cheese had NO flavor Tots came not seasoned and with a sauce that was curdled and just looked unappetizing Service was soso Not rude just didnt pay much attention We probably wont be back To many other places with much better food in downtown Gilbert The atmosphere was cool though thats a plus
