I just took my parents to Nandos because I had gone to the location in Chandler and had great service and food Unfortunately this was definitely not the case at this location We ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer all of the food ended up coming out at the same time We asked for them to take back the cheese crisp because it would have gotten cold I am vegan and ordered a guacamole taco and black beans without cheese and my meal came out smothered in cheese They did bring it back out quickly and the food was decent I was told that through my work I get a discount and I received that discount when I went to the Chandler location The manager came out and gave me a round about story about the programs they offer and that isnt one of them but she will check into it The cheese crisp stayed on our table the entire time even though they said they would take it back We still got charged for it and all of the employees we encountered had terrible customer service I definitely wont be back to find out if they offer the discount
