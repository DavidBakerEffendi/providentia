We tried this place twice and hated it The prices are ridiculous and there was no meat in the sandwich I hated the cheese and the meat was fatty I have been to Philly  and an original cheesesteak and this is not even close I thought Capriottis was great compared to this place but it went a little down hill they use less meat and its dry If you want a great Philly go to Mikes burgers and cheesesteaks
