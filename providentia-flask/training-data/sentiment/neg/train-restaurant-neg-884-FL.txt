Sorrynot a fan of this place Went here with my family of four on a whim the reviews were decent I got a Philly sandwich which was the most bland flavorless luke warm sandwich I have ever had It was not good the peppers and onions were cooked until they were mush no flavor The steak was bland and dry I didnt even finish it it was that bad My kids opted for a pasta plate of spaghetti and meatballs they were decent the kids liked it My husband got some chicken marsala dinner which was nothing more than dried up chicken with canned mushrooms on top The juices in the chicken marsala were watery and just unappetizing to look at The serve was meh we had three different people serve us Some one took our order another brought our drinks then the last one brought our food Never did any of these three servers refill our drinks ask if everything was as expected or offered any extension of service I was highly disappointed as this is a moderately priced eatery The inside decor is nice in a cheesy opulent way but not impressed to spend my money here again My husband and I sincerely love to support local business but unfortunately this is not a repeat for us
