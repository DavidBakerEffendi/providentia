I wish I could give this place a better review Perhaps it was because I had just spent two weeks in Italy So the comparison was too fresh in my mind    Maybe the dairy products are better over there Ive been to Frost  times wanting to like it  It is convenient to get to   But I just dont see the value So far I have tried the Stracciatella Pistachio and the Hazelnut Each time comparing against what I had over there Each time disappointed

Given the convenience I would probably  give it a try again if they would change the policy on the small cup and allow putting more than  flavor in it  Each time I was there I asked to put  flavors in the small cup All three times I was told NO  What ever happened to the customer is always right

The value  Almost  for the small cup   In Italy I paid  Euro for a single scoop small cup     I could get  scoop  flavors for less than
