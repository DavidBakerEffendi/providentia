Super Gross I stopped here for lunch today and found a lovely surprise in my Black Bean Chicken Bowl

 RANDOM PILLS 

They had been cooked with either the broccoli or rice (a black bean substitute) and had started to disintegrate so I couldnt tell what they where

The GM wasnt there but they gave me my money back Lucky I didnt eat any God knows how many other people where served ricebroccoli from the same batch Ugh
