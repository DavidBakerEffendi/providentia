We visited this location today I wanted LJS  my wife wanted Taco Bell As soon as we walked in we noticed a large number of people standing around Another customer approached us and said that we may want to go elsewhere  it was taking  minutes to get  food orders out because they were understaffed We went across the road to Popeyes  where they seem to value customers The manager at this Taco BellLong John Silvers should be talked to
