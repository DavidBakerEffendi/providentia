This place is not for me For being a higher end Mexican food place this place is average at best Appetizers leave you disappointed and the entrees are ok but doesnt wow me I dont mind paying the higher price of the food matches it In my opinion the food at some burros is a better quality and better tasting then here I can tell you that I am disappointed There is so much potential here but the food doesnt cut it You could tell that I am not the only one On a Sunday most places are hard to get into for lunch This place was only a quarter full and it still took  min to get a table I believe if the food changed this place would be unstoppable Until then I cant come back
