Service here was terrible We are a party of   celebrating a birthday and our waitress couldnt even offer us a glass of water until we flagged her down and asked for drinks and sushi menus I mean this is a sushi place right Negative experience the customer service was uncomfortable from the start Wont recommend this place to anyone nor will I be back here
