So disappointed With the various other chicken options in the area I was expecting more from this place The chicken tenders were dry and rubbery the gravy tasted like plastic and the fries were soggy Couldnt finish my meal The only redeeming part of the experience was the sweet roll and the car side customer service Better off going somewhere else
