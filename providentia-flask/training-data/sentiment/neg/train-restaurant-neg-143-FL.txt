Review of the Impossible Burger First of all nobody here mentions how the burger costs  That alone is extreme and unwarranted This is not a  star gourmet restaurant its a whole in the wall in the back of a nearly abandoned rundown business complex I was simply shocked by the pricing when I finally found the place and looked at menu

As to the burger itself No exaggeration it was the worst tasting burger Ive ever had My lunch accomplice agreed It had absolutely zero flavor outside of peanut butter and jelly I basically paid  for a pbj sandwich with a hard tortilla chip on it Wow

They significantly overcooked the Impossible patty It does not need to be well done The bread was not flavorful I though it was going to be Asian style like the other reviews No Not at all Its a peanut butter jelly sandwich with a wonton  tortilla chip cucumber and vegan meat Thats it

I am disappointed beyond belief at the price  paid for how unappealing the meal was

Lastly the sweet potato fries were terrible They were so undercooked that it was like eating a raw potato Very greasy and too little salt How can you mess up fries Just cook them like they are supposed to be

I would never return here for any reason as the next best item on the menu was the Beyond Meat burger which listed at  I can go to Natural Grocers right down the street and get a  pack of these exact patties for  and make it taste delicious

I think most Yelpers leaving these  and  star reviews are the kind of people who literally cannot cook any meal besides a frozen dinner and therefore they automatically rate nearly every restaurant highly As someone who is an excellent selftaught chef and been vegan and vegetarian at periods of my life this restaurant truly does not deserve the ratings it has on here

I do not understand why so many Arizona restaurants think they can charge nearly  for a single casual sandwich  tacos plate  other basic meal when they dont even have real chefs in the back preparing their food

If you want an actually delicious Impossible Burger Thirsty Lion at Tempe Marketplace is still King and does it right like a burger should be done I recommend you go there if you want something that had flavor and costs less ()

Good luck to this vegan restaurant The owners should go to LA and take some notes on how great tasting vegan food is done
