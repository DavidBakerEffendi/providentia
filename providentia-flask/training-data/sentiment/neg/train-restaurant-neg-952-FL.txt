Two of us spent  for dinner and we got a hamburger and a fish special The food was only mediocre It turns out that the hamburger is cooked to rare Apparently the menu says that but I didnt see it The hamburger was red and slimy inside I cant imagine how it passed the Health Department regulations for temperature The fried Zucchini was not crisp The shrimp were actually too big and just uninspired  The fries were not tasty I like the McDonalds or Burger King fries a lot better Having said the above we did like the cod and the cole slaw Needless to say we were unimpressed and will not be back
