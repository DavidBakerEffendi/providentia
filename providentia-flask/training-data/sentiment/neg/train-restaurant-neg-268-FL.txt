I am so sad about this Kneaders location Food was great as always but the restaurant is disgusting  Tables werent cleaned and stuff on the floor I was there for  min and not one employee came out and cleaned tables The place was empty so there was no excuse  The sliced limes in the Container at the beverage station will probably make someone sick The limes were all brown and gross 
The kids working there need to work and quit playing around at the counter when they have no customers Management needs to take control or they are going to lose business I wont be back There is a Kneaders going in by my house and hopefully they will be better
The  stars are for the food only
