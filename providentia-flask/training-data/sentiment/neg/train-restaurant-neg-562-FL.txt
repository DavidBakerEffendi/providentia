Well mama had a birthday  She wanted to get her birthday Slam so here we are

I will rate my food (since I didnt try hers but I am on record previously not liking the Slam)  I got a simple burger  It was one of their specialty burgers but still a burger  And fries  Nothing too adventurous

The food took a while to come out  It was sufficiently hot so Ill assume the made it after we ordered  Which is good  The fries were fine  Nothing special but fine  The burger was OK  Honestly I didnt really taste the difference between this and a normal burger  And for some reason it was determined to fall apart on me every time I picked it up

My wife ordered a bowl of soup which wasnt as big as she expected nor as flavorful  Im not rating this just passing on the feedback

Then when we wanted to purchase gift cards because they had a special bonus going (and we could use them to pay for this mealnot the bonus cards just the gift cards) they didnt have any  Thats right  They advertised this bonus gift card special and then they had NO GIFT CARDS  Thats just sad

Service was friendly but often MIA (missing in action)

All in all mediocre  Id say dont bother unless you want a Slam on your birthday or youre desperate
