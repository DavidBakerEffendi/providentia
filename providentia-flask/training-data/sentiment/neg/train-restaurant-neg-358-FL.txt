This place gets worse and worse every time I come here First off they didnt have avocados to make table side gauc Then I ordered chicken nachos and the chicken was rubbery I had to spit it out Also the restaurant is dirty They arent even trying anymore I would only come here bc it is down the street from my house but I guess Ill have to go to downtown Gilbert if I want a similar restaurant environment
