Service was fast and friendly at the door ordering is confusing because you dont know if you order at the table or the counter ordered a corned beef sandwich corned beef not a high quality meat here and not much meat on the sandwich

Restaurant is comfortable and inviting but the food quality has to be better

nd chance Maybe but I cant recommend the corned beef sandwich
