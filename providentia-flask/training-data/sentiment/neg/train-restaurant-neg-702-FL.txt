I was very upset at this location It was my birthday and all I really wanted was an awesome bowl of fresh made ice cream As my girlfriend and I are getting ready to park this car comes speeding right past in front of us to park in the handicap spot Ok so I thought that was just a rude drivernope a group what we thought were teenagers jumping out of the car They proceeded to walk into the ice cream shop As my girlfriend and I walk in these teenagers turn out to be employees because there they were behind the counterI was pissed Not only are their employees parking in the handicap spot but they also almost hit us while we had the right of way I really hope this was an anomaly but needless to say we turned around and walked right out Now dont get me wrong the ice cream there is great but the unprofessional employees have made it so we will not come here anymore Nowany good suggestions on a new ice cream spot
