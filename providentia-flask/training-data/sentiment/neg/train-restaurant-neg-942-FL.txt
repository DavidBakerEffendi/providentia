This place wants to be fun Nice setting Gorgeous outdoor eating However that being said they need to revamp their food prep I have eaten there several times Last time was two days ago Food was mediocre Biggest thing was it wasnt even hot When you get eggs and bacon you want them hot Took about  minutes to get my food although they werent busy Pancakes served to me with no syrup and no butter Had to go ask for same Bacon  cold eggs cold Went to get rootbeer from fountainemptyhad to ask them to change it out More attention to detail Hot food go conceptget it out when its hot People do not like cold food Good menu selection Nice variety of choices They just need to work on their production line timing
