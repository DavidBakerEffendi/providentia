First time I went food was great This last timefood was OK The reason for the poor review was our server We had to snag silverware off another table after asking for it and it never came We asked for more salsa and that never came either until we flagged down another server I left a  tip (right around  I couldnt bring myself to tip less (I usually tip ) and chalked up the lack of attention to them being super busy and that isnt the servers fault per se But then I saw the charge on my card and it seemed high Like  too high I called and they looked into it I saw today that they refunded  back to my card So it appears the server decided to tip himself at my expense
