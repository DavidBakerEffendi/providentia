I have never had a bad experience at nandos til tonight I have recommended time and time again this restaurant to people who have never heard of it I will no longer go there after tonight First we were sat in the corner where it was so dark i could barely read the menu I felt like we were being punished right from the start I ordered the el jefe enchilada style with EXTRA CHEESE i specifically said to make sure the cheese was melted cause sometimes they put so much cheese the cheese isnt melted Wellit came out with barely any cheese on it barely any enchilada sauce and no rice ( i asked for double rice no beans) my friend had more cheese on her beans than i had on my whole plate they server took it back and added cheese only to come back with a tiny bit more cheese on it When the manager came over i explained everything to her and she said oh it looks like it had extra cheese like i was lying my friend had put some of her cheese on my plate thats why Shes like i will take off the extra cheese off the bill At that point i really felt like just saying i didnt want it at all but i was hungry Sorry nandos but the poor customer service and poor food leads to you losing me as a customer And if this keeps happening you will lose one customer at a time Me and my recommendations will go somewhere else
