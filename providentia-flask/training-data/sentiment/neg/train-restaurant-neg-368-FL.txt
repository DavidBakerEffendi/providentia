I will start off by saying I am visiting from out of town I am a native Californian who is accustomed to authentic Mexican food After looking through various Yelp reviews we decided to dine at this restaurant The food was not what I consider Mexican cuisine It became somewhat apparent when the kid meals sides included French fries instead of the typical rice and beans I ordered the barbacoa plate The tortillas were hardened and the meat was chewy In addition the tableside guacamole was bland 

To be fair I will mention that the chips and salsa were great and I also enjoyed the ambiance However I would not consider dining there in future visits
