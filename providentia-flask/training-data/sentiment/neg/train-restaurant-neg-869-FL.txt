My family and I just left this Nandos and we were extremely disappointed in the service and food  I order green Chile burro enchilada style  It was not worth the  I paid
  There was no flavor it was bland  In fact I dumped  containers of their spicy sauce on burro and it was still flat  I have tasted better green chile from a can  My grandkids were also not impressed My grandson said his taco meat was tough flat in flavor My dinner tab was   A total waste  We waited a very long time to be seated  Waited again to place our orders and then had to wait forever to pay our bill  I will not be back  If you are looking for good mexican food avoid Nandos
