I live down the street from Nandos so this is usually my choice for mexican food Ive always had great service until last night I think our waitress was new because she had no clue what she was doing She rushed through our order and didnt mention some key things about our food When asking for a recommendation she hadnt tried anything on the menu so I had no clue what to order I recommend not going in a group larger than  because we were in the very back of the restaurant next to the kitchen so it was very noisy I tried catching our waitress a couple times and she would walk right by so instead I asked a waiter walking by our table I asked him about how big a kids quesadilla was and his response was sorry you have to ask your waiter in a very rude tone I was appalled by his willingness to talk to a paying costumer like that I have always loved this place but im not quite sure how I feel now
