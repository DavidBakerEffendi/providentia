If you plan on consuming alcohol here be sure you have a horizontal valid drivers license The concept of TopGolf is cool but this review I primarily to say customer service was not the best and very inconsistent The point system is messed up and doesnt read properly Here is my story I walked in with my fianc and some family members After being told it was a  hour wait for our bay we decided to get some food and drinks Everyone was carded and received the drinks we ordered we then also ordered some food We received a text that our bay was ready way before  hours As we are about to head to our bay our food comes No one offered to deliver our food and we also were charged more for our bill (later we were charged properly) We go up to our bay and ordered some drinks for while we play The waitress tells my fianc that she can not serve her alcohol because her VALID US DRIVERS LICENSE is past  days from when she turned  (Our licenses do not expire until  so there is no need to get a horizontal license and we have been receiving alcohol our entire vacation) The managers eventually came and were very rude about the situation Our group understands the drinking laws of Arizona but our point is we were literally served alcohol earlier in our visit to TopGolf In the end it was a lot of fun besides the first hour we spent there The place is super disorganized and needs a to understand the concept of customer service Our point is make the rules of the establishment consistent in the entire building If you have made it this far thanks for reading If you are an employee of TopGolf please do not contact me as I am uninterested in any thing you have to say

Taren I understand that its a law by the state of Arizona but our point is you DID serve us with our vertical IDs just moment before we went upstairs
