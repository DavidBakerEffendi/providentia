Great concept unfortunately its expensive and they make it really difficult You have to get a membership card and then load money onto that card Of course they only let you load in increments and the increments dont match the cost of the golf Therefore  you always end up having too much money on the card If you loose the card theyll reprint it for you after waiting in the long customer service line and they charge you to reprint the card 

Cmon why all the hassles

Next time Ill go bowling and spend rd as much with none of the membership card hassl
