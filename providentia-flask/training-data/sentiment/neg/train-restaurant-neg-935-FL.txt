I used to love this place it was like coming home for breakfast 
Unfortunately its lost its charm Service is seriously lacking food is mediocre and there are huge air vents blasting cold air on your food (even in the winter) 
Its extremely frustrating to be served cold syrup for your pancakes ( that are also being blasted by cold air) cold air cold syrup cold pancakes cold food 

The dining room smells like musty carpet It seems theyve lost interest in making this place great I seriously doubt that Triple D would ever visit this place again 
The outside is nice but not worth paying for overpriced food just for picnic charm 
Im sure this could all be remedied with some decent management 
Truly sad 
I gave it a  because the last three visits have been nothing but disappointing
