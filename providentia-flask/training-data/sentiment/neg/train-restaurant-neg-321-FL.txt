On a recent trip to Arizona I was looking forward to some quality Mexican food and was rather disappointed with the fare from Cantina Laredo

The hot salsa and chips immediately brought to the table were delicious as was the fresh guacamole made table side but it pretty much went downhill from there

I ordered queso chicken tacos which were nothing more than a grilled chicken breast sliced and put in  small taco shells and a side of queso no lettuce no tomato no NOTHING  For a mere 

Other people in my party got different types of fajitas which were good but still overpriced  

All in all this place is overpriced for what you get  I dont mind an expensive restaurant but I expect to get what I pay for and Cantina Laredo just doesnt make the grade
