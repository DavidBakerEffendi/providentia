i just wanted to let people know that this place is not what a lot of the reviews say it is i ordered fettuccine alfredo it had no taste a plate of noodles in sauce with no flavor  a very small salad that looked like someone just plopped it in a small plate the tomatoes looked like they where wilted  the bread that received wasnt warmed up the butter was individually in little containers and the ice tea tasted like it had soap in it very disgusted with this place   for food that was very poor quality it seemed like i was at a fast food drive thruthat was very slow no flavor what so ever
