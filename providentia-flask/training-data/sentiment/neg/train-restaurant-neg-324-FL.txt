Dang Cantina Laredo  I wanted to like you so hard  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray  Ive walked past this place for years imagining a swanky highend Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices sadly what I found was a very regular uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food  This was a man behind the curtain Wizard of Oz moment for me

Good things  Mmmmmm  the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets  very enthusiastic stars from me  SO DELICIOUS  It was hookmeuptoafeedbag delicious  Service was quick and pleasant

After that though it all goes downhill  Being vegetarian I can  of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese  Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know Im very exciting)  When my meal came out the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf  who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant) so began the first of my meal modifications  I might note here that while being veggie I am a pretty lowmaintenance diner  So just as the black beans are being brought out I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks  again wtf  in my  years of life on this earth no Mexican food joint Ive ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese  onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe)  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross  something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can  The zucchini and cheese  onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again  Black beans were alright  hard to mess those up though  

In defense of Cantina Laredo if youre a big meat eater perhaps you might have more luck here than I  The place was clean the workers were nice the one aforementioned salsa is killer  But this place is neither authentic nor newagey Mexican not worthy of the steeper price points and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food  Dont think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike  would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back  it was that bad
