Yes its been a year (or more) but Im here again  Late night at work late from the gym and hungry  With most places closed or closing  And we had a coupon for Dennys

Its a diner  A mediocre diner but a diner  The service was good  Looking at my past reviews that seems to be a constant  I decided to try something different  Not a burger  Not a chickenfried steak  I got this chicken skillet thing  It wasnt fancy  Some sauteed vegetables and potatoes (maybe even panfried) and a few pieces of boneless chicken  It was tine  I thought the flavor was nice  Nothing special but nice

We then opted for the sundae  It was three scoops of ice cream with chocolate syrup and crumbled oreos  It wasnt as good as it sounds  It was OK  Not bad  But not as good as it sounds like it should be
