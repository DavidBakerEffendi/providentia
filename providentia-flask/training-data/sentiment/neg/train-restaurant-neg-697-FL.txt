The kids here screw up the ice cream everytime Its all gimmick no flavor  I have chunks of base white ice cream with my chocolate Gross probably all artificial flavor anyway   And its chewy ice cream is not supposed to be chewyWe have tried  visits each time is more disappointing No more The ice cream is one note sweet The chocolate is a joke
