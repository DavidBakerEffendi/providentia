Reading some of the reviews I was sure I was going to give this place a  or maybe even  stars Weeelllll nope So I was in the mood for Chinese food and this place was close I thought Id try it I ordered the sesame chicken combo that came with fried rice  crab puffs and an egg roll After I left out the restaurant (ordered to go) and went to my car something told me to check my food I check the bag with the puffs and roll and behold a hair hanging from my crab puff Should have taken a picture but with it being  degrees outside I didnt feel like doing all that and I just wanted to go back in and get new ones Anyway the sesame chicken tasted great The chicken was nice and hot It wasnt chewy Actually had a slight crunch which is what I like and had a good flavor The fried rice on the other hand looked and was dry and was not fresh like the chicken was Its really debatable as to whether or not Ill return
