I am really disappointed in Kneaders  We frequent this location roughly once per month  This last week I ordered an avocado salad at the drive through  When I brought it home I found that about half of the lettuce (which was all located at the bottom of the salad) was orange due to being wilted  The onions had been on the salad for so long that they were dried out and flavorless  Even the avocados were showing signs of aging  I completely lost my appetite and threw away my meal  What a waste  I attempted to resolve this privately with Kneaders by sending an Email to them through their system  Unfortunately they never responded so I chose to leave my review here
