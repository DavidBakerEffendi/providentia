Its sad to review this place and give it  stars knowing that it really has potential to be  The inside of this place is beautiful very clean and very open I ordered a burger here which was okay(nothing amazing) the fries were extremely greasybut then again its a sports bar so no complaints there However being charged  for a side greek salad was kind of out of the ordinary This place is very pricey for a sports bar I know its a nice area But sheesh the costs for medium quality food isnt something I like to attend often What really hurt is the service My server came by our table a total of two times for the TWO hours I was there My party ordered two burgers and a flatbread pizza which took an hour just to get there Who knew being the only group in the restaurant would make the chefs go extra slow Kind of frustrating Nonetheless this place has potential they just have to step up their game I probably wont come here again for quite a while
