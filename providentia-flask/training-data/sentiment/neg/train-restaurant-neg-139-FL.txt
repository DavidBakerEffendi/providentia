Very mediocre food Basically its a cafeteria where have to go up and order the food and they bring it to you I had an artisan pizza with  toppings for  each topping was  but the lady next to me had one topping and seemed to have more with that one topping than I had with  toppings The girl at the check out I asked her  times about the PASTA and she kept talking about pesto telling me it was made of oregano and nuts My pizza toppings were only on the inner third of the pizza(I gave up on the pasta) the outer and Much larger rds had nothing on it but olive oil One lady had salad and said her piece of roll was very hard and stale 
Not a place I would return too
