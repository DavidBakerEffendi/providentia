Ill give a thumbs up for their mango margherita but thats it From the moment we arrived (a party of ) there were issues as the hostess tried to figure out where she could seat us among the many open tables several of which were apparently reserved But the clodk was ticking till happy hour would end so we just wanted a seat The table service was very slow and the food was not good The description of their chile relleno (stuffed with raisins and other goodies) sounded mouth watering but when it arrived it was mainly breading covering a small chile stuffed only with plain cheese For that price   

If all you want is a drink sure go here I wont be back
