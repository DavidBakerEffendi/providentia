It use to be good Walked in today and the placed reeked of old carpet and moldy water The AYCE menu used to be ok but now the rolls and nigiri lack presentation and quality I think the woman chef was making the sushi today Usually when the man chef makes the sushi he pays careful attention to the details of the sushi I dont know if I will be back Hopefully they would deep clean the carpet and pay attention to the details of the quality of sushi served
