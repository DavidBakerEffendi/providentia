They claim to be gourmet mexican cuisine  Ive had better mexican food from street vendors  Service was awkward food was mediocre at best and pricing was way too high  Ordered the barbacoa  It was basically boiled meat with absolutely no flavor  Menu stated it was brisket it seemed more like top round  the tortilla chips were good  Wont go back
