Wow we have been going here for  years we have had birthdays here company meetings and family and friends in town I have never had a server and a manager explain to you that it was your problem the way you ordered it My daughter ordered a burrito and it came and was wrong told the server and he said it was half gone you said it to late I met my family there  min late and my wife received her dinner with mine They charged  more for my wifes plate then my daughters and it was the same thing Nando I am a business owner also and I know its hard to find good people but if this was the only way we were treated we would never come back I was upset last night and told the manager I would fire everyone and start over But I know the customer is not always right but tell your servers and managers not told argue with your customers and say its their fault We received   off which still is not right when orders came late and orders were wrong This is not good business and I hope you make it and can turn it around Best of luck
