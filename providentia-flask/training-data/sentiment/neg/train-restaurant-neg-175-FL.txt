My girlfriend and I came for brunch and fun this morning Getting a bay was quick but no servers appeared until  minutes after we started our game The only reason a server did appear is because the couple sitting in the bay beside us went and complained about the lack of service We ordered a carafe of sangria and the jumbo pretzel board The sangria came out pretty quickly but unfortunately was a whole lot more ice than beverage today What was really irritating was that the pretzel took  minutes to come out with no explanation why and no apologies for the delay either
Ill probably make any future trips to the Scottsdale location instead
