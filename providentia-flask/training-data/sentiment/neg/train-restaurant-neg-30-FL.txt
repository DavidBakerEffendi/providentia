So I took my family to Even Stevens for Sunday brunch because of all the good reviews on Yelp It was a disappointing experience but Im sure that with a few changes it could become a staple in the old town Gilbert restaurant scene

First off as soon as you walk in you dont know whether to wait to be seated or to approach the register The menu on the wall is so vague that I had to pick up a take out menu to get a better idea of what each item actually consists of 

With that being said the food was hot fresh and savory Now there were some more issues after getting our food There was a hair on my sandwich most likely because none of the cook staff was wearing hair nets Multiple cooks had their hair down (Gross) The new Morrissey vegan burrito was a total letdown and they ran out of tots at am How  They are very short staffed so it took forever to get replacement meals made  

They would also be better served by having caddies at each table for sugar condiments and napkins because I had to get up from the table MULTIPLE times for the smallest things and there isnt a dedicated waitstaff to help you It would be nice to have that explained in the beginning

Overall a good call concept with a lot of kinks  The BEST part was the unlimited French toast for
