First off let me say the gal Jessica I believe at the front was amazing but I always do reviews based on the experience as a whole If it was just based on her I would give stars 

So today we went to TopGolf for my sons birthday I came here to have fun the moment we walked through the doors there was a short blonde girl who was just rude I just kinda brushed it off went to the counter and checked in got our bay and Jessica made that piece of it pleasant I advised her my son lost his card she immediately was able to help me get a new one She stepped away from the desk to get Lefty clubs for my son and sadly that blonde girl appeared My sister who was with me says her daughter lost her card and she says well your have to get a new one at the bay when Jessica just said because they were Juniors membership they had to print them So we went to the bay and sure enough couldnt get the card for her daughter So Jessica comes over to the bay and we tell her and she says I just told her Junior memberships have to be printed up there my brother in law and niece head up the counter and YET AGAIN the blonde tells them no They come back cardless to the bay now we are at least  minutes if not more into our bay time Jessica has to now take them back up and get them a card Needless to say that young blonder girl wasnt pleasant  created a major inconvenience to our outing She obviously needs more training on her job and on was GOOD customer service is This Topgolf facility is not the only one and if we need to drive a littler farther to have a great experience we will I stopped by the desk on my way out and told Jessica how awesome she did  how I appreciated her patience
