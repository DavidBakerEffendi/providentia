I have been here a few times but each time there is less and less meat and the price stays around  The people working are generally rude I gave it two stars only because they could actually make a decent sandwich if they used a little more meat The quality is actually pretty good (boars head) and tasty I grew up in NJ so Ive been to Philly and had the real deal If youre in East Gilbert and need a quick fix be prepared to pay the price otherwise head out to Forefathers Phillys Famous or Corleones for a heartier sandwich for the same price
