Let me start by saying when they get the order right their food is excellent With that being said  times the order is wrong We live about  miles from this location we used to stop on our way home from work and pick up salads togo EVERY time there is something wrong We are NOT picky eaters and usually only ask them to hold the onions but there is always something wrong with the order They forget the dressing give you the wrong dressing forget a various item on the salad (cheese chicken nuts etc) forget the bread that each salad comes with

Weve complained to the evening manager on  separate occasions for no other reason but to help correct the issues However we went back again about  weeks ago and BAM same thing 

Goodbye Kneaders sad to see you go especially since our entire neighborhood was excited for your opening but you just couldnt get it right
