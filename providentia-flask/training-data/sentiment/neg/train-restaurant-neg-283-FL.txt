Went here for the first time because we usually always go to Osaka for teppan but we wanted to try something new I was disappointed by the portion sizes At Osaka when we pay the  dollar share charge we get huge portions of fried rice and veggies and only share the meat portions which are still huge Here we ordered filet and shrimp and only got  pieces of shrimp and tiny cubes of filet We each only got about  spoon sizes portions of fried rice The rice was bland the shrimp was dry and rubbery Filet was delicious though My mom and I were still pretty hungry even though our bill came out to  bucks Calamari was delicious if I came back I would probably pass on the teppan and just get sushi and calamari The teppan chef was not entertaining at all compared to osaka He only entertained the girl who was celebrating her birthday and didnt say one word to the rest of the table He a couple tricks but kept having to turn the vent and light on and off every time he did them so it got pretty smokey 

The service wasnt very great either We had to move tables and the server wanted us to stand and wait while she cleaned her dirty tables firsteven though there were about  open and perfectly clean ones They only had one teppan chef working so I could imagine people getting frustrated with the wait I think ill stick to my usual teppan place Better food better service better portions
