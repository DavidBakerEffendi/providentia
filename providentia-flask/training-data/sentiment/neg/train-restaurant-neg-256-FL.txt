The staff was friendly and polite service was prompt and the food wasnt bad but not great
The only complaint I have is that the dinning area was filthy while the staff stood around chatting


This was my first dinning experience at Kneaders I went to Kneaders because a friend spoke highly of the food and service
I dont care how good the food is I wont  sit in the previous diners mess
