Go for the ambiance or the location but certainly dont go for the food or the service  We used to come here as a large group for their occasional tequila nights  I tolerated the extreme price tag and endured the mediocre food because they gave us a private room had raffles and awards and the tequila flowed generously  

However after three consecutive events where one or more of our group asked us to stop going there (usually because of bad food bad service or getting ill from the food) we stopped doing tequila nights  Since then I have been back twice with other people for lunch The first time I thought it must have been an off day I figured they couldnt really be this bad and still be in business  The second time was my last  they really are this bad 

I havent had fast food since  but Id drive through Taco Bell before Id sit through a Cantina Laredo lunch  So bottom line if youre just going for friends and drinks its a great place  If youre expecting decent service and tolerable food look elsewhere
