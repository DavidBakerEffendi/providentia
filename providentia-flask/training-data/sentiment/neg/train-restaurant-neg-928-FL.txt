Dont get me wrong I still love JFG I just didnt care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries  The coleslaw was good but not so fantastic that its worth the pain after  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyinglysweet sauce  Wasnt so sweet when paired w the garlic toast points  However if you look at the included photo youll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork and therefore completely saturated w sauce  I like accompanying bread to be crispycrusty (love that crunch) so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat  What a waste (tsk tsk)  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess  I shouldve asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product  Then again one (wo)mans treasure is another (wo)mans trash and viceversa eh

Today wasnt a great day for me w regards to Mr Johnstons two restaurants (see my recent Coffee Shop review)  I hope my next visit to a Johnston concept yields a happier adventure
