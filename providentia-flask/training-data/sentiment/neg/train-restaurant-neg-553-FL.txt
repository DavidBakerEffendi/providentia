Will  not be back   My receipt says Amber T took my order in the drive through  I told her it was my first time there  I ordered  chicken fingers She asked if I wanted sauce  I said yes and asked her what kind of sauce they had  There were two choices  I asked for  of each  I got three of the same sauce  Chick Fil A  is much better with great sauces
