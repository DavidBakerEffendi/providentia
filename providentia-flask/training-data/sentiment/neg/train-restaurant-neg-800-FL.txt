Its possible that this is the WORST carls Jr in their system They hire punk foul mouth kids with no sense of professionalism 

Their drive through window is the worst because their speaker doesnt work nor does the person who listens to the order listen to what you say Youll end up repeating yourself multiple times and only getting the wrong order

We went into complain after going through the drivethrough and the manager said its not his fault that his employee swore at us because they got frustrated

I wrote to  Carls Jr corporate about this and I have yet to get a response This shows that its beyond this location and actually extends to Carls Jr corporate office as well 

Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs
