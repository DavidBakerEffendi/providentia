I ordered a Thai salad fruit tart and a cinnamon roll The Thai salad was mediocre The chicken tasted off and the dressing tasted like thousand island Same with the cinnamon roll it was mediocre On the site they claim theyre made fresh but it tasted stale The best part was the fruit tart no complaints about that one
