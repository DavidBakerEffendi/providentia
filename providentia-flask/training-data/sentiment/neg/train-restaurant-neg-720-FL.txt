We stopped her for a change I dont want to get into the Pats vs Genos from Philly  I was just excited at the possibility of a good cheesesteak sandwich

I ordered the Genos Special  Cheesesteak with Cheese Wiz  It was very disappointing    Sandwich only  No chips no drink  Fries are another  

The sandwich was small  Not filled very much with meat I ended up with an inch of bun (at least) without any meat The buns are soft and do not hold up very well to the juice and mess Not that there was much in filling to really make much of a difference 

The only positive was that it did taste good

But I will not go back   for a sandwich and drink is not worth it  I would pay this if it were a good sandwich I would probably pay more  

Also my friend had Cheesesteak with Provolone  Very much the same
