My menu was filthy dirty The restroom doors were filthy dirty Especially the mens Makes me wonder if the kitchen is filthy Or behind the bar Do they wipe anything down with a towel that has been soaking in sanitizer  When I go to McDonalds Burger King Jack in the Box Home Depot Bashas or any truck stop the restroom door isnt all dirty Why is it caked with filth here 
Service was great and food was great but I just cant get past all the dirty
