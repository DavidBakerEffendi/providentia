First time customer and food took over   minutes from the time the order was placed to receive The lunch menu states In a hurry  minutes or less on the Express Lunch menu  The waitress was terrible She gave us the excuse she didnt know we were in a time schedule What the heck does that matter This place just lost  customers Our dental school is supposed to have a faculty happy hour there and we wont be going I would be surprised if this place stays open if the service continues this way To make it even better the manager was standing right there when I spoke with the waitress he said nothing Who ever owns this place I hope you are reading this You restaurant has problems They didnt even apologize

To top it all all off now that I have my food which had to be boxed up to go I found a hair in my food Unacceptable And we paid for this crap
