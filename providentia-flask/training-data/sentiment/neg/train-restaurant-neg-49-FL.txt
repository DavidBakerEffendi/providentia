This review is from a reason trip to Arizona We were in town over March Madness and wanted to find a place to watch some games and have lunch This place is super clean and modern and we loved that TONS and TONS of tvs

Unfortunately the food just wasnt very good Our waiter gave us the spiel about how they are a sports bar but all about gourmet food Maybe that set us up for disappointment

The best thing about my meal That they served steamed broccoli as an option instead of fries as a sideand it was actually good The wrap was just not good at all they forgot the saucewtf I asked for it on the side but honestly it still wouldnt have been good even with the sauce
