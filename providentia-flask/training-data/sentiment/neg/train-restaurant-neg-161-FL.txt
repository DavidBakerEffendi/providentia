The atmosphere and gameplay is like all other TopGolf locations The biggest issue we had is that we brought our  year old for his first time We walked in and were promptly told that he could not bring his juice cup in with him This conversation took place before we were even welcomed to the business Long story short they claimed that no outside food or drink was allowed in I can understand wanting to sell your own beverages and food items as a general rule but when the temperature is over  degrees is there no exception for a  year old to have a drink cup It seemed like a big deal was made over such a small issue
