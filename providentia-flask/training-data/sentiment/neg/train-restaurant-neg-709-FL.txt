I used to go frequent Long John Silvers years ago  My wife and I decided to go and try menu option L   fish chicken and three shrimp It was unclear if this option meant two pieces of chicken as well We asked the cashier who looked at the menu and validated my wifes question I asked once more to verify I would be receiving  pieces of meat total Again he said yes  We placed the order and waited 
After calling my name incorrectly the female shift lead() handed out our meal It had  pieces of meat Not a big deal but its the principal of the matter My wife drew the shortest straw and politely approached the shift lead and stated the discrepancy The shift lead said that no it only comes with one piece of chicken My wife explained our conversation with the cashier to which the shift lead replied rather snarky You can buy two pieces of chicken  My wife told her she was mistaken and wasnt paying for their mistake  The shift lead threw a fit and stomped away to her Mgr who told her point blankThen give her two pieces of chicken  We received the chicken with extra attitude  
Customer service rule   It takes years to gain customers but only seconds to lose them  
The food was as I rememberedvery average( stars)  The shift leads attitude was below average( stars) and I will avoid this resturaunt Now I remember why I quit visiting
