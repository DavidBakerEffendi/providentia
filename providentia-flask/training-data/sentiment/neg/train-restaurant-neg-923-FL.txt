We have been coming to this place for several years and we keep waiting for it to improve and it never really does The food is just ok and we really only come here because there is a large grassy area where kids can run around and play while you wait for your food This is a huge draw because it takes the stress out of having to keep your kids corraled the entire time Weve had the chicken tenders (strange) fish (ok) grilled cheese (the best thing weve had here) corn dogs the BBQ platters (dry) and several other things in between Its not that the food is badits just not good  its OK

Our kids love to come and run around with other kids and that is the only thing that keeps us coming back
