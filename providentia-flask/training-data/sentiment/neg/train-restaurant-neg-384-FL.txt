I have not been there in years I had guests and we decided to go The service was ok they dont give you small plates for the chips and salsa The place was dirty chairs were dirty and it smelled horrible When the food arrived it was bland and very generic Will never go back and they need to remove gourmet from the name We love to support Gilbert businesses but this place is horrible
