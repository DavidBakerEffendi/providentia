I have a friend that lives in Gilbert that swore by this place So I happened to be visiting an electronics repair place in Gilbert and I just thought I would stop by and see what the fuss was all about

First of all surrounding area is okay Although not something I was expecting in Gilbert The interior is clean and spacious  nicely done

The food portions were certainly generous enough

That is the extent of positives that I have to say about this place 

I ordered the  Combo Red Burro enchilada style with Rice only and I added a taco for good measure and comparison

My summation the Spanish rice needed more flavor the meat in the taco was undercooked and the cheese and vegetables didnt taste fresh at all And the server seemed like she was very put out to take my order and was very slow to refill my drink

If it werent for the aforementioned positives during the introduction of this review I wouldve given them one star

I am not sure what my friend was thinking but his taste buds may need further acclimation to better Mexican food options
