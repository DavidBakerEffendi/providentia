I waited at the drive thru for a couple minutes for someone to greet me then I finally said Hello  When drive thru boy finally helped me he was talking really fast  tried rushing me  He kept in interrupting me every time I tried ordering something too  Then waited literally  minutes sitting at the drive thru for my food  Got home and looked like they just hurried up  slapped everything together  Wont go here again  Will go to Wendys or Jack in the box instead  Dont take it out on your customers because you suck at your job
