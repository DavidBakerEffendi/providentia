Im not even going to pretend to be a cheese steak connoisseur Ive probably had  in my whole life  So no I dont know what theyre supposed to taste like but I had one here and the meat tasted like it had been chewed up already it was a horrible texture almost like ground beef   

Let me back up when I went inside to order the food the three high school girls working the counter were in deep conversation and I had to wait until they were done to order  I ordered the two sandwiches fries to split and a soda  When I got home there were no freaking fries
  
Hopefully the other things on the menu are better because I hate seeing small businesses fail  

My one star is for the diet coke
