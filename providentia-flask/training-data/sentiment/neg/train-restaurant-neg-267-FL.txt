I have visited kneaders  times in the past few weeks and in each endeavor had togo orders Would love to comment on how the quality of good they serve is top notch however after repeated incorrect orders I have refused to eat here Seems to me this is a direct lack of management having their  year old hourly employees take as much care for what I order as what a public teacher lectures  strikes and youre out with me and Ill be continuing to take my business to Panera and Paradise Bakery
