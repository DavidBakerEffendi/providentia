I had a feeling Kneaders might be bad since the other Utahbased chains that have come to town havent been that good (Im looking at you Cafe Rio and Cafe Zupas) but Kneaders shows them whos boss of mediocrity

They have one vegetarian sandwich (not including the grilled cheese) and the veggies are cooked in aus jus Seriously Im appalled as a vegetarian and as someone who enjoys the privilege of the sense of taste I am disgusted by what I ate I had my husband try it as well to make sure my taste buds werent off after abstaining from meat the past few years but he agreed the aus jus taste was accurate

My husbands sandwich was also bad His skimpy reuben had roast beef in it not pastrami I just couldnt believe my eyes The parmesan chips were just regular chips covered in Kraft granulated fakey parmesan that didnt even stick Very overpriced at  each To quote Woody Allen the food was terrible and such small portions
