Sushi wasnt very good  They forgot to put in for my daughters food and didnt bother to checkin with us till we were almost done eating  I assume they are short staffed

Service and ambiance are meh  I assume they dont usually have kids eat there since they didnt bring out crayon set till near the end  I wont be coming back EVER 

Eastwind Sushi and Grill in Chandler was sooo much better than this and thats a revolving sushi bar
