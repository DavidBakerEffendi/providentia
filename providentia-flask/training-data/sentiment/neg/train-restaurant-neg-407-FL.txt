We used to really enjoy this place Everything had been consistent and tasty overall One dish in particular was our favorite chicken del sol However we got it to go about  months back The dish was hardly recognizably Flavorless under seasoned and colorless My  yo could make a better version So we stopped going but decided to give it one more try a few days ago This time the dish had so much lemon it was not editable Not sure who is tasting these dishes before they serve them but we are done with this place
