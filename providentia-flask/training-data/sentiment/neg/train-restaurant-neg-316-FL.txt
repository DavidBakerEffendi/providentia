Cantina Laredo had a nice setting with outdoor seating to people watch and our waitress was very pleasant and on point Thats why the two stars However we were not a fan of the food at all The food was luke warm upon arrival Some of the food was spicy without warning The flavors were bland and lacked flavor I guess to new age Mexican for us We prefer the real deal mom  pop Mexican style restaurants where the flavors are right on and you get fresh chips when you order two dips
