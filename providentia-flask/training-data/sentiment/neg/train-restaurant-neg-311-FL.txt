This may have been our weirdest service experience ever  Before we get to that lets talk about the food My husband ordered the tacos al carbon () The taste was good but not traditional and they were served on flour tortillas I had the fajitas tres with chicken steak and bacon wrapped shrimp which were recommended by the waitress () The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious The other items were also good but not memorable We also had table side guac as a starter () 

Now Im going to backup up and talk about the service When we sat down the waitress asked us if we wanted drinks We both wanted water to start When she delivered the water she dropped them off fairly rapidly and moved on Upon taking a sip my husband asked how my water tasted which was fine He had me taste his and it was soda water Odd  On her return she gave him a new water per our request and took our drink order We ordered one diet soda and table side guacamole When she returned she brought him iced tea Okay  double weird
Then she began to make the guac We asked for lime and onions on the side which she did for us (she was consistently friendly) What we got from our table side was  avocados halves mashed up with a dollop of tomatoes on top Thats it We saw cilantro on her cart but there wasnt any in the guac and the only tomatoes were the dollop Pretty weird and expensive guac even with the onions and lime on the side 

While she was making the guacamole I asked her about the fajitas tres which she said  as her favorite After dropping off the guac she walked away We saw her take orders at the next table Later she dropped off my meal without ever taking my husbands the order The weirdness continued with people picking up one of the two different salsas they serve without asking but not replacing it When our waitress did replace it she gave us the wrong one 

We could go on but suffice it to say it was weird especially for a higher end restaurant So to sum it up  the food was good but expensive for the service we received and the weird guacamole Will we be backthat remains to be seen but my guess is no
