Two of our friends my husband and I visited this establishment last night When the server brought our drinks another server tried to slip past her due to overcrowding at the table next to us knocked into her and she spilled the drinks on my husband and one of our friends She apologized but then acted put off when the guys asked for extra napkins to try to dry off 

The other server had to ask the manager to come over as our server did not think about it It took a ridiculously long time to get anything we asked for Although the manager did comp one appetizer for us she made no sense In her apology she stated We rarely ever spill drinks on anyone Then in the same breath she said It does happen I did it last night Really If it is rare why is it happening night after night 

To top that off when my friend was trying to ask a question our server walked away mid sentence and started taking care of another table This was extremely rude and showed a serious lack of paying attention Our friends said they love going there and have never had such terrible service or anything like that happen 

Although I liked my food my husband and I will not go back to this spot This was our first time there and the first impression was rotten
