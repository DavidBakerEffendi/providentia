Worst experience ever I would rather eat out of my dogs bowl than this dump The manager is oblivious to tweakers walking outside with beer and has no control over the restaurant Waited over an hour to get our cold food which we didnt eat we just paid for our drinks and left The restrooms were filthy dirty just overall horrid thanks its now  and Im now in the drive thru
