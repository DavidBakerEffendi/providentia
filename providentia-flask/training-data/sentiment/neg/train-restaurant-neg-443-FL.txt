Thanks for shutting down early tonight   We made the drive over to your location  only to find the doors locked at pm

Why post store hours if youre not going to adhere to it 

Dont get me wrong I would have understood if you let me in and said this is all we have left   But instead  you opted to give a friendly wave turn away business  Guess whatTheres plenty of other options out there   

Thanks againnot only did i lose out tonight  but so did corporate and the store owner who pay the salaries
