I have never had a more awkward drivethru situation in my entire life 

I personally dont eat here because their food nauseates me for some reason (sanitation) but my husband likes it so I came here for him tonight 

Selina the gal who took my order according to the receipt was ridiculously awkward I ordered she repeated it back incorrectly in pieces I reordered it She repeated it I said correct Then there was silence for  seconds So I asked Are you done asking questions or whats going on

She repeated my order again INCORRECTLY I corrected her and just drove around to the window I dont have time for these games all night When I pulled up to the window she was telling her colleagues about how awkward I am 

Seriously Chicken mashed potatoes corn on the cob and a cocacola is probably one of the most common meals in America Id hate to know what my experience would have been like if I had a complex order 

Be professional at your job and do it right thanks I dont normally call poor employees out by name but this is welldeserved
