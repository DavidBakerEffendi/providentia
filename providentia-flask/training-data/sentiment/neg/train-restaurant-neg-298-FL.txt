We stopped in on Saturday to grab some lunch before the world cup started it was our second visit  Our first visit was uneventful and nothing special 

This time it was bad No one greeted us at the door The waiter eventually saw us and told us to sit anywhere The restaurant was clean and neat and the service was prompt 

I ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch special it was served in a bento box We also ordered three types of rolls and a sashimi combo Two of the three sushi rolls we ordered came out quickly The catapillar roll was ridiculous It was filled with a tiny piece of cucumber and lot of rice then covered with avocado The menu provides pictures with no detailed description This roll was an extreme disappointment  The other two rolls were unremarkable  The chicken teriyaki was chewy and had zero taste It was obviously microwaved It was served third after the two sushi rolls The third roll and the sashimi combo took much longer to prepare 

One high point was the waiter He was prompt and attentive For soup he suggested the mushroom and onion It was nothing but broth but exceptionally good later he indicated it was supposed to have pieces of musroom and onion 

The single star is for the waiter All in all not good We will not be back
