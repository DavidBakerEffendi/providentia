The food at Kneaders is good  if they have it I sat in line tonight for thirty minutes and when I placed my order I was told they were out of pumpkin pie Its pm on a Friday I dont understand how they cant have enough pie to get through a Friday dinner rush Needless to say my  month pregnant self was extremely disappointed On numerous occasions when stopping at this location I am told they are out of this or that  usually soup They need to up their quantities or they will be losing a lot of frustrated customers that want to know if they come here they can get the items they are looking for
