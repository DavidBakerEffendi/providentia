came here tonight and was not impressed at all I knew it was on that TV show so I made the hour drive from Scottsdale just to try this place it was a huge let down they messed up our order twice and we had no compensation for a place that is supposedly farm fresh the vegetables sure didnt taste like it especially the lettuce as it was old and wilted when they finally brought out the correct burger it was lukewarm and very mediocre the meat just didnt taste all that great( although I have had some pretty amazing burgers so that might just be me) I would go as far as to say that my gym the dc ranch village makes a better burger than this placea friend had the buffalo chicken sandwich which they forgot to bring out at first he is not a small eater and he threw it out after a couple bites the sweet potato fries were okay but nothing special the regular fries were pretty good very salty and reminded me of McDonalds fries after they finally brought out the beet salad( after bringing out a random side salad that did not taste good at all) it was good but not great they were out of a lot of condiments as well the only thing that really stood out to me was the medjool date shake that thing was freaking amazing it had these delicious chunks of dates in it if you like dates then you will enjoy this shake I would come back just for a shake another plus was the manager( Im assuming a nice blonde lady) came around and asked us if everything was alright multiple times although she should of comped something after we told her they messed up our order multiple times most likely will not be back unless its for a milkshake
