I have ordered here before (Generals chicken) and beef and broccoli but tonight we had the worst lo mein and coconut shrimp we ever had  The lo mein was so bland and the coconut shrimp breading was so thick and untasty I cannot even identify what type of breading they used  it actually ruined the sauce  i would have rather ate the sauce alone with a spoon  We didnt even save the leftovers  I wont not order from her again but will make note of these two items  DO NOT ORDER them
