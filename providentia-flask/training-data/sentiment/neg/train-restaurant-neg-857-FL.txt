If anyone tries to make me eat here again I will wrestle them to the ground  I ordered chicken enchiladas with verde sauce  I received some chicken that was reasonably flavorful (and not overcooked) but completely encased in a ton of bright orange cheese and smothered in a sauce that was a beigetan color and amazingly salty  There was nothing verde about it  The rice and beans tasted as if they were boiled in a high sodium chicken stock  Blech  Margaritas were fine  Service lackluster  I no recommendo
