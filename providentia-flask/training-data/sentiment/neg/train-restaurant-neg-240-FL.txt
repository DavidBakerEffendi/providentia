I wont be kneading this place again It sounded good but the sandwiches where pretty disappointing I got the turkey and cranberry croissant It was rather bland and lacked the gusto that the picture showed Oh well The staff seemed pretty nice though Im not mad I tried it I just probably wont be coming back
