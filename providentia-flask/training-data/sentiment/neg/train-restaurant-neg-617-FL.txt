I just had the worst experience I have been going to this dairy queen for years and I cannot belive what has happened to it It was awful the food service and ice cream Let me start from the beginning We got there about pm upon entry we saw several angry customers waiting for their orders to be corrected That should have been a big red flag right there but we were hungry and decided to go ahead and order since wed never had a bad experience in the past Big Mistake So we placed our order consisting of a chicken bacon ranch sandwich a pc chicken strips  orders of onion rings and  sm blizzards (pumpkin pie and a salted caramel truffle) We found a seat in the corner away from the obviously sick people sitting at the front and waited for our food Shortly our blizzards arrive the pumpkin pie one was missing its nutmeg topping so the guy took it back but returned saying they were out of nutmeg I was not told this when I ordered it and would have affected my choice He then took our number away even though we had yet to receive our food items So we waited and then saw what appeared to be our order delivered to the table with the sick people I guess the guy had given them our order number without completing our order first Once he realized his mistake he took it from them and gave it to us I was worried but we decided to try to eat it anyway Now onto the meal itself Half my chicken tenders were tough and inedible while the onion rings were flavorless My husbands sandwich was disgusting with pressed chicken and bacon that tasted as if it had been soaked in cleaning solution he didnt even get through half of it His blizzard was okay but mine lacked pumpkin flavor on top of the missing topping Very unlike pumpkin pie blizzards I have had at other locations This was one of the main reasons we went there today

Over all we were very disappointed and will not be back
