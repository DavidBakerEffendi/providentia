I dont know where to start Most of the reviews are correct The pizza is no good and looks like its been sitting out for hours I tried about  different slices but none of them got more than  bites taken out because they were so bad The only slice I actually finished was the Oreo dessert pizza The pasta is precooked and they only throw it in boiling water for about  seconds to reheat it so the consistency is very mushy and over cooked The only thing I semi enjoyed was the salad bar Its true the lettuce isnt the freshest it was a bit wilted but I still liked it over the pizza and pasta One soda machine was out of order and the other two were out of most of the sodas with the exception of about  The service was friendly The girl in the front counter explained the buffet to us and said she gave us a discount for signing up for the rewards program but once we sat at our table there was a advertisement which said it was happy hour and the buffet was already discounted All in all we probably wont be back
