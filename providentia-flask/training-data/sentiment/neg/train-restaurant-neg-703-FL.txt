Very cool conceptno pun intended this was only my nd time hereI am a big ice cream lover but this isnt grabbing my ice cream lovers heart in me I enjoyed hearing a big gentleman that was working there the st time I went there described what he was doing as he prepared my order but he wasnt there the nd time and honestly I cant say there will be a rd timesorry Its expensive  and not very good The big guy at least made it worth the price of the ice cream due to his awesome personality butwithout him it wasnt worth the price I miss the good old ice cream days of the s (ie Swensens flavors  Farrells)where you didnt need a great personality to sell the ice creamthe ice cream was so good it sold itself
