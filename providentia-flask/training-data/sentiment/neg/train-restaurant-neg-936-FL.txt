The food was good just like it is at Joes BBQ  However we wanted to enjoy the outdoors so we went outside to eat only to be attacked by flies We brought it to the bus boys attention yet nothing was done nor did mgmt come see us  There are no fans or other means to keep flies away  Not only is it annoying but it is also very unsanitary
