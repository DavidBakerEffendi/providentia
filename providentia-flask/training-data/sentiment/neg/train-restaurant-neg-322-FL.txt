I want to LOVE this place  After all it has huge sentimental value for me as its where my husband took me on our first date  Their cold salsa is amazing and their chips are good which is the only redeeming food item on the menu  This last time I went I wasnt starving so I ordered an appetizer  The description of their ahi tacos actually says sushi cut ahi What I got instead of thin buttery slices was chunky chewy mouthfuls of horribly cut ahi  It was disgusting  To make matters worse the manager argued with me about it when I pointed it out  Sadly memories or not I doubt we will ever be back

As you can see by the attached photo the chunks were nearly the size of a half dollar and very thick  I wouldnt even eat a piece of steak that big  They absolutely overwhelmed the tiny taco shells

Save your money and eat somewhere else
