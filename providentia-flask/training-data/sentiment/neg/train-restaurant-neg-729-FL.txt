Stopped in with great expectationssorely disappointed  Flavor of the sandwich was ok but certainly not anything to brag about  The most disappointing thing was that it was so over priced for the product we received  I really expected a fair amount of meat which we did not have on our sandwiches Bread was on the verge of being stale  Would also appreciate it if the staff would smile and speak loud enough to understand what they are saying
