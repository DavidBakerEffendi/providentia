I had the pesto and my guest had the mac and cheese Both lacked tons of flavor The noodles were barely coated with pesto or cheese (respectively) so youre basically tasting a bunch of bland noodles The portion sizes are decent but this food is not worth paying the prices for when theyre skimping on the ingredients that contain the actual flavor We each had a few bites and decided to take it home where we could add more cheese and flavor to actually enjoy the food Will not be giving this place another chance
