I live right by here and have heard all the hype on this place so me my neighbor and my daughter just ate breakfast here One wordOVERRATED 

Beautiful grounds and scenery but I am rating just by the food price and atmosphere 

Set up is a little confusing You order from a window and seat yourself I had no idea Food is pricey and no fresh orange juice they sold Tropicana Ordered for  adults and a child and it was  For breakfast 

We ordered omelets bacon my daughter had kids French toast 

Food so so and it is not cheap My daughter did not like the apple crisp bacon I thought it was ok Me and my friend both got omelets which were just ok Came with a pita bread and salad and a side of fruit 

utensils outside and flies everywhere including the inside We cannot figure out the hype here We would have had a better breakfast at The Good Egg
