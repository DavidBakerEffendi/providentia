Well we were greeted with this comment You dont have any drivers in that bag do you Well of course we did as it was advertised as a driving range They confiscated the drivers and allowed us to use irons We were absolutely astonished to see that the rates were  per hour  but figured it would be good to try it just once since we are from out of town We tried to pay and then were asked if we would like a lifetime membership card My husband said no because we knew we wouldnt be coming back there The saleslady saId that it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED We asked what advantage the membership was and she said nothing but it was HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WE said that no we didnt want the lifetime membership card for  and so she said we could pay the  an hour for the range but we could not hit our irons because one of us had to have the lifetime card So we asked if the card was required she again said no that it was HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Are you seriously kidding me You know if the place was upfront and honest about telling us that it would cost  for the first time and  for any other times we might have stayedbut when you lie and mislead the public I will have no part of your establishment So no I cannot give this place a good review because they lack integritypity because it was a nice looking place
