We went for dinner this evening and I have not been there in  months
After visiting here again from Chicago and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT
I had toreturn the Chicken Breast as itwas cold dry and salty The service
Was poor my silverware was dirty and we had to ask for napkins and cutlery
my friends had the guacamole which was tasteless and boring with no
Specialized taste Imean really You are much better off going to a more
Specialized Mexican restaurant like Barrioat Phoenix 

I DO NOT PlAN ON EVER RETURNING TO THIS REStARAUNT

it has really slipped and
 the quality has gone down hill you truly should be
Ashamed ofyourselves
