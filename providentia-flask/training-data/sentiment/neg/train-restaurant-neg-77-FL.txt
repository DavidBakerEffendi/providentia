We went to Blue  for our daughters th birthday and were pretty disappointed  The waiter was condescending but we initially just laughed that off  Food was ok nothing really wrong just not great  Still within the happy hour window I ordered their well bourbon on the rocks advertised as  on the menu  When the bill arrived I noted that it was  and change so I asked the waiter about it  He said he would take care of it and came back a few minutes later and said to me sarcastically I took that  cents off for you like Im cheap  When I asked about the  cents vs  correction I was expecting he said rocks pours are always doubles  Huh  How about asking me if I want a double  He was adamant that anytime someone orders rocks they just automatically charge a double  Given the small glass crammed full of ice I received it sure didnt look like a double  After he left and I was signing the check we noticed that my wifes salad was  when it should have been    for the added chicken she ordered  These prices were on the menu so I have no idea what Ace was keying into the system  We thought about saying something but after the first experience in flagging something to our waiter we decided to vote with our feet and never come back
