Went for dinner on  Walked in and instantly noticed a foul mildew like smell The further we walked into the restaurant the stronger the smell We sat down and started looking at the menu But the smell overpowered us We got up and left Whatever the smell is no restaurant should ever smell that bad

Used to enjoy this place quite a bit but I refuse to eat in filth
