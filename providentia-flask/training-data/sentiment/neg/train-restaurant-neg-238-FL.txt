I was on my way home from a late class and wanted something quick I rarely eat fast food and between the  and my house there is only kneaders or McDonaldsthere was no way I was eating McDonalds As this was my first time I quickly looked over the menu and ordered the reuben panini After a long wait (by any drive through standards) I paid  and went home with my sandwich I understand that these were wide slices of bread but where was the filling Literally only a few slices of beef and an equally thin layer of cabbage While the ingredients were good that was in no way a  sandwich And the pickle spear didnt make up for it I may go back to try a pastry Ive heard theyre amazing but the actual food is a complete rip off
