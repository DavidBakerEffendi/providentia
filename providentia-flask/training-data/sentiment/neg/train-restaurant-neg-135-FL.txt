This place was so gross I find it funny that the name is sauce because there was almost no sauce on my childs pasta and on the pizza The bruschetta tasted like I might as well have eaten a spoonful of salt  it was definitely way overpriced for the crap that was delivered to my home I would suggest getting a Red Baron pizza because it will be way better than what they call food at sauce The best thing we tasted from here is the Sierra mist soda Huge disappointment  waste of money Giving one star was being generous
