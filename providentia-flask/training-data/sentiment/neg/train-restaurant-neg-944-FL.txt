Cons Be prepared to wait in line for  minutes even if the line is barely out the door That does not include the time you spend waiting for your food

Combos do not mean drink is included 
The man taking my order said You can get   lemonade  
I assumed based on his question that the drink was included 
Otherwise he should have asked Anything else  Would you like a drink 

Lemonade is   Yikes

Upgrade to onion rings instead of fries  

Lunch for one is almost 

Pros 
The food tasted fresh but the fish was NOT better than what Ive gotten elsewhere which would did not include  minutes in line  wait time   drinks

Its a lot of food and impossible to finish
