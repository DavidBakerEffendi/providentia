My husband and I ate there tonight Its been about a year since we ate there because the last time we did I was throwing up all night and ended up in the ER Im really not sure what it is but tonight my husband has not left the bathroom and I am very nauseous AGAIN 
Most disappointed because the food is very healthy Since we eat a Vegan diet there arent too many places we have found to eat out 
I do think things were a bit over garliced okay forget the a bit WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC 
I have to say it ruined our date night and no price is worth what Im paying
Wont be back
