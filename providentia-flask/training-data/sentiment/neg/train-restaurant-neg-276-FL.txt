Review started   I feel awful having to downgrade but after sitting there for an hour on Friday night starving I cant help it They really werent that busy but I finally had to ask for whatever they had already made (if anything) to go because I didnt want to be rude and I was getting tired and impatient The waitress had explained that the sushi chefs will just randomly take order tickets and dont necessarily make the food in order yeah that just happened When I got home which was only  minutes away the couple rolls and salmon sashimi we did get was simply inedible My favorite spicy scallop simply was not Everything we tried can only be described as gross for lack of a better term Thank goodness I picked up cupcakes at Mind over Batter before dinner Maybe Ill make some top ramen

I will try them again after I forget how horrible the last visit was because our first visit was so good and Im not a quitter  )
