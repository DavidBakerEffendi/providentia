Dont you hate it when you crave a certain food only to have that food taste horrible when you finally get to eat it I had the General Chicken and my wife ate the Beef  Broccoli The General was perhaps the worst Ive ever eaten (I have been to countless Chinese restaurants across the country and only eat General) and my wife said she would rather have eaten Subway because her beef tasted nasty and even the broccoli was no good 

This place gets  stars because the staff was all very attentive and friendly Because of the disappointing food though we wont be going back to this place again
