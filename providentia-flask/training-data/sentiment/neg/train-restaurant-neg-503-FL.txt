Too many homeless people come here  Ive been waiting for  minutes for a table  This place is packed full of homeless people watching football and not one to f them is eating  Im looking at  booths that have only one person in each  Out of those three booths only one person has food  The other two people have a single beer each and they are not drinking them  I counted  tables and booths and only  of them have food  I dont know how this place is still in business  This place only gets one star because of the pure stupidity of the owner not cycling people through hisher restraint  This is definitely the last time I ever come here  I suggest that if your hungry go to a restaurant that does not allow a single person to occupy an entire table and only order water
