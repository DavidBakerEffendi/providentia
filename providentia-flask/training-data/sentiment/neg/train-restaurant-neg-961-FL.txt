Negatives 
Its am and they dont have any pizzas ready despite the fact that they advertise hot and ready 
The counter person was a little impersonal and the wait for pizzas was longer than the  minutes they promised Employee who was prepping and cooking did not have a hat or hair net He also had a beard Also did not wear gloves ( 

Positives 
Place does look clean and I like the exposed kitchen
