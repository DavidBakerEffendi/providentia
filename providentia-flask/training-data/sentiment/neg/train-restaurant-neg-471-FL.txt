this was my first experience with this restaurant I placed an online order and its supposed to track it and tell you the process if its ready to pick up in the oven etc I placed my order at  and it said it should be ready at pm At pm it said the order was still in cue So I tried calling The phone number doesnt work and hangs up on you automatically So I drove there (it is now an hour past the time I placed the order) I talked to someone up front (who was nice and helpful) and he had someone else come out to talk to me Wouldnt really listen to me telling them the online system was clearly not working as well as the phones kind of just blew me off and then handed me my food My food was cold and is missing part of my order I am literally never coming back here But shoutout to the nice kid who apologized to me
