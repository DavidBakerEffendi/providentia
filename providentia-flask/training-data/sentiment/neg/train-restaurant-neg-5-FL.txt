The lost me as a customer tonight My wife and I have been here many times in the past because they were in a convenient location and served better than average gilbert area Chinese food I have to say that their service has been quick throughout the multiple years we have dined there 

Tonight we arrived  minutes before closing and were turned away because they close at pm First of all what restaurant closes at pm on a Friday Second what restaurant turns away loyal customers a half hour before closing Most restaurants will seat you up to closing time and let you finish your meal after they close the door

Life is too short and there are way to many good restaurants in the area to put up with this They are off of our dining list
