So we have been to this place  times now  The first time was pretty darn good service great food

Second time service was not the best  I ordered the fried chicken The fried chicken was probably the most mediocre fried chicken ever had Thy brined the chicken in maple which just does not work 

Third time tonight we couldnt figure out where to go so ended up here  There was only one table full and us A couple people were at the bar Took a while to order drinks they were apologetic but still ridiculous We ordered our food after could not figure out what to order because nothing really stood out I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich  the meat was so dry my wife ordered a cheeseburger and was nothing great Our waiter took a while to check in I told him about the sandwich he took it off the bill which helped But this will be our last time at this establishment
