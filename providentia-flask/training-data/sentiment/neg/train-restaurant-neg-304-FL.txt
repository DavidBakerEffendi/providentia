All I have to say is spend your money on Teppanyaki somewhere else We had some sushi which was good but the Teppanyaki was terrible They screwed up our steak and it was way over cooked (we did the table service to be faster not the full show with dinner) We said it was over cooked and we had asked for rare so the girl just took our plates  came back about  min later with our initial rice  veggies which were now very cold and some medium rare steak The steak was bland and a terrible cut of NY strip It was incredibly chewy  the rest was just so cold by the time we got it back I wont be coming back Ill stick with consistent Benihana
