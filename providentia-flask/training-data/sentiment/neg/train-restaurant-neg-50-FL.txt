PROS plenty of TVs friendly service beer was freshcold chipsqueso were okay clean facility

CONS chicken wings must have been to Jenny Craig before they went to the wing factory    meat on the bone was sparsepaltrydisappointing    The bar volume was set to  Seriously I found it hard hear my colleague above the din of our fellow diners Annoying

Fellow Yelpers are pretty big on this placeperhaps the menu has some gems worth trying My experience however did not inspire me    

Cheers
