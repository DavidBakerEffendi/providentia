Absolute terrible food prep and zero response from manager Ordered takeout one item being loaded fries The container could not sustain the incredibly heavy weight of the food which also contained ranch dressing supposedly in a sealed side container Upon opening the container of fries and dressing the very very very hot food and dressing fell all over me leaving me with burns on my legs Never realized ordering fries and some ranch dressing was dangerous I highly suggest investing in containers that can actually hold the weight of the food and that the manager doesnt go into hiding when called and then hang up on you Blue  is one place neither myself family or friends will ever order from or go to again
