This restaurant was quite an (awful) experience First of all we experienced pretty much EVERY problem that other people have written about among various Yelp reviews For instance terrible service No one greeted us when we came in we had to awkwardly ask the sushi chefs behind the bar if we could seat ourselves It took a while before either of the two waitresses took turns aimlessly and halfheartedly wandering around the restaurant came to bring us menus Next the temperatures of the raw fish that we ordered were quite variable Some pieces were extremely cold nearly frozen and others were warmer than room temperature (eek) When we asked our waitress why some fish was so cold and others warm she said The fish is cold because it is fresh dont you want fresh fish I had no idea that frozen fish was the freshest but apparently thats the case here This also made us wonder what must have be up with the warm fish because if she thought that cold meant fresh Based on previous reviews and the menu posted on their website ( nigiri lots of rolls etc) we specifically requested the happy hour menu since happy hour is all day on Saturdays Not so exciting once you actually get the happy hour menu though which does NOT match the happy hour menu posted online The actual happy hour menu had about  options for rolls (salmon tuna octapus etc) only all just under  So not only do you have to request the happy hour menu (which seemed to be intentionally kept secret) but the prices and selection was weak at best And maybe its just me but I was very unimpressed with the Apple or Orange juice listed on the specials menu at the sushi bar I mean seriously Although we did get some freebies (miso soup small bowl of edamame) these tend to be free at most Japanese restaurants and did not make up for all the other issues WHATSOEVER This is one of those special sushi restaurants that makes you spend your drive home wondering ifwhen food poisoning may struck and also makes you hesitate to EVER take another chance on a new sushi restaurant again
