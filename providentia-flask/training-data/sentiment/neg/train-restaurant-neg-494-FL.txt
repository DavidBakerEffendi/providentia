Our family of three had a horrible dinner at San Tan location of Noodles  Company yesterday Our order has  dishes none of them was wellcooked including Kids Meal Mac  Cheese They charged us for  dishes but brought out only  bowls after waiting for  minutes completely forgot mine After another minute wait my dish eventually came out but it was only  cooked tasted gooey like eating glue sticks At this time my husband said his green curry was between raw and medium like chewing hard plastics in mouth He took it out to have it recooked they made a new one for him However I tried some Mac  Cheese for my daughter it was glue sticks as well She did not want to eat it any more after taking five bites It took us a long time to get our food and they all taste like junks totally wasted our time and money
