I heard great things about this place during one of my classes at ASU so I thought I would check it out The vibe in the place was very hip  modern Im usually not very particular about service because I know stuff happens and sometimes people are just having a bad day That being said this was some of the worst service I have ever had 

While I was deciding what to get the guy at the counter was visibly impatient despite the fact that I was the only one in line and I had only been looking over the menu for maybe  seconds I asked him if I could make my own sandwich or customize one of the ones on the menu as I didnt see anything that really caught my eye on the menu He snobbily said a simple no and continued to tap his fingers and look around impatiently I decided to just pick one of the sandwiches The sandwiches came with a side salad I asked him if I had any options with the salad he said no and continued to tap his fingers and look around impatiently like I wasnt worth his time After I ordered my sandwich I told him I had a coupon from Yelp for a free cookie with the purchase of a sandwich he looked dumbfounded like I was saying the stupidest thing he had ever heard I pulled up the coupon on my phone which he than ripped out of my hands and starred at for a minute before reluctantly asking me what kind of cookie I wanted I asked him what kinds there were and he looked like he just wanted to leave and stop wasting his time with me despite the fact there still no one behind me and I had only been at the counter for maybe  minutes now He snobbily listed off the kinds of cookies they had Once I had finished ordering he shoved a number and a cookie in my face and walked away from the counter

I was looking for a table to sit at but all of them were dirty  sticky I picked the cleanest one I could find and went to find some napkins to wipe it off with I asked another guy where the napkins were because I wanted to wipe off my table hoping he would get the hint and clean off the table he didnt He handed me some napkins and I wiped off the the table myself The food itself was ok however I didnt really have very many options to begin with 

I think the fact that they donate a lot of their income to charities is great and all but I will not be coming here ever again The food is just ok and they give you know options to customize your order whatsoever Not to mention the service was some of the worst I have ever had
