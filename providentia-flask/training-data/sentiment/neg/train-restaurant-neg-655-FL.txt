This store is horribly mismanaged  Twice I have been into the store and had to wait for over  minutes to get a breakfast sandwich  Today I walked in at am and after the person in line before me was served the clerk disappeared for about  minutes then finally came back to take my order  Perhaps he needed a bathroom break but on a Saturday morning they should have had someone else up front

It seems like they focus more on the drive throughjust like my first visit I stood at the counter for about  minutes after my order was placed and didnt get any attention until i asked how much longer it would be  Had to show them my receipt as they didnt even know what I had ordered so I had to wait more for them to get the order started 

While waiting I saw an employee stir coffee for a drive through order with a spoon throw it down on the counter then stir a separate coffee with it later on  Gross

Finally got my order and my crispy hashbrowns tasted like mushy grease soaked cotton balls

I dont do fast food much but I know that it cant be normal for it to be this bad
