This place is horrible Weve tried it  different times and always the same We just keep hoping it will get better sadly it doesnt Service sucks Food takes FOREVER I dont think it takes  mins to steam broccoli Are you kidding with that They never get the orders right and when they do get the food out its ALL WRONG  I love pita jungle but definitely NOT this location
