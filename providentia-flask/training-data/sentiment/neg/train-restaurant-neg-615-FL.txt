Came thru drive thru Told the girl  times I wanted gravy  Even at the window I said are you sure its in the bag  Oh yes she said  Well no gravy in the bag as I drive away  I had to pull around and park go inside and there it was on the counter  She saw me and said oops  No apology  I spent  there that night  This place just cant get it right  Must be poor managment  Food is good  Service is the worst
