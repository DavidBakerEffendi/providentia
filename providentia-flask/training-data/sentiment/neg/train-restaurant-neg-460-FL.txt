Dominos had a deal for  medium pizza which I thought was a good deal and you get two toppings Went to pick it up and they should have just said  small pizza the box was a small It serve probably  people if they all had  pizza each When I went to pick it up the guy was on his cellphone but dont worry he was nice enough to put his phone down when I came in Not worth the savings
