The rolls were ok and Nigiri was horrible We asked for no cucumber in both roll the dragon roll and the crunchy roll And they both came out with it in them The waitress was new and apologized but didnt say she would go remake it I suggested I guess we can pick it out and she said yah that what most people do with things they dont like She should have remade it right away  She should have not even brought it out 

Our nigiri was so fishy The fish didnt  taste fresh at all The cut of the fish was literally almost a quarter of an inch thick  Barely any rice Horrible balance and the Nigiri fell apart We had the Shrimp tuna and salmon All were way below par
