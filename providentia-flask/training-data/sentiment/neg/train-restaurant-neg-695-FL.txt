This place was a disappointment I thought it was going to be really cool but I actually found it to be a bit weird The employees werent super friendly and didnt explain how the process worked just said you want ice cream  um yes So on their website they have a favorite that was coconut ice cream with strawberries pineapple and coconut flakes Then when I got there the menu said it had mixed berries not strawberries and pineapple I still decided to get it I ordered a small and got a huge portion The ice cream had a weird texture and was not creamy like I would have expected In addition some of the berries just tasted like hard gas it was truly gross The BF got the peanut butter and chocolate concoction His was better but had some parts that only had the cream no flavor and that tasted weird I would much rather go someplace that uses fresh ingredients and makes ice cream the old fashioned waywithout the gimmick
