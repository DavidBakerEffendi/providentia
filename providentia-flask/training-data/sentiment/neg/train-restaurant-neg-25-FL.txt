I wanted to give this place  starts but I feel things happened during our experience that brought it down We ordered the jackfruit carnitas Tortas and they were bomb The atmosphere was super chill at first and they even had a guy singing songs with his guitar We also ordered the vegan tots which came out really hard and burnt When we told the lady she looked at our tots and made a ew face She said she was as going to tell someone in the back but it seemed like she was just telling us what we wanted to hear and no action We didnt eat our vegan tots and it would have been nice of them to hook it up right There was like  other people there I think were customers and  other ladies that worked there but was busy chatting with another guy the whole time I think  of them was a manger It was awkward after a while especially when we realized the lady was not coming back out with fresh tots So confusing
