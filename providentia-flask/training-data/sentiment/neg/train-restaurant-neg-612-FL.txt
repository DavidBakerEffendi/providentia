This Dairy Queen could get  stars for their blizzards and staying open late Unfortunately find my picture and see that Im reviewing the food and wait time It was a  minute wait for two chicken strip baskets The one pictured was my  piece (count them only ) Not to mention they were more like nuggets measuring just a few inches long Now this is not the DQ norm and I was embarrassed because I assured somebody that they actually have good fast food not just soft serve Lol Fail
