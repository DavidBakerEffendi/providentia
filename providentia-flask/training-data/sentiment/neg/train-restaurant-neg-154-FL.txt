I have such mixed feelings about this place We have been here  different times The first time we were here we had a really good time golfing but a not so great experience with our server He was intrusive and irritated when we told him that we would be golfing and then heading in to eat dinner at a table It was a little uncomfortable but we brushed it off

Since we had such a great time golfing my son wanted to celebrate his th birthday by going there with a couple of his friends The kids had a wonderful time but our waiter was atrocious He was really inappropriate from the get go We (the parents) ordered beers and he sat and remarked about each of our ages in relation to his own for an awkward amount of time He also made odd comments including a super offensive one about them being retardedly busy He continually forgot orders and I continually had to call him over to remind him and repeat myself over and over This was so bad that I couldnt engage with son as much as I would like to After the incident I tried calling Top Golf to complain and Was put on hold for about  minutes only to be told to email them I emailed them and got no response 

We came here a third time just a few days after the party on my sons actual birthday for a quick hour of golfing in the morning It was just my son my husband and I that day and it wasnt busy at all Our waiter was amazing which is really the only reason for the second star

I really like playing at Top Golf but the waiter situation is really offputting It was downright uncomfortable twice which is not ok when you are spending at least a hundred bucks if not more The worst part is that the Top Golf management doesnt even care enough to respond to complaints Oh well
