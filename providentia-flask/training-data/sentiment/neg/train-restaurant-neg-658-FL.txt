Slowest possible service imaginable  Avoid this place and save your time and money  Today I sat in this drive through a total of  minutes  I ordered the assorted dozen so it wasnt anything crazy  There were two cars ahead of me and each took about  minutes to clear the window  The person directly in front of me got a coffee only  When I pulled up to the window I was not greeted by anyone for  minutes  There were employees doing various jobs next to the window occasionally making eye contact but nothing  Even if they opened the window and told me it would be a couple minutes that would be a good start  I considered driving away twice but then saw a woman beginning to put my order together  There were  bags of food and an assortment of coffees being set on the counter next to the window  I can only assume it was for the people behind me  This location is mismanaged and extremely inefficient  I will never go to this location or any Dunkin Donuts in general ever again  Sorry I cheated on you Bosa Donuts I learned my lesson
