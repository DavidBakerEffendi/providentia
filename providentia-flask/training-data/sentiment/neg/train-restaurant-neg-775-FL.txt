I love Chipotle but this location is just careless I put in an order online to pickup in an hour and when I got there it wasnt made They simply forgot The cashier even said oh I dont know why it didnt go through with no apology To make things a worse experience I found that they didnt include every ingredient I asked for in my order by the time I got home They forgot  items and I didnt have the energy to go back to have it remade I dont understand how my order was messed up with extra time even after they were already over an hour late with making it to begin with I wont be eating at this particular Chipotle again
