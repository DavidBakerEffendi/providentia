I know a lot of us had been to Dennys on Gilbert and Germann Have to post this coz I am so disgusted with the service Ok our server was fine no problem with that The food as always came in after over half an hour  its a Sunday brunch so theyre swamped The coffee mug was dirty and heavily stained I ordered mediumrare steak and what did I get Almost RAW bloody fresh piece of meat Judge for yourself I did not complain coz I dont want to make a scene nor for them to recook coz the kids are starving at this point Sorry Im unable to post the pic but IT WAS DISGUSTING
