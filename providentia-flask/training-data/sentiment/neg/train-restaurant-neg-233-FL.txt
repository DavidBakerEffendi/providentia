Been to this location several times and its always a disappointment Coffee has always been lukewarm food comes to you and your party all all different times and lady time we met friends there for evening dessert there was very little choices the racks were empty There was one dessert that looked good and we wanted several slices but was told they only will sell that pie wholereally Its pm and you wont sell several pieces of pie on the chance someone comes in before closing and wants a whole pie They seem to only be able to employ kids there so customer service is below par
