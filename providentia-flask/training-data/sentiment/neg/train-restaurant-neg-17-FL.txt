My love for the Stuffed French toast and the sandwiches here Ive tried the Pot roast dip and Reuben in two other locations brought me to try this Gilbert location  Inviting live music (female vocals with acoustic guitar) wafted through the open windows and door as I walked in  Its a bit chilly in here but I always have a sweater in the car for times like this  Noticed I didnt have to wear it for long so someone mustve taken notice and turned AC down thank you

I tried the JP Grilled cheese with salad Brava tots and my beloved Stuffed French toast  I enjoyed the albeit oversalted grilled cheese made with garlicroasted jalapeos white cheddar and cream cheese on satisfyinglytoasty French bread until I reached a corner of the halfsandwich and tasted something more akin to detergentcleaner httpswwwyelpcombizphotosevenstevenssandwichesgilbertselectiOsmVJoPipnQjwRHmhxg  To cleanse my tongue I switched to the brava tots which tasted great with their paprika dusting and garlic aioli but I would order this again with the aioli on the side so that I may control how much I consume  Went back to the sandwich and again tasted something akin to glass cleaner  Took the secondhalf home to see if it too was handled with a contaminated glove I will update soon

All of the food comes out around the same time including the French toast since it is an entree you may order anytime of day here (within business hours of course) and I was already disappointed from the presentation alone httpswwwyelpcombizphotosevenstevenssandwichesgilbertselectKhKZozQyIgoWECBpw  Besides the actual uninspired plating the bread looked shrunken and after the first bite I felt like either this had been sitting for a long time prior or perhaps the bread used was more than a day old  Also there wasnt much of the sweet cream cheese stuffed in between the old shrunken bread  Gilberts version made me want to weep as I knew how great it couldve been

Im hoping that my subpar experience here in Gilbert was due to shabby kitchen staff skills and not to my toofrequent visits to a chain  I do admire Even Stevens dedication to helping out local communities this locations partners are Open Arms Care Center United Food Bank Boys  Girls Clubs of the East Valley and A New Leaf but I think Ill just visit the Tempe and Scottsdale locations from now on  I need to see if my hypothesis on Tempe and Scottsdale having the better kitchen staff skills after all )
