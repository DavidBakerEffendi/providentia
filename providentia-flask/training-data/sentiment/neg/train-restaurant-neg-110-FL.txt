Chicken crusts all over the floor in the dining area The chicken was so salty it wasnt edible I had high hopes for this place but the dead parking lot says a lot My tongue is still burning from all the salt  Staff stands around doing nothing when the place is dead Even for fast food sometimes managers will walk around and ask how everything was Not this place Sooo salty Blah
