I give it two stars for a few reasons 

On the good note the ice cream is really cool  It is a really awesome concept and the ice cream is actually really good

However on that day the boy behind the counter was eating all the toppings in the back not to mention we could not find anywhere to sit because all the booths were dirty from previous visitors who hadnt just left because they ice cream spills were hardened  The employees hadnt come to clean the booths or chairs It wasnt just one but almost all of the seating was dirty  We sat at the cleanest table we could find only to be bothered by flies and gnats one flew into my ice cream and I threw it away  It was gross There were a ton of flies and gnats

The ice cream was great the cleanliness and service not so great
