We had a great time right up until the very last minute  We ate and drank and had a blast  Tija our server was attentive and friendly food was good and the beer was cold  My buddy and I split a bucket of beer  When the game play was over we even added extra time our server asked if we wanted anything else and we did say no  Tija brings the bill and we paid by card when she returned after running the card she informs us that the lane number sign would turn purple indicating we would need to leave  Its automatic she says but we were not informed of this until we had already paid and tipped  We were surrounded but close to twenty empty lanes so we just sat there finishing our beers thinking we were not interfering with anyone Next thing we know we are surrounded by about six staff members and asked to move to one of the bars because they needed our lane for the next guests with a bit of attitude by our server  I totally get that we were tying up a lane if they were busy but it is August in Gilbert so there were many lanes available due to the heat and humidity I can also understand if we had been causing trouble or were being obnoxious but we were not it was just the two of us  It just put a damper on what was actually a real fun evening  I will think twice about returning
