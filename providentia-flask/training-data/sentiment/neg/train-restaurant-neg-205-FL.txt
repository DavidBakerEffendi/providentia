Game play is fun but Im not sure the level of service is worth the price
I used to go there all the time in the first year or so it was opened but since then their standards for the serving staff have seriously gone down hill

Im a pretty patient person when it comes to servers but the last few times Ive gone Ive had to track someone down to get service at our bay

Lets just take last night for example
My friends and I were for more than  minutes before someone finally came to the table to just say hello and take drink orders Luckily in that time wed decided on food otherwise who knows how long it would have been before we could have ordered
We had eaten most of our food and had a refill of chips on the way (thanks to a food runner) before our server brought out my friends drink
Shed forgotten it was at the bar and instead of having a new one made shed brought the drink to the table with almost all the ice melted We had to track her down again so we could ask to get a new one made
We saw food runners and bussers more than twice the number of times we saw our actual server the whole night and the place was not busy at all

On top of the less than stellar service the food is overpriced for what you get While yes some of it is excellent and the concepts are interesting most is mediocre at best

Recommendation
If you do go there choose earlier in the day when youll spend less on game play The savings at that time might at least be worth what you pay for overall experience
