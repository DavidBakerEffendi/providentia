I wrote a negative review  months ago and things got better for awhile but it seems this location has fallen back into its old bad ways Last weekend we tried the new waffle chicken tenders They were given to us cold This weekend after placing our order we waited  minutes for our food and was told our order was never given to the staff to make Then they gave our order to the wrong person so we had to wait for them to remake it Then they gave us the wrong bagel and cream cheese and gave us  egg and cheese wraps that were ice cold corporate needs to come in and take over There are always different staff members working so staff turnover must be a problem As a suggestion they should call out order numbers or names rather than the type of food that was ordered as many people order the same thing
