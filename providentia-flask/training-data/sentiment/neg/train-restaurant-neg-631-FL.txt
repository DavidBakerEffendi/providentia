You cant win on food alone We are huge fans of The Hub We go there weekly We were happy to support their latest endeavor when they first opened It was not awesome 

So we came back todayit was seat yourself  which wouldnt have been an issue if there were actually seats to choose from No jokeon the bar side there was ONE HALF of a clean table to sit at The rest were dirty Not filled with people dirty The restaurant side wasnt much better about  tables were full of people the rest were dirty with  to choose from So a fairly empty restaurant with  tables to choose from 

We sat

We waited

Finally a guy with a bucket of cleaning solution in one hand stopped by to give us menus

Then we waited

The bartender was busting her butt She covered the bar and was the only reliable face we saw After about  minutes we finally asked someone if we could order food The food came out quickly  and was delicious However no one stopped by to check on us which would have been helpful since we didnt get any salad dressing

We watched another patron rip into the manager and walk out Honestly the place was dirty and neglected I hate to be so brutally honest but there isnt any way to make it sound better
