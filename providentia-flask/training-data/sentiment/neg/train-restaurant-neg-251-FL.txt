Had breakfast with husband there for the first and last time  Confusing when you enter the front door and no one to help you figure out the route  My French toast was served stone cold the fruit cup was mediocre and my husband had to go up to the counter to get the rest of his order  It was sitting on the counter and was of course cold  Very very noisy with kids running around the place kids screaming and wait staff walking around calling out peoples names  Not a very friendly place to eat  All you get with the meal is the entre everything else is ala carte including coffee and juice  Quite expensive for what we got  I would not go back there again  I had high hopes for this place but a big disappointment  Save your money
