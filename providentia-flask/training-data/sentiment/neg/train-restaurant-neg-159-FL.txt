Tried to go to Top Golf for the first time today As we made our way up the steps this morning with a driver in hand we were stopped mid way by what looked like a Manager (I purposely say stopped vs greeted because her demeanor was nasty) She berated me  my daughter like naughty children  keep in mind Im middle aged  The associate was unapologetic when she proceeded to say and I quote Theres  things Number  You cannot bring in your own clubs Number  Theres no drinks allowed 
OK  the whole point of going out this morning was to try out my new driver  spend a fatherdaughter day with my kiddo My daughter was carrying an unopened bottle of water its not like it was a soda or a bottle of Jack Daniels Get over it lady
So to your establishment I say number   the whole point of a driving range is to practice with the equipment you have to improve your game so your rule is as ridiculous as telling a bowler they cant bring their own equipment into a bowling alley  number   its hot in AZ  its appropriate to carry water with you when playing an outdoor sport 
This place is a racket
My guess is that they cant trust customers with golf clubs  are worried youre going to steal theirs Guess what If you cant figure out how to come up with a process that protects you while allowing people to enjoy the game as its intended to be you dont deserve to be in business And while youre at it next time apologize even if its insincere I might not be as tempted to take time out of my day to write a detailed review about a horrible experience that you delivered before I could even get my foot through the door
