Feeling so sad and disappointed  Been so happy eating here until today  Ordered a pie with sausage a salad two orders of garlic knots  After we place our whole order the girl tells us its a  minute wait for the pizza  Why not let us know in the beginning  She said they have individual slices availableI had my hungry husband and kids with me so we settled for the slices which costs us much more than buying the pie  Felt ripped off  Also the pizza was not really hot  Dont know if Ill  be back
