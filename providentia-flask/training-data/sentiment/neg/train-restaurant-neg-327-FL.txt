Though we were initially pretty impressed with the restaurant our hopes for an enjoyable and filling lunch came crashing down pretty quickly 

I do agree on a few points with some of the previous reviews The chips and salsas were great I asked for some extra hot salsa and our server (Adrien) quickly made up some extra hot salsa that along with the two other types already served ended up being pretty much all I ate 

As others have already stated the service was great the atmosphere was nice but we walked out the door looking for somewhere to go eat 

My wife ordered the Enchilada De Espinaca (sauteed spinach monterey jack cheese and mushroom enchilada) and asked to have chicken added She ended up with what looked good at first but turned out to be steamed whitemeat chicken and spinach ONLY inside the enchilada No mushrooms or cheese 

I ordered the Chile Relleno and was expecting to be asked if i wanted cheese or whatever Picadillo was but since I was just a little busy getting my daughter to not create a new lab experiment with the salsa and her sprite I pretty much hoped for the best when our server just walked away I was very suprised to find ground beef (yes hamburger) sliced almonds and a semisweet spice mix filling my relleno Since I enjoy almonds and most other nuts as much as my daughters enjoy sushi that blew my whole meal Did I mention the almonds sprinkled on the side dish (some kind of panfried potatoes) 

The two stars are only granted for two itemsa decent kids menu with enough options to even satisfy my two picky chitlens and the fact the person who appeared to be the head chef came out of the back and personally apologized to us and comped the entire meal (including the corndog and chicken fingers my girls scarfed down) 

We may give it one more try because we are always looking for someplace we can get at least decent food while also satisfying our two princesses 

I hope they can get the back of the line in order since i dont know any restaurant that can survive longterm on happy hour chip and dessert fans
