Decent food but the place needs a good cleaning feels run down and dirty Clean the place up a little change to decor and lose the carpet in the dining area its very dirty and carpet does not belong in a dining room The food quality at this Nandos has gone down a bit I would blame this on management Even the wait staff says managers all have different ways of running the restaurant This should be fixed all managers need to be on the same page so everything works smooth Its not rocket science just common sense Come on guys fix this place so I dont have to drive farther away to another Nandos
