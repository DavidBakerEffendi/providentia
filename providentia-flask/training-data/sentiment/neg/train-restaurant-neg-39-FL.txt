Worse place ever Called and ordered  Shrimp Lo mein  large The order that came was chicken I called to let them know and the women confirmed she will send someone with the correct order 

The food arrives they ask us to give them the previous order for the new one We gave it to them and the man asks for  difference Mind you I gave a  dollar tip He then yells at us because the previous food feels light and that we changed our order 

Normally I dont like to complain but this was stupid service In fact I thinks it silly when people do sometime This time its important to do so 

The shrimp lo mein that arrived at shrimp that clearly is old and has gone bad Now I dont have any food and they wont return my money 

Basically dont order from this place Rudeold food and on top of that no shame in yelling at you when you accommodate the poor service

PS They say they record you You will not be told you are being recorded and that is illegal in the state of Arizona 

This place should not be in business
