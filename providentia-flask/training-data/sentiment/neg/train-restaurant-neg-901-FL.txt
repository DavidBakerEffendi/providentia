Food was great but service was not good Was sitting at the bar instead of a seat Maybe thats why my order was wrong They were too busy to check on me so after  minutes of trying to wave down the bartender I just ate what was brought Pizza is pizza and I will give them that is tasted amazing its just not what I ordered Plus what I had ordered was more expensive of a slice Anyway long story short get a table
