Went for a pain in my upper left back molar They came up with an extensive bill of almost  To remove tarter in between two teeth 
I went to another place or a nd opinion and they removed the tarter for free
Wow 
Turns out the pain wasnt even the tarter it was a wisdom tooth coming in I almost had to pay  that wouldnt have even fixed the problem
