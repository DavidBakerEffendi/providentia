If you have  minutes to burn waiting for lunch togo orders this is the place for you I ordered one of the simplest items on the menu (a vegetable salad) and I still waited over  minutes for my orderId probably still be waiting for it if I didnt flag someone down asking where the food was About  people who arrived after me and were eating there got served before me Its like they cared more about the dinein customers more than the togo orders If thats the case stick to what youre mediocre at and dont offer a togo option
