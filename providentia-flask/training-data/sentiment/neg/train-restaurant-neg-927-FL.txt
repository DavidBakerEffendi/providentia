Food not worth the wait Stood in line for  minutes just to order Saw the (presumably) owner headed out for the day stop and chat with some people in front of us in line Mentioned just how busy they have been Saw the obviously long line and didnt do anything to address the situation Yep the entire time only one of their two order windows was open One  I guess Im the sucker and the jokes on me
