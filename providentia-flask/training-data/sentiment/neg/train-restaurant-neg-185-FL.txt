IF you get a server named Austin RUN He is absolutely terrible Weve had him twice and both times he has forgotten orders at our table charged us for drink orders that we didnt order forgot drinks ETC He tried to get us kicked out and was a complete AHOLE to us about ordering drinks at the table I get if you arent able to do something but be polite about it  dont act like a snotty child We havent been back in over a month because of the awful experience we had last time Its a shame because we really enjoyed this place and spent a whole lot of money on golffooddrinks each time we came in 

The only reason this place isnt getting one star is because of the food As far as whats good the banhmi is amazing my favorite thing on the menu The queso dip is excellent but the salsa is a bit bland for what you pay Turkey and avocado wrap is great and both the fries and tator tots are excellent Flatbreads are good as well ) All the food items are pretty solid if you cant tell 

We love this place and would love to come back but they need to hire better help It really determines how the entire night is going to go We all pay a lot of money to come here make the experience enjoyable PLEASE
