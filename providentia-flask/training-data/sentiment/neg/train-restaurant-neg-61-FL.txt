This is one of the loudest echoing sports bars I have ever been to pretty bad when the first thing you notice when you walk in is the noise level and I have been here  times  Even if I am out to enjoy a game with my friends I dont want to have to yell across the table at them 

The waiter was excellent and very friendly but I will not be going back
