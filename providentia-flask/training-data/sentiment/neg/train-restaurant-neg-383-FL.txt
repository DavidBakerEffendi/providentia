The good Ive ordered the same item both times Ive been here and it was delicious It was the camaron poblano asada It had shrimp with mushrooms sour cream and I believe vegetables stuffed in a poblano pepper and a skirt steak carne asada wrapped around it on a bed of lime rice and corn Excellent choice 

Heres the not so good There are quite a few other Mexican restaurants in the area that have way better food with lower prices We have gone two times the first time it was  for  entrees  margaritas guac and a kids meal for our toddler Yesterday when we went it totaled out to  Our server happened to be great yesterday (Theresa)HOWEVER on our first visit the hostess placed us all the way in the furthest room in the back completely by ourselves (even though over half of the restaurant was empty) We found this very odd were confused and ended up asking them to move our table Yesterday the hostess placed us away from the front section again Our seating wasnt in the far back of the restaurant this time but it was another back room by ourselves Additionally there were workers fixing booth seats and standing on ladders installing ceiling lights RIGHT next to us Arent these things supposed to be taken care of prior to opening up shop We were considering making reservations here for Fathers Day and bringing the rest of our family but now we have decided otherwise
