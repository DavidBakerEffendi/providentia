This place continues to declinewe have been increasingly disappointed each time and last night was the final nail in the coffin  We called ahead to see if the game we wanted to watch was on there First the person on the phone said I think we get that channel Can you check Yes that game is on I am watching it right now We were there within  minutes  but it wasnt on  We were seated and  of the  tvs in our section were all showing the Ohio State Wisconsin game which no one was watching  I asked if one screen (any of the ) could be switched since none of the tables were watching  they said no
   Our poor server had a party of  in addition to ours and other tables (i was in the restaurant industry for years you dont do this) so we rarely saw him When he first came to the table we said we werent going to order right away  he said And what will you have  Apparently waiting to order wasnt an option 
   The two at the host stand were repeatedly asked how long the wait was and repeated the same answer each timeTheres no way of knowing because the ASU game is on The biggest issue with that was that it was only on one screen in our half of the dining room  so it wasnt impacting table turns much but most guests just left upon being told this Another group who came in when we did had tried to call ahead for seating and were told they dont do that They were quite upset to see several tables pulled together for a different large group coming inapparently that rule doesnt apply to everyone 
   The food was okay but just okay Average food and terrible service maybe used to fly in Gilbert but new competition is springing up every day We will be taking our business there and giving them a shot because we will never return here
