This place was great when it first opened but has since gone steadily downhill I had brought some friends for a round on Monday night when the place wasnt very busy First off there was only one person at the register and a line of people Meanwhile there are  employees talking it up over by where you check in for a bay After waiting  minutes to get my buddies signed up for cards we check in and are told it would be  minutes for a table to be bussed No big deal We decide to grab some drinks at the bar but no one is there to take an order we keep waiting until my friend goes down to the other end to tell the guy hey we wanna buy some beers No menu was given so we didnt know the beer list We ask the guy what IPAs they have He says only one and the one he names isnt an IPA We decide to look at the taps and see that there are like  IPAs up there Either the guy didnt know anything about beers he was selling or it was his first day cause every question we had he had to go down the bar and look then come back Back and forth After about  minutes of that horrible beer experience I ask the girl if our table is ready she fumbles around on the computer and I like oh yeah sorry its ready I think if they werent so busy talking to one another they could have showed us our bay way earlier It seems like everyone that works there is just standing around and collecting a paycheck Clearly the management skills in this establishment need to be worked on cause if I run my business the way these managers do I would be out of business I dont plan on coming back anytime soon and feel sorry for my buddies first experience here being a lousy one
