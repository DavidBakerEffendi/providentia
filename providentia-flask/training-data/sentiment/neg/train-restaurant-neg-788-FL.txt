This is by far the WORST chipotle Ive ever experienced Im not sure how theyre still in business to be honest 
First off every single time Ive ever ordered from this location they have gotten my order wrong Either there are items missing from my order or like last time something I didnt order  like a HAIR in my food The worst was when I ordered from their app on my way home from work a few weeks ago I accidentally ordered from the location at chandler mall and not from this one like I had originally thought After I had realized that I ordered from the wrong location I was super embarrassed because obviously that was my fault The thing that was actually upsetting was the way that the staff went about it from there When I asked if they could just make it at this location since I had already paid for it on the app the guy at the register said No because you could have already picked up the one at the other location Excuse me I couldnt even believe he said that I sat at one of the tables while the other employees just looked at each other and then proceeded to ignore that I was even there At the time I was  months pregnant and obviously showing The fact that your manager said that it was impossible for them to make my order there was so ridiculous So I had to drive  min the other way (during rush hour on a week day) just to get something your staff could have eradicated right there Thankfully I got home an hour later with cold food Ive tried to give them chance after chance (mainly because theyre close to my house) but Im done with this location Unless you want your order wrong hair in your food and a rude staff dont come here
