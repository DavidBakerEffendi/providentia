Crappy customer service food takes forever and staff is rude messy and unprofessional Save your money Our table was Dirty and wet we waited mins for food to come out and  additional mins for a banana split before leaving Dylan the waiter got pissed we decided to leave after mins of waiting  and stated Well Were busy here youre not the only ones Apparently multitasking paying attention to detail and providing  customer service is too large of a task  Hmm hes going far in life I will not return Dennys you and your staff are getting classy missing teeth wrinkled clothes and attitudes hmm every drop outs dream job
