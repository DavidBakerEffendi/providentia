Well that was disappointing  Cant summon any humor for how disappointing that was  Great first impression nice big open airy restaurant patio was open and has tiled tables fireplace pretty windows with big leafy designs dug it even talked about maybe moving the rehearsal dinner here

That wouldve been a mistake  

Seated were given chips and salsa  They were fine  Server stopped by asking if we needed a few more minutes  Fiancee responded we needed a few more menus  My order were their seafood enchiladas and chipotle albondigas  The soup was oily and the meatballs fell apart upon contact so were a bit too mushy  Some nice spiciness but just too greasy and broth too thin   minutes after ordering our entrees showed up  What a joke  Billed as seafood enchiladas mushy enchiladas filled with  part shrimp and fake crabmeat  part cheese  Couldnt taste the seafood at all  Ranchero sauce was fine  Beans and rice were acceptable  Overheard server say to another table Was it at least okay  

No  Never again  What a total waste of  hours
