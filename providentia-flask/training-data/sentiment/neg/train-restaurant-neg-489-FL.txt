Our first time here and most likely our last My wife had the Pesto Cavatappi with chicken breast I had the Bacon Mac  Cheeseburger and we also had the pc Pot Stickers To start the pot stickers came out on a plate looked like they were smashed flat I thought this was odd but this was are first time here so maybe they do them different The filling was almost nonexsistant Not happy with these at all Later a table next to us  also ordered the same pot stickers and they were more plump like they should be My wife liked hers but its really is mostly noodles and skimpy on the chicken My Bacon Mac and Cheeseburger was not bad but it was already just warm not really hot like it should be We both had the regular size so it really feels like your eating so much noodles The small size would have been better In mine too the meat was not that plentiful again you feel like your just eating a big bowl of mac noodles Mine was pretty dry could have used more cheese I know this was our first time here but in this day and age with so many choices out there if a place really doesnt impress me on the first visit then I dont usually come back This cost us  with two fan drinks and a very average cookie Like others have said not a lot of seating when it gets busy So that being said Im sure I can be more picky then others  but this is how I feel I have to give this place a Doh
