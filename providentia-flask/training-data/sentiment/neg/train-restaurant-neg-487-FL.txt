Food is amazing I love it but the service is HORRIBLE They have young kids working that I dont think know how to read Its sad Ive been here  times cuz I love the food but I have to go back every time because they dont read the instructions The management staff is a joke and they really need to work on training employees on how to take care of the customer I cant ever take friends here because I might be embarrassed by the service
