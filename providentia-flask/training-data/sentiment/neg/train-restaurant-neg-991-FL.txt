For some reason most of the sushi places in gilbert close for a couple hours in the afternoon not sure why Since we didnt know about this quirk of Gilberts we tried two places before ending up here I even double checked their archaic website to make sure they were open They havent bothered to update their hours though so they were closed when we arrived but opened minutes later so we decided to stick around 

We were given drinks and menus by the kid who sat us and then we didnt see a waitress for at least  minutes We decided to go with the all you can eat option even though it only has rolls (no appetizersdesserts) and doesnt include their specialty rolls  We ordered a rainbow roll a salmon roll a shrimp tempura roll and a las vegas roll It was another  minutes before we got our food (we almost left clearly we should have) meanwhile a couple that had come in a few minutes after us had gotten all their food was getting ready to leave 

Both the raw rolls were WARM and frankly disgusting We couldnt finish either of them The fried rolls were decent the tempura shrimp was overcooked After theyd given us our rolls another waitress pops up and asks if we were given our miso which we hadnt been of course So we got that partway through our meal Then the waitress just disappears again and theres no one around that we can flag down for refills  Their Soy sauce is nasty its strangely sweet and very watery were actually curious if they didnt accidentally put in some other sauce Weve never tasted any soy sauce thats remotely similar to that 

When our dour faced waitress finally showed up again we explained how the raw rolls were gross and asked if we could instead be charged for the rolls separately instead of the all you can eat (saying wed pay for the bad rolls as well) since after that crap we really werent in the mood for more sushi and hadnt ordered nearly  worth of food She very rudely refused to do that and told us wed have to pay for the rolls we didnt eat regardless of whether we liked them or not We also asked for refills (our first in the hour wed been stuck there) and she actually had the nerve to say half glass Total cheapskates

In my annoyance as she was walking away I said  star quite a bit more loudly than I had intended Which she obviously heard because she came back (smiling for the first time) and said since we were new customers they wouldnt charge us for the uneaten rolls She then proceeded to rave about the watermelon slices like those alone could give them a good review They were however delicious and because my hubbys allergic I got to eat all  slices lol I really cant give them credit for good watermelon though

We definitely wont be going back
