Wellwe needed a place to have late lunchearly dinner ( generations) Close by was Nandos You enter the restaurant and its very pretty and clean The hostess asked us (about  timesok maybe only  but it felt like ) if we wanted to sit near the bar because it was happy hour or if wed like a booth in the general restaurant We opted for the general restaurant As we sat down at the table we noticed how much stuff was all over the tablehonestly we couldnt even open the menus until we rearranged and put some stuff out of the way The chips and salsa came very fast Now I say salsa but it was actually hot sauce I say hot sauce but it wasnt hot at all Hot if youre from Minnesota maybe but it was not good There were apparently  different kinds but you couldnt prove it by me We ordered drinks I ordered a habanero infused margarita (gee maybe Ill get some heat from that) Let me say our waiter was very niceThe margarita gets a  limes from me It was interesting and did have a little bite to it All of a sudden we had this weird fish smell that wafted our way from the table behind us Oooo weee it was fishynot something we expected at a mexican restaurant It was an uncomfortable fishy smell and thats all Im saying 

Our food didnt take too long to comeabout  minutes I ordered the seafood relleno Now I love my rellenos This was not good It wasnt bad it just wasnt good It came with beans and rice and they were cooked very well and had great taste The relleno had shrimp that was rubbery The sauce and cheese on it was good The number  that one of us ordered was reported to be very good and the border chimichanga was alright 

The company was great The waiter was friendly attentive and not a pest The food and drinks wereok

My suggestionshostess person dont attack people when they first come in There is a fine line between friendly and creepy 

Salsa make some real salsa or at least have your tomato tasting hot sauce have some heat
