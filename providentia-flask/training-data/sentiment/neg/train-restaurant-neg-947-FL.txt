Clearly Ive missed what all the hype is about

Went by the place at around  parking lot was full and there was a line out the door  Left and came back about an hour and half laterno line lots of parking

Ordered the farm burger and  hot dogsthat and two drinks  

Hamburger  nothing special  Came with two leaves of partially brown lettuce and two rather anemic looking rings of red onionnot two slicestwo rings

Hot dogs  actually not bad  Came with onion and homemade relish  

Fries that came with the above we ok but again nothing special

So whats my assessment

 Nothing special
 Way expensive
 Odd that theyre a farm restaurant but yet they had such sad looking produce
 Glad I didnt have to wait in lineI wouldnt be a happy camper if I did
 Places to get a better burgerespecially on a price to quality ratioIn and Out Five Guys Fudruckers

One final point that ranks somewhere between weird and disgusting  The drinkcondiment station shares the same drainage trough  So when youre down stream from the condiments getting your soda you get to watch ketchup mayo ranch dressing etc float by you as you get your soda  Kind of a nasty sight in my book
