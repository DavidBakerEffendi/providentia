Been out to Joes Farm Grill twice and both times Ive been SO excited about going there and both times I have left well disappointed 

This place is another restaurant from the Joes Real BBQ gang (delish) The place is actually very cool you can eat out under the stars if the wind is in the right direction (there are horses close by) and they have a machine that dispenses as much ranch dressing as you can use Gotta love that But the food has been underwhelming and on the verge of boring Ive tried the burgers grilled pizzas and salads For me they are not much better then what you could get at your local mall food court I know its crazy for me to say that but considering that much of what they serve is organic I just dont feel or taste a difference here 

The saving grace here is the coffee shop next door called you got it Coffee Shop They have lot of YUME desserts and make a some great coffee drinks Oh get this they hand pack there espresso machine no click click turbospresso machines here I like the way that sounds I think I will steal that from myself 

Side note this place is in the middle of nowhere becoming somewhere bring a map
