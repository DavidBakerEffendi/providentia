I have been eating at pita jungle for years and love it Everything is delicious and fresh However in the last  months or so something is very off with main items on your menu Its like the kitchen staff doesnt remember how to make the food anymore Literally making the entrees inedible I got the Mediterranean chicken salad recently and there was over a cup of parsley in it It tasted so bad I had to throw it away I thought it was a fluke no biggie But I went again and the hummus tasted like there was rancid garlic in it It tasted awful My mother in law went recently got a sandwich and she said she had to throw half of it away because it tasted so bad And its a sandwich she gets regularly What is going on Gilbert location Did something change Because thats now  separate times this has happened At this point I cant recommend your restaurant anymore I hope things can get back to normal soon
