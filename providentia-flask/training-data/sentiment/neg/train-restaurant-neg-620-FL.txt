I decided to come here during my lunch break and it was a big mistake the location is very convenient because how close it is but I will not be returning Soda was going flat burger was sloppy buns were flattened like sliced bread and it was barely warm after a  minute drive Also their fries were unbearably soggy and over salted Ive worked fast food before and at a Dairy Queen Grill before it doesnt take much time or effort to keep a meal hot
