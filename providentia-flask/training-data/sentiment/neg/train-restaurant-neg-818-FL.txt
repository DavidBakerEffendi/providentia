I dont get it I dont get the high rating on this restaurant Sorry guys 

When we arrived the parking lot was packed but once inside we were seated almost immediately out on the patio Unfortunately we were not seated with menus Our server visited our table twice before correcting this error One of our salsa bowls arrived at our table with caked on food bits After ordering our food we waited almost an hour for our entrees which were sincerely lacking in yum

I ordered the Faja Pasta  so maybe its partially my own fault for order a pasta dish at a Mexican restaurant  but it was not very good The pasta was very doughy and many of the noodles were clumped together The bread it came with while not awful was partially soggy from sitting on the plate too long Saving grace was the chicken I had with it It was juicy and had a nice kick One star for the chicken

Fiance ordered a seafood enchilada which he found lacking in seafood and smothered in too much cheese 

We ate until we were full enough to call it a meal As unsatisfying as it was 

Second star is for our server because even though he was a smidge on the slow side he was trying bless his heart He refilled my soda before it was completely empty so thats a plus for me 

I dont think well be returning
