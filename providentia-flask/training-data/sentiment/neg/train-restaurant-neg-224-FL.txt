C  I stopped by here on our way to his first performance of Pinocchio Its fairly close to the theater and I wanted to try it out Plenty of parking for sure Since we stopped in around  on a Thursday the place was pretty empty I checked out the different pastries that filled the glass case Yum But we werent there for goodies The young lady at the counter was a bit aloof I told her this was our first time at Kneaders and she just stared at me like so Not that I needed any help but its nice when employees acknowledge that you picked their restaurant instead of the other  or so around Oh well
I ordered C the Kids Grilled Cheese () which came with a bag of chips bottle of Chocolate Milk and a frosted sugar cookie The sandwich is only half a sandwich so if your kid is the hungry type or can normally eat more this might not be enough You have to be the judge on that one For C it was fine The bread had a nice toast on it and the cheese was ooey gooey goodness C said it was bangin Kid cracks me up Cant say much for the chips or chocolate milk because theyre prepackaged C enjoyed the frosted sugar cookie so well assume it was ok
I ordered the Veggie Avocado Sandwich with Asiago cheese () I think the price is high for what you get Sure the bread is decent but hey are a bit scant on the fillings After all this is a  vegi sandwich so it should be loaded up with stuff tomatoes lettuce sprouts mushrooms bean paste cucumber shredded carrots Avocado etc but it isnt You get a couple nice slices of tomatoe a slice of cheese a couple lettuce leaves some red onion rings and Avocado BUT imagine getting a Roast Beef or Turkey sandwich opening it up and seeing some of the beef or Turkey with green tinge to it Gross right Well when you order basically an Avocado sandwich you expect the Avocado to be fresh not with some brownblack bruised flesh Yuk Why why would anyone assembling an Avocado sandwich not cut off the bad parts I dont care if the Avocado if in perfect slices What I do care about is that if I hadnt opened up my sandwich to look I possible would have eaten that gross rotten Avocado (Can you tell I love Avocado Well I do Im a So Cal kid I was raised on the stuff My parents used it a lot and I still love it But I digress) 
That being said I blame the management for poorly training the employess to recognize what is good and bad quality food I also blame the employees because there comes a point when you have to use COMMON SENSE Would you eat brownblack Avocado Is that something that you want on your Avocado sandwich If the answer is NO then why would you continue putting it on the sandwich And the assemblers in back were not that busy which isnt an excuse anyways but they need to put some pride in their work
This is where I stand on my soapbox for a moment You know how there are things in this world where the creater puts their name on it Like art work custom engines garments hand bags etc Maybe thats what we need in food Make the poeple who assemble or cook our food also include a slip of paper that says Lovingly created by Joe Schmo or whomever You get the picture I wonder if things would improve 
Interesting decor average (at best) customer service fair kids meal using produce that should be thrown out poor value sandwich  Stars
