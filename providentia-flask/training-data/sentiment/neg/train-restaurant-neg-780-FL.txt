I really dislike this entire chain  I have eaten a few and have not been impressed  They make these burritos look huge by packing them in flavorless overcooked rice then put a few ingredients on  They have additional items that you can buy a la carte to put on your burrito to add flavor but youd think they would be included  This is TexMex cafeteria food
