Absolutely forgettable bordering on yucky  We went for lunch today and my husband had a cheesesteak and it was unremarkable  Not good  not bad but where they earned the  star was on the kids menu  We ordered a regular hot dog for our son and even after asking them to remake it it resembled the hot dogs that are on a constant loop at a  Eleven  Not edible  I know that a hot dog isnt healthy fare but the hot dog was so yuck that it looked as though it had been cooked on high in a microwave and then left out for days  

So all of that being said the staff was very friendly and completely kind when I asked them to remake the hot dog  In the end it was just really poor quality food with poor preparation  We will not be returning
