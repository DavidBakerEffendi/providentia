The food here is really good but I hate that the employees are so miserable I cant get a smile out of them for the life of me Its sad that I said hi to the cashier and cook first The first time we came we literally sat their and watched them screw up  orders and had an oops oh well attitude  I refuse to eat in the store because their attitude seriously ruins my appetite Sad but true
