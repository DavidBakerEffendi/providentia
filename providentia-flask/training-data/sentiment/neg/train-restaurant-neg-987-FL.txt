I am wondering if the people reviewing this place positively have had actual authentic Thai food

I got a green curry which had cabbage (wtf) snow peas (wtf) no basil (double wtf) Its green curry which is SO Basic  Eggplant green bell peppers carrots and basil Simple

This to me was Chinese food masquerading as Thai 

I looked through the reviewsit seems like things are hit or miss What should one order when they come here I wonder 

So I guess if you want Authentic Thai Food go elsewhere If youre suburban and havent a clueenjoy

Fail
