I had a great time today at Top Golf with my family However my experience was only hindered by the staff and business organization of this franchise 
We were first greeted by a rude and inconsiderate employee who escorted us to our bay She seemed apathetic towards our experience explaining that there was no way to play any other games She explained to us that as out of state players we were able not able to have our own team Because of this the  of us were forced to play on two teams instead of being all able to compete against each other as desired Just as we had teed off we were introduced to our Bayhost a very impatient waitress She continually exclaimed HELLO as we were trying to watch our grandma hit the ball and took no message from the fact that we did not immediately turn around She explained to NOone the drinks and left before taking any orders She returned two minutes later to see if we need anything and didnt return for the rest our hour an a half stay at Top Golf 
I would love to return again for this fun family experience when I come back to Arizona but not until these kinks are knocked out
