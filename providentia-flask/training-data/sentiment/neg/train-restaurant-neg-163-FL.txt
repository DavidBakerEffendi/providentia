The golf range is really cool however the worst part about the place is the food I had food poisoning from it My family members had the same issues with top golfs food I asked what everyone ate that made them sick and they all said they had appetizers chicken in it Stay away from the chicken Im giving this place  stars only because the range is cool but over priced
