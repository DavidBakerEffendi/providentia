I wanted to like this place as it was reccommended to me by a friend but after giving it two shots I probably will not be returning  No complaints about service and it is a cute restaurant but the food quality is poor  Pollo rico is dry chips are just meh salsa is bland and it seems that everything is covered in so much cheese that you cant taste the food underneath  With the amount of Mexican restaurants available in the area do yourself a favor and skip this one
