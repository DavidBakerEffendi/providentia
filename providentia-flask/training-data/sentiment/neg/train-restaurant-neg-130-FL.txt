I used to love this place but the consistency is never there The very first time I tried their pizza I was blown away The crust was perfectly risen the mozzarella was golden brown and the pepperoni provided the finishing touch But Ive never had that same pizza Ive gone back over and over and over again accepted mistaken orders waited for remakes but ever since that first time its never been the same I ordered my usual pizza this evening and arrived to a wrong cheese on the pizza No big deal I waited for another  minutes (The accurate time a remake takes) And it looked perfect Until I got home I live off pecos road in between Gilbert road and Lindsay rd (so not very far) I immediately go to the kitchen to get a slice and when I open the box and pick up a slice Immediate disappointment You can still see the dough in the crust Im having to put the pie in my own oven to finish cooking I understand you were trying to get the pie out AFAP but I wouldve waited for that perfection I had the first time I wont give up on this place but I had to let you guys know It can be SOOOO much better Thank you
