My family used to eat here all the time but its been a good two years since we have ordered food here We always loved the hot pita specifically the Mediterranean roasted chicken (shawarma) We just ordered a takeout order tonight and it seems the chicken is now shredded and tastes and has the consistency of canned tuna I am so disappointed and could barely finish it My husband felt the same way Sadly we probably wont be back Please bring back the old chicken Pita Jungle
