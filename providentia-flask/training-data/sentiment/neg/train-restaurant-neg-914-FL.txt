If you would have asked before my last visit I would have given Casanova Bothers a  star rating Last night was my first visit to the new bigger location and from what I experienced they should have stayed in the old location We pulled in the place and it was a little over half full We asked for a table for two and were told there would be a wait or we could sit at the empty bar We said ok but we walked past a good  tables  of which were two tops that were vacant We asked the hostess if we could sit at one of those and she was like we are saving those incase we have a big party come in which is a stupid reason to refuse customers that are there One of the tables was a two top in the corner that even if a big party came in would have been of no use We sat down at the bar and waited looking at the half empty room joking as to why we had to sit at the bar The bar tender was running around with his head chopped off as several other staff members did nothing The blonde that looks mike the Aussie chick from pitch perfect did nothing the entire night She just wondered around and tried to look busy it was pretty fun to watch her try and look busy while at the same time doing nothing We watched her shuffle a pen back and forth between her hands as she pretended to ring up checks for a  minutes if not longer Only taking breaks to look over her shoulder to make sure her act was working 
We ordered the same three things we always order cesar wings and meatball pizza The salad came out with no plates Pitch perfect was asked if we could get some plates she vanished and never returned We asked two more people before getting plates Half of the salad didnt have dressing The wings came out and once again no plates We gave up on getting plates and settled for some more napkins and a refill The wings too were half unsauced I dont me not that much sauce I mean dry as in fried chicken The empty tables we were not allowed to sit at remained unfilled with the mythical large group still yet to appear The two topper in the corner was given to a group of two because they obviously were more special than my party of two since they showed up five minutes later 
The pizza which should have been the saving grace of the night came out The first slice I tore into was a little undercooked The normal light fluffy dough was not as light and fluffy this time I dont know if that is because the pizza didnt get a chance to fully cook or what All in all the three items we have been getting for the last two years NONE of them were up to the quality standards pre move The bill finally came after the bartender and a dishwasher exchanged numbers with the blonde at the end of the bar The bill for the  items we always order was yes you guess it more expensive than pre move Overall our first experience at the new location was lacking and made us long for the days of the old location As we drove away a night at our previous pizza place had us questioning if we would ever return
