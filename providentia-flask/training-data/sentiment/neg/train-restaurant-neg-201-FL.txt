I arrive at Top Golf with  frienda us all being  After being greeted by numerous attractive females I get through the line after paying  for membership and the entry fee Then I was told we cannot play because of only being  without an adult I understand rules and policies and I respect it but Tell me BEFORE I pay money to play Will not be going back I am Legally allowed to drive alone I work and I pay taxes But I cannot swing a golf club with an adult Awesome Thank Top Golf
