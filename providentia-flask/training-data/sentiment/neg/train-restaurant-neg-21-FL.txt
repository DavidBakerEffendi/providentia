The food was great My only problem was with the service The guy at the front counter was very friendly and it was clear he had great customer service skills My only problem was with the guy who served me my food Joe He threw it down in front of me without saying a word and walked off I saw him deliver food to other tables and he did not act that way Server needs to work on his customer service skills because he was down right rude
