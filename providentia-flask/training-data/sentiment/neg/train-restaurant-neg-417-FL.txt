Last year I would have given Pita Jungle a strong  stars but today like the tip I left  stars is still too generous My son asked to go to Pita Jungle after his Karate belt exam and I was thrilled as before todays experience I loved this place 
We arrived about  and it was packed with a wait no big deal About  minutes later we were seated Some guy who could have been off the street asked if he could get us something to drink (are you allowed to Guy Off The Street) We order my  year old a lemonade and I got the house white wine He brings my kid his drink in a kids cup with a lid and straw Im thinking if my kid doesnt complain then fine but its  outside and you are the one who is going to have to fill it up five times
He busied himself helping others who had just seated and eventually found his way back to us I ordered the California Beach Club and the kid got a Pita Crisp kids meal with turkey fruit and carrots 
We watched virtually every table get their food first prior to us getting served which was fine because we were enjoying the games on the kids menu 
Another waitstaff dropped the plates on our table like with a CLUNK Okay still doing fine but the kid has no utensils I look for the waiter and he has his back to the tables while he is chatting with the ownermanager Im trying to catch his eye he is laughing hadnt seen a smile before he sees me I wave the smile disappears He angrily stomps over and stares we need another set of utensils Okay Get one from another table and puts it on ours and walks away No How is everything Can I refill your cup Get you water 
By the time he makes it back to finish his chat my kid announces he needs more lemonade I wave the cup at him He stomps back Fills it up brings it back stomps away 
Drama ensues at the table next to us he has brought them their check and in a voice much too loud for waitstaff says You should have told me before I should charge you for it but if you dont want to pay for it I WILL EAT IT And stomps away to ring their bill The women are in shock and ask another waitstaff for a manager who meanders over and speaks quietly to them and gets the woman a drink she seems still unhappy with Im pretty sure they wont be back 
There is more I could tell you but you probably arent reading anymore  on my way out I stopped at the ownermanager while he was eating a huge plate at the bar and told him your waiter isnt doing you any favors He got annoyed and said Ill talk to him You do that while we eat anywhere else but at your restaurant
