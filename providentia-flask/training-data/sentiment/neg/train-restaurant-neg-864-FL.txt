Been coming to nados for a long time until tonight Ordered a taco and cheese enchilada Took a bite of the taco and it was sour I had to vomit in the bathroom The thing that really upsets me is the only thing the manager did was take it off the bill The whole meal was spoiled Will never go there again She blamed it on the tortilla
That was a Lie My girlfriend smelled the meat and it smelled rotton And tasted rotton Long time customer Last time there
