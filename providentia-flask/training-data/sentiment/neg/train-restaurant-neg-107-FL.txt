I had high hopes for Bushs Chicken I was hoping it would be a better version of Raising Canes but instead it was a lesser version of KFC 

We walked in and were welcomed with a pungent oily greasy smell that was offputting We were the only ones in line and were not greeted by anyone for the  minutes we were looking at the menu 

The prices werent bad but the gizzard meals on the menu mixed with the awful smell made us walk out and not eat here I have no desire to go back
