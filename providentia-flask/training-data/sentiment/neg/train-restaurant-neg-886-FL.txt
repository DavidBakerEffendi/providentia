I have recommend Casanova Bros to my friends for many years but last night I was sadly disappointed and wont recommend them anymore One of my favorite things about this restaurant was their authentic New York style pizza but last night my large deluxe pizza was a pre made crust that tasted like cardboard Ive had frozen pizza that tasted better They do have great customer service but for as expensive as their pizza is I want a fresh hand tossed crust
