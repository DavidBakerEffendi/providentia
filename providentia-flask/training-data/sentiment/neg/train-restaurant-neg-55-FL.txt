Went there for a birthday celebration and the hostess told us the wait was  minsso we decided to wait for it minutes later and a few other groups of people being seated before us even though we were there first so we decided to leave and went to the other restaurant next to it We were glad we left because who knows how much longer we had to wait I dont mind waiting but if the hostess told us  minutesI dont mind waiting  or  minutes longer but it was ridiculous that we waited over  minutes to almost an hour and she didnt even say anything to us It seems that the hostess there didnt really know what she was doingalll she was saying to people showing up was  minutes waitwhich obviously it wasnt I would have been glad if we were notified of our status for waiting that long but we werent We went there June rd which was a Thursday around  pmso whoever worked there in the front  please work on you customer serviceit sucks because we really wanted to eat there but was turned off by the front personnel attitude or lack of services
