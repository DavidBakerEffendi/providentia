We have always loved DQ blizzards kids are always satisfied but we always ask for extra candy the blizzards for my wife and I we get charged for extra candy then by the time we are halfway thru them there is no candy I even ask for pb sauce in mine and never get it Always teens working no adult or even college age managers on duty It must be nice being the closest DQ and knowing no one will drive out of there way to visit the other locations to get what they pay and ask for Whoever this franchise owner is they should really look deeply into their staffing I would say we visit this location at least once a week but I think its time to go elsewhere

Its a shame that with how busy this place is that they take advantage of their customer base
