Wouldnt go back Wasnt the worst thing ever I went for lunch with coworkers and got the mac and cheese Ive definitely had better but its fast food I actually had to ask for it to be warmed up because it cane out pretty cold and they threw a fit Nonetheless will not be giving it another try I can make better mac and cheese at home
