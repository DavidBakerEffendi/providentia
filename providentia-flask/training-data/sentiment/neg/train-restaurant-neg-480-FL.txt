It was my first time visiting the noodles  company and I couldnt decide on what I wanted right away the lady that was helping my friend was giving me suggestions when a gentleman came up and was trying to rush me into making my decision I made my decision and he told me that I wouldnt like it so I changed my mind again The gentleman had a very rude tone with me and was pretty much yelling at me I said that I couldnt have mushrooms when trying to make my decision on what I wanted but received mushrooms in my meal anyways Just an all around bad experience I didnt even enjoy my meal after the rude customer service
