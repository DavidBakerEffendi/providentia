First time here and nit impressed with food the
 appetizers are your routine bar food Ordered cheese enchiladas and very disappointed Small tasteless and hard Needed a steak knife to cut it
The ambiance is dull and like a funeral home with loud irritating music playing The only good thing is service is excellent Going to pass this one up
