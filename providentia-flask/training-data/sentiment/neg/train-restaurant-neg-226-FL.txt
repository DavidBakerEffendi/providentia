While I love the idea of getting a fresh salad and a fresh loaf of sourdough all in a drivethru I am not excited about the last and only  experienced Ive had I ordered a turkey bacon avocado salad and TWICE I brought it home and there was no bacon Not a big deal I know but if it happens to me twice  its an issue I wouldve loved to resolve it by calling the restaurant to let them know their bacon was missing  But I called  times and it rang and rang for minutes at pm  All I can say is dont deprive a woman of her bacon
