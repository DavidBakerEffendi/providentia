Really what wing place charges for ranch Then its  cents for this little ass cup of ranch Beer was warm when I got it and the food was half ass Its no wonder on a Sunday night for football this place is empty It was a toss up between here and cogburns and obviously I think we will be going to Cogburns from now on good luck to you when you come here I wont be ever again
