I rarely write reviews but I must point out that this place has the worse customer service ever After I ordered my food and drove all the way home I noticed they had forgotten a quesadilla I ordered for my son Its small so it wouldnt be noticeable After I drove back to tell them they forgot a quesadilla in my order one of the workers automatically responded with oh that must have been the quesadilla that was there They didnt apologize and just made a new one and didnt even bag it until I asked for a bag I got nothing in return for their mistake and inconvenience not even an apology Horrible service Worst chipotle customer service Ive ever received
