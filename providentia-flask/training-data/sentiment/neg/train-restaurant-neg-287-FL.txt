Ryu Sushi replaced Way Sushi  New owners but similar teppanyaki experience  The restaurant just opened and it currently needs improvement  

First off the service is slow  We were promptly seated but it took some time to have our order taken  Our drinks were rarely refilled and it took seemingly forever to receive our bill at the end

The food choices are typical  chicken steak scallops shrimp etc  The usual tricks and obligatory cheesy jokes kept us entertained but the end result was dryovercooked food that was underseasoned  Even the fried rice was too bland  We also ordered a sushi roll which was mediocre  only a slight step above what you can buy in your local grocery store

Price is on the high side though this is typical for teppanyaki
