Absolutely disgusting So terribly disappointed after reading so many great reviews There were four of us The childrens steak was supposed to have some pink and was dead There was absolutely no seasoning on it it was literally a piece of meat on a plate with fries The buffalo beer chicken was so dry it wasnt even edible The broccoli was supposed to be sauted it was steamed and the mashed potatoes were terrible The bbq burger and buffalo chicken sandwich were a greasy mess You couldnt even see the bun on the bottom and the grease was dripping off the burger My son always finishes his burger and he didnt even eat half The prices are astronomical We couldve eaten at Zinburger for quality food and the same price The only thing good was the service Definitely wont be back most certainly wont recommend
