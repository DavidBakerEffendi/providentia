Runny eggs and when I sent them back they were still runny eggs The tbone steak was  fat and I showed the waitress and she didnt care at all It was the worst cut of meat Ive ever had If you HAVE to eat there get the ham steak you will always get a good cut that way The coffee was cold and I had to asked for more then one creamer and she brought back a cup with on creamer in it This screams of management cutting back on everything or the wait staff just hate the customers Perhaps its a little of both I dont know 

Never again will I go into a Dennys
