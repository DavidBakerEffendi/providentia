I was really excited about this place the prices seemed good I had heard about it from some Texas friends and they liked the ones back home

I wasnt ready to completely commit so I got a tender sandwich The roll was ok but the chicken was so cheery I couldnt bite through it I threw it out and drove around the corner to canes I wont go back to bushes
