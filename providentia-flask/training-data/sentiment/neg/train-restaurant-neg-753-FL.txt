The food at Genos was just OK  The highlight of the meal was the bread  Good flavor and tasted fresh

The atmosphere leaves a whole lot to be desired  There was a loud mouth obnoxious patron that ruined the entire evening for me  He was swearing and talking about his marijuana delivery business  Smooth  After one mother finally told him she has kids around he settled down for about a minute  Then one of the workers who knew him got him riled up again  Encouraging the behavior

I will never be back to this place again
