Ive been here  separate times for lunch and Ive enjoyed the food and service each time They need to drastically improve their breakfast offerings if they are going to advertise it so much on social media This past Sunday was our first time trying their breakfast menu They have a board outside advertising  mimosas and  allyoucaneat French toast They also offer a single serving of mixed berry stuffed French toast for  The empty restaurant at am on Sunday (prime brunch time) should have been my first clue I decided to try the AYCE French toast I didnt expect anything stellar for the price but I expected it to actually resemble basic French toast It was very dry like plain toast and served without butter only syrup 

Pros excellent lunch entrees delicious mimosas friendly service 

Cons AYCE French toast was dry and inedible and tasted like regulardry toast with sugar on top
