My husband noticed that from our recent visit we were overcharged A simple fix really and he decided to call in Apparently the manager he spoke to was incredibly rude and didnt believe we were overcharged Maybe it wouldnt be an issue had we gotten a receipt which we didnt get for the bar or bay Not planning on returning if this is how it is going to be
