Terrible First of all we were one of only  groupspeople dining at the time The back door was open and the sushi chef was out back smoking with his gloves onsmoke was filtering through the restaurant and he then proceeded to come back in and continue making sushi with the same gloves on There were several servers wandering around yet we could never get anyone to help us Our drinks were empty we got no refills and we waited over  minutes for the check once we asked for it While we waited our server and another stood behind the counter talking We purposely did not tip after such a horrible experience and yet when I checked my credit card statement I was charged  morethey added on a  tip for themselves Luckily my credit card is taking care of the matter Regardless of this experience the food is mediocre at best Id much prefer other sushi joints down the street at the mall This place is dirty and unprofessional to say the least
