Worst service Took forever to get drinks asked for pancakes out first and never came  Missing food several occasions food was cold  One of the items was a skillet and it was cold  Asked for coffe three times before I got it filled once  Eggs were improperly cooked  Never received an apology and were asked to pay full price  Never coming here again
