I was hoping for a local joint to add to my list but no such luck  I was out with a couple of friends one (from a large Mexican family) recommended the place since we were in the area  Going with that and the fact that it seemed pretty busy I said what the heck  We couldve done better

Once our waitress finally arrived she was friendly enough but seemed a little overwhelmed  The chips  salsa that followed were completely underwhelmed  Bland factory chips and the um salsa you say   Really  We added  of the little cups of spicy sauce to it just to give it some taste  Didnt give me the warmfuzzies

With plenty of interesting menu options I went with the tacos pescado  One word  dull  Almost overloaded with dry bland chunks of mahimahi and a huge pile of rice and beans each with little flavor  I didnt taste chipotle in the chipotle cream sauce  I splashed them with the spicier sauce black pepper and still nothing  My other st timer friend later told me he felt the same about his entree like hed just eaten a big pile of beans with a chimi on the side

I can see why the place is busy plenty of grub for the American belly for the price  Im sure relatives from Minnesota would say oh its gosh darn good yabetchya  But its the kinda Mexican food I dont want it goes kathunk on the plate throw on the cheddar  tada  No thanks I need to taste something   A little spice  A little fire  Nothing  No  Oh

I decided to introduce my Mexican friend to flavors and took him to Los Sombreros   Mmmmmmmmm
