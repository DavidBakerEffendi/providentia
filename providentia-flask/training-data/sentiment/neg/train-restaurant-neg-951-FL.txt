Wanted to try this place because it had great reviews  So we had the lunch good to know because some places have great breakfast and not so great lunch  the fontina burger was awesome great combo  But I also had the onion rings not a good idea to fry anything with Fish it will always take on the fish taste with that said I had fish flavored onion rings  fried green beans were cold if they had been fried fresh they would have been hot or warm but they were room temp so not fresh  Cheese cake was good they put this strawberry pure on it that doesnt have much sugar so it was really really tart  maybe breakfast would be better hubby loved the fish and  shrimp they were huge shrimp
