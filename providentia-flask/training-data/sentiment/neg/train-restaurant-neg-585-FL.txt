Ok this an update from my  review
So we dined in this visit We saw several booths empty and were not cleaned off The lady who came to take us back to the our booth she was very nice However the booth that was just cleaned off for us she still had to swipe food off the seats She should not have to do thisIt did seem a little under staffedIm just sorry we didnt see our favorite waitressesthis Dennys use to be busy no matter what time it was but this time it was empty around 
Especially at lunch timeplease look at your reviews and fix some things
