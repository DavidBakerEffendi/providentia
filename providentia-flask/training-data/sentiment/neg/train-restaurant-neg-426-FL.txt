Vibe is good and its clean people are nice  However both mine and my husbands food lacked flavor The gyro meat tasted boiled and salty not fresh For  we left with carryout with one small bag The same order at our previous spot in NV would have given us lots of extras Even another nearby spot would have given much more on portions Just disappointed because I love Greek food
