Every night I drive by this place and the drive thru line is crazy like innout burger So Ive been curious about it since it opened a couple of months ago 

My kid fell asleep and I could actually wait in line without her screaming bloody murder I put on NPR and proceeded to wait  minutes just to place my order then another  to get my order I dont mind waiting for good food but SERIOUSLY PPL Greasy chicken tenders and crinkle cut fries Not worth waiting  minutes I prefer chickfila where I can also get spicy chicken and get my food in under  minutes
