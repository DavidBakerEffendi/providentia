Food not good water was taken from the toilet i think and service was only so so  Just another fancy name with fancy atmosphere but they forgot to serve food that is edible  And though you can order a variety of drinks sometimes washing food down with a glass of water is nice any restaurant that cant invest in a simple RO system for drinking water or to make their drinks with shouldnt be charging  for an appetizer  Small price to pay for a comfort that goes a long way
