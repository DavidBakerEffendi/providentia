For such a new restaurant the place was pretty dirty  floors seating tables etc Help was obnoxious and even using the F word with other customers Didnt love the chicken  Sonic is better as well as chick fill a Fries toast lemonade and coleslaw were better Wish they had more side options Also no sauces except their mystery sauce I wouldve liked some mustard BBQ and some other options Also at almost pm the place was pretty packed but no one over the age of  so definitely a high school hangout
