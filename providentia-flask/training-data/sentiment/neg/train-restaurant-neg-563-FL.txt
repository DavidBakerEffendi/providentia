Well it was someones birthday So I ended up here again 

The slam still didnt look very good but I had the Santa Fe skillet and it was very tasty  The kid enjoyed her chicken fried steak  And my wife seemed to like her Hobbit Hole (yeah Tolkien themed food)   And the service was friendly and reasonably good

So I must amend my previous review  This was a three star visit   Maybe  (like I said the slam still didnt look appetizing to me)  I can definitely recommend the Santa Fe skillet if you come here  Though its still not my first choice of places to come frankly  But if you order the right things you certainly could do much worse than this place
