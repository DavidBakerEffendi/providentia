The food is always delicious at Pita Jungle and never disappoints However service is always lacking and I never feel like any Pita Jungle I go to has a professional staff I went here with a friend to grab dinner and we and another group of people were the only customers there when we were first seated It took our waitress no joke  minutes to take our drink order While four other employees stood behind the bartake out area and were talking to each other not doing anything There were two waitresses waiting tables and four people behind a bartake out area that had no people at it After we FINALLY got our WATER we waited another ten minutes for the waitress to take our food order Food came out it was great I needed a refill on my water halfway through my meal and where was our waitress Standing with the other four employees talking I couldnt believe my eyes 

Pita Jungle your food is great but you need to have better training and better managers on site because this isnt the only location that has issues I hesitate ever coming to Pita Jungle because I know my service is going to be poor
