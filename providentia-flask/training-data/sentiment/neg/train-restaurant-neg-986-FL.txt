We went here for lunch one day and after hearing so many good things I was shocked that I didnt have a great experience We walked in and there was no one at the hostess station but there was (someone who appeared to be) a manager playing with one of the televisions who chose not to greet us So we waited for a few minutes before someone showed us to a table where we waited another  minutes before we were greeted by our waiter (who to his credit was swamped with tables) I can understand being busy but the fact that there were two managers walking around and not helping customers was what bugged me 

We didnt try the wings but I had a meatball sandwich which was pretty good but not good enough to entice me back for a second trip Ooooor maybe the NewYorkers sensed that we were both from CHITOWN and chose not to take care of us ) haha
