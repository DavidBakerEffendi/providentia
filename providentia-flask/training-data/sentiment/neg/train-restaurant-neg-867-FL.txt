Ive been coming to Nandos for years Its very close to my home and a convenient meeting place for friends and family When I say years I mean at least once a month for a decade 

I have resisted writing this review because I thought it would feel traitorous Im over that My wife has suggested Nandos several times in the last months and Ive said Im done for now

First let me say that the staff are great My only beef is with the decline in quality of one specific item That item is the shredded beef taco (SBT) To me the SBT is the quintessential casual Mexican fare Its the standard by which I judge all Mexican restaurants Its what I look forward to the moment thoughts of Mexican food enter my head My standard order at Nandos was always El Numero Uno (Two Tacos with Rice and Beans) They were so good back in the day
Its been about  months that Ive found the Nandos SBTs lacking They are now bland with very VERY little flavor Youre getting texture from the meat but not much else except a hint of the deep fryer oil (and thats not a good thing) You have to add flavor by adding salsa

But I have a simple suggestion a really quick fix that I hope Nandos adopts (or returns to) Heres the discovery story  My daughter recently returned home from college On the way home from the airport she suggested we stop in to Nandos (what are ya gonna do) 

Hope springs eternal I ordered the bland tacos Now you dont have to specify they be bland they just come that way regardless I wish it werent so Truly I do 

Alas at first bite my hopes were dashed I began the ritual of heaping more regular and habanerosalsa on my tacos to make them palatable I should have ordered the shrimpbeef fajitas or the Hatch Green Chile Pork burrito (those are excellent tasty options that I would never have tried had the tacos not gone into quality decline) But dammit I want tacos the good tacos I used to get here

My wife got her standard shredded beef enchiladas My daughter got a shredded beef chimichanga Both enjoyed their meals but had much to take home in takeout containers 

The discovery came the next day when I reheated my daughters leftover chimi I discarded the deepfried flour tortilla and tried a forkful of the shredded beef Oh lordy It was exactly as I remember the SBT meat had been seasoned back in the day It was excellent

So please all at Nandos  owner servers bartenders kitchen staff  please please please use the seasoned beef in the shredded beef tacos the same shredded beef as goes into the shredded beef chimi Please taste test the two items side by side and you will see what I mean

Thank you for your time and I look forward to rewriting this review
