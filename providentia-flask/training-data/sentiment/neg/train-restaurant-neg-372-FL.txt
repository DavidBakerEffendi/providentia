I think Ive been here  times  First few visits were mediocre at best  This last visit I ordered a skinny margarita cheese enchilada and regular taco  The skinny margarita tasted like a Diet Sprite The cheese enchilada was OK  I took a bite of my regular ground beef taco and couldnt believe how much it tasted like a Taco Bell taco but at x times the price  I then looked down and noticed that the meat was under cooked  Loose ground beefnot fully cooked  Not pink but RED  Anyone who knows anything about food prep and handling knows under cooked loose ground beef is one of the most dangerous next to raw chicken of course  Thanks for not making me pay for my food but this is unforgivable  Got to spend the whole day worried I was going to get food poisoning (which I didnt thank god)
