I usually go to Dennys for their breakfast  Ive never ventured out to their lunchdinner menu Now I know why I avoided it for so long It was not good I had the new Chicken and Avocado Sandwich  It had pico de gallo and sour cream on it too The only thin I tasted was sour cream and chicken The pico de gallo and avocado had no flavor whatsoever My fries also were way too salty and didnt come out with the sandwich Not a huge deal

We did have a few more food issues around the table My wifes turkey bacon was not cooked at all It looked like it came right out of the package Her toast was also burntboth items were sent back  Our waitress was quick and friendly about the errors and was very apologetic

Luckily my daughter didnt finish her pancakes so I did enjoy something  From now on its breakfast at Dennys
