Went to Nandos for the first time last night and I was extremely unimpressed  First the waiter brought out a small pitcher of salsa with two smaller shot glasses He did not spend any time explaining what they were for and we found out by tasting that the large pitcher was salsa and the smaller shot glasses were chili sauce to mix in to your liking  Could have used that advice ahead of time 

 I ordered a Cabo Margarita  Cabo Wabo tequila Grand Marnier with a float of blue curacao  I am highly doubtful Cabo Wabo was used it was EXTREMELY sweet and the blue curacao was not floated it was shaken into the drink  

We ordered the chili con queso dip which was a disgusting soupy mixture with soggy fried flour chips  My fiance ordered an enchiladataco combo and seem satisfied but not impressed  I ordered a deep fried hatch green chile burrowhich was absolutely fantastic and only served to cast the rest of the food in an even worse light  

Secondly I had ordered a Enchilada Del Mar Two corn tortillas filled with crab baby shrimp and cheese Topped with Ranchero sauce Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream Served with rice and beans  It was edible but since I like to examine seafood dishes I peeled one apart  The shrimp was clean completely devained and cooked through but IMITATION crab was used in the dish  I have no objection to surimi in california rolls salads etc but I was extremely agitated to find it inside a seafood dish especially one advertised as being CRAB

Breakdown 

A) Service
Service was adequate  Food and drinks came quickly chips were plentiful and we were seated quickly  Perhaps too quickly as the salsa mixture was not explained  However our waiter was hard of hearing and required menu items be pointed to and orders repeated multiple times  It was loud but not so loud that people sitting across the table could not have a normal conversation  
B) Food
Food was average at best with the exception being the deep fried pork and green chile burro  Trying to pass imitation crab in a seafood dish is a reprehensible culinary and business decision  
C) Drinks
I can make a better margarita with bottled mixture  I have never had a margarita so sickly sweet  Absolutely disgusting  

Summary  Will not be returning  Probably the most unsatisfying dinner I have had since moving to the east valley and possibly the worst Mexican food Ive ever had
