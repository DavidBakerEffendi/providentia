Well we used to love this location but over the last  years the food service and quality have really gone down hill Went there a few days ago and had a coupon for a free dip (for bday) it was an act of congress to get what we wanted  maybe new staff dont know
We will not be returning to this location Shame miss the beginning years when it was just the Tempe location (before that one went to crap too)
