We love Pita Jungle We eat at the Chandler location  times a week My husband is a nurse and we live in Gilbert so he gets off work around  or we went to Pita Jungle in Gilbert and it was  and they told us they were closed I said that it says  at the door and the manager said we dont serve anyone this close to closing This was about  years ago I thinkit was when they first opened We will drive all the way to Chandler now Occasionally we will eat at Pita Gilbert in a pinch but the service is terrible there and they will have you wait even when there are empty tables sitting therethey dont hustle at all to please the customer Their portions are smaller too Not that I need a huge portion but we like to share our food and having more chicken in a spicy chicken wrap rather than rice filler makes a huge difference to me Mostly I like the food for the most part but the service is has been and continues to be aweful I am pretty certain it comes from the management
