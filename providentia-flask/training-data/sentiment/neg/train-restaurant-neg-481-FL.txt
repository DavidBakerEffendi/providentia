The absolute worst We ( a family of   kids  adults ) went into have dinner at pm we ordered our food was brought table at pm
The food well when your  year old takes her first bite of her favorite meal (mac  cheese) and says first thing after waiting over an hour for food and is starving that her dinner isnt good because its cold like a popsicle theres a problem So I tested it yep ice cold
My  year old spaghettithe same ice cold
My hubs ordered a meal and a side if soup soup ice cold meal luke warm I ordered a meal and a side salad salad was literally  pieces of lettuce my meal was luke warm at best 
My  kids and I shared my dish while waiting another  minutes while waiting for their dishes to to be warmed back up When my hubs went up to see what again was taking so long the mac and cheese was finished just sitting there getting cold again and then the person cooking the speghetti again says it hasnt been started yet because they dont have any spaghetti noodlesso I guess just standing there for  minutes gets more noodles
After waiting out for the kids food again my hubs went and said something to the manager he said werent you warned of the long wait for the food after you orderedUm no and wouldnt you warn if the wait before the customer orders and pays 
Sure it was dinner time and busy but no more busy then Tokyo joes which has the same ordering concept of ordering and then going to your table with a number and then they bring the food to you
The beverage dispenser out if ice
Out of forks when we approached a employee to get forks he said the ones he had were for other people then started handing them out to people at tables that had arrived after us Any how that wasnt even the biggest issue
The ladies restroom was also out of toilet paper when I asked for some the gentleman I asked pawned getting it off to some one else who went to get it which took forever comes back with hand towels I said no toilet paper he says no one tells me anything around here goes back for another  minutes come back and starts going towards the rest room I said no I can just take it and put it I there theres a line of  ladies now waiting to use the bathroom at the rate Flash McHussle moves at it would have taken an hour to put it in there
Seriously I wouldnt even give this place one star but then I cant leave a review
