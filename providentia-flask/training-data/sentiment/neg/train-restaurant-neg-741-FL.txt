ordered for delivery on the menu the have a Bacon cheddar cheeseburger sub when it was selected it asked how would you like this cooked and Medium was selected when the order was entered medium confused them instead of calling to alleviate the confusion they ordered bacon cheese fries and added  additional charge so not only did i not get my cheeseburger sub but i was charged extra for something i didnt order when i called to explain the situation they were very receptive to getting a chicken bacon ranch sub out when the lunch rush calmed down (but i was a customer first) and hour and a half later (grumble grumble went my stomach) they delivered A BACON CHEESEBURGER SUB i was extremely disappointed to say the least the only reason i gave  stars and not  is because Alex was apologetic and is able to get my money back for the sub with out any argument
