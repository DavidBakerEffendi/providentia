Be me M full time student no job 
Thursday hits hit up Dennys with the bros for the weekly Godly worship 

Server comes around super friendly everyone orders food finally server get to me I look around at my friends putting on a strong face nothing wrong (dont show them how you feel inside)

IM 
NOT FINE INSIDE its pm been studying and going to my hospital clinicals all day no food in my belly no cash in the bank to even feed myself off the  menu (I have bills to pay)

I secretly check my bank apps in hope to find the funds to wave down the server to order some food 
But its over the server brings out the food funds unavailable for myself I look in horror as my friends stuff their face and Im left hungry another Thursday night 
Gone every Thursday to Dennys coming out depressed and starving The only thing I see from Dennys to this day is depression
