Wowthe customer service here on a Saturday late morning was ridiculously terrible No greeting no smiles no personality whatsoever The girl preparing the food simply set our items on the counter without saying a word or making eye contact I guess its up to the patrons waiting for their orders to figure it outI dont think Ive ever experienced anything like this before Its a good thing DQ is a yummy treat Maybe reconsider your staffing decisions
