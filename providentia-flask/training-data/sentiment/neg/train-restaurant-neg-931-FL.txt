Joes I want to love you but I dont I think there are two types of people that go here People that know the food is average and people who are in denial because of its geography Your food is extra meh with a side of Hmmm

We have been here many times The setup is terrific We make the trek and take our dog to nearby Cosmo Dog Park then hop over for pizza hamburgers salads etc (I think weve tried just about everything to no avail How do you screw up BBQ pizza)

Since I may sound like a Negative Nelly I will say I dig the milkshakes

So why is it so popular 

This is a haven for East Valley apologists who want to have a signature restaurant to call their own but dont want to drive into the city Look into your hearts people of Mesa  Gilbert Enough of the charade You saw it on Food Network and youre happy theres some place there with a line out the door
