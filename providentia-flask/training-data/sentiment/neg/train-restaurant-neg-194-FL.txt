I decided to celebrate my sons bday on a Friday evening so I go to topgolf that day at noon to get information about the wait time whats the best thing to do and so forth  So they suggest for me to call before I take my party to topgolf to have a better idea of the wait time  I call around pm and I was told that there was no wait time and that if I get there now I will be given a booth up on the rd level (which I had asked about earlier in the day)  So my party and I get there at pm (which I understand that we were going to have a wait because it was an hour later) once we get there they inform us that it will be an  hr to   hr wait time  So we decided to go eat dinner somewhere close by  We get back to topgolf around pm we check in and they tell us it will be a  min wait time  We said okay well hang out upstairs rd floor where the DJ area is at  ONce we got up there we notice a couple of booths opened and notice a family was escorted to a booth  We ask them how long their wait was and they said  MINUTES  however they said because they have a premiumplatinum membership which we understand that they pay  for that  So we said okay whatever  My husband goes downstairs to check on our wait time and they said that there are  guest in front of us so it will be another HOUR or so  It was already pm  We didnt get a booth until almost pm and the only reason was because my husband went almost  times to guest services and told them to be honest with him and tell him if we are going to get seated or we just leave  They give you the runaround about the wait time I had to wait almost  HOURS on Friday evening  I felt that we were given the worst booth because of our complaint  WE were put on the booth next to wall
