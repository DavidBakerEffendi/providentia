This last visit was really disappointing I ordered the adult grilled cheese with added jalapenos and a side of loaded fries They left off the jalapenos and brought the wrong side and I didnt get my loaded fries until we were pretty much finished eating I expected something to be comped or discounted  nope  And the service was apathetic Oh yeah and the tomatoes on the grilled cheese made it soggy

We started coming here less frequently because they dont have much for vegetarians and their beer selection is weak But we used to enjoy the friendly staff and the atmosphere This experience didnt help
