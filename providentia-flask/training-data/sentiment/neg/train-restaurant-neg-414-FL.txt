Stopped in for a quick dinner Sat at their small but cute bar One of the male wait staff took a look at us and responded with a strange and unpleasant reaction Not a pleasant greeting at all We ordered our dinner from the female that asked to take our order She wasnt very pleasant either Our food came The same male waiter came out with a load of silverware and put it down infront of us on the bar and started wrapping them in napkins It felt very odd like of all the places to do your work  why stand facing us within  feet and do this  Still no pleasantries from him  Then another young man came out to join him He had a strange smirk on his face as though there was an internal joke going on They were  standing at our small eating area to do this work  The food ended up not being very good Its disappointing because I had not been in a pita jungle in a couple years I recalled that their food was always good and pleasant people to interact with  I left with a strange feeling that this male waiter decided he didnt like us from the moment we walked in and the joke was that he did something to our food I will NEVER eat at this location again
