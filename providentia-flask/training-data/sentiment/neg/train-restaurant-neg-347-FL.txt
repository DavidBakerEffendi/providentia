Came here with the family and was very dissapointed I dont have any problem spending  for a dish but this place is way overpriced Portions are very small and frankly the food was not flavorful most of it was drenched in sauces and spices to cover up the poorly cooked meat

The best part was finishing my kids cheese burgers they were way better than our meals 

Guacamole was  and it was plain

Wont be back
