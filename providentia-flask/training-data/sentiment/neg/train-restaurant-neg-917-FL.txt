Something happened with the new upgradeim not sure what it is (  But while the environment is awesome and i love the farm vibe the food quality seems to have gone down a lot  I tried a little bit of what everyone had at our table and it was such a disappointment  The fried shrimp tasted greasy and lacked flavor the fried zucchini was floppy the french fries were cold the pizza was tough  The whole new soda machines are really awful none of our kids like the flavor of the homemade sodas Its such a shame because we use to love this place and now we no longer do
