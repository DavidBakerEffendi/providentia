I used to like this place  My first bad experience her today was it took  minutes for our sushi to get on our table  The sushi chef served a family that came in after us before making our order Very unprofessional I ordered a spicy beef ramen that was ok The broth tasted generic The noodles were excellent  I was done with my ramen before my husband received his sushi Very disappointed I dont want to return
