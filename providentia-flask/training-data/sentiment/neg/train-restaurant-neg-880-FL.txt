We arrived here at about pm and waited about  min for someone to even greet us meanwhile there was about  ppl in the restaurant  The hostess came up and we asked for a table not a booth and she said ok I have one in the bar or outside So we went over to the bar area and the two tables were dirty she then stated oh they are dirty so all I have is outside REALLY when its  outside I asked if she could clean it and she said thats not my job I dont clean the tables WOW We left and went to another place that actually cares about their customers
