I came in today with my little brother  It was kinda of dirty Plates and food left on empty tables It seemed slow being we were the only ones there And when we came we sat ourselves because no one was there to be found Moments later some old guy came out asked us to move tables because that table isnt prepped So we did I ordered drunken noodles(dinner item I guess) and my brother got a lunch special beef and broccoli When they food came out they were the same portion because they were both on the same kind of plate Except mine was double the price of my brothers   unlike other Thai places you dont get to pick your spice level nor do you get to choose your meat No one ever came back out besides when we first came in and paying Our drinks were never refilled Sad to say probably will never come back
