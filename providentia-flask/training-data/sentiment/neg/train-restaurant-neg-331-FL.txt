Ghost town Came in Saturday night at  had a reservation but it was clearly not needed as only about  of the tables were taken (maybe we should have taken this as a sign and left) I tried to order the spicy cucumber margarita but the waiter talked me out of it as a new item in the menu that was weird to me but whatever I opted for the pineapple margarita and the wife got the regular margarita we ordered queso as well and waited The drinks were fine nothing special and soon enough our server came back to take our order We both got a combo plate Cancun and Puerto Vallarta Shortly after we ordered maybe  minutes our food came out no queso which we mentioned to our waiter and he said he would get it out right away but we didnt want it at that point The food was ok again nothing special For a Saturday night we were shocked at how empty it was (maybe MDW was the reason but who knows) We probably wont be back as there are much better options nearby but if youre looking for somewhere to just show up at this may be the place for you
