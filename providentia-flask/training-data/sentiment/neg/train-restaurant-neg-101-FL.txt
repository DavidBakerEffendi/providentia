I am so mad I never leave reviews on yelp but I just had to tonight The general manager leaves a lot to be desired I went through the drive through (no speaker they walk out and take your order) then they bring the food then take your money and have to come back to bring your card to you 

Tonight I ordered  worth of food As I started to drive away I realized they didnt ask me about sauce for the strips I park and go inside to see what sauces they have The GM butts in and says had I known you wanted sauce I could have traded it for that large gravy  I said I just need a couple sauces He said well Ill do it this time for free but I was so frustrated by this time I said forget it I just wanted a couple I wont be back They lost a customer for life over the fact that for a  piece strip meal I asked for two sauces and you would have thought I was breaking the bank for their  sauce I was willing to pay for them but he acted as though I asked for something out of the ordinary Not everyone likes gravy esp white gravy It was fine for the potatoes However I didnt know they gave you a large tub of it We only used the small one that came with the potatoes The poppers tasted dirty too I wont be back Next time Ill go through the light and get Raising Canes chicken 

Poor customer service
