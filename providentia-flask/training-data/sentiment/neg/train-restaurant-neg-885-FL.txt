First time ordering carryout tony was nice and welcoming The Pizza quality has tanked Sauce leaves more to be desired if this is what NY style pizza is all about then Im glad I am from Chicago 

Crustdough was very bland It is foldable like new yorkers like to do My wife said it was worst pizza she has had The toppings had no cooked flavor to them and they appeared raw They were warmed with the pizza but no where close to having any type of slight burntcooked flavor to them

Garlic knots were not great but had more flavor than the pizza 

The pizza reminded me of the pizzas i made when i was a kid wtomato paste from the can 

Tony was nice and all but try the entrees or thick pizza STAY AWAY FROM THE THIN NEOPOLITAN PIZZA
