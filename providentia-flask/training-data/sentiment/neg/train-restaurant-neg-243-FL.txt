Worst customer service ever Drive thru for a simple loaf of bread and they can not get that right They askec three times if wanted bread sliced and loudly said no three times Bread sliced and when i go into to get what i ordered not so much as a sorry from supposed manager Rather go to a business that puts some effort into customer service
