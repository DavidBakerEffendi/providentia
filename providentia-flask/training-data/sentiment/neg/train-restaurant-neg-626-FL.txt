Stopped in tonight for take out and ordered soup for my Fiancee and fish tacos for myself  Waited close to  minutes for the food to be ready  When I got home there was no soup in the bag  The container I thought was the soup was actually the beancorn salsa for the tacos   I was perfectly clear with Chad the bartender that I wanted soup and Tacos  Wont be coming back here again
