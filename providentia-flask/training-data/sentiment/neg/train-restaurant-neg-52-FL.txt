Versatile menu  mediocre food  table service was tiring  We had to ask for everything nothing offered and extra charge for ranch dressing with the wings because they serve them with ranch  Relaxed atmosphere with a lot of nice TVs Good place for watching games  having a beer at the bar but not recommened if you are going for dinner  Our birthday party of  was split into  tables which was very awkward especially when you can see that if they moved a couple tables around they could have accomodated us to sit together  Our dirty plates were left on the table even though our server had come and gone several times  I ended up stacking them and handing them to her so we had room for dessert  birthday brownie (delicious) came with  spoons  we had to request more when she finally came back  By the time we got the spoons the ice cream was melted  Maybe because gratuity is included on large parties she just didnt care to give good service
