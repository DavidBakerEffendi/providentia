I work across the street and weve tried ordering from here several times I have yet to have a positive experience Today I placed a group order for pickup After picking it up I realized theyd forgotten part of it When I called the person on the phone was very rude She did offer to grab a manager but instead of putting me on hold she just hung up My previous experiences were similar The food is okay but the customer service is awful Do not recommend
