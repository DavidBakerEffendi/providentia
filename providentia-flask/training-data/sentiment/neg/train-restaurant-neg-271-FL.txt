Well I tried kneaders again today but wish I  didnt I bought a  chicken chop salad  It had about  small pieces of chicken cucumbers ( that tasted like they had been in the fridge to long)  grape tomatoes  rings of onion  Sprinkled with blue cheese   Just a so so salad  The problem I have is I got it to go on my lunch break  I start eating and find that the lettuce didnt look washed  There was mud still on the leaves   See picture  So I wasted my money and my time for the last time
