Oh no Joe 

Heres the problem

  You need to do something about the ridiculous line out the door  Yes you are popular  Yes it was dinner time (on a Thursday night) So why was there only one person taking orders  You have two registers Heard numerous complaints during my  minute wait

  if someone orders the havarti pesto burger please include the pesto  even if the person orders it without the bun  You could put it in a condiment cup

  When youre making kids food please be aware that kids are some of the pickiest diners out there and unhappy kids  unhappy parents  The kids grilled cheese came out with some red sauce on the cheese part  not just a little  Therefore kids refused to eat  Perhaps it was pizza sauce  BBQ sauce  Whatever it was it shouldnt have been there  Thats  down the drain  Yes two kids meals which were  a grilled cheese sandwich each were  And mommy who went out to avoid having to cook after a long day had to go home and prepare something

  Whats the story with the flies  Well of course they are expected at an outdoor place but our table was literally swarming with them  I noticed that the tables under the trees did not have patrons vigorously swatting these pesky creatures away  This isnt really a complaint just a heads up to future guests to suss out the tables before you sit down

  What do you do best  I want to give you one more chance as my moms group loves to lunch here but I just havent discovered the magical menu item  My husband said hes come for the last time so Im on my own  Ive had the sandwiches and pizzas and nothing stands out  

A couple positives to end my review

When I went back in to get my pesto the guy who got it for me was super friendly

Food comes out quickly once its ordered

Cool bathroom

One final piece of advice  sit on the side away from the street  We learned this the hard way as it was a nuisance to continuously walk around the building for drink refills taking kids to the bathroom utensils condiments picking up food etc
