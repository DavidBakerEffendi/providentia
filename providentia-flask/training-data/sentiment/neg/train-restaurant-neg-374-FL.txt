Cantina Laredo at The San Tan Mall

We were taking our daughter to see a movie at the San Tan and never have dined at Cantina Laredo so we decided to give it a try We were thoroughly impressed with the general facility and the attention to detail that it contains eclectic with Spanish overtones The place was immaculate 

The food was fantastic I had the Cantina Laredo Platter Cheese chile relleno tamale chicken enchilada fajita beef taco al carbon I thoroughly enjoyed this plate The relleno was super gooey cheesy and the beef in the taco was exceptional and reminded me of something my motherinlaw would make when we travel to New Mexico  

The glaring problem with this restaurant is the service It was absolutely terrible When we sat down it was nearly  minutes before we were greeted The server never mentioned any specials and was not knowledgeable about the menu We ordered a Queso dip for the table which was good but not exceptional however I was extremely irritated when I overheard the server at the next table offer tableside Guacamole to his guests HELLO WTF I love guacamole

Then I sat irritated in my chair as I watched the neighbors guacamole being prepared fresh tablesideeeeerrrrrr In addition our Queso dip came out late and our dinners early as the courses were annoyingly overlapped Why even bother ordering an appetizer if you dont get a chance to eat it 

My wife has a sweet tooth and always looks forward to dessert Not here though as we got the automatic check drop without being asked for coffee or dessert 

My wife and daughter went shopping before the movie so I moved to the bar to test the house margaritas I never got to because I sat at the bar by myself for exactly  minutes without ever being greeted let alone served So I got up and left and went to Kona Grill for a drink instead By the way a Gaggle of hostesses all up front and not one mentioned to say goodbye 

Wow Great place Great food and then this place really shoots itself in the foot with its absolutely lousy service
