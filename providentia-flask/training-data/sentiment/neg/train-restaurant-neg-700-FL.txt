Just had my first subzero experience While the experience was differentmildly entertaining  the ice cream was beyond horrific This was the first time in my  years of life that I actually threw out ice cream (Ill even endulge in months old freezer burned ice cream at home) The icing on the cake was the  it cost to have a SMALL creation some peanut butter combo they have on the menu I literally ran upstairs once home to brush my teeth and get rid of the horrible flavor once and for all Worst  ever spent and worst ice cream Ive EVER had
