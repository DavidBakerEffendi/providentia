Horrible We were looking for a good place for Chinese food this was not it The orange chicken was like an everlasting gobstopper You could not stop chewing it it never broke down The Pork fried rice had chunks of refried and refried pork like flavorless wood chips The egg flour soup was a gelatinous yellow substance with no taste The chicken lo mein had a nice burnt taste to it The egg rolls had been cooked cooked and boiled again My family stood around our Chinese bounty each trying our food and spitting it in the sink We then had to go out and get a real dinner Dont stop here you will be sorry
