Place was pretty dead only  other parties of people Excellent service but aside from the appetizer of spring rolls(which were delicious) food was very mediocre The pad thai was a big pile of barely spicy noodles chicken and shrimp no bean sprouts or vegetables Hubby got a basil chicken dish which he said was ok but left him still hungry Neither of our dishes came with rice We just werent impressed with the food but our goto Thai place Siam Thai is run by a family from thailand so we are a bit spoiled
