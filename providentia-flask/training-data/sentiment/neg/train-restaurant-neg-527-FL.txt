Okay No 

I normally really like El Pollo Loco Normally the chicken is pretty good and it is decently priced allowing you to fill up on relatively little money Today however I experienced a notsogreat version of their service
I went through the drive through and asked for a chicken and cheese quesadilla ONLY chicken and cheese and a cherry coke The drive through took forever as it normally does and when I finally got my food I continued on my way to work Upon inspecting my food (as I always have to do due to my pickyeaterness) I found sour cream salsa and guacamole shudders I also ordered a cherry coke and received regular coke On top of the food mistake they wildly overcharged me for my meal a  meal was somehow 
So I went back to the restaurant but this time I went inside I waited my turn (again it took forever) and told the lady at the counter of the mistake on my quesadilla (I didnt even bother with my drink) The worker looked at me and said Oh you dont want it To which I replied No I cant have the stuff inside of it I wanted only meat and cheese I was also overcharged The worker then turned to her manager and explained the situation When she was done she said okay theyre making you a new one and went to help the people behind me I stated I was also over charged for my food The worker turned to her manager and then turned back to me She said Well just put extra chicken in your quesadilla
   Okay side note Dude really Really

So I told the worker Id rather just have the difference of what I over paid She looked like she didnt know what to do and finally the manager agreed So I finally got the difference of what I over paid and when I stepped to the side I looked up to see the manager giving me a dirty look 

 I know I am the pickiest eater known to man but if I am paying for food I dont think its too crazy to get what I want
 It is not my fault that whomever made my food messed up
 The MANAGER is giving dirty looks to paying customers not a very good sign
 I was polite about the mess up and STILL got attitude The worker was okay I am more miffed that the MANAGER gave me attitude when I was just asking for the mistake to be corrected
 I doubt Ill be back any time soon
