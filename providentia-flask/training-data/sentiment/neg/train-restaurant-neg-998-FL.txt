Disgusting place 
I was craving sushi and all the reviews were pretty good so I gave it a try
The whole place smelled so freaking bad   I was gagging half of the time 
Our waitress seated us then disappeared for  mins  
My sushi was crap The rolls all fell apart  They tasted horrible  Nothing tasted fresh  
After my first roll I got this horrible pain in my stomach and I just stopped eating  
Horrible experience  I ordered  different rolls  I tasted  each one  
The fish is definitely not fresh here people  I do not know what the awful odor in the restaurant was but it was very bad  Bad food  Bad smell  Bad service  if your looking for a good sushi place scratch this place off the list
