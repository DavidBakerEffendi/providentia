I just had lunch and I have to say it was the worst Mexican food I have ever had extremely bland and nothing to it The chicken enchiladas just had boiled chicken in them no cheese sauce or onionspeppers and the sauce on top was bland The two other people had different items and they did not like theirs at all  We even had to wait to be seated with only a few people in the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon

Dont waste your time or money here go anywhere else
