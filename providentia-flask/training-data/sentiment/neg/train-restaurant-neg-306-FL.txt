I had purchased a gift certificate on Restaurantcom and knew nothing about this business I do love sushi and Teppanyaki though and was excited When I went in to use it they refused to honor it We ended up having a terrific meal but the aggravation from the server and the manager was not worth it I went back to use the gift certificate for take out and was told I could not that it was only dinein Again a big hassle I talked to the manager and she did not care that I was put out she did not care that I was trying to patronize the restaurant (albeit in the comfort of my home) Very nasty and they dont care about making new customers or keeping the ones they have Must be the reason it is so empty the two times I have been there and the reason they are having to discount and advertise on Restaurantcom so heavily
