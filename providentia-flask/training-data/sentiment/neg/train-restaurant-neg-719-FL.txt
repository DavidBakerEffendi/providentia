went to Genos for the first time at I have to say it will be my last   We ordered the provolone cheese steak sandwich gyro and fries The meal cost around  so its pretty expensive for casual dining The cheese  steak was the absolute worst Ive ever had The cheese was non exsistant barely even there the roll was soggy and cheap quality and the meat if it was meat was closer to canned dog food then steak The gyro is also horrible The meat was thin and tasteless the pita was store bought and generic The fries are junk too I have no idea how this place stays in business but What I do know is its not getting anymore of mine If you have taste buds then genos is not the place to go to  star is too high a rating
