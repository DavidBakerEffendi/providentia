It took ten minutes to just get a water and Coke Patiently waiting the manager Erin was arguing with his employees in the back BAM My heart skipped a beat My friend ducked in fear Erin had punched the wall I noticed how stressed out he was so I just shook it off and let it slide But then within minutes the yelling started again in the kitchen and BAM Erin punched the wall again Erin had the audacity to come and apologize for the slow time but Ill never forget the striking sound and the pain the wall had to go through It was a very uncomfortable experience Very unprofessional for a manager
