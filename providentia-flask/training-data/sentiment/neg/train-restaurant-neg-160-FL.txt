We usually have such a good time when we go but it seems like many of the familiar faces Ive seen are all gone The wait time wasnt bad at all but the service wasnt good We went to golf eat and drink and the food was great but we had to ask for everything as our server kept forgetting Brought food with no plates We ask for napkins thinking hed bring silverware and brings just napkins Then we wanted to change the channel because our bay had a broken tv and it took  min for someone to change it By then our time was up After spending X amount of dollars in  min on play food drinks we get told we cant sit there anymore because theres a wait to get in Two things wrong here first off we just spent a ton and for a kid server to tell us we cant stay and sit there but we can eat inside is wrong Second off there was absolutely no wait It was probably the most dead Ive seen it ever Just a poor experience last night But hey everyone has a bad night sometimes
