Horrible service waitresses were too busy playing games and laughing at each other to help customers  One even dropped a tray because they we having too much fun I had to bus half the tableInstead of the waitress going to the other side of the table to grab dishes I had to bus my end of the table and hand it to herREALLY  Drinks were bad and when we sent them back instead of making new ones the bartender tried to adjust the bad drinks  Come on guys get some REAL bartenders and waitresses in there   Food was just ok  We wont be coming back
