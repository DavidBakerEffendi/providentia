Ive eaten here numerous times with coworkers and Im very disappointed in the food we got My coworker and I ordered the chicken and hummus and when we returned back to the office we were very upset to find there was hardly any hummus it looked like someone scooped and slatted a small amount of hummus and forgot the pine nuts tomato and our chicken was cold I wish I could rely on them for a quick healthy lunch but I will not be returning for the price and quality of food rendered
