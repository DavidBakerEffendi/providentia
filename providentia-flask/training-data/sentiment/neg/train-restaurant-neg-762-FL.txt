If you are hungry and you want to get what you pay fordont stop here This is one of the only Chipotles where I get the stinkeye if I ask for a little more ricebeansmeat (not that Im asking for mounds of food but at least enough to fill my burrito) The burritos here are way to small to be paying almost  bucks for a burrito (I dont usually get extras like a drink or chips)
