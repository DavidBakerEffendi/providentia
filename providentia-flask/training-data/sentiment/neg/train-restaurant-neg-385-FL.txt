Im amazed that this place got  stars  possibly the worst Mexican food I have ever had I ordered iced tea and the chimichanga pollo which comes with rice and beans The iced tea tasted like it was made with unfiltered municipal water (ie nasty chemical taste) The only thing on my plate that had much of any flavor at all were the beans I cut into the chimi and there was a POOL of grease underneath it Of course I know chimis are fried but they must not have allowed this one to drain before plating it It just simply tasted like grease The rice was truly devoid of flavor at least any flavor that was pleasant

I waited  minutes for my food to arrive I was on lunch break from work so by the time I got my food I had  minutes to eat it Any server who works weekday lunch shift should realize that someone who is eating alone and dressed in work attire (I have a logo embroidered on my shirt) is on a limited lunch break My server took my order someone else brought it out (they were NOT busy) then she asked how things were after I finally got my food but before Id had a chance to try it I didnt see her again I had to flag down the manager to ask for my check He was kind  apologetic for the delay and gave me a discount (which is why Im giving  stars instead of ) but I didnt see my server again until as I was getting up from my seat to head back
To work asked if I wanted an iced tea to go A nice gesture but too late I wont be going back If only the food was bad or only the service was bad I would give them another shot and chalk it up to a bad day but when both are bad Im out
