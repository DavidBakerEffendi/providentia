Probably the most consistently bad Dominos location in Arizona Toppings are thrown on the pizza one slice will have  pieces of pepperoni and lots of cheese The slice next to it will have almost no cheese and  piece of pepperoni The worst part is they dont care how the pizza looks when they put it in the box They also must blindfold the person that cuts the pizza because it never is cut into  almost equal slices Go to Pizza Hut they seem to care about quality
