I dont know what everyone loves about this place  We ate there today and tried many of the items they are known for  onion rings had no flavor whatsoever the barbeque chicken pizza was not good at all I had to actually douse it with barbeque sauce to even make it have a modicum of flavor the kids corn dogs were just like you would buy at the grocery store and my husbands double dogs tasted like the chili was burnt to a crisp  All in all at  total this was a horrible experience  We will not be eating here again that is for sure
