I only gave this deli  star because you couldnt choose  stars
I have ordered from Genos a few times in the past while my husband was camping  I wanted to be lazy and decided delivery was the best option on a couple of those nights  The staff was pleasant on the phone those few times which is why when my food was delivered cold and incorrectly I didnt complain  I felt I was being lazy so I got what I got
However I ordered tonight after a long day of soccer games and was excited that my husband was on board even though he had heard horrible reviews in the past
My first clue should have been the lady on the phone saying Okay your order will be there as soon as its done then click  No waiting time or thank you or anything
Over an hour later our food finally arrived  my husband was at the door with the delivery driver while I was checking to make sure our order was correct  EVERYTHING was COLD  COLD Mozzarella sticks COLD Philly COLD wings COLD chili cheese fries COLD everything  
The delivery driver tried to walk off as we were advising that the food was COLD not very nice in my opinion
We asked him to take it back and called the manager who recited the companies guidelines  We explained the guidelines might be so however this food tonight was not acceptable as it was ice cold  There was nothing they were willing to do to make it up  It wasnt even offered that they would redeliver hot food
VERY disappointed with the lack of customer care and the complete lack of customer service  Sad to say I will not be going back  Ever
