I went here last night for the first time because I have a few friends that swear it is the best chicken  So I figured why not even bad fried chicken is still good  Well that usually is true unless it is not cooked all the way  I wouldnt have even written a review had the manager on duty not been defensive when I pointed out the tenders that were pink andor slimy  Instead of saying I am sorry can i get you a new batch for you the response was that is our marinade and it makes the chicken look like that  Now i am not an expert when it comes to chicken and will never claim to be but there is one thing I know chicken is either white throughout or not cooked  And a marinade would never give a slimy gel look to a product that is fried  I worked at Chickfila for  years so I know enough about chicken to know that at least  A simple I am sorry instead of blaming the marinade would have been fine  I get it restaurants screw up it is bound to happen but own the mistake dont push the blame back onto the customer for not being used to chicken looking shiny and pink as being ready for consumption which it isnt  I did get a refund and took that money to Raising Canes where the Chicken was white on the inside
