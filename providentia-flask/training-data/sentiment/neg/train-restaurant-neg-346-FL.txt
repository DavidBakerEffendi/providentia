So I have been lured back several times

Its such a scam they suck you in with the fancy menu and these Fab chips and salsa trust me after eating those youd expect to the food to be pretty damn good but NO to Quote Jenn H  it is  Blech Die

If and when I come back Ill stick to the chips and salsa I also would usually order the table side gauc  but have found that they put such large chunks of onion and jalapeno it really takes away from ittake your time chef and finely chop that shit

Ill give  stars for the chips and salsa
and  for the food but you cant have both
