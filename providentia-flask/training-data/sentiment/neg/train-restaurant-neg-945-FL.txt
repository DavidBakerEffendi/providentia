Went today Not very busy and still took about  mins to get  burgers and a shake The reason is because our burgers were done but they were doing TRAINING so our burgers sat there while the one server went through all of the procedure to adding pickles lettuce etc all the garnishments That alone took a good  mins Meanwhile our burger sat there getting cold Also the fries

Then they called us up I alreayd knew it was going to be cold because we saw how long it had been sitting out with  employees hovering over it

Burgers were cold fries were cold Had to send it all back UNREAL

I have been to Joes at LEAST x since its in our neighborhood and our last  experiences have been HORRIBLE

So disappointing This place used to be great
