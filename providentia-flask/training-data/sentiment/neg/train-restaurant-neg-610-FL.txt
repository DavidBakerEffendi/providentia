First the good The HostWaitress was nice and attentive and the food was good 
The not so good Our table was dirty The Host apologized and went to get a rag and cleaned it The music was WAY too loud and it was metal music from the s I dont want MTV blaring while I eat  We normally just get water to drink and when it came it tasted horrible The waitress got us more from a different source and it was better but still not very good Makes me wonder if this is a ploy to get customers to buy drinks
Bottom line we will not be back
