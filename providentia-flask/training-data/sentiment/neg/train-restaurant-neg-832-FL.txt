Went there today because my wife wanted Mexican food I have never been to nando and she had Food  on  and service  on  Very very disappointed Server Adri got me the wrong order only find out when I got the bill that she didnt get me what I ordered I could not tell because I do not know their menu I ordered the picado dinner and she got me the tacos pescado  they definitely need new cooks as this food was tasteless I would choose Taco Bell over them The people that were more into it was the bussers They were on top of cleaning and ready for next guest  I work in the industry and I know when my food is bad And this place is pricey for the crap they serve Anyway I DO NOT RECOMMEND nando for people who want to experience Mexican food Bad bad bad and no manager around checking on tables Where are the managers If any
