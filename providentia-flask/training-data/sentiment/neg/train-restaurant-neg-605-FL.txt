Beer selection is basic beers you would find anywhereabsolutely nothing special
Pretzels and cheese were AWESOME (the only reason I have  stars instead of )
I had beer can chickenwas luke warm super tough and was defintely reheated (had that weird reheated poultry taste) The taste was somewhere between Indian and weird 
Gorzonzola potatoes were really good but dry as well
Hubby had gorgonzola burger and really liked it
