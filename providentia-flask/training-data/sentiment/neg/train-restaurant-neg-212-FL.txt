I had my first visit here today after trying to come for several months but they are closed on Sunday which is real annoying I ordered a panini and some soup the soup was ok served with cold bread and a pad of butter The panini had no pesto on it even though it was chicken pesto My friend ordered the triple double melt sandwich and it was super greasy I am also told the mens bathroom was absolutely disgusting I will not be returning to this establishment and will go to my favorite place instead Wildflower Bread Company
