Nandos has been my favorite Mexican restaurant in Gilbert but after todays visit I wont be back for awhile  It seems as if they have a new cook or new food products I didnt even want the doggy box offered to bring the rest of food home  We start with the mini platter everything tasted different and not for the better even the jalapeno cream cheese tasted like it had a chalky powder in it  The table chips were different too just not as yummy as weve gotten for the last  yrs of frequent visits  A bit disappointed forsure Anyone else see or taste the difference Was always our go to place and today was not worthy
