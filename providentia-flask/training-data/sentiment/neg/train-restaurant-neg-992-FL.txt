The customer service kills the experience for this place I am very understanding that people have a bad day but you are here to earn a paycheck and earn my tip so leave the negative get out of my restaurant attitude at home 

Otherwise its a nice looking place with good sushi Normal sushi prices 

You can buy chopsticks here and eat with them right away I believe you can eat from an AYCE menu and outside says its conveyor belt sushi but I did not see such a thing inside tho I did not go to the back 

I would come again but the customer service experience was not one I want to go thru again
