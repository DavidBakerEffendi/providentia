We waited about  mins in line to order inside mins of life well never get back True it was P but simply not enough staff on hand 

Never got to taste the food probably a good thing They are understaffed girl at inside counter  to run food outside and a guy who doubles as inside counter order taker and chicken fryer

 others in back of store one was likely manager unloading a stock truck (really at P when you are trying to serve) but had  folks ahead of us and it took  mins to get up to counter to order Like other reviews understaff causing longer than normal wait times 

When ordering was told they are out of several side disheslike mac  chese cole slaw okra green beanswe just looked at each other and grinnedthen left after we were told thatwith about  folks standing behind us Went elsewhere 

We wont return for several reasons very poor customer service  woefully understaffed prices are higher than say a Popeyes and other similar places from menu it appears all single sides are but gravy for mashed potatoes is an extra  Huh Side menu doesnt say mashed potatoes AND gravyjust mashed potatoes gravy is listed separately and at additional cost 

Really
