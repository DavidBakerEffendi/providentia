Minus the TVs which are great for watching sports the food almost killed me Its disgusting I never complain but when I ordered the chicken  avacado sandwich other night it tasted and smelt rank like rotten meat it was dry like it was freezer burnt that was left out open and then spoiled then cookeduggThen I ordered wine it was so rotten I spit it back in glass 
Yep Im not ever going back there again
