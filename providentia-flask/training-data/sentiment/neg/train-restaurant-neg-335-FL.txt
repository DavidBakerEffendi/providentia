Review update
Not sure what is going on with this place but the quality of the food is definitely gone downhill They only bring one salsa out you have to ask for the second one 
I ordered the carnitas and it came out very dry not very good at all and Ive had this in the past Manager said they deep fry it now which dries it out 
The black beans were rancid did not taste good actually got sick after the meal Not sure if Im coming back very disappointed was one of our favorite restaurants


Again great meal  Well presented  The new ceviche is spot on  So fresh and sea bass was done perfectly 
Had carne asada poblano what great medley of flavored   Carne Asada was done perfectly
Missed it on desert though  Had apple pie and there was just too much salt in the crust
Server was Theresa and she did a fantastic job 
Will definitely be back
