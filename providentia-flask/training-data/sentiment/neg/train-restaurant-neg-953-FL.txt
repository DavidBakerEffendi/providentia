This place was rated really high on yelp so I thought Id give it a try Ill be honest I was nothing but disappointed The location was pretty which is just about the only positive about the place The service is rather slow I believe the line was out the door our of popularity and it took a good hour or so before I got my food I sat inside the restaurant and there were flies everywhere It was pretty disgusting The chairs were uncomfortable which I guess is due to the picnic theme I ordered the hot dog and the food was extremely pricey and just not good It was so generic it basically tasted like a hot dog I bought from a gas station Considering the long wait the flies in the restaurant the price and the poor tasting food I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
