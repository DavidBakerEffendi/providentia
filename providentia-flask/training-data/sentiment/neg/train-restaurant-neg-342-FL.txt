We have been here plenty of times and decided to stop in at  on a Sunday after Christmas shopping for happy hour  They had a giant Happy Hour sign outside the door and in we went

When we ordered margaritas we were slapped with the notice that they were not on happy hour pricing on Sundays Wait  What   But that bait and switch sign outside didnt mention that  Bloody Marys and Mimosas were the only HH things on Sunday  What the heck   

We drank and paid and bailed   There are plenty of other restaurants that offer better HH and I would recommend going there instead of hereunless you want to get duped
