We love Kneaders We go to this one most often but weve been to San Tan and even some of the Kneaders in Utah 

Sorry to say this one dissapoints too often They are often out of many items on the menu and have never offered a discount for substitutionsafter the third time I asked Nope On Wed I was told they were out of mint brownies but yesterday the girl told us they dont offer mint brownies anymore (

The worst part about this Kneaders A few weeks back my mom said she got sick and I thought it was an isolated incident About a week later i felt sick after ordering a salad Last night both my husband and I felt ill from our sandwiches I think Im done with this location Ill make the drive to San Tan
