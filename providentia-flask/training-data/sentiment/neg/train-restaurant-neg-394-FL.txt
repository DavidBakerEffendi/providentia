I live one mile from here  was so excited when it opened I have been there about a dozen times I LOVE the sandwiches The service is lousy They need to get their act together or they wont last long EVERY time I have been there they get something wrong The last several times I have ordered a Mini  Club Each time when I go to pay they have given me the Regular When I tell them that I ordered the Mini they change the ticket  charge me for the Mini They are loosing money every time Today they forgot to put the bacon on the club Fortunately I caught it before I left the building The lady in front of me had already paid  the guy tried to charge her again The guy behind me ordered wheat bread  got white They gave me a regular AGAIN today when I had ordered a Mini I dont know if this is some scam they are running to increase their incomea lot of people may not even notice that they gave them a regular  just pay the higher price  go on I think Im going to see what the Attorney Generals office says about this Come on guys this is not rocket science its subs
