Have been going to sauce for years  Have always ate the pizza and pasta  I should have just stuck with tradition  I ordered the Roast Beef and Smoked Mozzarella Panini  It was awful  I Didnt eat half of it  It really had almost no flavor  It was a completely odd experience eating a roast beef with no flavor  I had my wife even try some of the meat and she was perplexed as well  Also the meat was really cold and the mozzarella was cold and unmelted  Kind of expected a panini to be warm  I was wrong  My wife had a grilled cheese and tomato soup While the soup was good the grilled cheese was also awful  The cheese was nowhere close to being melted   Like i said lesson learned  Stick to the pizza and pasta
