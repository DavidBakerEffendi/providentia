nice place spacious good decor Attentive considerate waitperson Attractive menu  lots of choices Complimentary chips (really good) with salsa  all of which are hot  good but spicy Just FYI The prices were ok a bit high  lunch for  with one beer one appetizer tax  tip  the high side of the  range There was a lot of food enough for  more average size meals We had the shrimp chimi app  ok although I wondered afterwards why  I should have known it would be tiny (probably canned) shrimp Nice to find on a menu though MH had the carne asada chimi  flavorful and large It was ok As for me I really didnt like my meal size (ok who am I kidding  it was HUGE) chicken chimichanga Im not an expert of Mexican food by any means but Ive had this dish before Theres got to be more to it than putting bite size (not really shredded) white chicken inside  really thats all there was no cheese sour cream salsa mixed with it  it was incredibly dry If these are your favorite ask about this first imo Maybe it was just the way I got it but I wasnt impressed It left me with a lot of retroprep work on the leftovers I might go back but I doubt it
