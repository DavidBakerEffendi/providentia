My wife brother and i went there last night and was really hoping for a great experience

did not have it first issue was they were busy hey usually I am ok with that because that means it is a great place but the reason they were busy was it seemed the employees were overwhelmed it took twenty minutes to get to front and order once ordering we were told a list of things they were out of so we ordered and like many people that frequent here they nmay have heard of it from Shark Tank  well on Shark Tank they promote like a  minute waqit from order to ice cream in hand well it was more like fifteen minutes once getting to front the cashierice cream maker took another five minutes to realize that I was waiting to pay then was able to pay and asked for napkins well it appears they are out of napkins (this was a Friday night in Mesa Az how are you out of napkins at an ice cream parlor) once I was able to enjoy the ice cream I found it underachieving it was bland
All in all I would rather go to stone cold creamery I drove out of my way about  miles for this place and will not do so again
