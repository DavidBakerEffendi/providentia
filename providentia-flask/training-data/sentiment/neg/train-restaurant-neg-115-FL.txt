I would give this restaurant a  but their rolls are very good The chicken is very very bland the sweet tea is too strong the gizzards were overcooked and they were out of the chicken livers  There is also this very bland weird white gravy that was tasteless  that comes with the combos The chicken is extremely greasy as well This place needs to get its act together or close It puts southern food to shame
