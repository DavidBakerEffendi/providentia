If you were at Dairy Queen tonight sorry for causing the seven car back up  Unfortunately the staff felt the need to force us to order a sundae instead of allowing us to order an ice cream with a topping as is advertised on their menu board and as we have done twice weekly for the last three months  The manager Chantel laughed at us to our faces claiming company policy while the original staff member was complaining about us to other staff  We asked repeatedly for him to discontinue and asked the manager to have him stop while we were still there but customer service isnt what it used to be  Better to make us upset and cause a back up then to honor your advertised menu board
