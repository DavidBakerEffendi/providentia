Went for breakfast on a Saturday the place was packed not enough seats and the few table that were open were dirty  Had the french toast as everyone goes on and on about it however I thought it to be just ok  It is about  inches thick which makes the middle very dry  Two others in my party had breakfast sandwiches which were loaded (dripping) with butteroil  The prices are reasonable it was only about  for  of us  Not that this is the resturants fault but parents were letting their children run loose they were standing in the windows crawling on the floor leaning over booths and screaming at other customers  We did buy a loaf of blueberrylemon bread that was delicious  Sorry but I will not go back here
