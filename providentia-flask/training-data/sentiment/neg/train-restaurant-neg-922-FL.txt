I was so excited
Anticipating a cute restaurant on a farm
Organic veggies

I got exactly what I was looking for and absolutely nothing else It is a cute restaurant on a farm It does have an interesting menu It does have prices that would attract a former NoSco resident but the social atmosphere I might as well have been at McDonalds Usually I would not blame the other patrons on a restaurant This time the crowd was so overwhelmingly obnoxious that I had to mention it It seemed like it was coming from everywhere noise pollution from every angle There were children running around with no shoes on and one mother was actually throwing fries at her child because he was misbehaving Right that will teach him

I had the veggie patch pizza and hubski had the grilled tuna sandwich featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives The food was mediocre although the sweet potato fries were tasty Hubski liked the cole slaw
We walked around the farm afterwards which was nice 

If I went back it would be to get a shake to go and walk around the farm Otherwise you wont catch me at Joes Farm Grill
