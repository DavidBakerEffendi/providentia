I ordered the Tbone and eggs The food wasnt the best especially hash browns and toast The hash browns were extremely bland and a little burnt Speaking of burnt the toast was One side was charred while the other was slightly burnt As for the Tbone i asked for medium and got wellcooked It was dry but A sauce helped a little The only safe thing was the eggs But a little later I got a stomach ache Although I wasnt happy  I gave a  star because Ive had worse
