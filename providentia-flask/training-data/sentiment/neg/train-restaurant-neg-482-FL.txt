Pad thai was pretty sad looked and tasted bland The egg was scrambled and thrown in as an afterthought and the shrimp were tiny Hubby had the ramen which looked more appealing and tasted ok Place seemed chaotic and there was always a line to get a drink Was excited about a noodles restaurant but disappointed with the food
