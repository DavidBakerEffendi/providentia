No goodsorry Kneadersyoull never be Paradise Bakery Our first visit was so bad and the sandwiches were awful that they gave us two free sandwiches for our next visit and those were just as badservice is also poor Save yourself time and stick with a classic like Paradise Bakery or Flancers (Heck save yourself a ton of money and just go to Subway in the same shopping center as the quality is about the same) Kneaders sandwiches are all breadno meat
