Hadnt been to this Nandos in a long time because the Chandler store is much closer  The service was mediocre and the food wasnt nearly as good as it was in the past nor as good as the Chandler store  My wifes taco came out cold  We sent it back and they returned it and my wife said the taco didnt taste good and there was only half the amount of chicken compared to when it initially came out

Well stick to the Chandler store on Dobson and Germann
