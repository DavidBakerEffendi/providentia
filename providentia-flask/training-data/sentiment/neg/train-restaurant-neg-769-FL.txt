Today was a very bad experience at Chipotle The staff was rude It was chaotic and they couldnt get an order straight Plus the amount of meat they put on their meals has diminished When we ask for more chicken they were Surly and argumentative there are plenty of other options in this area I would not recommend Chipotle The only reason I gave it to stars is because the food was okay otherwise I would have given it one star
