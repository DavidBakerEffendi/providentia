For all the hype this place gets I was really disappointed The ambiance and atmosphere is definitely cute There are a bunch of trees and picnic tables to eat at outside The inside is cute as well However we came in on Sunday a little after   And the inside was filthy They werent crowded as there was plenty of seating We found ONE table that looked clean There was food all over the carpet and all of the tables were just nasty This is definitely a hotspot usually drawing big crowds so you would think that management would staff adequately It was just gross The food was good nothing spectacular I ordered the pesto pecan chicken burger It wasnt pestoit was mayonnaise based The chicken was mediocre at best My boyfriend  got the farm chicken sandwich and he said it was good but nothing memorable I got the garlic fries for my side and those were absolutely amazing with tons of garlic and he ordered fried zucchini which was soggy and nasty   Needless to say this place failed to live up to all the hype Ive heard about it We definitely wont be returning
