Well appointed and decorated location with friendly staff who were very good at their job Sunday morning started with a delicious bloody mary and really well made chips and salsa For our entrees we selected the migas which were painfully dry and very under seasoned and the vegetable omelet which had perfectly cooked eggs but the vegetables inside were way undercooked They really needed a few minutes in the saute pan the mushrooms were crunchy not in a good way The plain red potatoes that were either boiled or cooked on a low temp and then covered in a mound of flavorless white cheese The potatoes were probably the saddest side dish I have had in a restaurant in a while Please check the master recipe as I cannot imagine someone in the menu presentation said these were good That being said the fried tortilla with cinnamon sugar and fresh fruit were the stars of the meals We had high expectations but were underwhelmed by the entrees
