MUST READ TILL THE END

This place is probably THE worst Canes Ive been to My friend spilt his drink outside and he walked up to the drivethrough They told him You need a car to get another drink They made him get his car from the parking lot to get a drink and wasted everyones time when instead they couldve filled up his cup THEN AND THERE One of the employees also denied to take my other friends order when the store itself was almost closed (but the drivethrough was still open) He then asked for togo and the manager stepped in and took care of it Theres no difference in giving food at the front or the drivethrough
