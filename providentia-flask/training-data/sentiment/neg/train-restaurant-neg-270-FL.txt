The food and service is  times better at Wildflower bread Company Drive two more miles down the road to wildflower and you will be glad you did I will never come here again Such bad customer serviceI can be a bit particular and I own that but when I am paying I expect to be satisfied I always bring it up nicely I apologize and thank whoever is helping me I am no not rude at all but I am assertive I ordered something that came with varieties that I was unaware of and was not given the variety I had in mind The person taking my order never asked for a specification so when I tried it and didnt like the one I had I try to exchange it for the one I wanted or simply return it for a refund The person helping me would not accommodating at all They wanted proof of purchase for something I wasnt satisfied with when Im standing right there with their food item so I obviously purchased it But I had already thrown away my receipt with my lunch After waiting  minutes in line again hoping to deal with somebody else I got the same person possibly the shift manager and again was apologize to but there was no restitution was even offered
