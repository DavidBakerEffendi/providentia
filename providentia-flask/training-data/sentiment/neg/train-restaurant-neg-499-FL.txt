Alexis and I were excited when we saw an Indian restaurant open up in our neighborhood   We have neighborhood restaurants and will support them over chains any day  There is only a few catches    Service has to be friendly and they were very friendly   Clean and though my fork was less than clean overall the place was clean and you can tell that the employees and owners really take it seriously  Food has to be great   So this is where the had a less than enjoyable time  We went midafternoon and it was buffet only  Hmmm ok  Odd but ok  Nothing was cold the Chicken was average but acceptable   The Naan was doughy In the end we came we saw we ate we wanted more and both agreed that we will not be back  For a very beautiful restaurant we think they should have spend more on the food and less on the atmosphere
