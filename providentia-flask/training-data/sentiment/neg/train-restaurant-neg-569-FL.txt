This has to be one of the most inefficient Dennys I have ever been to Waited  minutes before having to find someone to take out drink order then another  minutes to get a coffee OJ and water Had the waitress take our ores right away then waited another  minutes to get it Good didnt come out all togetherstill waiting for other half of our order and what did come out is cold 

Ridiculous wait times They know their Sunday rush times and should accommodate with additional staff Wont ever be back to this dennys
