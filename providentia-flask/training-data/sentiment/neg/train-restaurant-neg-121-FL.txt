Tried to give this place a try but the chicken had absolutely NO flavor to it it was rubbery and did not taste good at all  I tried the mac and cheese and I am pretty sure it was made the week before again no taste at all Didnt even taste like cheese not sure what the heck it was  Probably the worst chicken  meal I have had in a LONG time (  sorry I really wanted to try them it was so bad that I dont think there a chance of my second meal being any better
