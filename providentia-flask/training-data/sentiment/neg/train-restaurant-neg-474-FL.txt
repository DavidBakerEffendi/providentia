Sorry i have to change my rating After looking up nutritional info on this dish I learned that it has MORE carbs then a standard pasta dish  Being pitched as low carb only to find out it has  carbs (with only  fiber grams) this is far from a low carb option So disappointed


Hats off to noodles and company for offering Zoodles  Tried the spicy peanut saute and Im super impressed Zoodles were crispy lots of peanut and spice and the veggies were yummy too So nice to have a place to eat out with a low carb option
