Food was decent Lots of TVs but I mean come on its a bar and grill there are s of these around these days that being said the service was terrible It was a Saturday and must have been only  services for the bar tables but literally the girl took forever and I was almost done with my meal by the time she asked if it was tasting good Price point is per usual for a bar and grill
