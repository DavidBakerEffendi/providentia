My first time going to this restaurant and will NEVER return It was not busy and yet when I walked in I was not acknowledged and the hostess stood there looking around the restaurant slowly trying to seat a table of  in front of us Even though there were two hostesses we were not acknowledged for nearly  minutes One of the hostesses did looked at us (party or ) and then proceeded to answer the phone without saying anything like be with you in just a moment and took an extensive togo order while we just stood there Finally we were acknowledged  she took us to the most crowded part of the restaurant and we asked to be seated in a quieter area This posed a problem and the hostess had a bit of an attitude but seated us in a corner in another area While we did receive chips and frozen or old salsa immediately  it took nearly  more minutes before the server arrived to take our drink order At that point we were ready to leave It was not nearly busy enough to have that slow of service and who knows how long it wouldve taken for our food to be prepped We were completley underwhelmed by this place If you are looking for a place where people move at a snail pace this place might be right for you Otherwise I would steer clear
