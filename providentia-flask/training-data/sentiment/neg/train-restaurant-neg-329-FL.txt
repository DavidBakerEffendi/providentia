In baseball its three strikes youre out Im not sure Cantina Laredo is going to get a third at bat with me More on that in a moment

These days I watch what I eat I attempt to eat healthier foods and I was excited to see that Cantina Laredo added Pollo Asado a roasted half chicken with grilled street corn and black beans to their menu a while back 

Batter up

We were seated for dinner at  on a Tuesday night our table of  perused their menus but not this guy I already knew what I was getting We placed our orders and I was excited to try this elusive new chicken dish Why elusive you ask Well thats because the last time I ordered it several months back July th specifically I was told they were out of it at  pm Wow I thought this chicken must be amazing to be sold out before the dinner rush Ok Ill give them a hall pass on this amazing dish and take the first strike 

The server came to me for my order and without so much as a moments hesitation I ordered my dinner I was finally going to taste this legendary and elusive dish 

It was a good  minutes later when a woman came to the table and informed me that I was about to swing and miss for strike two Yes Cantina Laredo was once again out of this unicorn  of a dish 

So here I am back from my second strike at the same restaurant and Im not sure if I should take another at bat I think a walk might be better perhaps a walk to El Pollo Loco I hear they have chicken in stock
