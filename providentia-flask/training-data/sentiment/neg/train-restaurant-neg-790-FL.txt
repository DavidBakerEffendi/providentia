I love Chiptole  Rarely do I have a bad experience This was one of them As I placed my order most of the staff was friendly and efficient Except the salsa girl  I asked for Pico and I got maybe a half scoop I asked for sour cream and got maybe a teaspoon I asked for cheese and again a negligible amount  I literally stood there staring for a few seconds before I proceeded Was she being health conscious I cant say but she gave me attitude when I asked her for extra cheese and sour cream Smh 

In addition the white rice had minimal flavor not the usual And the babacoa had too much gristle 

Still with so many positive experiences at other locations I will still go back just maybe not to this location
