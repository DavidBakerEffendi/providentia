This is actually a ZERO star review I had the worst customer service of my life here and will not come here again regardless of it being more convenient than Bosa because of the drive thru I dont know the womans name who was taking orders through the drive thru (short blonde hair) but she is absolutely one of the rudest people I have ever dealt with I told her I wanted a mixed dozen and started telling her what I wanted and she rudely interrupted and said a mixed dozen doesnt give you the option to choose what donuts you want that would be assorted but whatever I guess start listing off what you want for something you didnt order I told her I didnt know there was a difference between mixed or assorted and continued on with my order where she continued to make snide comments She was extremely rude and I will not spend money at a place who doesnt take pride in who they hire  If higher management reads these reviews please take a look at who was working this morning (June  ) at this location around am and give this girl some training on customer service cause she needs a class or two or ten
