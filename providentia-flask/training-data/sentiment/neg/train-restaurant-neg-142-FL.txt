We ordered the beyond burger and rainbow tofu Was really excited to try this spot but man was I disappointed The sweet potato and potato fries were oily soggy and half cooked The tofu far from crispy under seasoned The only decent thing was the beyond burger Paid  for  meals and I would have been better off going to chipotle Would not go here again Save your money
