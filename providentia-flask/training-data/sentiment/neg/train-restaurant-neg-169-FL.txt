This was my first visit to Topgolf The security guard outside wouldnt let me in with my water bottle Its Arizona in May You should be able to go everywhere with water bottles this is a safety issue When I tried to explain this to the security guard he made me throw it in the trash (When I later got into my bay one of the bays next to us was passing a flask around) That didnt give me a very good first impression of the business and I hadnt even made it in the door yet 

I ordered a membership card online prior to arriving because I was told that it would be easier than waiting in line to buy one there I still had to wait in line to pick it up and when I did they had no record of my purchase When I showed them my receipt email on my phone the receipt that was sent to me was for another person I spoke with a manager and forwarded him the emails so that he could send it to corporate to investigate Safe to say Im a bit nervous that they cant keep receipts straight in email Im worried about them having my credit card information 

All in all a negative first experience I will wait to see how the membership issue is resolved but as it stands right now I was not impressed enough to want to give them any more of my money
