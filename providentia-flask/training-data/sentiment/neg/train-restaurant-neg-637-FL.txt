This place has a good atmosphere but thats where it ends  Ive gone three times  The first time I ordered fish tacos and they brought me fish and chips  I told them I really want the tacos  It took so long to bring the tacos I asked for them to go because my dinner date had been done for  a while  Second time I do have to say my husband and I went sat at the bar our bartender was fabulous and the food was good  Took my family there last Wednesday  We started with the hummus for an appetizer  Not only was it the worst hummus Ive tasted they served it with a hand full of blue tortilla chips two pieces of bruschetta bread and a bunch of veggies that made no since at all  For my cocktail I ordered a grapefruit vodka with club soda  I was brought tequila the waiter even tasted it agreed it wasnt vodka but I was still charged for the tequila drink The food took so long we asked for it to go AGAIN we had a one year old with us and her time was up  Here is what made me decide this would be our last visit  It was the manager that had to bring my to go tacos the first time it was also the same manager that cleared the hummus board  He had to of noticed that we barely touched it  He did not say one word asking of if anything was wrong  This tells me customer satisfaction is not a priority  Just a bad experience overall
