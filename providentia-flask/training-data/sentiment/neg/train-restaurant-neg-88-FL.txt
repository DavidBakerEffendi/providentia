Can only rate the service since never actually got food Wanted some friend chicken for dinner so decided to try bushes Pull into drivethrough and it said  lanes so pulled into the nd lane No ordering kiosk like most places so just sat there along with a lot of other people After about  minutes of the servers just passing us by and only serving the one lane got annoyed and went inside to order Got up to counter after it took  minutes just for one person to order Order a  piece chicken with  sides family pack and then Im told they dont have any chicken ready it will be  minutes to cook chicken WTF It is a chicken place with no chicken All they had was the strips but we didnt want strips Manager offered no solution apologized that his drive through was not working as it should and gave me no option but to drive one street down to popeyes and enjoy a quick easy drive through experience with no issues
