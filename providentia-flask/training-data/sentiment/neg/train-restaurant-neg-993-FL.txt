Good not great I choose the all you can eat  Great deal but when you go that route they make the pieces very large with a ton of  rice to fill you up  Big Thick slices of fish  and rice overstuffed hand rolls are not the makings of tasty sushi

 Also I felt like I was being watched over like a hawk and anytime I ordered more sushi I felt like they were upset  Wow you eat more was one comment I heard them say to me  Im a big guy ( ) and can eat my fair share but I assure you I didnt eat that much that  they should have been giving me the evil eye 

Overall if you want cheap prices and average quality this place fits the bill  If you can afford to pay for quality go elsewhere
