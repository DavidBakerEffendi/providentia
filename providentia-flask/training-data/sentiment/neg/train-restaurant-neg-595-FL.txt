 stars are for the friendly cash registerwaiter guys that were working the front as you walk in Michael and another guy in glasses

 stars for the horrible food

There were maybe  tables seated  It was not busy at all No excuse for crappy service and screaming in kitchen that I could hear at front door where I was waiting 

To go order   sandwiches  and tater tots
Everything was burnt with the exception of one of the egg ham sandwiches  orders of tots burnt so badly that I dont even think there was any cheese in them and if so  it didnt survive being burned to death  Needless to say  they were so dry they crumbled All but the  attempts to fund good ones but became crumbled ones were dumped out

Egg ham sausage whatever it was called sandwich Was very burned on the outside and it was way too mapley but nay be that is how its made Not sure

Asked for a side of mayo ( times confirmed by glad guy) l so of course it wasnt in the bag when I got home He even happily told me it was there as he handed me the bag 

May I have my  tip back May i just have the whole bill compensated So disappointing to waste money like that  

Last time there
