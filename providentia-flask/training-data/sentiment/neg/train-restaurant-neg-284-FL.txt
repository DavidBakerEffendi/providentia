Went there today as my daughter took me there today for my birhtday My daughter made the mistake of mentioning that she she had a salmon sushi with a sauce at another sushi place The woman working the floor pointed out the salmon sushi which was  or  dollars My daughter wasnt interested A bit later she came back to us and asked if we want any appetizers I said I would like some white steamed rice and she smerked at me I said we also would want some edanmame and Then we decided to order We ordered Tina sashimi and a roll The girl said Ok a tuna sashimi Your tempura roll and salmon sashimi I said no not the salmon sashimi but maybe later She said you order all at same time Very pushy and nervy I said no We are in no hurry My daughter ordered water as her drink When they came with a refill it was sprite soda We just assumed it was a mistake However when the bill came we noticed that they charged us for a soda Some sushi places think they can get away with pressure tactics to increase their bottom line Problem is its glaringly obvious that they know exactly what they are doing in this case they are wrong We wont be back
