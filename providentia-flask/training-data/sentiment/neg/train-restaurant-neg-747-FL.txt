I lived in Philly for a decade and I am very familiar with Pat Geno Jim and Dalessandro  Ive never been a Genos fan and this continues to be true here in Arizona And even as a Pats fan I can say this location is not worthy of the name Genos The bread is wrong and the lack of alacarte pricing sucks Someone who just wants a REAL cheesesteak (cheese and onions) shouldnt be paying the same as someone who wants mushrooms peppers red sauce etc
