We bought a restaurantcom certificate to try out the restaurant on  I tried using it on  but the waitress said that they do not honor it because restaurantcom should have stopped selling it on  She finally let me use it after telling her that it is ridiculous and it is not my fault that restaurantcom still sells it 
The service was terrible We have asked for water refill several times but no one refilled it We ordered ramen noodle and some sushi The ramen tasted terrible even my teenage son complains about it The sushi was not as tasty either 
I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone
