Went here on a Saturday afternoon and ordered a turkey avocado and bacon salad The boy who took my order asked if it was to go or dinein and I said it was for dinein My salad was delivered less than two minutes later in a togo box on a plastic servingbowl basket Some kind of paper lined thing that made no real sense There was apparently no choice of dressingit came with two containers of ranch The salad was okay but obviously had been premade and had a large piece of extremely wilted and obviously brown of lettuce

 My companion ordered a pannini sandwich also came before she even made it to sit at the table The sandwich was justhorrible She couldnt eat more than a couple of bites and said it tasted like it had been made earlier in the day then microwaved to superheat it before it was tossed on a pannini press to brown it a bit The result was an extraordinarily hot soggy sandwich that was basically inedible She asked to see the manager and when he appeared she told him her meal was horrible and inedible He said he was sorry and did we want him to have it remade When she refused he just said Okay sorry and took the plate away No refund was offered or given nor was she offered a different menu item as compensation so she basically just had to sit and wait while I finished my meal with nothing to eat for herself

Poor customer service and food that was marginal at best I will not be returning and I dont recommend that anyone else does either
