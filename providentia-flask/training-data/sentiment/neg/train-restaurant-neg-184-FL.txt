Second time here and Ive gotta say Scottsdale cant be beat
This Gilbert customer service was NOT on point The counter people werent friendly and our host was trying to act smart with me I made eye contact smiled and nodded to maybe  or  different hosts that didnt acknowledge me back Then the security guard came and bothered us when we werent even doing anything wrong I didnt come here with my  year old brother and disabled father to be harassed by some rent a cop I think he yelled at us because we were the only people there that werent white 

The food was ok
