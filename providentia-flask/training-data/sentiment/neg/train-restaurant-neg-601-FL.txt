Great atmosphere  for a pint of adult root beer is kind of ridiculous considering San Tan and Wilderness brewery are right down the street and have lunch specials  for an over cooked burger and adult root beer at lunch noon Disappointed since we work down the street and were looking for a new lunch spot Place is over priced No specials Mediocre service when it only had maybe  customers in there Asked for burger medium rare came out well done and over peppered Ate half of it Waste of money
