We had the sushi so I dont know if the teppanyaki is better   Overall it was a poor experience  We ordered  or  rolls and they were all mediocre  The rolls fell apart so much so you couldnt use chop sticks  The crab tasted like imitation crab meet  

There are plenty of other sushi places so avoid this place if you are craving sushi
