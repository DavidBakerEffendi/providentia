I was very pleased to receive a response to my review that Id previously posted I was very disappointed in the situation that took place however I do believe that the  Dominos corporates care about their customers I actually mentioned my experience to a friend of mine and was informed that she too had a similar situation happen when her teenage son ordered from this peticular location Its a little disheartening to think of how many other people may have been short changed by their delivery drivers Hopefully this will be adressed and not tolerated
