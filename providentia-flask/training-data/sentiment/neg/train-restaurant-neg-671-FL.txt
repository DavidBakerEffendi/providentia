This DD is sadly very disappointing Ive tried to give them  different tries over about a years time frame One time I experienced the manager and the employee arguing at the register as the employee walked away in tears Another time it took them  minutes to give me a cold breakfast biscuit and barely warm coffee  They seem to be always rude and disorganized  I think Im done coming here  Thats unfortunate because I like their black coffee with sugar and creamer  
Customer service goes a long way They could really thrive if they either A had a better team Or B worked on becoming a better team together
