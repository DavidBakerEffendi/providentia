Great idea for a driving range  However  we chose to go on a Friday night It was a madhouse I dont recommend doing this They assured us of a  hr wait So we waited and after that hour we were still th in line for a bay and were told it would be another hour and  min 

If you want to practice your swing dont go to Top Golf If you want to drink and fry a Friday night waiting and drinking with the possibility of hitting a few balls this is the place for you
