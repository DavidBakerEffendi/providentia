Ended up going to chic fila to get what i wanted At Caines I Dont like their sauces and did not want a drink Cashier tried to sell me a meal Told her I dont like the sauce and did not want a drink I just wanted fingers and fries She told me that a meal would be cheaper I replied i dont care how you ring it up i only want the chicken and fries She kept arguing with me so I told her to forget it and walked out 

I just did not want to waste the drink and sauces since all i was going to do was throw them away anyway 

I went to chicfila and got exactly what i wanted since their menu accommodates the choices 

I like Caines chicken but if their help cannot be creative on orders or the menu cannot add the ability to order just chicken at decent price then i guess i will go to chicfila more often
