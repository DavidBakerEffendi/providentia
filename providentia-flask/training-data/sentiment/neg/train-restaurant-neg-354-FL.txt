Loved the Cantina Laredo in Houston but found everything from the food to the service to be lackluster at this location  The hostesss greeting was odd  She stood facing away from us and while wiping at an already clean portion of the counter behind the hosts station looked over her shoulder and said hi  This being the full extent of her introduction we volunteered that there were two in our party  She seated us right next to the front door  Seeing that the restaurant was still mostly empty I asked if we could be seated elsewhere to which our nonemotive hostess agreed  It took ten minutes before our server arrived which at pm on a Saturday seems excessive

Our six month old is still BFing and is still very much allergic to nonhuman dairy proteins in her milk  Im talking blood in her diaper allergic  So its important that my wife not have dairy which is something she was clear about  The server assured her that the dish she was looking at did not contain any cheese but as it turns out it did  Being cautious my wife caught it before diving in  By the time she received another dish I was already finished with mine which brings me too

queso  Its probably my fault for not remembering that Americans generally think velveeta is what queso means  I ordered a steak fajita burito that was topped with cilantro and tomato slices that is to say three leafs of cilantro and five pieces of chopped tomato  And the plastic cheese smothering  Its like ordering a dish and expecting filet mignon wrapped in bacon and getting filet mignon wrapped in bologna  I might as well poor ketchup on the fajita steak

Given that our visit was lengthened considerably by their inattention to detail and the fact that our dining experience was undermined by only one of us eating at any given time a comp on one of the dishes wouldve been nice but was not forthcoming

Just another mediocre Mexican restaurant  There are better options
