My husband and I went to the restaurant last minute heard the food and drinks were good Both of us ordered burgers tator tots Beer and a specialty cocktail Cinco de mayo dos for  Cocktail was  Small and weak cocktail 
Burgers were delicioustator tots could have been hotter Good meal 
What we noticed is all the employees doing nothing  counted  of them in the entrance talking looking at there phones yelling giving finger gestures to each other No manager around Prices would be lower with out all the kids on payroll We watched some of the drives cool place but seems like a kid atmosphere with a bar
