Took out of town guests  Service was good  The chips and the cheese crisp were amazing  HOWEVER I ordered carnitasI have never had such dry and tasteless carnitas  They were able to get me something elseBurrito taco and tostada  The taco meat was super duper salty  I brought most of it home and ending up throwing it away  I didnt want to waste the calories on bad mexican food
They service was good and attentive  Just sad about my meal
