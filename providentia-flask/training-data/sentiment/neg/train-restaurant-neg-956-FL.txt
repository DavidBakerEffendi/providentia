Used to eat here often especially since it has outdoor seating and is family friendly The Fontina Burger and Tuna Burger were our favorites We stopped going here after we saw that Joes hosted a fundraiser for a local Tea Party candidate that featured none other than the Queen of Mean herselfSarah Palin So this may bolster Joes reputation for those of you who love RightWing politics but for us it was a huge turnoff We would rather spend our money on local businesses who put their funds into Progressive candidates or simply back into the community
