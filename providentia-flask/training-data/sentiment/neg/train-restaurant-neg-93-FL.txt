It was my first time ordering food here my cousins like this place but they always tell me they forget stuff all the time Well thats exactly what happened to me earlier this week as well We ordered the mix and match family combo with a drink and they forgot our okra I called they said theyll cover it the next time we are in unfortunately we will no longer go back
Our large soda was literally ALL ice it was ridiculous my bf ended up finishing it in the mile and a half it took us to get home
Once we got home like stated above we realize our okra was missing then while I was eating my chicken I noticed a piece of chicken was missing too
But I didnt even bother to call about it because we ended up not even eating it because of how INCREDIBLY SALTY it was which is unfortunate because I LOVED how crispy their skin was
Later on that night all of us who had chicken were literally taking turns on the porcelain throne probably due to high sodium in our system or food poisoning

Only gave two stars because the staff was nice bread was good and loved how crispy everything was But with  missing items incredibly salty batter and meat along with a wrecked stomach for all of us not worth it

Oh and I am the Queen of Salt but even this tasted like I was drinking salt mouth dried up and everything
