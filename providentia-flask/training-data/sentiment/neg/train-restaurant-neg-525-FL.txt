Dropped by El Pollo Loco on   minutes before closing The entire restaurant was ready for closing Very little food was available except  overcooked pieces of chicken on a small corner of the grill (the rest of the grill had been cleaned ready for closing) We left Clearly El Pollo Loco closes at  pm on Saturdays not  pm
