Although it is a great concept The customer service and prices at this place are horrible The food is super over priced which I wouldnt mind if it wasnt disgusting and was only made to serve two people Also they know how much they charge per hour yet the bays only allow you to charge your card certain prices which is of course over the amount they are charging per hour Also if you try to add time it just adds it to your card not to your actual time Of course no one tells you how to actually conduct this so after racking up  on our cards we had to have a manager refund us After an extra  minutes process we were able to be done The lack of customer service really ruined our experience We wont be coming back anytime soon
