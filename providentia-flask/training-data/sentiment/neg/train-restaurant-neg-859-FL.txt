Let me start by saying my family has been eating at Nandos for quite a few years  Weve visited both the Gilbert and East Mesa locations and seem to have the worst service experiences at the Gilbert restaurant  We really enjoy the food though they do occasionally have an off night where the entrees arent hot enough or some other faux pas like forgotten items wrong orders etc
We visited the Gilbert location this afternoon for an early dinner and as usual the place was busy  Not packedbut filling up
We were seated immediately by the Hostess and the server that brings chips and salsa arrived shortly thereafter  Pleasant and courteous as usual
Here is where the wheels fell off  The server for that particular area was nowhere to be found and the section was quite full  We noticed several tables in some state of waiting for their meals drink refills paying the check etc  The mental time clock started at that point  There was a table of  seated across from us and had been there long enough to eat a good amount of chipsalthough they had no drinks other than the water pitcher that resides on every table  Clearly they had been seated for some time  We waited no less than  minutes before we saw our server for the very first time  He greeted us and informed us hed be right back  
He attended to his other guests and was looked upon like a long lost relative who hadnt been heard from for years
While we waited another table of  was seated next to us and received their chips and salsa quickly  Another  minutes passed and the server showed up to take drinkdinner orders from us first  We informed him the table across from us had been waiting much longer than we had and he should help them first which he did  He then attended to us and then the table of  next to us  Keep in mind these folks had only just arrived minutes earlier
Ultimately all orders were taken  Can you guess which table was served their food firstthats rightthe table of  that had been waiting the shortest amount of time  The table of  was nextwe unfortunately came in dead last when our food arrived  minutes later  
To give you and idea of how much time passed from being seated to actually seeing a plate of food in front of us minutes  Entirely too long for Mexican food of any quality
We are strongly considering this visit to be our last  An unfortunate situation that could easily be remedied by proper training and communication among the staff
