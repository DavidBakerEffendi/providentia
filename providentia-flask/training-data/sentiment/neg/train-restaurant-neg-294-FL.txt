Every time Ive walked into this place its empty You are the last priority of the waitress and no one is behind the counter If you get sushi its going to be  minutes even if you order  rolls and the chef (if you can call them that) is just some mediocre reject from another restaurant 

Just stop feeding their ratings This place is bad And the sushi is bad
