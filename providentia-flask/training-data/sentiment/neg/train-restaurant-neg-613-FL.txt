I post this having ordered a chocolate brownie royal blizzard looking into my cup only to find no brownie pieces Not a single one We paid  for an extra scoop of them and it doesnt appear as if any made it to the cup The chocolate fudge that is supposed to be in the middle is not and a tiny amount has been swirled into the top Last time I checked the whole point of a royal blizzard was to have a center of ice cream with one of their sauces you could mix in as you pleased Apparently this location did not get the memo

Dairy Queen You have failed me when I needed you most on this cheat day I am highly disappointed in you The Queen Creek location should come teach you how its done 

PS If you think fast good employees deserve  an hour forget it If you cant get a simple order right theres no way in hell youre getting more money than someone who actually works for a living
