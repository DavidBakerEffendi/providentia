NOT Handicap friendly Went here after seeing them on Channel  news and viewing their menu online Maybe my expectations were too high but I was very put off by managements lack of humane treatment toward the handicapped After expected the handicapped to endure long lines STANDING outside in the hot sun you would think management would at least offer a chair when asked if there was anything they could do for the handicapped And not being  years old anymore you would think theyd accommodate the aging category with a foot long hot dog that ISNT loaded with the chili and cheese on it (You can ask for it but they charge you  for a hot dog the same as the fully loaded one)  And the outside dining area which really brings in the farmhouse feel isnt really wheelchair friendly with several inch drops off the sidewalk to the picnic tables  Thats a shame because aging and handicapped individuals deserve the same opportunity to enjoy their nostalgic food stand goodies as much as the next guy Nevertheless I gave them two stars for their great food offerings if you dont mind overpaying for items you cant eat or being in pain when you do finally get to sit down and eat them
