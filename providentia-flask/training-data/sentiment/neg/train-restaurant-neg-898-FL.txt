Disappointed 
I have mixed feelings about this place We came to the new larger location on a Saturday which happened to be there nd day open 
The staff seemed very unorganized not trained and had no communication between other employees 
They gave us free garlic knots which were terrible It was just a ball of cooked dough They had no flavor 
We ordered our food only to be told  minutes later that they were out of lasagna For being your second day open  a Saturday you should not be out of a main dish 
We ended up just ordering a hot sandwich  slices of pizza 
The slices of pizza came out way before the sandwich so needless to say we were almost done with our pizza before the sandwich even made it to the table 
The pizza was good and with the lunch special pricing Id come back 
The sandwich was just ok I would not order again 
The sum it all up I think they rushed the opening and staff were not properly trained
