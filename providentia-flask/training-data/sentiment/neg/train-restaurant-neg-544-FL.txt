I received a gift card so I went againbeen several months  I remember why I didnt go back  The staff and service were excellentthis is NOT about the employees  I ordered The Caniac Combo  First the french fries are like those OreIda Golden Crinkles French Fried Potatoes you bake at home  Not much flavor and they go limp with all the moisture in the togo container the worst  Second the chicken tenders are too thick and the breading has no flavor its edible but Ive had better tasting chicken tenders from Frys grocery store  The sauce is terribleits like they mixed tartar sauce with some barbecue and mayonnaise  Ill never be back  Its like Val Vista  Williams Field is a retail food corner with lameness oozing from underneath  First the Burger King that we never went to (been here almost  years) and now this  At least Bushs chicken down the street has better sauces  But if you want good chicken  fast stick with Chikfila  I have no idea why these RCs keep going up all over the placenothing special
