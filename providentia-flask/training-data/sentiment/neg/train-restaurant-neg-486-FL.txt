Lunch there today I read the Yelp reviews before I went Many of the same things other diners had mentioned were still issues I got a salad It tasted fine but was so small it didnt even cover the bottom of the bowl The lettuce what little there was was wilty  I wouldnt have thought too much about it but a man came to sit over near us as we were finishing and had a salad too His lunch completely filled the bowl and was even rounded on top That is about the size you normally see for a luncheon sized main dish serving
The restaurant was clean 
There was a line at the single drink dispenser even though there were few people eating there
There are a lot of restaurants available I think Ill chose a different one from now on
