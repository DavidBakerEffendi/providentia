st time here and I accidentally requested a table for  to someone that looked like a manager  He quickly and curtly corrected me and told me I needed to order at the counter  He then proceeded to ask me if I wanted a menu and handed me a very well used menu that was even more bent than I was at this point I apologized and said oh sorry its our first time here  His response Yeah you order at the counter any questions  Needless to say food was ok not worth the  however thank God they explain their giving campaign online or I wouldve had no clue how they truly give back  Customer service was below average  Especially since I gave them the chance to explain what they do  No thanks I will spend my money elsewhere
