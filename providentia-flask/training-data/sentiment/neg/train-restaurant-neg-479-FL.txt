They do not have the ability to give you decent portion sizes I dont pay full price for a regular to get the equivalent of what a kids meal would be I would easily go to any other Noodles over this one at this point as Tempe Noodles has always been great and has NEVER been stingy This place is way too stingy for the prices And why is it only this Noodles  Company They also have an issue with taking pick up orders at the pick up order register Every time I come to pick up an order they either have someone actually placing an order at the pick up register or they ask you to go to one of the other registers Whats the point of designating a pick up register if you dont use it for that ever But mainly The portions I mean Come on Picture included to show how ridiculously stingy they are
