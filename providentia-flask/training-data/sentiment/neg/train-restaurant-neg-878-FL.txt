Bad bad bad  Moved to the Valley from Tucson and based on many yelpers comments decided to try Nandos to get our Mexican food fix  There was a line out the door and the place was packed  We had high hopes  Guacamole tasted like something purchased in a refrigerated section of the grocery store  Salsa tasted like tomato sauce  Neither my husband nor I could finish the food  Bland not the least bit authentic and downright gross  Took the leftovers home to my teenage kids (they usually eat everything)  They took one bite and discarded the restciting that Taco Bell was more authentic  My only assumption can be that those that have yelped have never experienced authentic Mexican food
