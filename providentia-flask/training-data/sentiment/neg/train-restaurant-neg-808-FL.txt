The Beer Bacon Cheeseburger is the biggest abomination of a hamburger that I have ever eaten It tastes like beef patties drowned in a nacho cheese SAUCE I could barely discern the flavor of the vegiesbun or ketchup or mayo It was so rich and greasy that I felt sick after eating it Id like to mention that virtually ever one of specialty burgers have been incredibly delicious and well conceived Nobodys perfect The drive through service was quick and courteous as usual
