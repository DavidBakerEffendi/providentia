My wife has been wanting to bring me here to check it out so we did today She usually goes to the one in Chandler but she thought wewould check this one out instead as it was closer 

The ambiance of the place left a bit to be desired in my opinion It didnt seem to have any central theme Seriously whats with the metal bull and matador in the mens roomhmmm Anyhow there are no booths which I hate  except a couple of half booth tables that were already taken The music was too soft  low so you can hear peoples conversations around you So yea I got a couple of eye ball daggers thrown at me Some woman let her  kids run around the dining room like it was Chucky Cheese 

Food was actually rather good even though it was difficult for me to come up with a good selection with the diet Im on We had an appetizer of humus that was artfully displayed on the plate with a dichotomous split  down the middle with jalapeo cilantro humus on one side and red pepper humus on the other My wife had the pita bread with it and ordered me some cucumber chips to dip  awesome stuff You guys have that jalapeo cilantro humus nailed 

My wife had a Caribbean salad which looked like it was plucked fresh off the Chiquita Banana Ladies hat Good looking artfully designed plate She liked it 

I had a grilled chicken salad and asked for feta cheese on top Salad looked great but our Patrick Dempsey looking server bolted before I could ask him for additional dressing I forget that places like this literally spritz a single mist of vinaigrette on the salad in fear of offending Suzy slender bones that shes fat  Server McDempsey was no where to be found as I waited and waited painstakingly eating the dry salad He got there eventually and I asked him for the dressing and he said Sure man Then he went to the busser station and talked with someone got a drink rang an order bussed some plates and then got my dressing  dude Dempsey WTF 

The place left a bit to be desired but the food was good In my opinion you need good food ambient atmosphere and efficient service   out of  in these economic times aint bringing me back in

Moreover the management staff needs to have a refresher course in hygiene with its employees Now Im no clean freak whatsoever Christ I used to drink out of the friggin garden hose when I was a kid  ah who am I kidden I still do  Anyhow Im looking over at a table with a woman who just sneezed all over the top of her drink  allergies I guess Well she gets up and leaves and the petite bus girl comes up and bussed the tables and sticks her fingers inside of three glasses in order to carry them away to the bus station She comes out with a clean rag to wipe the table and fresh silverware roll ups in the soiled hand  nice Even worse Im watching server McDempsey talk to another guy employee while hes running his fingers through his gelled hair scratching his scalp and then rubs his nose with his thumb and index finger He then goes and serves plates of food to the people next to us Only good thing  the customer was the frigid woman who shot me the stink eye earlier Heres to hair gel in your pita lady
