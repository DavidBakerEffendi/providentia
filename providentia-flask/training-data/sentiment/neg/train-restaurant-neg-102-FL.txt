Very disappointing We were excited to try this new place in Gilbert But sorry to say the coating on the chicken breast was bland and had no flavor It was very moistjust no flavorwe expected something similar to Raising Canesbut no such luckit was also poorly run and unorganized as they had a long line and it seemed understaffed for lunch time

My wife did give a two thumbs up on the coleslawvery tasty

Sorry Bushswe wont be back
