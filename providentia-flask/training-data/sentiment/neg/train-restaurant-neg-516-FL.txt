Worst service ever The food is decent but going through the drive through they wont give you more than  or  little salsas I said I wanted a large side of salsa and that I would pay for it I was told they arent allowed to do that anymore because it takes too long and makes the drive thru slow I let them know they could either get more salsa or they could refund my order whichever they thought would be faster She got more salsa 
Suggestions for management put salsa in a pitcher in a refrigerator and when someone orders it pour it into a container instead of having your employees go spoon it out of the salsa bar with your tiny useless spoons That would be faster and your customers would also be satisfied 
Id rather wait longer in line and get the food I want than for the line to be faster and me not end up with the food that you have for sale yet refuse to sell me
Needless to say that was my last of many visits Ill drive further to a different location if I want to eat there again
