This place didnt wow me it was also below average to me  Customer service to the drivethrough was pretty lame wasnt too happy Kids working here with terrible work ethic look like they hated their jobs I did get a strawberry banana shake which turned out pretty great but Ill stick with Bahama bucks or anywhere else
