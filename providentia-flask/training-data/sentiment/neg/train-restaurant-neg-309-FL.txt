I can sum up this review with this

An alcoholfree lunch for two at a Mexican restaurant that costs  better have me saying Holy crap that was good I cant wait to go back

Not so at Cantina Laredo

They tout gourmet Mexican food  And while some of the entrees looked interesting and I suppose gourmetish I was basically unimpressed

The tableside prepared guacamole was very good though  seems a bit pricey It was nice and chunky just how I like it (though the onions were TOO chunky for my taste Unlike a previous reviewer noted the jalapenos were diced to the perfect size)

Chips were excellent and the salsas were quite tasty but had absolutely no fire

I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole which were just OK Not bad not great The Sweet spicy blend of dried Mexican peppers made me think there would be some spicefire to this dish but again there was none Flavorful yes Spicy notsomuch And there was something odd about the taste that we couldnt quite place One of those dishes that I couldnt quite decide if I liked or not It was almost as if the cook did something for the sole purpose of making it gourmet

My lovely bride ordered a combo plate that was anything but gourmet It was standard Mexican fare Again OK but not great by any stretch of the imagination (and available for half the price at any mom  pop type place on the planet)

The guy behind me ordered fajitas that smelled delightful Then again you can throw a hunk of any form of beef on a sizzling skillet and itll smell delightful to me 

Service was very good We were seated swiftly (the place was basically empty at noon which doesnt bode well for their future) and the food came quickly Our soda  tea  chips were never empty Very attentive service though not particularly friendly Clearly not rude just sort of there

This place looks like it might be fun to hang out and have drinks A large (and apparently well stocked) bar is front and center With margaritas pushing  a pop though be sure to check your credit limit before leaving home

In short you can slap gourmet on the facade and on the menu You can charge gourmet prices But if you dont serve gourmet food you wind up with a two star restaurant that I cant recommend
