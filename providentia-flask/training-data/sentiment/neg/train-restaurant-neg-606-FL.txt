Unfortunately this review is not as positive as my previous review  We were there one time between my previous review and this one and did not have a good experience but I thought they deserved another chance  But this time was even worse  We ordered the  sliders which we were told we could do even though they were no longer on the menu and they didnt even resemble what they used to be  It used to be  sliders so three good size medallions of steak with onions and mushrooms and this time it was two very thin pieces of meat on a hamburger bun cut in half  We were okay with the hamburger bun because we were warned but last time it was cut into three pieces so we still got the same amount of meat as the original sliders  I would be embarrassed to serve the thin small pieces of meat at all let alone two instead of three  I asked for mushrooms to be on the side so they decided to also put the onions on the side in the mushroom bowl  They obviously dont think about allergies or follow what the customer wants  I upgraded my fries to onion strings which usually are delicious but this time they were cold crispy but cold  I dont mind an upcharge but please do not charge me more money for something that is supposed to be hot and served cold  The server gave up on us as soon as a table of blond women came in  This was their last chance  There are too many other places to spend our money
