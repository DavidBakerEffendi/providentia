I give Genos  stars only because the word Cheesesteak is in the moniker However these socalled steaks of cheese are just horrible Wrong bread not enough meat too small and waaaaay too expensive for what you get If you do happen to stumble into this joint get the wings and go to the store and buy SteakUms Better quality in the box than on a Genos bun
