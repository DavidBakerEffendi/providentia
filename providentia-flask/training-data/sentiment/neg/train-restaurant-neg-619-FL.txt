If I could give this place a  star I would When I go through the drive through I expect my food order to be correct How hard is it to mess up two ice cream cone orders And because its hot out how hard is it to take a cone and put it upside down in a bowl so it doesnt melt all over me on my way home 

Apparently the workers cant even fathom this crazy contraption and give me a plastic dish thats NOT what I wanted 

Unless you want to deal with idiots dont come here That is all
