Chilean Sea Bass

We have been here before and the service is always great

Tonight I ordered a Chilean Sea Bass that was painfully over cooked I sent the first order back only to receive another one that was butterflied and equally overcooked When the manager came to our table we told him that the fish was overcooked and not typical of Chilean Sea Bass He asked if we had the fish at his restaurant before When we said no He said he was sorry we didnt like it and walked away

It was a  entree in a suburban mall restaurant Not sure where he thinks he works but the opinion of his customers should matter As far as I am concerned This restaurant is a fail
