This was the worst experience I have ever had at LJS  We waited for over  minutes for our order as we watched people order after us get their food and leave  The manager wouldnt even come out to talk with us  The poor cashier had to deal with upset people   I could have gone to a REAL restaurant and ordered and received our food in that amount of time  When we asked why it was taking so long we were told that there were many orders in front of us but they  people in the store when we got there and the one car on the drive thru were helped and were gone in about  minutes  so WHAT orders were there before us    The drive thru was busy when we left but those were after we placed and paid for our order and since only Taco Bell orders are now taken in the drive thru I would really like to know how our LJS order was placed AFTER all these other orders that came in AFTER ours  Any type of explanation or apology from management would have been appreciated but NONE was offered  NEVER going to this location again
