Right when we get seated I sit in water they never cleaned off the seat The hostess asked Do you want me to dry that off for you after the fact rather than Let me check the seat for more water or Let me clean that off for you I said No thanks my pants got it all

Secondly we wait  for our waitress She comes by eventually and said Sorry about the wait We had a confusion on waiters My thought Im sorry its pm and I know your shift did not just start You know what section has been assigned to you Also the restaurant and section was empty She also asked if we wanted anything to drink Funny we already had water sitting on the table from the pitcher placed on the table before we were seated 

Another  minutes later we get to order because that is when our waitress swung by for once When we receive our food there was a black hair right on top I have blonde hair and my boyfriend brownit clearly was not ours

In regards to the cleanliness of the restaurant it was awful There were broken chips all over the section we were sitting and also the water on the seat from when we first seated Perhaps if the hostesses werent too busy chatting and being unproductive and who knows what the waitresses were doing to be distracted from work my experience was awful and unpleasant Just another restaurant where employees think its okay to be lazy rather than fulfill the needs of hungry people
