If I could give this place  stars I would First off its my birthday and Im in a different state so we decided before we head back to Vegas lets get some breakfast well we went to Dennys and it was really slow in there We were sat  adults  child waited for  minutes and no one even came by to give us a drink Needless to say I was not waiting any longer We walked out and went across the street to Village Inn instead to get my birthday breakfast
