Ive been to this location a few times and Ive been pleased with the service and the food Tonight was a very different story I walked in the door at  on the dot to just pick up a chicken Caesar salad I was told by the gentleman at the counter that they didnt do carry out past  Let me remind you it was  exactly when I walked in im literally in shock right now its not as if I went in at  and asked they stop serving at  Customer service is everything and I was really disappointed tonight
