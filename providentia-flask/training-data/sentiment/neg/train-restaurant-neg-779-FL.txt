Ordered online today for me and my son  Drove out to pick up my order  The girl at the register looked at me like shed never heard of an online order  She asked someone in the back and came back to tell me there were no fax orders on Sundays I told her it wasnt a fax order it was an online order  The line was out the door and the customer waiting next to be rung up was getting inpatient  The girl at the register asked the shift manager who asked in the back about an online order she said they had no online orders  Left without any food wont go back
