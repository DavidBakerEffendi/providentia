The food was about average for any sports barrestaurant nothing spectacular First problem was we were dining inside and there were flies everywhere All the tables around us were shoeing away flies constantly as were we When we received our order I noticed when I was eating that my plate was dirty from the meal before I complained to the server as well as asking for the manager The server saw the dirty and said WOW THE PLATE IS STILL DIRTY ISNT IT and went on to one of her other tables Not even a let me reorder it with a clean plate nothing  I would have thought that the cook in the back would have noticed a dirty plate as mine was very noticeable and I never did have a manager come by Left my meal behind I dont think that we will be back I ended up having to pay for a meal on a dirty plate that I did not eat no comp nothing  Could have ended on a positive note but they truly dropped the ball  Too bad
