We came here for a big group lunch during a weekend wedding in AZ I had super high hopes based on what we had been told and how cute it was upon pulling up but I was unfortunately not impressed 

The atmosphere is cute for sure It is an order at the counter sort of place but their branding is nice and it doesnt feel like every other place in AZ While I do think thats great it wasnt even close to enough to bring up my review of the food 

The food was not good And not just mine  nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking  people eating like  different things) The burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice The veggies on the burgers didnt look or taste fresh My chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter Ive ever had The ribs were dry and mediocre Even the kids barely touched theirs It just wasnt a good experience I know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having the rest wasnt even worth trying to fix 

And the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isnt too cheap If I want to have a crappy burger or chicken Ill go to McDonalds and spend  but just my boyfriend and I paid like  something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later You can eat MUCH better for that money

I will say their garlic fries were ok  definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad) And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS After trying mine two other girls at our table ordered some So I guess if you just want a shake and fries I recommend it but I travel to AZ often and I wont be back to this spot
