dennys was the best restaurant when I was a teenager as you get older and have acquire a taste for real food and not a cafeteria joint  I stopped being a fan of dennys when I was  it became something I rather not eat and just starve
I dont expect a lot from dennys unless Im drunk and need food to sober up I just think your better off hitting up a drive thru instead
