Not worthy of even  star they really are horrific This is the first business I have had the worker laugh at me  on my face  Asked them what was so funny and they  pretended to not hear what I said  I drop it and proceeded to order my simply small coffee still puzzled  She asked all the wrong questions like did a want my coffee iced on a raining early morning yet left out all the basic normal questions like sugar black etc  Had to ask for everything single item that I wanted one by one since she obviously was not interested in serving me I finally demanded a receipt when all was said and done throw out the coffee I now did not trust and left sad thing too is I think this was the manager This was the first time for mehere  however am never going back The starbucks in Frys is a lot better manneredservice and with none of the immaturity or unprofessionalism
