Low quality SLOW and not worth it 

Blegh do not come here 

Came here for dinner with my family I was looking forward to it because of everyone elses reviews The tuna sashimi was old had stringy parts and was mushy Couldnt stomach it at all The salmon was a little better but all of the sashimi was cut way too thick and big which reduced the quality 

The lovers roll was forgettable Not worth the  

Finally we were still hungry so we ordered a ramen soup and an udon noodle soup We waited almost  minutes for it before being told that they were still going to take  minutes Its unbelievable how slow this place is the sushi took a long time too 

I wish I could get our money back what a wasted meal PLEASE dont come here
