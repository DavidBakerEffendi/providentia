Ordered an Americano with two shots of espresso The young lady working the counter could never figure out how the espresso machine worked She pushed every button while the manager watched from the kitchen and never offered any help Another young lady who was working the driveup window walked over to the machine removed the cup intended for me placed another cup in its place and made two shots of espresso then gave it to one of the kitchen staff that was taking a break WTF Are you kidding

The first young lady just threw her hands up in the air and went back to taking orders from the long line that had developed behind me The manager just watched me walk out without my coffee or offering a refund
