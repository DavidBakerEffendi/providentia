Im feeling a little frustrated after dining here this evening I come here quite a bit because the chicken is tasty 
I get my tray of food and sit down I quickly realize I was given two spoons and a knife Its kind of hard to eat the side salad with a spoon I went to the counter and no one even acknowledged I was standing there I waived at a couple of folks looking in my direction nope No response I finally yelled excuse me and got their attention to request a fork 
The salsa bar and drink dispenser were a mess The floor in front of them was a mess A gentleman came by to refill the salsas I figured he would clean up the counter by the drinks or even tend to the floor No 
No one was out in the dining area cleaning off tables sweeping the floor etc and the restaurant was getting busy 
The food was good but Im hoping I dont end up getting sick from the lack of attention to a clean restaurant 
I wont be back
