I have eaten pita jungle many times but I ordered on door dash today and it was awful I ordered a gyro (something I have had many times) but the meat was gross I dont know if they changed it or what but yuck Usually the gyros have fresh ingredients but these were layered beneath the meat so they were just wilted mush The hummus was okay I paid  for sliced cucumbers and they were so tiny like the size of a dime  Just really disappointing overall and I doubt I will eat at any of the locations again
