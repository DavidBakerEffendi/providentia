Im on a diet Im trying to lose a hundred pounds I get one cheat meal a week This week we chose to try Pizza Pie Cafe I love pizza pasta and salad so it sounded like a perfect fit Kudos for the drinks The cups they gave us were HUGE The restaurant was very clean and well decorated It was busy but not bad and the staff was all very attentive and friendly Unfortunately the food was just disappointing The Alfredo sauce was too dark and void of real flavor The noodles were way underdone and chewy The pizzas were disappointing Not a big fan of the crust or of the types of pizzas that they had available Now they did have a TON of dessert pizzas EXCELLENT I thought I tried the raspberry peach and apple All were disappointing I have to say the salad was pretty good but that was my favorite thing 

If youre looking for a pizza buffet there are plenty of other ones that are a LOT better Even Peter Pipers buffet is better Disappointed
