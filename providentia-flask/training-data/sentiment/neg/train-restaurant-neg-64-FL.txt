I wish I could write a review on how the food was but I didnt even get that far A friend and I went in this past Saturday and were seated right away It wasnt too busy (maybe  tables and a lot of people around the bar area) so we figured we would get service pretty quickly Our server did come by quickly and took our drink orders (just water) When she came back she asked if we were ready to order and we told her we needed a few minutes thats the last we saw of her We waited  minutes until finally getting up and leaving I dont know if she completely forgot about us or if she was annoyed that we needed more time to think about what to order Either way it was a bad enough experience that I will never go back to this location again
