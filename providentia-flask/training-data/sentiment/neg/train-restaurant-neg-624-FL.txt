Super disappointed I have to write this Our service was handsdown probably the worst service I think Ive ever had at a restaurant I only give it two stars because the food was still great We got in the restaurant around  PM I sat at the bar and waited for a table to be ready and for the rest of my party to get there They came shortly after I did they said the table and we sat down Not joking it took  minutes for them to even take our order The restaurant was not full by the way and there were dirty tables that didnt get clean until we left TWO HOURS LATER After they took our order it took another  minutes to get our food Our waiter never checked on us never refilled our waters We ordered an appetizer that didnt come out until right before food did And then we got our check finally not kidding it took up another  minutes just pick it up Granted he was around busing tables very slowly sitting down in one of the booths and had this look on his face like I dont want to be here anymore It wasnt until I had to holler at him from across the restaurant to come pick it up and told him were in a hurry we have to go also told him weve been here for two hours No apology The guy was a total douche bag He seemed very entitled and like we were irritating him We didnt even do anything Maybe I could justify that if we were requesting a lot of things being loud or making a huge mess but that was not the case at all The manager was also there he also seemed really irritated How is it that when we left the restaurant we all felt like we were the source of their frustration It was awkward and uncomfortable and we probably wont be back Looks like somebody else had the same experience today based off the day the reviews Its unfortunate because its close and they have really good food Maybe just stick with the bar if you ever decide to come here because that girl was killing it
