I have eaten at many Pita Jungle restaurants but this location by far is the worst for pick up orders  Two times I have ordered the Wood Fired Grilled Salmon salad and they did not place any dressing on both occasions  The fact that they ask for tips on to go orders they should make sure everything should be there especially the essentialssalad dressing  Yes I called to speak to a manager  As soon as I ask if I can speak to the manager the person who answered the phone said right away (without even checking)  he is currently busy  Of course I didnt accept that answer  Finally I was able to speak to the manager who apologized and reasoned that the food runners are the one who prepares the to go orders  He offered to refund what I paid for the salad but didnt refund my tipwhich I thought should have also been given back since I was not happy with the service (which is the reason for tipping)  And after our conversation I said thank you and his reply was uhuh then he hung up the phone  I see that there are other unhappy to go order costumer reviews on here  I think its time for this branch to reevaluate or retrain their staff before they lose more customers
