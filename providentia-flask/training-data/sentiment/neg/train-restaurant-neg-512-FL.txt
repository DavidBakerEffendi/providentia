We started out by grabbing a drink at the bar tonight it was around  so not busy yet all Bartender greeted us right away and took our drink orders After he served us our beers he literally disappeared I dug up enough cash to leave for our tab and we moved outside to the open seating area we sat there for at least  mins if not  with no greeting no nothing from anyone I went up to server area and asked if we could get menus and a server  and got such attitude from the young lady with purpley hair pulled up with a bow in back I should have left Service after that was still bad server kept disappearing My steak tacos and rice were so salty I couldnt eat them But couldnt find her even to tell her I wont be back to this location I will drive to Val Vista
