This is one of the worst Dunkins that I have ever visited Donuts are always stale  Yesterday I tried to order a breakfast sandwich only to be told there were no eggs thawed Annoying but fine maybe they had a rush of people who ate all the eggs Today I take my kids in for breakfast order up a few wrapsonly to be told theyre out of tortillas Seriously who is managing this place How can you be so ill prepared day after day Will not be going back Im sure they couldnt care less
