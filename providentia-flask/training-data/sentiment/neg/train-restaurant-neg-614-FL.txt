We stopped by on Easter Sunday after church about am They were not busy as I believe they must have just opened We went through the drive thru  brought the food home big mistake  The ice cream was excellent as always BUT the  burger combos were horrible The burgers looked  tasted like they were made the day beforethey went to the dog Even the buns were cracked  dried out I now wish we had eaten inside so that we could have returned the food After paying nearly  for this meal  the only edible thing is the icecream I will take our business elsewhere DQ is usually know for really delicious quality food but NOT at this location  
I gave    star for the employee who was really nice  upbeat
