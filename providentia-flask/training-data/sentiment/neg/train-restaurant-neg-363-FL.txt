Overpriced We ordered tacos my husband had the chicken and I had the fish You get three size of your palm tacos  The fish was pretty good but my husband really didnt like the chicken Definitely dont care for corn tortillas They should give options corn or flour Rice wasnt good at all Maybe its some peoples taste but we didnt care to spend that much money on something that wasnt very good and very tiny amount  We wont be back If you like to throw your money away then you can try it and see if its your style
