My dinner cost me over  

Had dinner there food was good but I bit down on a rock in my salad from the salad not being washed properly and broke a tooth  

I brought it to the manager and he gave me his card I called and called  They ignored me  So I paid out of pocket to get my dental work

I will NEVER RETURN

if you want dirty salad then you have dinner there

Manager not honest said owner will help
Owner will not accept responsibility 
Produce not being properly prepared
