I was so excited about this place opening and went there and they couldnt understand that I wanted my chai tea iced  Gave me the chai tea warm and a cup of ice  Any other place I go I can get it large and with ice  The staff isnt friendly either  They seem as if they dont want to be there and Im bugging them coming in and ordering what I want  I will not be going back to this location  Very sad since its right by my house  (
