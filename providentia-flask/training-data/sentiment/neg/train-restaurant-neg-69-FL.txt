Have been going here with my kids almost weekly for a long time and has been fairly decent overall  Today I had the worst lunch Ive had in recent memory  Ordered the fish  chips so I understand Im in for a bit of grease but it was dripping in it from the fish and onto the fries below it  The coleslaw was basically DRY cabbage with a little bacon mixed in  Terrible  The waitress was oblivious as I told her my food was nasty and just asked me if I wanted to box up the remaining  of all the food I let her take away  Never said anything else about it and I just paid the  because I wasnt in the mood for an argument and just wanted to get out of there  There were also an obnoxious number of flies buzzing around our table and everyone elses which didnt help the atmosphere  Id say they could focus more on quality than quantity as the portions are ridiculously big   teenagers and I average about  for lunch  including one draft beer but pretty pricey for the food and atmosphere  Taking a long break from it if I ever go back
