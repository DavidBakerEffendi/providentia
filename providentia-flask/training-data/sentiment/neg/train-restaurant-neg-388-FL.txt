Cantina Laredo I was sooo expecting more Now looking through most of your reviews I see I am not the only one The place looks nice from the outside and yout expect it  might be good It is not It was not even ok in my opinion Very bland The chips and salsa were good but that was only thing My husband ordered a sampler platter they had Everything was so plain and tasteless and dry I am a season everything well kind of girl I ordered the Sea bass It was ok but definitely not worth  I think the plate was The steamed veggies that came with were frozen cooked to mush with a lemon slice on top Pricey and food not very good a combination that never take me back I dont mind paying for somethingbut give me quality worth the price I left mad thinking of all the things I could have spent that  on
