First time here came on Saturday about  pm Computers were down so NOTHING could be rang in It all had to be a cash deal Who carries cash these days Anyhow with a group of girls we ordered drinks  budlights and a Pinot nor for myself The bill was  Wow Because the computer was down we had no physical bill in front of us to prove that was the actual amount that we should have been charged Nonetheless drink the drinks came we had a conversation at the bar The bartender was very nice and had no problems with her humor professionalism and our conversation We then decided to get a round of shots for our friends birthday The bartender suggested orange creamsicles We all agreed and were told that before shots were  Wow Four shots (not topshelf cordials) were  each Expensive  Anyway we sat there at the bar upstairs and enjoyed ourselves but we were questioning how much the drinks actually were Upon leaving we ran into several people who were there longer than us because they had large birthday parties It took them one hour and  minutes to cash out The server they had had no written documentation for what they had ordered so it was a guesstimate on what their bill should be Then they had no way to physically copy their credit card but had to hand write it Very unprofessional they didnt even have any old fashioned credit card swiping machines I dont understand how companies systems can continually crash and leave the customers in a predicament about paying their bills Not sure I want to go back
