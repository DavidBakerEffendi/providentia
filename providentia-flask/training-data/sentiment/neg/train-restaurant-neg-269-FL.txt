Ive tried to like kneaders because everyone talks about it like crazy but every single time I go I leave unsatisfied and I tell myself I wont come back The first time I went I found a hair in my sandwich I understand that things like that happen all the time but it turned me off Another time I went I ordered a sandwich and the bread was torn in half making it very difficult to eat I am just not satisfied with the customer service either When I have a problem with my meal I feel as though I am a nuisance I shouldnt feel like that at a restaurant I will not be going back to kneaders
