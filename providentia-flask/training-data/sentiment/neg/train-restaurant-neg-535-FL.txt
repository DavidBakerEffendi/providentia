Dang I started going to this location because I hated getting messed up orders from the Stapley location but I guess I made a terrible mistake This location sucks

Their line system is bad its always slow no matter what time of the day if theres  cars in line you could be there for awhile I have no idea why this is but Ive been to this location  times now and it is always the same slow speed The way they designed the drivethru at this location is pretty bad seemingly no thought went into it because its placed awkwardly at a corner The Stapley location has lines that are x larger and theyre about x faster 

The speaker system still sucks youd think for being a new location it would be better its not The employees from what Ive seen seem nice and helpful but every time Im waiting for my food I just see them talking to each other and laughing while moving slowly to do anything useful 

One of the times I was there (about two weeks ago) their drinks had literally no carbonation at all it was nasty and I didnt discover this until I was back at home On the other hand theres plenty of parking spaces but as I said earlier the drivethru system they have is annoyingly  complicated if theres a line as they use cones to direct traffic in a weird squiggly line

The food is mostly good at least once the chicken has been undercooked the fries seemed soggy and something was off about the sauce Mostly pretty good on the food part 

Raising Canes is awesome chicken but maybe go to the Stapley location instead (feels weird saying that since I had issues with them as well within the last  months)
