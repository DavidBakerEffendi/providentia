I am a fan of Mexican food so we decided to try this place out I felt like it was a little over priced for what you get The chips and salsa is really good and so are the margaritas I got the crab enchiladas and they were ok I could of gone without all the extras they put on the plate to dress it up 

This place is ok I wouldnt recommend it to anyone wanting really good Mexican food though
