We have been customers since the very beginning but sadly will no longer be coming back The over all taste of the food has become very bland  We ordered last night the veggie fajitas and they should have been called the ONION fajitas  onion What happen to the potatoes and other veggies   for that  Then there is the unfriendly bar staff Not that they have ever been good but its gotten worse No personality and you have to ask constantly for drinks food and basic needs Done over paying for a horrible evening of bland food and service
