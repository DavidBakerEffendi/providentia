The service and food was great up to a point I had a personal pizza with chicken sausage and my wife ordered the lasagna bowl The flavors and service were fantastic But halfway through my wifes was on your bowl she noticed a long black hair in her food At that point we got up and left didnt mention anything didnt want to ruin anybody elses night but it definitely did put a heavy negativity on the establishment in our eyes What I try Tagan uncertain at this point want something like that has happened its really hard for us to get over it
