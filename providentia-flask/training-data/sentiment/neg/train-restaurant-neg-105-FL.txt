Sat in and was ignored in the drive through for  minutes before someone pulled up in the rd (labeled exit) lane and was immediately helped

Beyond poor customer service and attention only made worse by the lack of organization and order kiosk in the drive through 

Standing and taking orders works great if you implement a system like in and out has not so much if you lack any order and drive up windows for your drive though 

Wont be back and wont be recommending
