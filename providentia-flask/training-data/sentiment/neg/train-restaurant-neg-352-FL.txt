The atmosphere here is nice but I definitely wont be back I had the tres fajita plate which consists of steak chicken and bacon wrapped shrimp The chicken was bland and the shrimp was bone dry and flavorless The steak was tender and delicious so I dont know how they managed to mess up the chicken and shrimp The rest of the meal which consisted of beans rice and flour tortillas was not bad but certainly not good I would have given the place at least three stars were it not for the higher than average price of the food but the food here is nowhere near worth the money youll spend I had a Margarita that tasted like  tequila and maybe a squirt of Margarita mix I had to add about  limes to it to make it taste like something at least close to a real Margarita To top it all off the service was slow and our server never came to check on us until I glared in her direction never mind the fact the place was nowhere near busy Cantina Laredo was not a good experience for me so thats a wrap for me The pictures I snapped of the food came out amazing but dont be fooled it was all just bland Proceed caution
