I have been to top golf many times and it seems the quality of customer service is getting worse every time I visit Today I went with  other couples which made a total of  of us We order a round of drinks and when our waiter Hunter came back informed us that they actually discontinued one of the drinks that was order Ok we ordered a different drink again  min later we were told they were out of it Fine We asked for a recommendation for moscato he told us there was another wine that was similar but when we tried it it was sour Finally we ordered the Rum Punch golf bag and he asked to see  IDs At this point everyone has been drinking and well ok fine here are  IDs that you have already seen then we ordered chicken quesadillas waited  min and nachos came out  more minutes go by Hunter is no where to be found I finally asked a different server for the quesadilla and we were told Hunter ordered the wrong thing and we had to wait for them now  min later we get them Hunter never came around to check on us and never apologized Once we got what we ordered he came back and asked if we needed anything if not if we could close out horrible horrible service After that we were still playing another server came over and shut down our game with  min left needless to say for the money you pay to eat drink and play Your money can be well spent somewhere else
