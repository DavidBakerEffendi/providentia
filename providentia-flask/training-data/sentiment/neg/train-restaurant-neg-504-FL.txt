We really enjoyed this place the first time we went We went last night though and although not horrible the service was really bad and slow Our waiter had his wife and screaming kid sitting in the table next to us We never got our waters Our appetizer came out in  minutes it was good Our entrees were still not out  minutes later so we opted to leave because it was getting late The icing on the cake was when the waiter told us that we wouldnt be charged for the entrees that never came Gee thanks silly
