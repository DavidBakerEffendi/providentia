I was about to order rice but I saw a piece of the walnut chicken stuff in the rice If a piece of food falls into another dish pick it up More importantly the cross contamination of the walnuts could have killed those allergic to tree nuts Yes their is the allergy sign but the staff should make an effort to reduce the cross contamination
