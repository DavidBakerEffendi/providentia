I just ordered  cheese steak combos what a disappointment Definitely not authentic if you are wondering I am from Philadelphia  Over priced and the sandwich is very small  for the two combos Check out my photos for a better reference   The website photo makes the sandwich  look much bigger  I will not be returning
