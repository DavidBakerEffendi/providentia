Not impressed at all We were meeting friends that had made reservations  When we arrived the hostess said shed already seated them and we were free to walk around and try to find them  Really   We awkwardly walked around the entire restaurant looking at people until we found them

I ordered a margarita with no salt  It had salt   Our friend had a whiskey and diet coke  The drink was clear in color  The waitress said they must have run out of syrup  So she brought him a new diet coke on the side

I was really looking forward to the fresh guacamole made at the table  It was fresh but without flavor and we had it made with the works

I ordered the chicken enchiladas  They were extremely bland  No onion garlic cheesejust a white sauce with something green drizzled on top

My husband had the fish tacos  He said if it had just been the two of us he would have sent them back  He didnt want to make a scene but said the fish tasted old  

We also requested extra salsa as wed consumed every drop trying to get some flavor  It never came

The waitress was very pleasant but for the prices and flavor very disappointing  Filibertos is much better
