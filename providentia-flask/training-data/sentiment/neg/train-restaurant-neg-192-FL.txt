My neighbor took me there last night to meet his brother and a friend had been waiting since  employees everywhere but they couldnt seem to figure out how to get the people waiting to actually play  We had seen open areas to up to  minutes before they got filled we left at  frustrated and disappointed  What a joke get your shit together what horrible organization  I dont understand for a franchise that is suppose to be successful fail on so many levels  When we complained on the way out everyone was apologetic but did nothing to make it right The parking was a joke as well
