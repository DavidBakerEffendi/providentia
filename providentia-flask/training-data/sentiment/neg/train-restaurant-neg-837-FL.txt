Im not going to lie this establishment has good food However some of their staff AND manager Kristy are completely unprofessional I have been in the FB industry since I was yrs old and have been a bar manager Im very easy to please and completely understanding Yet I have never in all my years experienced such disrespect I called the establishment to order a togo my boyfriend  I were traveling and starving but needed to be quick When placing the Order I expressed that we would probably go to the bar and have a drink really quick but we were on a tight schedule The manager on the phones exact words were  NO We do not do that You have to either dine in or get it togo We almost just wanted to say F it we dont want to go there then But we did anyways Upon arrival we were directed to the bar to get our togo the food was not ready So we sat there being ignored with no service for few minutes When we finally got the bars attention we were told our food still had few minutes so we got a drink and some chips Once our food came out we opened our food to take few bites before getting back on the road and the bartender came over and said that we werent not allowed to do that and that it was against health code Which is SO not true What made it more unbelievable is the the gentlemen right next to us at the bar also had Togo food and was drinking and eating as well This place is popular and does get busy but its sad that because they know that they feel that they can careless about costumer service The WHOLE situation could have been presented another way and we would have been completely understanding but the way they spoke to us was so unprofessional that we will never go back
