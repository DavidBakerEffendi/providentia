really like the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches here Its unfortunate that for half a sandwich you have to spend over  Had a really bad day and wanted to comfort food a PBJ sandwich and the manager refused to sell it for less than the entire meal of  plus for a homegrown and supposedly socially conscious business I dont think they really care about their customers at all when you have something that is very popular you should go all out to be able to sell it to the customers that want it Bad deal Kneaders
