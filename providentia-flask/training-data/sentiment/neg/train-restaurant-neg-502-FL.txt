Picked up lunch yesterday and was pretty disappointed I had the turkey reuben and a friend had the chicken strips The turkey reuben was nothing like a reuben besides having swiss cheese and being on marbled rye no sauerkraut or thousand island I was pretty disappointed with the reuben and definitely would not order it again Also I asked for bbq sauce and its probably my fault not for double checking that it was in the bag but I got home and they just put in ketchup and ranch Food has been better when Ive eaten there so maybe Ill stick with that from now on
