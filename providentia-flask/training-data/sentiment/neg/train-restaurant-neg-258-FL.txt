Love the food here as far as soups and sandwiches Bakery looks better than it tastes Sitting here right now waiting for breakfast No coffee at the self serve Asked and waited   minutes later asked again Was told by the woman doing specialty coffees she didnt have time What kind of service is that  Dirty filthy tables To be fair have never experienced this at lunch Dont bother at breakfast  Update  food came Both egg sandwiches cold   Not even warm COLD Update   new sandwich Still cold And they put it on a grilled and burnt croissant Such a ways of time and money
