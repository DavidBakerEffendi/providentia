I visited Pita for the st time today () at the Gilbert location Once I arrived to the location for a to go order a female wait staff waited to take the order I looked over the menu for about  minutes The wait staff seemed to want to hurry the order (not  sure) So I placed the  order at  pm and was informed that it would be done in  minutes I than went back to my car to wait After  minutes I go back in and asked about the order was informed it was not ready Went back to the car for about  minutes and returned and asked the same female wait staff once she was done with another order (I thought she would see me in front of her and address the order but no) so I then asked her about the order and she seemed as if she could not hear me with the look on here face so I point to my watch and she stated it was not ready and is still cooking and she didnt seemed to really care to interacted with me so I went back to the car waited about  seconds and called and stated can you place the order in the pick up window when it is ready so I can know she said sure and hung up About  minutes later the window opens and she just place the order in the window( pm   min total) and than closes the window as quick as she opened it Now I might be looking to hard for something but I would THINK she would at least wait   seconds for me to reach the window and say here is your order have a nice day (something) I just am taken back a bit Plus my order for the spicy chicken wrap was just bad and looked a mess I will be returning that tomorrow Plus I plan not to ever go back to the Pita location in Gilbert and I MIGHT try another location one more time and if that goes bad I will not spend another cent with this company I think am going to have some cereal now
