THE NANDOS ON MCDOWELL IS X BETTER

I love the food truly do but the service at this location is most certainly  points under where it should be We were taking our friends to dinner to share with them some very important news on a Saturday We arrived at  and checked in for a party of  was told itd be a  minute wait At  I decided to check and see how much longer and was told that my party was already seated I informed the little hostess that we were not we were all outside and she blankly stared at me in disbelief I asked how much longer and she said probably another  minutes They had my name written down along with what shirt I was wearing and I at no point saw another women with a blue striped tank top arrive with a party of  so I demanded to see the manager Instead of getting the manager she went and got the bartender who was by no means apologetic for their obvious mistake Nothing was done or suggested to try and make up for their error and we were left going across the street to Chipotle I will NEVER be returning to the Gilbert Nandos again
