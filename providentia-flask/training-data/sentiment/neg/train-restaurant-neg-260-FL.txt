While the pastries and other goodies looked amazing we were there for breakfast I ordered the french toast (I had been told it was amazing) and a chai latte  My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich and a soft drink The cashier asked if he wanted a combo so he asked what a combo included she replied  a drink  and he said  sure that is what I wantthe sandwich and a drink Now I think this is where it went wrong  he asked if there was custard inside the eclairsshe was obviously new it was crazy busy (Memorial Day) and she probably wasnt sure what an eclair was I got my french toastnot amazing a little too thick and not warm enough to melt butter It came with some kind of whipped topping sliced strawberries and a little cup of not quite rip melon and kiwi My latte was also luke warm But at least my food camemy husband never got his sandwich We stopped one of the runners and asked him why the combo charge but no sandwich Apparently the cup of unedible melon was the combo 
   We spent over  for  slices of NOT amazing  french toast a luke warm latte and a medium sized soft drink Will NOT be spending our money here again
