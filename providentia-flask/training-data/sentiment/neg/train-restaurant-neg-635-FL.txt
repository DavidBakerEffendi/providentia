As big fans of The Hub we had high hopes for this place and were excited to try it We had the Mushroom Burger the Fish and Chips and the Fried Chicken platter First off it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive despite the restaurant being halfempty on a Friday night No one acknowledged any delay to us or apologized for the wait We had no refills on drinks during this time either

When the food did arrive it was unappetizing The chicken and fish were genuinely inedible We sent most of each plate back untouched The fish batter was so salty that it hurt my mouth to eat and per a previous reviewers description the sides had no flavor The mascarpone tartar had no discernible mascarpone The fried chicken was  burned batter with some token tidbits of chicken tucked inside The burger was fine 

We discussed how to politely express our concerns to the waiter but our opportunity never camedespite our plates being sent back heaped with uneaten food no one asked us anything about how the meal was Im sorry to say that this was a big letdown overall 

Were not really sure what was going on last night Its clear that this restaurant has some big ambitions but the menu execution fell short and the service was inattentive It was totally different than our consistently excellent experience at The Hub From now on well head there instead
