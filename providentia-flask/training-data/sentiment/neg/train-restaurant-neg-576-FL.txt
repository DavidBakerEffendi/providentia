My girlfriend and I were in recently at about  on  and the restaurant seemed desolate You would assume that this means good service The first thing I noticed was the vinyl table with a greasy film We both decided to deal with it though Our waitress brought out coffee and to mix cream in I was going to use the knife in my silverware set The knife had a thick white film on it that I was able to literally pick off with my nail I set it aside to try the spoon and once again it was nasty Dried white food crumbs were on it I requested a new set from the waitress and she seemed annoyed As I drank my coffee I began to realize how disgustingly stained the inside of the mug was The food was about what we expected but the service and sanitary conditions were very subpar Both me and my girlfriend are in the food service industry and at this point it is needless to say that it was outrageously subpar I cant imagine that Im the only one that has had this issue so if I dont get approached in some way to make the situation right Ill probably be filing a complaint with the state Tipped  and at this point I regret tipping at all
