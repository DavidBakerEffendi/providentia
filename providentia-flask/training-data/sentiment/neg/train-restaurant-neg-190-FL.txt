This place has so much potential until management steps in to help solve problems If the app can sometimes take up to  hours to load money on the card you should probably state that IN THE APP We preloaded our account through the app then transferred it to our game for credit Twenty minutes into the game the screen froze and we had to call the manager Casey over Instead of apologizing for the screen crashing we were blamed for using the app and not going down to the person in the lobby to load money Then he so graciously gave us  minutes free but we had to buy  more minutes We paid for an additional hour had  minutes remaining and now we have to pay AGAIN for those  minutes This place seems great until you start talking to the managers Extremely disappointed in the way this place is run Caseyjust terrible
