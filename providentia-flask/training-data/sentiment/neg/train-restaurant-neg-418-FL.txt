Our waiter was very nice everything was clean  That is it for the good stuff

There was nowhere to stand while we waited for a table  It took me a couple of minutes to get one of the bartender girls to get us some menus to look at  
My husband ordered the woodfired chicken off of the specials menu  It was covered in a lot of cilantro (not in the description) and he hates cilantro  
i also ordered from the specials menus and got the ginger stirfry  It was so salty that i couldnt eat it  Since it was for a birthday i just tried to pick out the vegetables that werent as bad  
My fatherinlaw got a side of the garlic new potatoes  He didnt complain but half of them were burnt and the rest looked okay like divided down the middle

And the water tasted like tap water  Couldnt even wash the the salty noodles down with a drink

While the open kitchen seemed like it would make it feel like all the cooking was fresh it was piled with enormous stacks of plastic togo containers just like the hostess station  weird
