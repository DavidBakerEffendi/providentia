I easily eat Chipotle a couple times a week Typically in Tempe close to where I work for obvious reasons Ive gone to this location a few times in the past couple of months more out of necessity than preference because just about every time I go to this location whether its the service the food or just overall experience is less than desirable or expected

Its funny to read some of the reviews on here saying the service is quick and prompt when in reality and by definition it is However it typically comes at the cost of an overall positive experience as theyre really just trying to get you out of their hair as quickly as possible Most of the time Ive visited this location Ive come away feeling like my patronage has been more of an annoyance rather than welcomed It seems as if the staff is usually younger and would rather converse with each other than interact and help customers In a most recent visit I stood there after my food was made for at least  or  minutes as multiple employees walked by while I waited to give them my money Someone yelled cash at least  times to signal someone to come ring me up instead of one of them taking the initiative to help the customer To boot a nonuniformed employee off the clock decided to help himself and jumped behind the counter to make a burrito

My visit today was par for the course Usually theres always something unfavorable about the food and typically its the portioning on any ingredient being inconsistent Today as experienced at least one other time at this location the chicken was overdone and burnt So much so that it was charred and crunchy It sucked

Im not going to stop eating Chipotle I like it too much and a majority of the time everything is just fine Quite honestly Im ticked at myself for continuing to believe that Im going to get the same experience at this location that in accustomed to from others which obviously isnt going to happen Regardless someone needs to know that customers arent enjoying their experience here Hopefully this will either force this location to make improvements or dissuade other customers from bad Chipotle experiences
