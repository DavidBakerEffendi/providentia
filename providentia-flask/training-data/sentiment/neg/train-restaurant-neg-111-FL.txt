The place was so unorganized and the manager was full of excuses Took  minutes to tak our order and there was only one person in front of us The manager seemed so lost Out of everyone waiting only one person was helping anyone I dont want to rate the good for this place because the service management skills and organization will kill this company And I am writing this at the cash register they just messed up my simple order
