First time here and I ordered a pita I always judge a pita by the quality of the pita bread and if it stays intact this one did not it fell apart which made it messy to eat and I did like like the substitution of pickles for fresh cucumber in it the red bell pepper humus was pretty good but the pita chips it was served with were not the kids meals where not good at all they get to put together their own meals but the choices are strange not that great wont be backs
