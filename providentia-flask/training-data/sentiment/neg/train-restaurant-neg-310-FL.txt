After looking over their pictures on Yelp I really wanted to check this place out Their margaritas are what caught my eye however they dont even put them in those jumbo glasses anymore 

The lover and I came i think it was the day after New Years We were waiting for a good  minutes before a hostess even came When she finally came out she said that they are short staffed so it will be a little bit of a wait The restaurant was maybe half filled Why couldnt they seat us even if they were short staffed After being tired of waiting we decided to just sit at the bar and order I ordered two traditional steak tacos and the tableside guacamole as well as a strawberry margarita The guacamole was pretty good i think it needed a bit more salt The tacos were ok nothing special and my margarita was decent 

I think theyre a bit overpriced Our bill came out to about  w tip for two drinks my tacos guacamole and my fiances entree Also the customer service was not great at all Im not sure why they would not be able to seat us and make us wait even though they were short staffed the restaurant was half empty I would probably only come back for drinks during happy hour and sit at the bar but thats it
