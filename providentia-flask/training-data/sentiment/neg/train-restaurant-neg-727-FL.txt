I honestly had higher expectations for this place My husband was craving a Philly cheesesteak sandwich so we decided to try this place out The employees were young and seemed annoyed to be at work I could hear them complaining and they were on and off their phones which doesnt bug me normally but they made us feel like we were bothering them I ordered the turkey sandwich and tried to add some steak to it (which sounds odd but it sounded good in my head) and the girl taking my order just stared at me like I was crazy So I just said nevermind When I got my sandwich it was like turkey and cheese in a loaf of bread I ordered the half size one and it was just so much bread I dont know if it seemed dry from the size of bread or if it didnt have enough condiments I heard the pizza was good here so maybe if I feel like bothering the employees again I will order the pizza Keep it simple
