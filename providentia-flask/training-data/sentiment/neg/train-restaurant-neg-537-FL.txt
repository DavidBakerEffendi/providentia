Guys your chicken is good but what makes you different is Texas toast with good chicken fingers  Ordered a Box combo and drove away and  minutes later open the box and no freaking toast  Went there because we were craving the whole combo  Not worth driving back so forget it  Very disappointed  Simple things are what make a meal great
