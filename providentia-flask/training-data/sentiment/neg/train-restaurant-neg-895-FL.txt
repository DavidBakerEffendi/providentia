Huge slices for the price thats about the best I can say The atmosphere was nice enough for a small place however since I ordered ahead for take out I am reviewing based on my food Lets start with the garlic knots After reading other reviews I guess I was supposed to microwave them per instructions on the box Mine came in a styrofoam container in a brown paper bag and I didnt know (no instructions for me) so to my disappointment they were cold Yuck Now for the pizza it was just okay Thank goodness our stomachs were growling and neither one of us had breakfast When asked if the new place was a thumbs up or down my boyfriend replied Meh Ive had better But Ive had worse too The ham looked like cut up sandwhich ham that was bunched up across the pizza Also the crust was tough towards the outside and it was lacking in sauce I was hoping for better based on the Yelp reviews and given our usual go to pizza place is no longer right down the street Ill keep looking
