This Dennys has the worst service They cant get an order right Forget ordering a salad you will never get it We have been coming to this Dennys for a long time and its always the same Its pretty sad when you walk in the door and it takes them  minutes to even acknowledge your standing there with only  people in the whole place Food is good but very poor service
