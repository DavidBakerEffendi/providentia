I was given a gift certificate for Top Golf so when my boss who used to play on the PGA tour was in town we decided to try it  We had a lot of fun and the food was really good  When our hour was up we were finishing our last sips of beer  Within  minutes  different people told us to get out of the range  They werent even nice about it and since we spent well over  for the hour I thought it was pretty rude  When we left I asked to speak to the manager  He said they had a lot of people waiting  They only had  levels open so it is his problem not mine  He was just as rude as the other people and really didnt care if we came back or not  I wont go back
