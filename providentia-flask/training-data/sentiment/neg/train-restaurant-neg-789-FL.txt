This is the worst chipotle I have ever been too The chips rice and beans are consistently undercooked and they always screw up the online orders Any time I have gone there to pick up my order there have been items missing The meats are not cooked or prepared right either The chicken constantly has pieces of fat and cartilage in them Terrible Terrible Terrible
