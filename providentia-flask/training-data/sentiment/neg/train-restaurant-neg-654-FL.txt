I only go here because my daughter takes riding lessons right next door The donuts are usually stale so i no longer get them Today i got hash browns The bag was not even half full I thought they spilled in the bag There were  hash browns and none had fallen out I dont drink coffee but my daughter does The iced coffee is basically sugar and a little coffee I rarely get anything here Today i got their bitter iced tea and the hash browns Mistake Waste of money I actually prefer the mc donalds next door and i hate mc donalds The people who work here are pretty nice though the food sucks
