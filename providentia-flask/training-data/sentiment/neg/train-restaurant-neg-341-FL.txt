I would return here for happy hour  margarita and chips and salsa or guacamole but never again for dinner  The fire roasted salsa and my house margarita were pretty good but our entrees were marginal and extremely over priced  I ordered the Mahi Tacos  they were flavorless except for the overwhelming amount of red onion My husband ordered the Shrimp Enchiladas and was served the Spinach and Mushroom Enchiladas instead My dad who eats all things Mexican only ate half of his plate  If youre a foodie skip it  If youre not concerned with flavor but enjoy a nice atmosphere this might be a place for you
