I have to agree with some of the other posts about this location Maybe its due to this location being so new and trying to get the employees up to speed Definitely do not recommend going on a Saturday or Sunday when the weekend crew is working Salads are lacking the chicken I have had times where you can count two or three small prices of chicken on a  dollar salad My chicken Alamondo today was a little interesting seemed like it came out of the freezer two minutes before hitting the table 

Bakery items are usually amazing Free samples up front by the register are always nice I love this place but this particular store has some work to do Hopefully the owners and management reads some of the reviews
