I cant believe the positive reviews listed here  The food is marginal not authentic  The quality of the ingredients is poor to fair

The only saving grace is the low prices

The ambiance is non existent

So if you want belly filling Chinese and are desperate than go for it

I restrict myself to take out when Im sick of pizza and fried chicken
