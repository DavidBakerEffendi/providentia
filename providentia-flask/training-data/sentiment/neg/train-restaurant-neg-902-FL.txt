After reading the reviews I was so excited to try it  Tony was great garlic knots were great but the pizza just wasnt so good  We ordered the Hawaiian Delight  The crust seemed like frozen pizza dough and the sauce was bland  The food also took a really long time to arrive at the table  We also had the caprese salad  hard to mess up but the tomatoes werent ripe and should have been thicker sliced  Probably wont go back but if I did  Id try something else like the pasta or entrees
