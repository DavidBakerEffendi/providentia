I went here with some friends and had a mixed experience but dont plan to return

The good my Reuben was delicious and well made Reubens can be very messy but this one had a great corned beef and just enough sauce

Also good Management apologized the issues and discounted our meals for the bad stuff below

The bad  service was poor  The person delivering food couldnt find the right table  or  times while I was there   of the  others at my table had their orders come out with wrong side dishes or missing bacon  The other sandwiches were greasy and unappetizing  The bottomless French toast was not made right so it was dry and more a cinnamon toast than nice and soft and eggy  The kitchen corrected all the errors but they seemed be having too many problems to want to return
