I stopped in for a casual lunch last weekend with my mom and my son  Immediately upon being seated I noticed that the salsa dish was dirty  Then my mom noticed her water glass was dirty and her fork  My fork was also dirty  And Im no clean freak either there were visible food remnants on these items  If my son hadnt been so hungry we likely wouldve left

The waiter was very apologetic and nice so the nd star is for him  The food was not terrible just unmemorable  The best part of the experience was the warm chips decent salsa and my cold Corona
