Tried to find a way to send this to you but you dont have a contact form on your website or a message option on Facebook I just had lunch (Check  ) and noticed a discrepancy on our bill Instead of offering to fix it we were told we didnt fully understand how the price worked I ordered lunch special G which is a red or green burrito taco and a tostada It is listed as  On our bill it was charged as  as the base price for  Lunch G I pointed this out and was told that since I ordered it enchilada style (which I didnt by the way it just came that way) I was charged more I pointed out that it clearly says red or green burrito The hostess told me that this is the color of the chili used inside the burrito which makes zero sense as there is literally JUST chicken inside Rather than make a scene I told them it was fine but its not You cannot quote one price and then upcharge for no reason I believe you have this item in your system at the wrong price but instead of looking into it I was told I just didnt understand the price Side note Justin our server was excellent today and our food was very good Ill definitely be asking very specific questions about what my food ACTUALLY costs if we come in again
