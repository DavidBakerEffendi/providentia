I enjoy eating Gluten Free and was delighted to know Sauce offers a Gluten free crust I have enjoyed Sauce it multiple locations and was excited one was built close to my home I placed an order to go tonight and they brought me out my pizza and opened the box I immediately noticed how burnt the edge of the pizza was I thought about just taking it how it was but I really do enjoy this crust from Sauce So I asked if they could re make it without the crust being burnt The nice young male took it back the kitchen and asked the male
cook in the back if he could re make it and the male cook seemed annoyed He told the male who was asking thats just how it is and the young male asked again if he could just remake it The male in the kitchen again seemed agitated and said that he could but the pizza was just not going to be done in the middle I wanted to say something to the cook because I have had this pizza multiple times around the valley The young male had to come
To me to tell me the pizza wouldnt be done I was completely lost and had thought to myself this is Sauce right Either way I waited and the young male brought out the uncooked pizza It looked as if they threw it in the oven for  min and pulled it out I was done at that point I walked out of there and ate something else I called the manager and let them know but at this point I dont really want to go back I dont understand because I have had this pizza (Gluten free crust) and never had this issue I believe that there are some training opportunities to be done at this location
