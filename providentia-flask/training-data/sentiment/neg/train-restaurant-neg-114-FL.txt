Had never been there but heard it was good Well for some reason we couldnt get anyone to wait on us The cashier was either friends or family with the person in front of us and decided she needed to leave her register and personally wait on her  Three other people were manning the drive through and also ignored us After waiting for  minutes we left It may be great chicken but their customer services leaves much to be desired
