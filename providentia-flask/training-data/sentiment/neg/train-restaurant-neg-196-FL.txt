Last night I met some girlfriends at top golf for happy hour First we had to find someone in the bar to clean the table we wanted to sit at Then after sitting at that table for over  minutes someone finally came over to take a drink order Mind you the bar was less than half full After that another  minutes went by for them to come and take a food order then we waited another  minutes to  minutes for our food to arrive and mine was wrong The atmosphere was good but the service in the bar needs a lot of work  I was a little disappointed to say the least I had heard great things about it and was excited to try it
