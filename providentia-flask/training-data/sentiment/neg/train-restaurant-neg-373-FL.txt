Would have done better at a chipotle

Came here for a Mothers Day dinner The place was a total mess like a chunky cheese All kinds of food waste on the carpet under the tables Our waiter even had food smeared all over his shirt 

Service was a struggle we had to ask for everything multiple times and they didnt clear the table if old items as the new items came out Food was decent but overall not worth the price
