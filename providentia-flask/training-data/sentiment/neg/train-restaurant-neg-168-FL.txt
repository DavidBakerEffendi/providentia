My husband and I have been to Top Golf in Utah Ca Tucson  Scottsdale Az  We recently moved near Gilbert Az and thought we would celebrate our daughters bday at the Gilbert location  Every Top Golf we had been to before more than surpassed our expectations  We reserved online and marked Birthday event  The place was NOT busy  They gave us a table bay and we asked if we could switch to a bay with a couch there were two empty ones next to us  The host went down to customer service and returned to tell us they were saving those for events  So we took the table and chairs with  chairs for  adults The bays with the couches did not get used and were still empty when we left  hrs later  The service was horrible  We had to go get our own napkins the food was slow they forgot our second order  Our drinks were always empty  Even though we live  miles from this location next time we will drive to Scottsdale to take friends and family to Top Golf  We spent over  last night and it was very disappointing
