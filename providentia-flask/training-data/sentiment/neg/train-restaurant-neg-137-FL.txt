Meh Wanted this to be good Ordered three pizzas Ideas were good but execution wasnt All three had burned crusts  Not just a little in the bottom Each was half black and charred around half the pie And they arent properly kneeding the dough All three had large bubbles around the edges One covered almost an entire piece 


Finally they didnt cut any of the three so that a piece would actually come apart It was as if someone went over the things lightly to mark where they shouldve cut No thanks Back to Sals
