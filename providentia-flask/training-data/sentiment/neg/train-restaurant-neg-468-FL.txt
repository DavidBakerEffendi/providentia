Fresh out of my mouth after a bite of this Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich This is no joke taken  and confirmed by management that it was from one of their employees I DARE YOU TO DENY THIS DOMINOS  Why did wait so long to post this Let me explain After taking a bite of this sandwich I felt something crunchy in between my teeth that didnt seem to go along with the consistency of ingredients I was used to (and trust me I am very familiar with the sandwich because it used to be my favorite) I was infuriated as any mentally sane person would be to find somebodys full acrylic nail with jewels IN MY FOOD and not only in my food but in between my teeth That has got to be the most unhygienic thing Ive ever seen in my entire experience of eating food  So I angrily drove down to the Dominos in which I ordered the pizza from (VAL VISTA AND WARNER Gilbert AZ) mind you I had ordered delivery but still chose to drive there in a fit of anger (can you blame me)   The amazing Dominos customer I am my order was over  Im basically a regular  The reason why I didnt write this review in March was because I felt that the manager I spoke with handled the situation very well (Hi Benjamin you were awesome and have great people skills)  He refunded me for my food remade my sandwich and promised me TWO orders of whatever I wanted He said and I quote I could come in with a  order if I wanted to and it would be free and I he annotate that on my account l He was very apologetic he said they would take care of the girl whos nail it was and asked over and over if I needed anything else Initially I was going to go to corporate and complain but the way he handled the situation I felt that there was no need Three months later I made my first order and had no problems  I dont remember how much the order was but it was quite a few pizzas more than Im used to ordering  Today I went to use my second order Im not gonna lie I had quite a few items on this order like last time not totaling over  but hey Unlimited is unlimited so why not use this to feed my family who is visiting from out of town  This is where I ran into some issues I spoke to a different gentleman not the same manager who help me initially who looked over the notes and said that I was incorrect in that my order would be free  I explained the situation in which he replied that I was never promised a lifetime full of pizza I am well aware that I wasnt supposed to get a lifetime of pizza out of it but I was under the impression that my second order would go as smoothly as it did the first time  This is what was agreed upon and I felt that it was fair at the time of the incident  He said that I was only supposed to get two free pizzas out of it but out of the kindness of his heart would he take care of four of the pizzas I told him to cancel my order I understand that accidents happen and sometimes employees get it wrong which should really not be at the fault of the company but when management deals with the problem and comes up with a solution for the customer the company needs to hold up their end This is unacceptable when it comes to practicing business I felt like I could have went all the way up to corporate and gotten free pizza for life if I wanted to but quite frankly Im not a greedy person The only reason why I wanted to take advantage of this offer was because that was the offer put on the table by management  I am absolutely done with Dominos as a company I will never recommend this particular location of Dominos and if anyone ever inquires my opinion of Dominos pizza I will go ahead and repeat this experience in hopes that no one else has to eat fingernails from this billion dollar franchise
