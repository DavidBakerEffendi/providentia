It is so unfortunate that others have ruined it for your regulars  yelp enthusiasts
Went to dine here tonight on our th Wedding Anniversary We have been in numerous times before writing rave reviews  were so looking forward to using our FREE appetizer  dessert coupon we had received from your location one week ago via email This promotion was valid from today ( our actual Anniversary)  expired on the nd of this month
After we placed our order for our appetizer which was the Calamari we were told ( when presenting our discount) we couldnt use the emailed version they sent us because it wasnt printed out as per the fine print Our server then said Weve had so many others abuse the system that they wouldnt be able to honor this emailed promotion unless its a printed copy ALONG with the emailBe prepared you must have BOTH
Im so sorry that I didnt pay more attention to their details or had the time  resources to pay additional  to have it printed out Who does this anymoreThis is so old school Super confusing unless you know otherwise So be prepared people
BTW Keep in mind that there is NO scan bar to this which would have made it that much easier  updated to todays technology Seems to be that this is more an issue with them accepting it  Like excuse(s) No option to speak with a manager Who knows if there was even one on staff We then just told our server to please bring us our check We paid for our drinks () which was over  Completely upset as I expressed this to their hostess on our way out the door  
It wasnt even that busy on a Wednesday night at  PM and they are worried about a coupon for a FREE appetizer  or dessert Valued at  tops We would have spent additional time  money on meals to cover their cost of this promotional offer they sent to me
After writing  previous positive reviews Experiencing this  not honoring a membership special they cant keep track of  that I took the time to sign up for  very disappointing 
Wont be back anytime soon
