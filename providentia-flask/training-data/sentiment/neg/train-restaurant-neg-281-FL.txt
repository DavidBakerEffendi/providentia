It normally takes awhile to eat in here and so I usually order to go but tonight even that was bad 

I ordered  rolls and noodles I was told mins and so I went close to the  min mark When I arrived they said they were waiting on my noodles So I waited about  more minutes before finally asking  what was going on I was then told about another  min so I decided to cancel that portion but right as she was going to ask they brought it out 

I should have asked they remake my rolls since they had sat for  mins and one was a crazy roll which is tempura When I got home my spicy mama roll was warm and the crazy roll was soggy and cold I was able to save the spicy mama by putting it in the fridge for awhile but the crazy roll was just gross once soggy 

The noodles were such a small portion that they were only enough for my  yr old to eat we normally order one to split between our  kids when eating there and its always been enough But they also had zero flavor Normally they have a sauce but this was was plain noodles and chicken They were gross 

So I paid  for warm soggy sushi and a tiny portion of unflavored noodles I would have gone back but I had to be somewhere and didnt have time
