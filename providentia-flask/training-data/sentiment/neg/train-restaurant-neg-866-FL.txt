Update   Ate there again with my daughter and mom Unfortunately it was still so so just not a lot of flavor atmosphere was still okay and I like the selection of plants in the landscaping around the building Seems like a nice dress up and go out with special out of town guests place  but the food continues to underwhelm 

 

Nandos Ive eaten here three times now and I guess Im ready to review 

Atmosphere  gets my top rating This busy and popular restaurant is fun The lighting is subdued The Spanish decor and architecture is attractive The seating options are plentiful The service is very good The tables are kept full with water glasses pitchers of ice water and a generous basket of chips and two kinds of salsa 

Food  mediocre I hate to say it I want the food to match the atmosphere but after three times it does not My daughter likes the grilled cheese on the kids menu but Ive tried three different things  a chimichanga a chicken enchilada and some kind of taco salad All three were only okay Last night I had the enchilada and despite the lake of melted cheese and red sauce I found it rather bland and tasteless The enchilada I had last month was similarly lacking in zest The salsa that comes with the chips is only okay I did enjoy my Margarita 

The atmosphere is so appealing I may brave the mediocre food for yet another return visit but I will keep looking for a truly memorable Mexican food experience in the MesaGilbert area
