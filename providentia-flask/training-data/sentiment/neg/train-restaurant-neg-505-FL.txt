Went for lunch at  on a Friday finished my drs appt and thought Id have an early lunch sat at the bar several other people were seated the bar tender was bent down oblivious I waited  minutes enough time for  batters to swing on the cubs cards game on espn The bar tender never acknowledged my presence so I got up and left While the food is great I usually have problems sitting at the bar at this location only the other two have been fine regarding bar service
