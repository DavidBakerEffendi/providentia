This place is not managed well Seldom is there anyone up front to greet you or put your name on the waiting list  After a  min wait we were seated  ignored it was  min before a waiter came over to take our order  get us drinks A couple came in after us  was seated in the booth right behind us they placed their order  were leaving by the time we got our food  They were not that busy  this has happened to us x now it shouldnt take  hours to get inout after a  min wait to be seated And good look paying your bill sometimes theres someone at the register other times not
