Not very conscious of gluten free orders and food was greasy Not the healthy feeling that we went to this place for There are MUCH better vegan places nearby My husband and I came here to split a burger and ordered a gluten free bun The waitress talked to us about it and confirmed that we were okay with  up charge We said of course Burger came with regular bun but they didnt tell us I didnt realize until after two bites
