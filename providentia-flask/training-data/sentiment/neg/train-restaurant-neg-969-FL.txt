One of the biggest dining disappointments Ive ever experienced After hearing a glowing review from another trusted Yelper plus a Groupon I was psyched to try this place Its just a few miles from my house and I love patronizing independent restaurants

Not considering price presentation ambience or service the food is bad My husband got  different types of tacos (salpicon carne asada carnitas) and he thought the meat was dry and flavorless in all of them He was also disappointed that they didnt come with any fixings just a whisper of onions The beans were ok but the poblano rice was awful So bland 

 I got a specially made vegetarian torta which was comprised of refried beans cheese and sauteed onionspoblanos The torta bread was good but it was pretty bland overall Ive had MUCH better tortas elsewhere Where was the avocado that I specifically requested Trying to keep food costs down I suppose They served it with a side of mango salsa which was very good on its own but it did not go with the dish at all

The only great dish was the red salsa that came with the chicarron appetizer It had a great smoky flavor from chipotles Unfortunately we werent offered any salsa with our food (and they certainly dont give you complimentary chips and salsa) so we had a wait awhile for to ask our server for a side Please note there were two other occupied tables (a two top and a four top) besides ours

Once you consider price the dining experience at Rosa Blanca borders on obscene Street tacos are  the chicarron app is  and the torta was  

But the BEST part They werent accepting the Groupons because Groupon hasnt paid us Unreal 

We will never come back here Hopefully when Barrio comes to town well finally get some great Mexico City style food in Gilbert

Stephanie unfortunately you have had a bad experience somewhere else and wish to bash our fine restaurant to compensate your lack of knowledge of fine Mexico City cuisine If you want oily orange cheese dried beans and old iceberg lettuce go somewhere else as you wont get that here We strive everyday to bring this community what it so badly is starving forgreat tasting entrees at an affordable price We also noticed that you ordered items that are not on the menu and our staff did our best to accommodate youWe are a new business and understand we have to be flexible However we have to be consistent Our menu and our products are top drawer Our preparation is solid Seems you also had a problem with how to pay Perhaps you shouldnt eat out if you expect things to be discounted and still cant afford it ( FYI) cilantro and onions is how street tacos come (  for all the fixings ) go Filibertos
