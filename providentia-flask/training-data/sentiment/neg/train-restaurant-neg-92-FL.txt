Today we tried Bushs Chicken as I have been told the chicken isnt that good but they have some of the best sweet tea I could not agree more with this random stranger 
The Chicken chicken has not a lick of seasoning the skin on this chicken was so hard it had to be thrown out and the meat itself must be eaten while hot or warm otherwise it is like one big piece of lard Yes they give you packets of the special seasoning but good cooks know you season food while hot (sidebar this was a togo meal) 
The Dinner Roll rolls soft warm with a hint of butter I could live in those dinner rolls they were so delicious
Mac and Cheese it was horrible like the chicken if lacks serious flavor It was noodle with an orange color to it 
French Fries although the fries had no salt on them (just the way I like them) they were quite delicious not to soft but also not too crispy 
Sweet Tea yes the random stranger was correct they do have some pretty good tea 
I can honestly say Iwe will more than likely only come back for the dinner rolls and tea
