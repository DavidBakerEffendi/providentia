Waited until we tried this place x before leaving this review

st time Excellent Bread a bit dry but other than that excellent Cheeseteak and Fries

nd time Horrible Very dry Bread Worst Rueben we have ever had

rd time Corn beef sandwich was like eating cardboard Cheesesteak was good but the bread was dry

th time Horrible Tried their Parmesean and Garlic wings had no taste at all Tasted like just Chicken wings fried and served Not even any salt PASS Cheesesteak was dry and the meat was overcooked Tried the Rueben again  tiny slices of Pastrami between  dry pieces of bread

This place has SERIOUS consistency issues Which is not surprising because they also have a pizza joint by the same name which has great thin NY style slices if you go during the day but if you order a Large pizza it is god awful and doughy
