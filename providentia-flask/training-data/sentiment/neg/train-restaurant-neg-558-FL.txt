Okits Dennys My expectations arent that high That said I couldnt believe what they tried to serve this morning Called in for pick up and after having confirmed my order at least  times over the phone I found that not only had they left  things off my order but also that the pancake puppies were burnt beyond recognition to the point that they even burned through the styrofoam container they were put in When I called in I was put on hold for  minutes before the manager came on the line made me reexplain the situation and then told me to come in and get another one or get my money back No apologies or even a surprised tonejust matter of factly When I asked if the replacement pancake puppies would be on her (the principle not that the  was going to break me) she said she reluctantly agreed to give a coupon for next time Mmmm thats ok Dont think there will be a next time Up your standards to edible please Dennys
