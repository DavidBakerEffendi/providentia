I wish I had something great to say about this place Weve gone there a few times (only because its walking distance from our house) Every time we go were irritated about it and say we wont go again The food and drinks are okay Its just crazy expensive for what you get  for two drinks and some wings Are you kidding me They are priced like a high end North Scottsdale pub not like a local Gilbert neighborhood bar A happy hour there would be great as well as a kid menu Im hopeful that if they can stay open theyll eventually improve and we can enjoy our local bar restaurant
