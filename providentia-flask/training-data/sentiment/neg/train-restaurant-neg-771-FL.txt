Let me just say I love the taste of a Chipotle Burrito when everything is done right

When the rice is cooked all the way through and has enough cilantro its awesome When the black beans are cooked all the way through it is awesome  But it is impossible to pick off or pick out a bad element  

This location is a hit or miss usually a miss  Sometimes the beans are crunchy sometimes the rice is crunchy or under seasoned  And if one element is bad the whole burrito sucks and is a waste of money  

Sick of wasting money here just need to find a better location
