Let me start by saying I Run On Dunkinbut this location has gone WAY down hill  I have been hitting this location for years for my morning coffee  I have a refill cup use the app know the routine Im a Boston guyits in our blood  We recently moved into the neighborhood so we are closer than ever and my wife and I loved this idea  Well that was until recently when almost all of our orders have been wrong  I can accept mistakes we all make em and Im not a review writer until this past Saturday  I pulled up to the drive thru with my usual order refill cup hot coffee with one pump of milk  I pull up hand the girl working the drive thru window my cup pay with the app and watch her take the lid off of an iced coffee and pour it into my cup  Now like I said I get mistakes no big deal we all make em   The issue I have I that I told her it was wrong restated my order to her and she said she was sorry Then she proceeded to take the iced coffee from my cup pour it back into the previous to go cup (obviously for the car behind me) put the lid back on and stage it in the window for the next car  That is straight cross contamination and a violation of health code  She hands my refill cup to another person who fills it with my correct order but as I found out down the road never bothered to rinse my cup so not it tastes flavored because of the previous iced coffeethats just lazy  Its really disappointing that this location has gone so down hill and I hope someone takes these posts seriously and makes a change soon
