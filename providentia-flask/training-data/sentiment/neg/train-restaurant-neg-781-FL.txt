Let me start by saying I love chipotle (although as someone pointed out already the Barbacoa at cafe rio is x better) but for some reason at his locationthey dont know how to make a burrito I got a burrito the other day and it was a MESS when I got home Couldnt eat it as a burrito (will include a picture of guac everywhere I want it in my burrito when you charge too much for it) But if you pay  for a burrito I dont want a bowl However I thought it was just a bad wrap and no biggie Ill get it again Got one tonight and its falling all apart again I love the food but its terrible work done at this location apparently Not thrilled w here and will be hesitant to go there again
