Craving a good burger and based on a coworkers advise decided to try out Blue  Sports Grill
Waitress was friendly and attentive Since this was our first time here she explained how everything was fresh made on site 

I always want an explanation of seasonings as some are spicy seasonings and I dont do spicy

The onion rings were seasoned with both black pepper and cayenne pepper The onion rings were evenly sliced and had a nice crunch to them After the rd onion ring they started really getting to hot for me I would suggest using the cayenne pepper as an addin for those who like spicy foods 

I also ordered the Blue  Steak Sandwich I expected to get thinly sliced  Steak instead I got something that resembled hamburger cubed steak 
The mushrooms were not sliced but rather cubed  The onions were also chopped up It would have been nice to have the mushrooms and onions sliced up and caramelized together on the grill then tossed in with grilled STEAK and cheese mixed in (instead the cheese was blobbed on

I am a mom that loves to cook and has a family that loves to eat my cooking When I go out to eat (doesnt matter where) I want to have something that I either dont cook at home or just blows me away and makes me want to try cooking it home with equal or better restaurant results

I will give Blue  another try and see if my taste buds are telling me what others are saying
