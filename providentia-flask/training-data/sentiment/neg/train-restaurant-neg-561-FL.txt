Ummmmmyuck  Just yuck

I mean seriously  I give it one star because the waitress was nice and we got good service

We were here last week  Wife got her birthday grand slam  OMGI dont know what they did but it was disgusting  The pancakes tasted heavy and fat and well just yucky  They should have been light and fluffy as most breakfast places will make them  Eggs werent a lot better  I wouldnt be surprised if eating that shaved a year or two off her life  It was free for her birthday and I still think we got ripped off on that one

I had a burger and fries  Wellthey were better than McDonalds  Cant say they were bad  But definitely nothing special  You could make a better one in your own kitchen in about  minutes for a fraction of the cost  If you want a decent burger try Fuddruckers or Red Robin or someplace like that  For the price Dennys burger was definitely not worth it

I dont care if its free on your birthday its not worth it  Dont come here
