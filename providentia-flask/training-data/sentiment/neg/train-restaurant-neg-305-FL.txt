My wife and baby daughter came here right at pm when they opened The place was practically empty They asked if we had reservations and we said no The host said that she was going to have large parties coming in later on that evening She looked in her system and said sorry we have a few parties coming in about  minutes  Would you like to eat in our regular dining area instead I could not believe what I was hearing We would be done eating by the time those people came Im sure the real reason for them not wanting to sit at the hibachi grill area was because they didnt want to waste the cooks time with just  people and a baby Thanks for ruining my wifes first Early Mothers Day Dinner
