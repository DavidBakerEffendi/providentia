On Saturday I paid cash for a dipped waffle cone and watched a kid with dark hair take my money give me change and then make the cone while touching it  Missing the hand washing step completely  

When he tried to hand it to me I asked him if he realized he handled dirty money before the food  He shrugged and asked if I wanted a new one  I said yes of course  He walked away dumped it in the trash half heartedly washed his hands and made a new one  

I prefer my ice cream without the attitude and germs
