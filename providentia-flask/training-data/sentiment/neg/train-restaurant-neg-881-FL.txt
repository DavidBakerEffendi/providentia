We decided to try this place because of the Yelp reviews  We did takeout and ordered a regular crust with meatball pizza and some medium wings  The service at the pickup counter was average to good  The wings were ok but the pizza was not good at all  There was hardly any sauce or cheese and the crust was chewy to hard in texture  Honestly it was one of the worst pizzas we have had  Maybe we caught them on an off night or maybe it is better to dine in  We wanted to love this place but unfortunately it didnt go as well as we expected from the reviews
