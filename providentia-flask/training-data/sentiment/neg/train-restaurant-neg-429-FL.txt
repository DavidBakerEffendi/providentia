On previous visits I would have scored them with a  but this time it was a bad experience On the positive side the server was nice On the negative side the food was slightly warm My protein serving of gyro was crispy but only slightly warm in parts and cold in other parts It wasnt crispy like it was cut off of a spit it was crispy from overcooking it on the grill but it still wasnt hot The single pita I ordered was barely warm but yet crunchy on one end It should have been warm and soft My husband had a lavash pizza which was served on a cold plate so by the time he got to the third piece out of eight it was cold He really likes this pizza but not when it gets cold Its always nice to walk up to their door and see an A rating from the health department But that makes it even more disappointing when the floor under the tables is filthy Food paper and silverware on the floor when the table has been reset for the next customer That does not equal an A rating for me The dress code for servers is rather loose which I understand for this type of restaurant but having someones midriff showing is not appropriate Overall it was not a good experience which is upsetting since we usually enjoy our dinners here
