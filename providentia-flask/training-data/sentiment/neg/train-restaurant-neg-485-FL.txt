Normally eat here once every two weeks Havent had problems Got pick up order this time Was in a rush to get back to work Got a penne Rosa pasta with Well Done chicken Two orders One was good Other one had RAW chicken in the middle Called back to see what they would do about situation said they would give me another meal another time ask for refund because now coworker doesnt have a meal Said they couldnt because he couldnt see the chicken   



Literally every bite was raw in the middle
Hopefully she doesnt get sick from the couple bites she had before noticing something was wrong
