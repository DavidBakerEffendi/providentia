I called my order in over the phone so that I wouldnt have to wait when I arrived at Genos  When I arrived the girl at the counter was nice  She greeted me made jokes and then handed me a bag of food  When I arrived at home I realized that the girl had given me the wrong order  I drove back to Genos and the cashier was expecting me  She rushed around the counter apologized and handed me the correct order  This time the fries were gross  I waited over  minutes for fresh fries  The staff didnt offer me a complementary meal or anything  They did give me a free drink upon my request  The food was decent but the experience was horrible
