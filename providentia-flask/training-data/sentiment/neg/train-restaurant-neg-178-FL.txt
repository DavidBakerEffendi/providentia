I went to TopGolf on Saturday with my husband parents and a friend from out of town While the gameplay was fun the customer service was absolutely pitiful The checkin process was extremely confusing and the staff was not helpful I would make sure to give any newcomer a thorough explanation of the checkin process before visiting in hopes they dont have the same experience I did 

With  of us playing being new we were a little unsure where we needed to go first We went to the front desk and they told us we needed to get in line for Guest Services We went across the lobby and waited in line for Guest Services We were finally helped by two separate cashiers but since we were all playing in the same bay we moved to one cashier They asked if we wanted our own player cards and not knowing we asked what they recommended They said we can all play on one player card and since wed have to pay for extras we decided just to use the one player card We didnt even know what the player cards did 

We walked back over to the front desk where we were given clubs and taken to our bay While the employee was getting us set up he told us wed all have to play under the same name with only one player card We of course did not want to do this Its like bowling with only one player on the screen  no one does that So we had to go back inside to get player cards

I went to the front desk and told them Id just been there but I was told I needed a player card The employee said I needed to go to Guest Services where the line had tripled in length since we were just there I said Wait seriously We have to wait in that line even though we were just here She just said Yep No apology No sympathy for the pregnant woman (me) having to stand in line for the next  minutes after already waiting in line for  minutes earlier There were about  employees at the front desk standing around doing nothing 

The cashiers in guest services were also not apologetic about the situation and couldnt seem to care any less about all the inconvenience we encountered to try to play I was visibly upset and no one apologized

The staff seemed extremely undertrained and underexperienced and I will not rush to bring my business back here anytime soon
