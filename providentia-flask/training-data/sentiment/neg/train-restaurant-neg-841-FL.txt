Very disappointed with our visit We had a group of  which I understand isnt easy We had to ask several times for drink refills my stepmother was served a margarita that was undrinkable We had to ask for extra mixer but wasnt brought a larger glass to mix it again  minutes to wait for that In my opinion when that was asked they shouldve offered to make her a new drink but we thought wed try to fix the situation Even after adding the mixer it was horrible maybe bad tequila Then the food came carne asada tacos had crunchy meat food was overall very bland  when we asked for sides ie sour cream we had to ask several times  it was brought out at the end of the meal (pointless at that point) Im not one to look for free items but the margarita shouldve been taken off the bill We wont be back
