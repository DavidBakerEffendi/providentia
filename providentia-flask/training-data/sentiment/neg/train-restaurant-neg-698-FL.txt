Went looking for real ice cream the other day and ended up here While it was an interesting science example for the kids I wasnt impressed by the flavor of the ice cream It was okay just nothing special My chocolate tasted exactly like when I mix Hersheys Syrup with vanilla ice cream at home and the scoops they use for mixing in the adds was pathetic For the price I expected better

I wont be back
