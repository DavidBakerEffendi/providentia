This is actually a ZERO star review I had the worst customer service of my life here and will not come here again regardless of it being more convenient than Bosa because of the drive thru I dont know the womans name who was taking orders through the drive thru (short blonde hair) but she is absolutely one of the rudest people I have ever dealt with I told her I wanted a mixed dozen and started telling her what I wanted and she rudely interrupted and said a mixed dozen doesnt give you the option to choose what donuts you want that would be assorted but whatever I guess start listing off what you want for something you didnt order I told her I didnt know there was a difference between mixed or assorted and continued on with my order where she continued to make snide comments She was extremely rude and I will not spend money at a place who doesnt take pride in who they hire  If higher management reads these reviews please take a look at who was working this morning (June  ) at this location around am and give this girl some training on customer service cause she needs a class or two or ten 


Update  A year almost to the date I decided to give Dunkin another try Unfortunately I see that management doesnt read reviews because I had another horrible experience here today  RUDEST EMPLOYEES AROUND The woman who helped me this morning obviously hates her job and was very rude to my family and I when we ordered our donuts We only ordered three things so not an order to get nasty about  I really set her off by asking if there was a vanilla frosted donut available  After an obvious eye roll she rudely pointed and said its right there  My bad didnt see it Even the customers in line behind me were in shock at how this girl acted towards me She needs customer service lessons stat Dunkin Donuts  start training your employees to be nice to customers
