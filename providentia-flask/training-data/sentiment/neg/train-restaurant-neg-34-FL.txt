Worst customer service EVER  Placed a phone order Got there and my order was twice as expensive as it should have been When I inquired as to why the woman insisted that I ordered a large meal I explained to her that I ordered the lunch portion A man came from the back and rolls his eyes at the woman and then proceeds to unpack my order When I asked what he was doing he said Im going to go back to the back and take some of your food away and give you a lunch portion   REALLY  Now Im late back to the office and they want to take away half my food because of THEIR mistake  Unbelievable  I told him I would never be back and I hope you never go there either
