I hate to dogpile another low rating here but its really bad This location is a desperate cry for help Ive tried this place at least  times I really WANT them to be here I WANT them to succeed 
Assuming theres an actual owner to this franchise (where are you Why dont you care) or maybe if its just one in a billion corporate locations (district manager Anyone) this place is one giant example of dont   
Ive had employees be rude and shirty Trained and snippy or untrained  incompetently simpleminded But the worst are the ones that are both untrained AND rude  
Ive had long waits been overcharged (even with another employee standing beside the cashier saying Youre overcharging her) had our food prepared incorrectly  I stopped going inside because the drive thru reviews are moderately better  I needed a couple of packs of munchkins two separate times for church youth activities  Both times the product was stale Like Ping pong ball stale 
I dont know I hear theres another donut place Opening up around the way I dont think Ill have the heart to try DD again
