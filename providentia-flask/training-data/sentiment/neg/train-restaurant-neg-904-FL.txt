We ordered pizza right around closing time for pick up because we saw it was rated best pizza in Arizona on Facebook Crust wasnt crispy and both the pizza and garlic knots were warm at best The marinara sauce that came with the knots was mediocre I was disappointed Descent tasting pizza wouldnt make my top ten list of best in AZ though
