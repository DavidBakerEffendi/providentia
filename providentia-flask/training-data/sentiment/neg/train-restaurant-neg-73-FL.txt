Well the review starts out a little like this

Came into Blue  for Taco Tuesday at pm Happy hour ends at  and Taco Tuesday is supposed to start after happy hour 

Savvy our very friendly and awesome server informed us that Taco Tuesday didnt start until after pm Savvy had the manager Lindsay come explain the issue to me as she wasnt sure why the time wasnt changed herself   

Lindsay came to the table and told us (family of ) that she could not honor the Taco Tuesday price until pm I asked why happy hour ends now at  and Taco Tuesday doesnt star until  She said it just hasnt been changed yet and that there would be a lot of changes made in the future  She told me that she can not control the pricing on the tacos but could Chang the prices in the computer to give me happy hour prices on filler food if I wanted to wait in the Taco order placement until pm  

I find it dumb that a manager can override happy hour prices but not Taco Tuesday prices 

Great server crappy management  computer system
