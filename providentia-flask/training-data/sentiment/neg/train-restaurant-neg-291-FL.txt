I do not know how this place has such good reviews the sushi is mediocre  There are some interesting rolls but nothing to write home about  The nigiri we had had a weird texture and a watery flavor  I also had some udon which was so so  I might come back here to try the Teppanyaki or maybe try another noodle dish but in all this place was nothing to rave about  I should also note that while we were there we observed a waitress drop chop sticks on the ground pick them up and place them on a table as if nothing had happened  Not sure I trust the cleanliness of this place either  That and on top of all this it was too expensive too
