Im shocked that there have been favorable reviews on this place The gentleman who has presented himself as the owner was nice but not very well put together Poorly served food soso service dirty tables as well as a bathroom without toilet paper The girlfriend of the owner was wonderful and did an excellent job explaining the menu Weve been here  times  we wanted to like it given that its in our neighborhood but its horrible The food was also very bland  served cold Ill give them  stars for their chips but less than a star on the rest
