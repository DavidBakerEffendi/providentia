Ive been here twice now The first time I wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke I ended up only ordering a shake I went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running) I was not impressed Im not sure what was weird about The sauce The cheese Ive had way better pizzas Loved the milkshake I give it two stars because my husband likes it and I have to tolerate it for him
