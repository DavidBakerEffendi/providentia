I ordered the  meat plateThe chicken breast turned out not to be bone in but sliced medallionsThe turkey consisted of  thin slices like one would get from an Oscar Meyer deli packMy side of baked beans was extremely blandIt reminded me of a can of Van DeKampsI had upgraded my dinner to a cornbread muffinBut when I opened up my bag I was disappointed to have gotten the dinner roll insteadThe Hot BBQ sauce was way too hotIt puts Famous Daves Devils Spit to shame It is laden with crushed red chili peppers to the point of being unable to really taste the food its supposed to embellish
