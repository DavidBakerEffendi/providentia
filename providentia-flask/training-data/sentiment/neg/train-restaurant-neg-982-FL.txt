Wish zero stars was on option Ordered through Grubhub Ordered six different flavors for boneless wings with extra sauce and extra ranch  Received a total of four ranches no extra sauce and none of boxes were labeled with what flavor they were Look at my pic to see the quality of the food we received Called the store and they gave  a  dollar credit on my NEXT order which isnt even close to what we spent Said they dont label the flavors because they dont have time Made no offer to make the food correct and bring it out Huge disappointment Stay far away
