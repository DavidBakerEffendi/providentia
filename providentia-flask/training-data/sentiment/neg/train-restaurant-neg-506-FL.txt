We love that this is close to our house but after the service this last time we will drive further for any place else 

We came in and sat at the bar After a beer I wanted to switch to wine I ordered my  glass and when the glass was delivered it was so dirty I would not drink out of it 

I asked the waiter for a new glass of wine My husband told me to keep an eye on the glass as he had a feeling they were going to pour the wine from the dirty soap scum glass into another glass Sure enough I watched the bartender do just this When the waiter brought it back we explained what we witnessed and he stated he was sorry but this is how the bartender said they are to do it 

He took the glass back and it sat there for another  minutes as we received dirty looks from the bartender after our waiter pointed to us from the bar as he was explaining our disappointment to him 

The nachos and the wrap we also ordered were good or this would be a one star
