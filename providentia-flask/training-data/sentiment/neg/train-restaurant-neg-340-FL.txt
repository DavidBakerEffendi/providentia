My kids and I came here for lunch It was pretty dead inside and raining outside and my kids were starving I figured we might as well since there was no wait

We walked in and were seated right away The waitress came pretty fast to take our drink order It was obvious she wasnt thrilled about serving us probably because she thought the bill wouldnt be high enough to constitute a decent tip The entire time we were there she acted like we were a total nuisance and I promise you that I am a nice and easy customer

My kids had bean burritos from the kids menu ( each) that they said were bland and I had chicken tacos and were pretty blas With drinks and tip the bill was over  We could have gone to Some Burros across the street for  and it would have been better service and better food Next time we know to skip this place
