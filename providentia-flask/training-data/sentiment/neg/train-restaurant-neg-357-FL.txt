Meh Wellworse than meh

Heres the thing The food isnt very good and the prices are insanely high Actually the food was almost bad and the prices were out of control BUT the service was pretty good and the chips and salsa were amazing so there are your  stars 

When you first walk in you will notice bowls of avocados sitting on your table 

OMG I bet they make table side guacamole I exclaimed

Well they sure do For  Fuck that  is too much for a tiny mini bowl of  avocados mixed with chili seasoning and onions Unless Im drunk or really hungry which means I will buy anything But I wasnt so I didnt No table side gauc for me

Next the main course Everything on the menu is beef pork chicken or beef pork chicken and cream What if you arent a huge fatty and CARE about your health What if you want fresh fish or veggies or if you want your beefchickenpork without cream I guess I shouldnt have eaten that second bowl of tortilla chips huh Now I am on a fat rant

So I order enchiladas  but for the love of god HOLD THE CREAM The enchiladas were disappointing Id give them a C or maaaaaaybe a B because they came on a bed of spinach (interesting) Maybe the cream would have saved them but I dont think it is necessary to add cream to make a good enchilada and neither do most Mexican restaurants with much better  ones The enchiladas were at most bland and blah and not worth  I dont mind paying a lot for good Mexican Food but this wasnt very good 

I was eating with fellow yelper Scott S He had the chili relleno He said is was below average

By the way their cheese enchiladas had CHUNKS of beef in the enchilada sauce Mind you these are a separate menu items from the beef enchiladas So your choices are

Enchiladas with beef
Enchiladas with cheese and secret beef of which you become aware of after you bite in
Enchiladas with cheese secret beef and cream

Blech Die

At least the iced tea was flowing and the chips and salsa were seiously kick ass

Hmm if I wasnt in a generous mood I might be tempted to take away another star But I wont Just like I probably wont be back
