Dont let the location and crowd fool you into eating here This place was shockingly terrible The salsa tasted like a can of tomato sauce the chili con Queso sure tasted like Mexican Velveeta the nachos were overly cheesed and lacking key ingredients like beans sour cream and guacamole and the grounds were littered with old straws napkins and cigarette butts We were extremely disappointed We ate a few bites of our food and left The ambiance was decent but the service was nothing to write home about There are several other delicious Mexican options in the same area in the same price range
