nd time I have been to this place was this afternoon for lunch  The food was great just like the first time I was there  The service sucked  It took almost  minutes to get our salads  And about  minutes after that to get our food  Once the food was served our waitress disappeared  She did not come back to see if everything was good  Our daughter didnt get all the toppings that she ordered on her pizza but was charged for them  When pointed out waitress took off extras but most restaurants would of comped her the slice of pizza for her inconvenience  Disappointed
