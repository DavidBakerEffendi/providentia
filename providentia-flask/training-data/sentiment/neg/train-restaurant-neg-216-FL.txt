This is my first visit to this Kneaders and it probably be the last I was here with my daughter and her friend for a postpractice breakfast The place was busy and when the girls ordered (French toast and a breakfast sandwich) we were told it would be out shortly 
Shortly turned into almost  minutes and a line of us asking where our food was and when it would be ready The excuses ranged from Were really busy to  A lot of people ordered French toast There was one person in the grill and six in the front The people in the front made no effort to hide making fun or passing comments about those who were inquiring about their food I was even advised to not have my daughter get another serving of French toast because the cook was backed up WTH
Were okay with not visiting this establishment again
