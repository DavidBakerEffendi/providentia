There is nothing like ordering a half slab of ribs and finding hair in my food Thats pretty disgusting  The manager came out and apologized He comped my meal and ordered more ribs for me The second slab came out I actually enjoyed them until I came to the last rib There was another hair baked into the sauce Manager came out again  apologized profusely and comped the  whole table This was my first and last time at this restaurant
