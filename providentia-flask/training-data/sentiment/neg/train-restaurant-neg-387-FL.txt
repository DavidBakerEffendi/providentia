I have been to Cantina Laredo probably  times in the past  years and went today for lunch   I had not been for a while so I was excited to go back  I dont think I will be coming back today was a huge disappointment   Normally they bring you two types of salsa for your chips and they only brought out one kind today  I asked our server about the other kind of salsa and she said she would bring it out and never did  The draft beer was down so they brought out bottles with tall glasses to pour the beer into and the glasses were dirty and not cold  The food was just average and was better in the past  The server was not very on the ball either     This place used to be great and it has turned into less than mediocre   Go to Barrio Queen or somewhere else for better food and experience
