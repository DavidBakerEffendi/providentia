I had the worst experience I have ever had at a Chipotle I am a regular here too I arrived at  and they ran out of chicken and steak They said  minutes So I filled out a form with my order paid and sat down After  minutes the chicken was still not ready I proceeded to wait because I already paid for my food After  minutes I saw they started serving food to everyone that had just walked in I stood up went to the cashier and said I had been waiting and others are being served before me The cashier told me to wait that she will get to my order Sure enough the young woman gave me the nastiest look for speaking up She put the rice and beans in my bowl and then went back to completing the people behind me their orders At that point I said again come on I have been waiting The woman proceeded to give me a mean look the cashier was rude to me Once my bowl was complete it was  They had forgotten my side tortilla I said something the woman threw it in foil and bunched it together After seeing her reaction towards me like that I asked for their manager The manager came out and was very apologetic However he told me he thought the other manager was going to fire the young woman The fact that your saying that to customers shows your poor management You are aware of a problem employee and are not doing anything about it I finally left at  They refunded me my meal but I will never come back to that Chipotle I read other reviews and its a common problem Seems like there needs to be new management and employees I am going to recommend no one to go here and I will be happily cancelling my corporate account with them
