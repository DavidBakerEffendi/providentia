This Dunkin Donuts is on my way to work and after hearing about their new Cookie Dough Collada coffee I decided to stop by Since then I have gone a number of times and each time is something new Either the person at the speaker doesnt understand what I mean when I say Collada(which is what they named it not me) or when I get the coffee I find out that they didnt actually put any coffee in it at all So then I started requesting the Cookie Dough Collada WITH coffee and thats usually responded to with a rude reply On top of all if this today after waiting a long time in line I get up to the window where the rude girl with a monotone hurriedly takes my card then says itll be a few minutes She leaves the window open and another worker whom forgot their was a customer there hops up on the counter and scoots all the way back to where his butt is almost hanging out the window Once the girl laugh and brought his attention to the customer still waiting for her coffee he jumped down My coffee was then practically shoved into my hand and the windows were closed really quickly

Now I am not one to usually complain in fact this is the first time I have ever even left a review at all but this place is very poorly run and the people are all rude and not trained very well Unless the get new management and hire nicer people I dont think I will be going back
