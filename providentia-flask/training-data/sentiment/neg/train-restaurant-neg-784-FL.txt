Thought I stop by here to get a burrito but probably will never go to this location again I usually like to get fajitas veggies on mine but the one at this location was black and burnt as can be It made everything taste burnt and it had this gritty taste all over from small burnt pieces couldnt not finish it and had to throw it away felt very nauseated after For a place thats all about the ingredients and where it comes from they should take care in how they handle and cook it Never coming back
