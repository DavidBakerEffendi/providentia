Heres the irony I give it two stars bc I just really hate going here but I recommend you check it out at least once The burgers are really high quality the other food is fresh But this place has such a dbag feel to it and its always so crowded that its both not fun and a little dirty

The place is authentic and has a good story behind it Leave yourself enough time to walk the grounds and the adjoining community garden

And its expensive (which means you pay too much for it not that its high value) I think I had a bacon cheeseburger fries and a serveyourselfatouroutsideintheheatfountain drink it it set me back like
