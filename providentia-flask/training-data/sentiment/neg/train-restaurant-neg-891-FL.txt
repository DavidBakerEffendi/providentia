I see my old review referenced eggplant parm with tough skin I do love the calzone here But what I hate is old pizza slices To me it was worse than frozen pizza Im mad at my self for not sending it back I lied to the guy when he asked me when I was leaving sad it was good I will never go back Enjoy your Caffeine free diet coke I wont drink that again
