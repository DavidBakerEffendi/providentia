Very very sad at the quality of the food at this Nandos We love the Nandos on McDowell road The plates are served with extra nice touches and look great as they come out The food at the location of valvista and baseline was so substandard I was sad at my usual tasting dry inside and I am not sure why my sauce had a yellow tinge to it The staff was very friendly and the establishment appeared clean
