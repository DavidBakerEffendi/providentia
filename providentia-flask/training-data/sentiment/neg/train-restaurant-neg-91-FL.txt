The Good  They serve chicken gizzards and livers customer service
The Bad  They need help with cooking Gizzards and Livers from places like Harolds in Chicago

My wife and I decided to give this place a whirl as it recently opened  Before committing to an order we decided to sample the items we wanted first  Our first impression was that they overcooked the gizzardsbig time  I am a person who can eat some tougher items but these gizzards actually gave my jaws a workout  It should NEVER take me more than  minutes to chew a chicken gizzard  My wife tried the livers and they were overcooked as well  When we ordered we reminded them not to overcook the gizzards and livers  They responded well but there was still quite a bit missing  

As for the customer service it was good but there needs to be some way to make it more efficient  I could imagine waiting in a long line with the staff we had on our visit and it would seriously take a very long time  The staff was friendly and accommodating but they need to take a page from Harolds in Chicago on how to cook chicken gizzards and livers
