I would like to start off that the two stars does not reflect their food  their food is actually  stars However (and its a big however) out of the last  times my husband and I have tried to order from Sidewinders we had to cancel our order or leave it incomplete online  Why you ask  Somehow a sandwich place is consistently out of white bread  I literally cant understand it  Thats like going into Subway and they are out of their Italian bread  It just doesnt make sense  Its not just their white bread (although thats the most frustrating because that has caused  of our canceled orders since my husband wont eat wheat) but  of the  times we actually have placed orders they were out of something else  Once they were out of the corn nuggets I accepted and understood that  The second time they were out of croissants  Once again I accepted and slightly understood that  That last  times we went to order and theyre out of white bread  I cant accept that Its gotten to the point where I will give my husband two options for delivery (usually between Sidewinders and Chinese food) and while we want to order from Sidewinders its not worth calling for the high likelihood they are out of the most popular bread order
