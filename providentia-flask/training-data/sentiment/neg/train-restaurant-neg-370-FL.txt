Cantina Laredo was not very good I did feel that it was a little pricey as well I went here with my boss to check out their banquet room and try some of their food for an upcoming vendor conference our company is having The atmosphere is very nice and modern The service was great We ordered the botanas platter to share which came with tacos al pastor chicken fajita quesadillas chili con queso Guacamole stuffed jalapenos and beef shrimp and vegetable skewers Nothing really wowed me though The best thing on the platter was probably the stuffed jalapenos but you only got two and they were pretty small The tacos were kinda dry and bland as were the quesadillas and the skewers had only one shrimp and one tough piece of beef on them I thought it was kinda a rip off The queso was ok but tasted like your typical Velveeta cheese dip In addition we ordered a cup each of the sopa de tortilla Trying to be fancy the waiter arrived with two bowls of tortilla strips chicken and onions Then he poured the thick soups tableside Yippy I really wasnt impressed Tableside anything is just stupid and useless in my opinion The soup really was not very good Was a bit too pungent in flavor and smell Almost tasted like a bowl of enchilada sauce Needless to say my boss and I didnt eat very much of it Even the complimentary chips and salsa were not that great The warm roasted poblano salsa was terrible I thought and the other salsa was mediocre I had very high hopes for this restaurant and was disappointed immensely On a positive note they do have a great banquet room that can hold up to  people and it has LCD TVs and surround sound so its great for presentations and corporate events Would I try it again I am all about giving places second chances so I would go again and try ordering an actual meal If it sucks again I will conclude that this place is overpriced crappy and not worth anymore of my time
