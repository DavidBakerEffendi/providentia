Ive dined here over a dozen times since moving to the east valley  The establishment is on the way home from work and therefore convenient for me  The service has been highly erraticranging from mediocre to absolutely horrid  Tonight the iced tea tasted like coffee the club sandwich was missing items and the server was nearly nonexistent  I will not be returning to this Dennys location ever again
