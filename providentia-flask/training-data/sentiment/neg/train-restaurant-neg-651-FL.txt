Hash browns were soft few and werent crispy  Egg on my Texas toast breakfast sandwich did not taste real  I think they were POWDERED EGGS No joke  The eggs were gross  I just threw them out  My husbands iced tea was terrible and tasted like it was brewed with coffee  They orgot I ordered a coffee and then didnt give me a stirrer so I could add my sugar to my coffee  My husband asked for extra ham on his Bagel sandwich at the drive thru speaker  and it didnt come with extra even when he asked for it again at the window after realizing we werent charged for it  He had his card ready to pay but they didnt take it  The gal who was making his sandwiches looked ticked about my husband wanting extra ham on his sandwich when she handed him the bags  Very rude

My husbands plain bagel and cream cheese was the only good part about breakfast  

This was a BAD experience  Not a good start to the weekend  Wont be coming back here  This place needs to figure it out
