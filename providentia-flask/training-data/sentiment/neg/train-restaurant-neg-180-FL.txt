Service really downhill After two most recent visits wont be coming back I have been visiting Top Golf since it opened its where I take out of town guests to Ive never had a bad experience at the Scottsdale location Ive been to Gilbert  times in the past  months and its insulting Lets start with walking in the door A pseudo security guard instructs you that each person needs to have a membership card Since when Ive gone to Top Golf in Scottsdale with out of town guests and weve used our existing membership cards Then you sign up for the bay list (expected wait) then head to bar to order fooddrinks The barwait staff is usually good The disconnect is the front deskconcierge staff They text you when your bay is ready  maybe  minutes on a weekend night Then they make you stand there another  minutes as they try to find someone to take you to the bay meanwhile your food is getting cold Also dont even think about trying to coordinate the wait staff bringing your fooddrinks to your bay because the front desk wont give you your bay number to give to the waiter okay a few more go arounds to this nonsense wait it gets better  you get the bay number give it to the wait staff The escort to bring you to the bay escorts you to the elevator opens the door pushes a button and doesnt get in with you No you and your guests are looking at each other like WTF Then you get out onthe third door and the escort is waiting for you at the end of a corridor Then you get to your bay and yes your food and drink has beaten you to it Oh and the front desk staff doesnt know how to prioritize or greethandle guests at best its a bunch of high schoolers who just want to be chatting with each other Okay back to the bay now you start to golf  well not all the holes were lighting up were pretty sure some holes were malfunctioning And then the guests at the bay next to ours brought a dog to the bay next to us Now I wont even go down this rabbit hole of why a dog shouldnt be at a golf range restaurant and on top of it a third floor So if you want to pay  for an hour of malfunctioning golf lights another  minimum per person to eat and then put up with the nonsense of the security guard front desk staff mystery elevator ride then by all means come One final note again the restaurantbar staff were all great I suppose its because they have to be adults to serve alcohol
