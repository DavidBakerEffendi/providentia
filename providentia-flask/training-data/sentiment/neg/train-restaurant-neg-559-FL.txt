This was probably the worst dining experience anywhere Do not waste your money or time We had very little expectations to begin with going to a Dennys but just wanted a decent meal with our kiddos after a long day We walked in and no one was at the host table for at least  minutes We were seated and the place was nearly empty A guy came and took our drink order and didnt come back for  minutes A lady came after  minutes and asked for our drink order We told her the guy took it and she disappeared only to return a few minutes later to ask for our drink order again We got our drinks  minutes later and hadnt even ordered our food yet She finally came back to take our order An hour later we had to flag someone down to find out where our food and waitress was We had not even gotten a single drink refill or seen our waitress She comes back and we ask how much longer our food will be and if we can get refills She disappears again comes back with no refills and says to be honest its at least another  minutes We had been there going on  hours We only ordered eggs and pancakes and a cheeseburger When we told her we were going to leave without food she had the nerve to demand we pay for our drinks My husband talked to another waitress who said not to worry about the drinks Will never set foot back in there
