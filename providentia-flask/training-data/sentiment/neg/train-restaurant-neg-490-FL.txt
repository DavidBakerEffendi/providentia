This place has the worst customer service and gives out way smaller portion sizes than any other noodles Ive ever been too Today I ordered  small buttered noodles and literally had a childs portion in it compared to the others When I asked the clerk why the huge difference in size when they should be the same she responded the noodles were stuck together Really Im doubting that Would it be so hard to give me some more noodles Geez I wont be returning to this location
