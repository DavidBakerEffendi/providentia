I was beyond excited to find a vegan restaurant in my neighborhood The menu looked amazing the decor was great  my server was so sweet and attentive I ordered the beet burger the sweet potato fries were awesome However the beet burger was burnt on both sides and the bun was way too hard to even get your teeth through My server was very sweet and she took it back offering something to replace it so I asked for the soup of the day a potato soup with onions and shredded carrot When I received the soup it was cold the potatoes were basically cut up french fries and the onions were raw but the flavor of the broth was fairly good Overall super disappointed great idea poor execution I did also order a Thai tea which was really good with the coconut cream
