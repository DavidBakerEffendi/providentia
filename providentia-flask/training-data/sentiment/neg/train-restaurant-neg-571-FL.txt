I love Dennys and when I come back to the states as I am stationed overseas it is on my list This Dennys has to be one of the worst locations ever I went Friday with my family and there was hardly any staff and hardly any guests The GM was at the front and didnt even acknowledge we walked in After being seated we waited  minutes with the waiter passing right by our table and serving people who came after us
After looking at each other in surprise my husband called the GM over to personally take our order He apologized that he only had one waiter that couldnt handle the tables There were only about four Not wanting to wait even longer for the food to come out we told him we would try again another day
We then tried Saturday and once again walked in to one server four guests in the whole place and no one at the front This time however we just walked out
This Dennys needs some serious retraining
