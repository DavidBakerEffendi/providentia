I ordered two Shawarma pitas to go and a Cilantro Jalapeo Hummus I opened up the pita for the hummus and the pita had mold all over it Our pita bread on our Shawarma pitas was stale and the chicken was dry I use to love this place What happened Ive been a loyal customer of Pita Jungle for  years  I will not be going back to this location
