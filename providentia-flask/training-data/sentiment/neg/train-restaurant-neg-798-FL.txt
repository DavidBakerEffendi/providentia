If I could give this place no stars I would My husband and I ordered the New burger that they are currently advertising which is the Jalapeo Double We waited about  minutes for our food We were handed the drinks the fries and the lady told us to have a good night My husband said to her Wait a minute wheres our burgers She shakes her head and apologizes and she gets them Well we pulled over to the side to make sure we were handed the right burgers as we unwrapped the burgers it looked as if they were thrown together and the patties were cold and they looked old We went back to get a refund and I handed the burgers to the cashier and she said she would show the manager and we waited about  minutes and the manager came out and handed us our burgers and to be honest with you these were the same burgers that we gave them and you could tell he just threw them in the microwave Very Disgusting He tried blaming the lettuce tomatoes sauce etc for making the burgers cold I told him I didnt need an explanation and what I do need is a our money back My advice is to not come here unprofessional staff and the food is terrible Pictures of our food is posted
