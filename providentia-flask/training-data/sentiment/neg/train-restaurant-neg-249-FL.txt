I ordered two Thai salads because I had it the other day at a different location and it was great So I order they say nothing get home of course its missing something I call in and the lady can understand my frustration that I spent twenty dollars on salad that is missing one of four ingredients Pause pause pause She doesnt offer a discount or say you can come get your money back if your bring the salad Or even a discount Riddle me this if you are missing a key component in something you charge for can you still charge the same without telling your customers I told her I would never go back she told me she hopes my day gets better  Terrible customer service Now I can only hope that location closes tomorrow or I will never have my revenge
