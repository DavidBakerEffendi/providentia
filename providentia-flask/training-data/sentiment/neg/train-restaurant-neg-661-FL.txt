I wont be going back to this location We walked in and there was an unsupervised till (with cash) sitting on the counter  That should have told me something right there The cashier tells us there is some deal for buy one get one on the breakfast sandwich we were asking about Order and pay  not BOGO  for  Huge difference Then we get the order and the egg wasnt even in the breakfast sandwhiches Yep Just bacon and cheese See my photos We had to go back up and get the sandwiches made again The crew was nice and apologetic but still this experience was a bit off all around
