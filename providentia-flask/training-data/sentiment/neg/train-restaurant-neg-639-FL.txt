DONT DO IT  I went to Dr Hanna for my regular cleanings for about  years and never had too much of a problem  Then it seems like things there took a turn for the worst  I needed a tooth pulled so Dr Hanna referred me to an oral surgeon  I went and had the tooth pulled  Dr Hannas office then called to make an appointment for the extraction  I kindly told the receptionist that I was told by Dr Hanna herself that she was not able to do the extraction and that I had already gone to an oral surgeon who she had recommended to have the work done  The following week I got a call from Dr Hannas office to make an appointment for a new patient consultation  I told the receptionist that I have been an established patient for the past couple years and I didnt understand how they got their records mixed up  Mixing up patients records Really  How unprofessional  Unfortunately thats not all My fiance went to Dr Hanna for a regular cleaning and cavity fillings  She told him that he needed his teeth deep cleaned which they did twice totaling over  out of pocket which also maxed out his dental plan for the year  She never took care of his cavity fillings which was why he went in the first place  Because the cavities were never filled one of his teeth broke in half  He now needed a root canal and crown  Of course we switched dentists by this time his cavities are now filled root canal and crown done And the nd opinion from the new dentist  A person generally needs their teeth deep cleaned once every  years  Wow funny coincidence that is exactly what our insurance covers deep cleaning once every  years  It figures Dr Hannas office can only survive by overcharging patients for services they dont really need  And here is the icing on the caketoday we got a call from a medical collections agency saying my fiance was sent to collections by Tracy from Smiles by Hanna for not paying  that the insurance did not pay  Not once did we get an invoice in the mail  Not once did we get a phone call letting us know  We called the office spoke with Tracy who claims they did everything they could but never got payment  Both of my parents and sisters used to see Dr Hanna and they had their own HORRIBLE experiences  And Dr Hannas office could care less they lost  patients
