Cantina Laredo in San Tan Village was a huge disappointment This was not our first time here which is why our expectations were so high We went there for two things Beer and the guacamole and they couldnt get it right It was a Saturday night at the peak dinner time We were seated right away and someone brought us chips and salsa but no water  When the waitress arrived we ordered  beers and the top shelf guacamole that they make at your table We started eating the chips and salsa salivating for our beers My husband had gone to the restroom and the waitress set up shop right in front of his chair and started making the guacamole I didnt say a word because I was stuck on the words that came out of her mouth when she arrived The bar is taking care of the beers so I asked someone to bring you some waters in the meantime What I can see the bar from where Im sitting I can get a bottle a beer myself  And the waitress was not doing us a favor by getting water We should have had a glass of water regardless 

When my husband returned the waitress moved out of his way and apologized for being in his way We were completely done with this waitress when we tasted the guacamole I dont know if it was her first time making guacamole or what It was disgusting It was overbearing with lime You couldnt taste anything else We finally got our beers and downed them as fast as we could so we could leave My husband tasted his water and then tasted mine He asked me if I tasted my water I did and I didnt think anything of it It tasted like tap water I tasted his and it tasted like cleaner We were completely disgusted Our bill was  for  beers and nasty guacamole We wont be going back
