Just wish I liked this place Have been here twice (always try to give a place a second chance) The atmosphere is nice and its close to home Service is ok but food was just soso and definitely not worth the price Maybe its the way cilantro overpowers all the dishes weve tried but the food was pretty onenote The chips and salsa were the reason for the second star Very nice which makes it such a shame that the food is sub par

Doubt Id be back except maybe for drinks chips  salsa
