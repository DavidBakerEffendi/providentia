So here is the deal with Chipotle  Every once in a while I forget why I dont like coming here and then poof I magically find myself in line looking at that damned Aztec art thingy wondering what a plywood and sheet metal Montezuma has to do with the comically overstuffed burrito I am doomed to regret eating  
The food does not taste horrible  It is decent  I really enjoy their fountain soda I dont know why  Their are a few places that just have amazing fountain soda  QT for one and Chipotle for two  (That reminds me I am going to yelp QT next  I have some shit to say about those MoFos)

So here is why Chipotle gets two stars Every time I eat there I get about halfway through my giant tube filled with meat beans and rice when Ol buzz kill Chipotle shows up in my gut like the cops coming to a party  Chipotle barges in and yells Chipotles here everybody OUT  That is when all of the drunken teenagers inside me make haste for the nearest exit 

Yes I did just make a diarrhea euphemism relating Chipotle to the cops and my poop to drunken teenagers  I am not proud

Why do I repeatedly torture myself for mediocre food

Although I do expect mad props for not going with a Montezumas Revenge joke
