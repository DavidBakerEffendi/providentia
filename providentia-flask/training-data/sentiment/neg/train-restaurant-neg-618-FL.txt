Shame me once fool on you shame me twice fool on me 

Well needless to say today was the second time (in a looooong time) I decided to give my DQ down the road a try Apparently they dont read their Yelp reviews or even care what the customer has to say because once more as I went through the drive thru and ordered  large TWIST ice creams with sprinkles in a bowl the person at the window either needs to have their ears checked hearing aids implemented or just plain be banished from this earth because I was served  VANILLA ice creams with sprinkles in a bowl looking at my receipt  AMAZING  TWIST ice creams were ordered (so Im not crazy Hallelujah)

Dairy Queen Im done stick a fork in me And youre lucky I didnt  just throw my ice creams at the idiotic lady who served me At this point the assault charges that would have followed would be worth it after numerous times youve failed to serve the customer correctly
