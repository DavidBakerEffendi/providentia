This location in Gilbert is awful Im a regular at the Nandos in Mesa (McDowell) they have the Gilbert location beat hands down 

I ordered take out I called in right I got put on hold twice once right as I said take out next was because I have no clue she said hold on I have to get management approval I ordered simple items  bowls of red chili tortillas lunch special A (enchilada and taco with rice  beans) side of rice and a pint of hot sauce with chips Needs no approval right Had me wondering at least Well I got to the restaurant and it was pretty dead  employees working only But they bothed seemed friendly My ordered didnt take to long but what surprised me was when the guy came out with a box Normally its bags instead my order was in a box The problem with this location is the FOOD The enchilada sauce is salty the salsa is bland and tastes bad even the hot sauce is bad red chili meat is tough and orangish color and finally the shredded beef taco is drier than a bone I was extremely disappointed Ive never had a bad meal at that Nandos in Mesa But its my fault for trying this location  Never again

The main difference between Gilbert and Mesa location if you go in at the same time (let say pm) Mesa will have  people working Gilbert will probably just have  Gilbert location didnt even have a bartender (happy hour is pm)
