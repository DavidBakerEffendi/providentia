This store loves to mess up orders apparently The first time was a small accident  the kid was new so I gave them a second chance But tonight was not that case I called the store to advise my bread bowl pasta  was incorrect but the box label was correct The ingredients they put in that were wrong I was allergic to them and The assistant manager Tim said ok and Ok and I want it fixed or my money back neither of what Tim was willing to do After admitting He made my food incorrectly he proceeded to not replace it he then said that he will only replace my food if I pay a delivery fee and waited an hour No thanks Why should I pay for your mistake you admitted too After tonight I wont be returning to this store again
