No wonder the highlighted reviews are from  This place was trash From start to finish We waited  minutes for the guy to make a bowl and burrito for one customer When it was my turn my order was done within  seconds I was completely rushed I didnt want to be rude but there is so many things wrong with the line When I got home I swallowed a piece of chicken that felt like I swallowed a razor blade Probably because the girl didnt cut the chicken properly Hands down it was awful Considering working here so I can make this place better because WOW Im very familiar with the way chipotles line works and their food rotation Why was the rice not filled Why did I get the bottom of it and half a spoon full This is not ok I should go back and get a refund because we didnt even finish the food or even make a dent Im so disappointed IT IS NOT HARD I work in the food industry I know
