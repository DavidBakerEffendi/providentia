I really dont reccomend this restaurant First of all the service was terrible He brought us our food and didnt come back until he dropped the bill on the table without asking if we wanted dessert or anything We also ate the first basked of chips fast because we were all very hungry and did not get offered a second basket even though it was another  minutes until our food came My husband needed a refill on his drink for  minutes and never got it The food was mediocre The chicken in my pollo Rico tasted just like boiled chicken with no flavor Im pretty sure the beans are canned and they tasted like glue The rice is not authentic Mexican rice but was better than the beans I cant believe we wasted  on this meal we will NOT be back
