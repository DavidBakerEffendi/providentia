To be honest way over priced the fact I wanted veggies over rice and I get charged more for veggies come on guys and then Ive had chicken with curry sauce before today ask for the same thing and I got this chicken that had no curry spice at all to it veggies are undercooked  Very disappointed with Pita jungle I am sticking with Pita da vita in Gilbert  At least I wont get charged for veggies and its actual curry sauce
