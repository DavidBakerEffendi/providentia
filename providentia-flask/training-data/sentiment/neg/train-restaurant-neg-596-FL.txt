Crappy experience again

We () sat down and ordered our lunchbreakfast  Waitress never came back drinks were empty  We asked for silverware and napkins which no success  Waitress refills our drinks  minutes later  The waitress came back to tell us that our order had been passed up this entire time  She said there are a couple of orders ahead of us but it is coming   wasted minutes  The service has been like this the last two times we have tried to eat here  We came to this Dennys at my yr old sons request  The manager didnt even come to our table to apologize  

We decided to leave and I stopped to pay for our drinks  I had to request to speak to the manager  He apologized for the mix up of course and agreed to pay for the tab  We were not going to eat there today or in the future 

For some reason this Dennys cant get it right

Wanted to give it no stars but t this app doesnt allow it
