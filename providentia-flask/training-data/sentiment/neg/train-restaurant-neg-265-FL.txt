I was glad to hear of a new restaurant coming to Parker CO so I recently tried Kneaders I have gone  times and ordered a sandwich once and a salad the second time The food is good but I cant get over all the plastic being used It is crazy how wasteful this is They really need to start using dishes for their salads and have utensils that arent plastic Can someone explain why they they dont use real dishesI would rather stick with Panera instead
