Not very impressed Restaurant seems very popular and was busy Waitress was kind but not very attentive She took my water cup and never brought it back We had to ask someone else to bring me water because we didnt see her At the end of the meal I finally got some water Food was ok I had yakisoba and husband had ramen dish We both prefer Thai and pho to the ramen dish so we probably wont be back
