Im editing my original review from three stars down to one star The coffee here has been consistent lately consistently bitter and old tasting I seriously think I was served last nights coffee this morning I will go to Higley  Warner from now on if I have a taste for Dunkin donuts coffee 

This Dunkin is just ok Sometimes the coffee tastes bitter and the flavor is inconsistent Sometimes its really good and other times its bitter I find it really odd that they dont put all of the food in one bag If I order a breakfast sandwich munchkins for my daughter ( of them) and hash browns they hand each thing to me separately in a tiny bag Hello Im in the drive thru so I clearly intend on continuing onto my next destination I dont want a  greasy hash browns bag getting the seat in my car messy Also they never give napkins unless you ask which is really annoying There is a lot of room for improvement at this location I much prefer the Dunkin on Higley and Warner but its much farther from my house
