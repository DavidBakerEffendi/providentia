Just about every year I go here I feel like they have cutten back When I first went there everything was fresh and tasty Then I went there a year later and got the same thing and it wasnt that fresh The only thing that was and has been was the Guacamole that they made infront of you Then I cam here the third year Fall of   and the food wasnt that fresh the Guacamole was alright and the meal I have wasnt good The next expierence I had was February I got the chicken Enchiladas with white sauce and had to say it wasnt very good The sauce wasnt very good it had too much chicken in it and was too big even the Guacamole this visit wasnt nearly as fresh as it use to be One month later I came the Saint Patricks Day weekend and I had to say worse expierence Ive had  They didnt have much of a menu the food wasnt that good and and not much of a good taste again The waitress was alright but Ive had a little better there After we ate I wanted some dessert so I received the menu and it was very very limited had only a few things on it that werent very good and cut off a lot of stuff of the menu My th visit a month before for dessert I had icecream in a churro like bowl and fruit this past time they didnt have that While I was there I picked the fried brownie and ice cream dish fried in scotch butter and had to say it was just gross very plain too rich and small amount I was very disappointed that last visit and if I went again anyway it would never be the same
