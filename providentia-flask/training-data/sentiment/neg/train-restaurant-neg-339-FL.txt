I am only give it two stars because they did have good guacamole As for the rest of the food it would get  star 

I thought it was impossible to mess up tacos but these were so bland I even drown them in salsa to try and help them but that didnt even work 

I have zero plans to go back to eat but would maybe do drinks and guacamole
