Still on my quest to find good mexican foods in this area Ordered the  kinds of salsas salty and saltier the Guacamole could have used some of the salt from the salsa the enchiladas went in the trash (ordered out) as they were tortilla wrapped spinach covered in some cream cheese with  mushrooms I asked for beans and rice got zucchini and rice ceviche was fish scented lemon juice (way over powering) guacamole lacked seasoning and spiciness the taco was on the guacamole so it was wet I am not ranking the service or the restaurant as I did not eat there But I do not think the food would of been any different Basically after tasting everything I had chips for dinnerwhich to my sadness (at what they charged for them) were not home aid (even chevys does that)  My daughter did not eat hers either and my hubby well he was in the military hell eat mres Most of the people who wrote good reviews on here I noticed were AFTER a few margaritas
