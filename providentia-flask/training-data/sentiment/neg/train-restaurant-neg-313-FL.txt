This place was weird but some aspects were good I liked the decor inside the restaurant and I was greeted and seated very quickly Our server was very friendly upbeat and had a nice personality My issue with the experience we had was As follows

) There was no music on so you could hear plates clanking and everyone elses conversations

) One of the salsas that was brought out was piping hot and I wasnt informed I almost burned my tongue 

) The food is described as Gourmet but in my opinion was just okay We got a steak burrito which was a ground meat with something similar in taste to Kraft cheese on top The beans and rice were good though 

This place has potential but needs a little work
