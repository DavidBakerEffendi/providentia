Went to Bushs Chicken for the first time with high hopes but was a bit disappointed The chicken was very chewy and tasted like low quality meat Also the French frys seem to have not been salted at all Finally the sweet tea tasted like it was made with unfiltered water and had a bitter after taste Overall everything came out very bland and unseasoned definitely not what I expected
