Tried the Scottsdale location with a coworker of mine Food was AVERAGE at best  Had the shrimp poboy and he had black and blue burger  His burger came out well done  YUCK  When he brought it up to server she said all of our burgers are prepared medium well  Would have been great if she stated that or asked when he ordered  In all fairness she did offer to re order it  We had to get going so he declined  Dont think I will go back too many options in this part of town with far superior food
