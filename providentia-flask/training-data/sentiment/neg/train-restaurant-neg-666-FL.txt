Walked in at  on a Friday morning line had  people in front of me Yikes 

Not sure if they were understaffed or what but what a cluster One register open for a huge line in the store and in the drivethru Poor kid on the register (Nikko) was really trying his hardest to stay pleasant He was stressing He had to bag donuts and ring by himself Also had to restock as people were buying like  dozen at a time 

Anyway I ended up leaving there around  I hope they figure out their staffing or whatever it is that went wrong And management needs to give that kid a pat on the back for not running out of there 

My donut and coffee were fine btw
