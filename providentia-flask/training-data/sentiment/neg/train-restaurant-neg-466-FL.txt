This review is just for the service  times out of two times they messed up my order  what the odds There has to be something wrong because both times they were different cashiers  If I go to Dominos over something else is just for the fast time in making the food If I have to wait for them to remake my order it totally defeats the purpose and I rather eat somewhere else Managers of this location should do something about it
