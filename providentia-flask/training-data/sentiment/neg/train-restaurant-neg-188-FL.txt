This used to be a good place but their business sense has gone down the drain We went there to celebrate but since my kid has bad food allergy we took her food with us They kicked us out for bringing outside food The manager Terri had no empathy on how the kid was feeling and she lost close to  business that we were bringing to this place due to a policy that that has no exceptions They ruined our entire evening which we were looking forward to We understand policy but each policy has exceptions and this business was not willing to take care of their customers but rather stick to a policy With this attitude this place will close down soon   We have lived with food allergy for almost  yrs and most places are understanding but this was horrible  Top it all she was bragging of having  kids sad a mom of  kids cant understand the feeling of a kid  Topgolf should know how their customers are being treated
