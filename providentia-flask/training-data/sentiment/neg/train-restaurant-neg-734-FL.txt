Well as you may already know Genos is now called Buddys  I never tried Genos so I cant compare the two but Buddys is not a place I will visit again   bucks for  sandwiches and  fries and the food was a huge let down  The Phillys were awful with crusty dried bread and stupidly runny cheese whiz  If youve had a real Philly with whiz its much thicker  The meat (both chicken and steak) was very generic  The other subs we bought were equally as bad and the gourmet fries were stale and small portioned  The ranch is pretty good though

So the food is very subpar and over priced  Not a winning combination for any restaurant
