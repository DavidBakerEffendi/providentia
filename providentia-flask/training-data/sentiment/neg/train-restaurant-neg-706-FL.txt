This is the worst Long John Silvers Ive ever been to The fish was dry The chicken was barely edible They only offer fries or coleslaw as your only side options They dont even put those little batter crumbs you get at every other Long John Silvers The employees are extremely rude and unhelpful Plus on top of that my food had a slight taste of tacos or some other kind of Mexican food I guess thats what happens when you combine a Long John Silvers and a Taco Bell and put them together in the same building I wont be back
