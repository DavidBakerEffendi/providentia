The food is average on a good day I would of given a  star but EVERY time we go all the dishes are filthy  Dried food on the silverware glasses  plates last time the water tasted heavy of soap (at least they are using soap I guess)  I finally gave up  tried their new location in Mesa same problem but not to the same extent  Must be something in the management they cant train or hire decent dish washers
