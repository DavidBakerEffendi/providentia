I have been here twice and its alright The first time I was very upset I was quoted a  minute wait They as if you have a preference on the floor which we didnt After  minutes I checked with the concierge and they said it would be another  minutes long story short we waited an hour and a half for our bay I was extremely upset by this When I told the host about this problem she replied saying there was nothing she could do Why would you quote  minutes when its not even close to that I have hosted at restaurants before and this doesnt make sense to me 

We tried the chips salsa and guac which are clearly not made fresh Tasted terrible 

We chose to return to try again and it was better this time Quote time was accurate Our server was really slow about getting us drinks I understand it can get busy but she would often be seen walking by chatting with the other employees I even brought it to her attention there was a spill at our table and it took her nearly  minutes to bring us a towel and by then the game was over I didnt get my drink until this point either Im fine waiting if its busy but dont be seen standing around when weve asked for help

I ordered a sangria which was also from a mixture I make Sangria by hand which you should but this tasted like powder mixed with water

If we return again we will be getting dinner and drinks beforehand If you are going at night and paying  for a bay you better save your money somehow because their food is not worth it
