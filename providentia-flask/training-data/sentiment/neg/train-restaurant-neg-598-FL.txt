As a breakfast snob I really do not like Dennys  They dont really do anything especially well  Also Ive had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions  I cant slam this place for one unpleasant waitress but I can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better

In fact this place was the very last Dennys I ever ate  The food took forever it wasnt well done came out all screwed up and the waitress was unpleasant  After that experience I decided to never set foot in another Dennys
