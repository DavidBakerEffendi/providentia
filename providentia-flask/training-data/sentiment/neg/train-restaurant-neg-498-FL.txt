Oh this place is classic  South Indian people trying to cook North Indian food Okay for the nonIndian people who are confused let me explain  Ya know how they have southern Italian food and northern Italian food Southern Italian food uses a lot of red sauce pasta olives red wine while northern Italian food incorporates a lot of white sauces grilled items and butter  Yes its an entirely different cuisine  Likewise south Indian food is very different than north Indian food but north Indian food is popular and its what constitutes Indian food much like southern Italian food is what primarily constitutes Italian food  So what ends up happening is you have South Indian people trying to cook North Indian food because the food from the North is what is popular(Dosa not withstanding)

And this lack of expertise was imminent among the cooks and owners Chicken tikka masala is boneless pieces of chicke tikka that is supposed to grilled first and then served in a sauce  They had some pieces of dark bone meat chicken makhani in their buffet I asked to see a menu because I wanted to try their chicken tikka masla The owner argued with me saying that chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala are the same thing with the exception of cream WRONG  A true punjabi restaurant would never make that claim  Anyway so I tried the buffer because I could tell they were too lazy to cook anything similar to what was in their buffet that afternoon  The buffet was tasteless the saag was watery the chicken makhani tasted as if they dumped some chicken into Campbels tomatoe soup and added butter  

We ordered their IndoChineseagain I have had real Indian Chinese and this place tried to make Indian manchurian

Bottomline If you are a clueless white dude who wants to just try Indian food for the first time I recommend this place You wont know any better and its good enough to send you home happy Unlike most Indian restaurants you will like the ambience here Its fairly large has vaulted ceilings is clean and the service was good  If you are Indian or a white dude that knows him some good Indian food skip this place
