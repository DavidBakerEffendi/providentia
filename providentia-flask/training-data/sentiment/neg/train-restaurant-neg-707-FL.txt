First no sign before you pull into the drivethru telling you that you need to go inside for LJS I understand that taking the time to cook the food takes longer than normal but how is letting someone ahead of you make a  Taco Bell order and making you wait  minutes in line behind them  Kid working the counter was really nice however The other worker that brought my food out had zero personality and displayed no enthusiasm for his job at all  The food was good but have had better luck in other locations Do yourself a favour and make the drive to Casa Grande or Winslow for better service The native guy in Winslow that helped me last time actually mixed the fried batter crumblies with the hushpuppy batter and they were amazing
