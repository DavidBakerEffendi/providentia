My wife and I love taking our kids here on Friday nights This past Friday was our last We called ahead on our drive to reserve a place in line They send us a text through yelp saying there were  parties ahead of us No big deal We arrive and check in and the hostess said it will be a few minutes Thirty minutes later I noticed more than  parties sat before us Some of which unnoticed checked in way after us So I got up and raised the question to the hostess whom was messing with her cell phone And she says wait whats your name I said David She goes we lost in our system She said sorry and we were to be seated next  minutes later we got sat at  after happy hour ended which is normally why we like to come to partake in happy hour I explained our situation to the server that we sat and waited longer than we should have and can you honor some happy hour prices And without asking her manager She said no sorry I cant So that whole night was a bunch of sorry Well blue  Im sorry too But we wont be coming back and thanks for charging me  for ranch
