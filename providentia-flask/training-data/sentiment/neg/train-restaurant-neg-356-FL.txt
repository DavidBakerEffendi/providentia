I had lunch with my parents here just yesterday and it was an awful dining experience I used to be a fan but its been quite a while since the last time I came to a Cantina Laredo It was about pm not very busy but I sat and waited (my parents werent there yet) to be helped since there was no hostess when I walked in I sat for  minutes before anyone came by to seat me And yes I saw at least  people look my way That already rubbed me the wrong way The food was also lackluster The table side gauc was bland and lacked salt however the spicy and medium salsa were too salty My dad told our waitress that the spicy salsa was not spicy and that it was too salty and she just laughs and says ok Ill be right back A warm salsa is brought over and I was thinking isnt this the same crap Like warming it up is going to change the saltiness Then when she takes our orders I asked how many shrimp came with the shrimp salad She answers  so I said yes as that is what determined my answer We get our food and after I ate the first shrimp I combed the salad to count the rest and there were only  left I let her know when she came back around but instead of an apology she says my bad Ill get you another one without making eye contact and swiftly turns the other direction I had to go shortly after because I had to get back to work so my parents told me they ended up eating the  shrimp they brought back It pisses me off that they charge   for  pieces of average sized shrimp in limp leaf salad Throwing in extra chunks of canned or leftover pineapple doesnt make up for how overpriced it is Thats all I could think about while I was eating it If I didnt have to go back to work I would have talked to the manager Its so annoying to deal with impolite staff on top of belowaverage food
