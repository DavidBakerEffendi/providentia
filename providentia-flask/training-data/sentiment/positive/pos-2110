Always great! I love breakfast and breakfast is ALWAYS  great here!  Giant pillowy biscuits, fresh organic eggs...had an omelette with spinach, feta cheese, and mushrooms, fried potatoes and coffee, my boyfriend had the meatloaf of the Gods... Oh my... You've got to try this! 
There's usually a little wait for a spot on Saturday but it's well worth it.  
Even walked here by myself once and sat at the cute little diner counter and felt completely comfortable and got just as good service. 
Then there's dessert... For that sweet tooth you give in to on the weekend...great cookies, cheesecakes, and bars- shakes and ice cream.  Can't wait to come back!
