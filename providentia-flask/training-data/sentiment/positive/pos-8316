I stopped by one of my favorite downtown Concord eating spots (2Gals Kitchen) for lunch and as usual everything was delicious! 
Linda is a wiz in the kitchen and she used her magic to get me to eat pickled beets on a burger and to my surprise I enjoyed every bite! 
The staff are always friendly and very accommodation but I did miss Mary's beautiful smile and witty personality with my meal! 

Do yourself a favor and grab a yummy treat from the onsite bakery to take home, but get more than one because it's too good to share!
