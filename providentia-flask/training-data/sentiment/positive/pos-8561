MY FAV INDIAN in AZ!!!! Can't say enough about this place..... it is just spot on... The servers & chefs are SUPER attentive & helpful as well.... I'm in love with so many of their dishes I could eat there EVERY DAY .... Seared Tofu / Samosa Chaat / Idly / Masala Dosa / Chickpea Ceviche / Lentil Soup / Channa / Aloo Gobi / Goan Curry / Paneer anything / Tikka etc etc ... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! They are also expanding into the spot next door and creating a bar area ....
