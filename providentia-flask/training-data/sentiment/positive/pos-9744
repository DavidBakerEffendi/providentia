Love this place - my favorite neighborhood restaurant/bar/coffee--I would have given 5 stars, except it needs to be BIGGER!  Love the food - always fresh.  Cocktails are inventive - even the tea is great!  Still my favorite neighborhood place-- great cocktails and food!  Love the staff and the food!  Brought 8 people here for a luncheon and although small they accommodated us perfectly on the shaded patio.
