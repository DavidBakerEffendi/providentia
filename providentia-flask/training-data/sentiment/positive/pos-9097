This morning I was craving some tea so I decided to stop in here and treat myself, first timer. I had the peppermint hot tea and I noticed on their menu they had vegan options. I asked the gentlemen in the front and he said they are completely a vegetarian restaurant with a lot of vegan options. He also informed me of their vegan lunch options. I came back and tried the smoked tofu sandwich with nut cheese and my gosh, it was SO delicious!!! I give this restaurant 5 stars, I almost wasn't even going to stop in but I am so glad that I did!
