This place constantly delivers. Haven't been here in a couple of months, but the quality of their products and craftsmanship have not waned which is very important in a place full of transients and fads. As always, everything looked heavenly. I sampled several flavors including the flavor of the day: Sweet potato w/ caramel & marshmallow. I opted to get the Banoffee (banana & toffee) and Miso w/ almond toffee which was a perfect balance of sweet and salty. Craving satisfied!
