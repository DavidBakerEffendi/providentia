Oh Parallax, I love you. 

This trendy Tremont spot serves up the best sushi in Cleveland, in my humble opinion. Parallax boasts quality ingredients and chefs preparing your rolls before your eyes with precision. 

Looking for an awesome happy hour spot? 

*The spicy tuna roll, cucumber maki roll, and crab California roll are favorites of the happy hour menu (ranging $4-8). 

*Don't forget to pair it with the bubbly prosecco ($6). There is a full list with any wine or cocktail you desire, similarly priced for HH.

*We also enjoyed the evening's special: a tuna dish served with seaweed and an avocado pur√©e... creamy, fresh, simply perfect.
