Heard about this resto from my coworker and finally got to try it. I was not disappointed! The food was very good and fresh. The soup dumplings never broke and the soup was very good. Ordered tons of different dishes to try but the ones that stood out for me was the: seafood egg whites, the sticky rice roll, scallop soup dumplings, crab soup dumplings, and the steamed pork and chive dumplings. All the dishes that we ordered were good but those ones were the ones that got me hooked. This is definitely not a cheap place to eat if you are expecting a huge portion of dumplings but it is a great place for fresh delicious dumplings. I cannot wait to come back here again!
