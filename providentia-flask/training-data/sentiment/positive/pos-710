Today I visited Uncle Tetsu Angel Hat Cafe.  It was really a wonderful experience overall.  I found that instead of buying constraint to buying 1 cheesecake, I can buy cheesecakes here directly as many as I wanted.  That's a big plus for me as I really enjoy the fluffy cheesy Japanese cheesecake.  But today, I wanted to just have something matcha again.  I wanted to go to Tsujiri, but their AC is not working and it was so warm in there.  So, I decide to go to Angel Hat cafe instead.  I love their second floor seating area.  It is both cozy and spacious with wonderful lighting and I think they have a little stage located in the inne corner of the restaurant.  Maybe it is for some sort of performance I think.  The Japanese girls dressed in French maid customs are always really nice and friendly.  I decided to order the matcha mousse today.   Surprisingly, the mousse came really fast today, and I was happy with the prompt service.  

And today, I was in for a surprise, the lighting suddenly got dimmed and four of the servers dressed in French maid customs started dancing with amazing energy and they all seemed so happy.  My impression is that they really enjoy the dancing part.  Some patrons even got up to mini stage and started dancing.  I felt so much happier after they finished performing.  I got a little size tracked, the matcha mousse was creamy and tasty with a lot of matcha flavour balanced well by the creaminess of the whipped cream topping and red bean paste.  It was just a wonderful treat.  Thank you Uncle Tetsu!
