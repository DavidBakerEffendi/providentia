I come her roughly once a month.  I always sit at the bar alone or with my son.  I'm usually waited on by Linda or Sean and sometimes Jessica.  They are all friendly, knowledgeable, and unpretentious.  

Speaking for the burger I get which I get every time , It's my favorite burger I've ever eaten.  Grilled onions, bacon, and white American cheese.  I could eat one every day.  The fries are always spot on and the cracklins are really good.  Really there isn't a burger that compares in my opinion.  

Highly recommended
