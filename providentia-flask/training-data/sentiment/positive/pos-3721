Union Social Eatery was great!
There was a lot of space for groups there, a big bar, friendly staff, and delicious food. Everything you're looking for in a restaurant.
I also liked the music they played here lol.
I loved the drink specials. They had $5 pints and $5 pimms and ginger (I don't really know what that is, but I can assure you it was delicious and not overly sweet!).
I will definitely be bringing my girlfriends here for a few drinks.

To eat we shared nachos with chicken (heavenly... and I'm not a nacho fan), and calamari which was absolutely delicious (weird, because I'm not a calamari fan either.  It was really good!).
I also enjoyed the wings
The service was wonderful, our server was great.
She had our bills and debit machines at the ready.
She was super quick and organized.

The only thing I didn't love was my pad thai. I found it sour, over vinegary maybe?
It was only the second time I had pad thai so I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste.
It was about $15.

Still, I loved the atmosphere, the appetizers, and the service here. They made a great impression on me and I'm sure to be back!!
