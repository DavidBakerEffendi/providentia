This is the BEST Chinese restaurant I've found in the entire United States. Their cherry sauce cannot be duplicated. They egg rolls are perfection. Their Moo Shu Pork is outstanding. Their chicken dishes always hit the spot. 

I've been eating here since I was 10 years old and I'm so glad this place is still in business 23 years later. Looking at it from the outside, you might not expect it to be such a hidden gem. But it is!

Great food the bigger chains and trendy Chinese spots just cannot compete with! I LOVE this place!
