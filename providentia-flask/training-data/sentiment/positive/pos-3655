Yet another reason for me to love Paradise Bakery. Awhile back right when spring break was coming to an end I was supposed to pick up my friend from Sky Harbor and we were going to drive back to NAU the next day. Unfortunately she is from Vermont and her flight kept getting pushed back more and more due to bad weather so I ended up waiting an extra hour and half at least. Luckily there was a Paradise Bakery right there with some coffee and cookies to keep me happy. Whoever thought of putting them in that terminal is genius! Thank you! 

Also they have this new cookie called a Lemon Fritter...if you like lemon and sugar cookies you need to try it!
