Charlotte is lucky to have a raw, organic, vegan restaurant. Not only is it affordable, it's fantastic. I've been too many times to count and while the service is hit or miss, the food is consistent. My goal is to try everything at least once. Yes, everything is cold. It's raw. There is something precious about local and organic food that connects us back to nature. If you're used to fast food, or heavily salted/sweetened things, this will take some getting used to. But for others who have a more down to earth palette will appreciate the love and care put into each dish and the amazing flavors from simple foods that I could never make for myself in my kitchen. The only con is that they're closed on Sunday.

Fav breakfast: Hola Granola with hemp milk
Fav lunch: Caesar salad (those kale croutons oh my gosh) with a side of cranberry/walnut bread and nut butter.
Fav dinner: Living burrito with local green salad.
Fav dessert: Turtle cake (very small but it's very rich).

I hope Luna's is around for a very long time.
