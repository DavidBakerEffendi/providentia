Ok, so i'm a regular at the Arcadia Pita Jungle. Last night, I was returning something at the mall, and hesitant to get my usual Mediterranean Chicken Salad there {rather than calling it in and picking it up on my way home}. But was starving, so went for it. 

YOU GUYS, the prices are better here and the salad was 10x better! The sweet lady working the counter seriously packed it with goodies and it was absolutely heaven! The salad was definitely made with love and I could taste it! If you're looking for a healthy place to dine in the mall, this is it. I also LOVE their mixed beans. So naturally, I ordered a side of them too. 

Next time i'm at the mall and hungry, you better believe i'm returning! & hopefully the sweet lady who was working this time, is working again! (9/21/16 at 7 PM).
