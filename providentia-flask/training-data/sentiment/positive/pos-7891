Ahh the roti, the curries, the spice!  I can't really pimp this place enough, or better than the plethora of solid reviews it already has. This is a sublime Indian experience, the curries are all made with fresh herbs and the rotis are giant. Watch out for anything beyond medium spice.

What are you waiting for?! Go get a friggin roti!
