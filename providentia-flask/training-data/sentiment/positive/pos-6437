Avenue B is my favorite special occasion restaurant for several reasons: The food is consistently delicious, the atmosphere is romantic without being too stuffy, and the menu changes constantly, so I can always try something new. Chef Chris prides himself on "sophisticated simplicity" and that's exactly what you get here. Nothing too over-complicated. Nothing that seems to be trying too hard. Just good, well-thought out dishes. Period. 

I'm happy that they expanded their dining room. It takes away from the intimate feel a bit, but it makes it easier to get reservations at a reasonable time. 

Dinner starts off with a basket of fresh bread and whatever the special house-made butter is that night. Expect some interesting flavor combos like kale/honey. On my recent Avenue B visit I ordered the most tender melt in your mouth Hanger Steak that was served over a flavor explosion of mushroom mac and cheese ($35). Dessert was a croissant bread pudding with salted popcorn ice cream. Divine!

If there's nothing on the rotating chalkboard menu that catches your eye, do yourself a favor and order the Wagyu Meatloaf ($25). You may be thinking, "Amy, $25 is a little steep for something my mom made for me as a kid." Well, I don't know your mom, but I can guarantee her meatloaf sucked in comparison to this distinctive, delightful, enticing, exquisite dish. This meatloaf will change your life (or, at the very least, cause you to over-use adjectives).

Service is always fantastic. The corkage fee recently raised from $5 to $8, which I think is a little steep. There's free corkage on Sundays, though!
