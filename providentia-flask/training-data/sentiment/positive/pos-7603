I know that Olive Garden gets a hard time for not being authentic Italian but that's ok with me. I love their soups and Pittsburgh is the only region that still has the wedding soup and that's my favorite. The "Creat Your Own Pasta" is my standard go to. I like the flexibility and most importantly the price. I also really like the new pesto sauce they offer. It's much lighter than the other sauce I get. 

All in all, Olive Garden is still a winner in my book for decent, quick food.
