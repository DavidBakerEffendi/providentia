After the change from Pizza Place to Sugar & Ice, I just had to have their sundae because it was so delicious but pricey. Well you do get what you paid for, excellent food, top service and classy ambiance without the rowdy drunk obnoxious tourists. 

I wanted to order the cheesecake sundae but they discontinued the strawberry gelato but she was nice enough to change the gelato flavor for just for one time. The place just streams 5 star and the waterfall in the background is the first thing you notice when walking inside and patio seating was great to relax admire the landscaping makes you feel you aren't in the desert.
