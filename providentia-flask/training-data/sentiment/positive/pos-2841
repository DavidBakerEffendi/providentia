Argentina..the land of the beef , good soccer and the home of the super hot Italian looking girls that have that latino flavor. Yes..you can say Im a big fan of their country, food and of course woman,

This spot is legit. Owned, managed and operated by argentinians. Nice people, very personable and super sweet. From the guy behind the counter , to the lady in the cashier this place rocks. And their service is great as well. You are welcomed fast, serviced faster and catered the same way.

Their steak sandwich is to die for, and if you never tried morcila(blood sausage) this is the place to do it. If argentinians have mastered something , is soccer and BBQ. This guys can cook the steak, sausage , etc so perfect that its an orgasmic experience. Trust me ..try it. Go all out on the cow!

If you don't feel like a whole big meal, you can order sandwiches and also empanadas . Both of them OWN. They packed them with meat so you get a lot of flavor from every bite. Try a "triple de miga" or an "empanada de carne"

You like garlic? You like oil? Like flavor? Add TONS of chimichurri to whatever you are eating. Don't get the fancy packed one..ask them about their home made chimichurri .I tell people that God came down on the 8th day and created chimichurri . That's how good it is .There not a single person that have tried it that didn't like it. Mix it with everything, most likely you will get addicted

On the right side of the place there are a couple counters and refrigerators where you can buy sodas, and products from southamerican countries. Don't expect a huge selection, but more of the "top 3" from each country. Pretty convenient if you want to take some stuff home.

I like this place and its one of its kind. Good people, central location,good food, good service and good prices .If you want to experience the whole thing..try to go when argentina is playing an important soccer game, or a night where they are playing tango. You will enjoy it .
