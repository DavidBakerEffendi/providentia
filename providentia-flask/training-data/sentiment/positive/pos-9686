I'm 30 years old and this was the best breakfast I've ever had my whole life. My husband also agrees the best. I had the fig jam and goat cheese omelette and it was everything I've ever wanted in a breakfast. My only complaint is the huge portions which really isn't even a complaint. 
The dining area is one huge dining room so it does get a bit loud but it's worth it.
