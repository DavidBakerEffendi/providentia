An absolute treasure!   This place is amazing!  A friend of mine lives closeby and recommended that we try it, so one rainy afternoon we went there and it was incredible!  The building is sort of odd(former bank), but there is street parking in front, and plenty of parking in the back.  The hostess greeted us with a smile and sat us right away.  The server was amazing, the food came out quickly, and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious.  They have a very good selection and variety of food for every taste, and you feel like you are in a place that should cost way more than it actually does to enjoy wonderful meals there.  We plan on becoming regulars!!
