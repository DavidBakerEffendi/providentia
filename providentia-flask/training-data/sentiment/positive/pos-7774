Every time we're on or near the strip, someone in my car mentions Art of Flavors. I've been reading some of Amanda M's comments on this place and she made it sound so good that I had to try it. Now I'm hooked!!! No matter how full I am from dinner, I will always say yes to AOF! Great variety of unique flavors. One of today's flavors of the day was Lemon Poundcake - damn, taste just like an ice cold poundcake! For you folks that are lactose intolerant, the sorbetto is just as good! If I were to pick only one thing on the menu though, it would have to be the Spiced Hot Chocolate. Shawn H. had mentioned to me several times, that it was the best he ever had. I agree. It's like drinking hot gelato - soooo goooood!! The negative: one demitasse just isn't enough!

On the agenda for next time: gelato panini with gorgonzola gelato!
