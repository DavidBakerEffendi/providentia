This was the most incredible place and food! I've heard so much about Luna's and it's even BETTER than everyone says! I absolutely love the place, decor is incredible and tendu, hipster, gorgeous. But raw vegan whole foods... If you wonder the answer is yes!! Yes you want it!! We had the basil Avocado sandwich which was so beautifully seasoned, fantastic bread, perfect per portions. Also had the kale lemonade. You could taste each ingredient... So interesting and awesome! Broccoli salad was nothing like what you're used to, 100 times better!! Oh I can't wait to come back and try each thing!
