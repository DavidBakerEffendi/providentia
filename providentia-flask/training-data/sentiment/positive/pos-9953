Delicious Mediterranean lunch! My sister and I shared the lamb shish kabob with 3 sides for $18.95. The lamb was so tender and very flavorful. The cabbage slaw is crunchy, tangy, and slightly sweet with the green apple and corn kernels. A nice contrast with the hummus and rice. The chunky bread was incredible to dip into the complimentary oil and vinegar starter. 

Service was great, the waiters are dressed very nice and the interior tables are dressed in white tablecloths with glitzy lighting. The outside patio has a wonderful atmosphere with romantic music, beautiful flower planters, and nice quality tables and chairs.
