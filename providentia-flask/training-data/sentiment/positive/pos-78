Wow.  I read the reviews and decided to try this.  I pulled into the strip mall parking lot, saw the location and almost drove away.  Good thing I didn't.  

I had the turkey sandwich and every.single.ingredient was 5 stars.  The bacon was crazy crisp, the onion marmelade (or whatever it was called) was tasty and not overwhelming, the avocados where appropriately portioned, the turkey was real shaved turkey and not deli crap, and the bread was perfectly toasted.  

I also has the peanut butter brownie bar.  forget about it.  awesome.  i'm just glad i don't live near there.  i'd be 20 lbs overweight.
