I went here for an unforgettable birthday with my boyfriend. The service was fantastic and the food was divine. Loved everything. Had the lamb, the chef's special appetizer roll and short ribs and lobster bisque. Since it was my birthday they gave us complementary dessert truffles (to die for). 

Everything was amazing. The lamb, which we had med-rare, was juicy and tender. I've never had a better piece of meat. We got a bowl of lobster meat which had us confused.... until our service poured hot bisque in the bowl at our table. Such a delightful presentation! Each dish not only tasted terrific, but looked beautiful. 

I want to try everything on this menu! Definitely our new go-to spot to bring our friends from out of town.
