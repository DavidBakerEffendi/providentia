Came in last night for dinner after bookmarking this place awhile back. The atmosphere of the place definitely makes it seem more expensive than it actually is. It's a big main room with a bar and a side room but the room is used sparingly so it gives it a really big and open feel which is pretty nice. Our server was Jason and he was great he was very interested in our little baby and was quick with the order refills and making conversation. We wanted to try some different plates so we got the calamari and scallops for appetizers. The calamari was pretty basic but my gf asked for remoulade which I thought was better then the marinara. The scallops were pretty good but I don't feel you get enough since half the pieces are the rice. For our actual menu I got the chicken wings and she got the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. The chicken wings were alright but like some people have said I think they would be better with some crisp in them. Pasta was quote "soooo good" but since I'm not a fan of spicy I opted out. For dessert we of course got the trio sampler and the creme brûlée was delicious although the flourless cake id really rename "fudge" all in all we will come back eventually. Cheap food, expensive feel, and great service.
