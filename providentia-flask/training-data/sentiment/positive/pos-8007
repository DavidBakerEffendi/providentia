This is my FAVORITE restaurant! Everything at B Spot is delicious and worth the price. 

Burgers I've tried: Lola, Thin Lizzy, Fat Doug, and Reuben (a smasher special). They were all great. You must at Lola fries too. I'm addicted to the salt and light rosemary flavor. My favorite milkshake is the chocolate banana marshmallow, which is think and has roasted marshmallows on top. 

I think what makes these burgers so amazing is the blend of meat that Chef Symon has created. One of a kind, just like Cleveland. Service is always quick and getting you on your way. This restaurant is not designed for a long meal.. and that's why I love it!

PS- I'm not a beer drinker, so no opinions here on that menu.
