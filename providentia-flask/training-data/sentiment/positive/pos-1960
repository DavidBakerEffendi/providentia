This was a random stop on our way back from Arizona... and it was a brilliant choice.  I wasn't expecting much, seeing that it looks like Korean fast food, seat yourself and they bring menus to you. 

But, when the food came out..... omg, delicious! My Kalbi plate came w rice n salad w a nice sesame vinaigrette. The short ribs were fatty, juicy, and had a nice grilled sear. My hubs had the spicy pork w tofu n kimchi... awesome dish. I'm salivating thinking about this dish. I love that they don't shy from fatty meats or oversaucing so long as the flavor balance is right.

Friendly service, east parking... absolutely great little place.
