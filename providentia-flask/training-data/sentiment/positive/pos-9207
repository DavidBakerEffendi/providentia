How it's even remotely possible this place doesn't have five stars is beyond me, I've eaten here at least a dozen times and every single time the food
Was perfect, and the service was impeccable. The clam chowder is delicious, the shrimp cocktail is food of the gods and the wine selection is perfect. If I could eat here everyday I would.
