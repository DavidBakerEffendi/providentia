Really good bento boxes! I had the chicken katsu bento box and it came within ten minutes. You also get an extra complimentary soup with noodles and miso soup, all for $11.99. The plaza does get busy so it might be hard to find parking, but other than that I would go back to try more of the menu as they offer many Korean and Japanese dishes.
