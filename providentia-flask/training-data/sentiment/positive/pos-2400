Having recently moved to Arizona we were looking for a top rate bakery and we have certainly found one here. We have repeatedly been there and have bought their breads, rolls, pasteries, cakes and pies. Everything is excellent. The store has seating for those who want to eat there. The store is clean and staff very polite and attentive. A great place.
