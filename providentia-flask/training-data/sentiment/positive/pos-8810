I frequent here atleast 2 times a week. It's the cutest 50's styled diner like restaurant. It's got real good quality character. They have the best breakfast in town as well as there lunch menu. Best chicken club, roast beef sandwich, the soups of the day. I honesty have loved everything I have ever gotten from there. The service is great! Only problem is I wish the place was open for dinner to. Who doesn't want to eat all day breakfast and chicken clubs for dinner :) they close at 3pm daily.
