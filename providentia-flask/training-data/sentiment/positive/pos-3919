I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant!!! Amazing service and phenomenal sushi, I'll definitely be back. 

We ordered the burning tuna roll, dragon roll, rainbow roll, salmon lover, toro belly nigiri and the chef gave us a complimentary jalape√±o popper and delicious orange creamsicle dessert. Great music and wonderfully clean too. Love this place!
