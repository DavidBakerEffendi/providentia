I'll admit it... This is probably the best AYCE sushi restaurant in Calgary at the moment! The chef use to work for Shibuya Izakaya and I guess decided to open up his own place down south. The interior is very nicely designed with open concept kitchen. The menu itself is VERY extensive and has so many different hot and cold dishes. The few items that stuck out for a Japanese restaurant was that they were serving Chinese items like Siu Mai, Har Gow and Ginger beef. For a sushi restaurant they serve bomb dim sum, surprising.

I only went for lunch and the place was still kinda busy for 1pm. The service was quick and the food came QUICK!! Meaning Takoyaki balls came out within 3mins of placing the order. Maybe it was because the tables were starting to clear out but great for us! The food is very well presented and attention to detail is not lost. Every dish leaving the kitchen was perfectly plated and garnished regardless of the quantity of the items. 

This AYCE sushi place is a definite must try especially for the dinner deluxe menu where there is beef tataki!!! Eating just a few orders of this dish would pay for your entire meal!!! Happy munching!

Must order:
1. Oiishi deluxe
2. Hand cones (they do not cheap out on the meat within them)
3. Takoyaki
