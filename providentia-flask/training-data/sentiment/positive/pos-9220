been waiting, and waiting, and WAITING to try this place out, yesterday I finally had the chance! 
I was at my limit for coffee for the day, so I figured I would come in to see what option I had, i was a bit taken back by the décor of the café, it was so simple, but it felt absolutely powerful to be standing inside this café, i know it sounds super weird to say that but, i literally felt the power of Odin running through me. i grabbed a menu and checked out my options, settled on a cup of berry tea, this tea was super hot when it came into my hands, and i had nothing but time to kill so i went and grabbed a seat and took the whole atmosphere of the café in. the bathroom situation is a bit odd, its 4 separate stalls shared by a communal hand washing station with faucets that have a single handle really close to the ledge of the wall vanity. when i was able to drink my hot tea, all I could think of was DAMN this is a Damn good cup of tea. 
i was boosted by this fact for the rest of the day, all i could think about was how good my cup of tea was. the place is spotless, extremely well lit, and the staff are super friendly. very very good transit options, and some street parking. 
i cant wait to be in this neighborhood to be reunited with my powerful tea. 
AND a nice little fun fact at the end of the review, the tea bag was not a traditional tea-bag, it was one of those hand made bags complete with a knot at the top. 
very very happy and i cant waiiiiiiiiiit to go back :)
