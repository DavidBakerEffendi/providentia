Love the prime rib.

This place is classic old Vegas. I don't think a damn thing has changed in this place since the day it opened. I love the smell of the wood burning and the meat that slow cooks over it. 

When ever we have company from out of town and they want a steak, this is where we go. This is where we go when I want a steak for that matter. 

Don't miss this hidden gem.
