Went today and invited a few of my friends to join me in an epic meal.

This time, I went to see if the food was consistent and to gauge how different the omakase was, a month later.  

First of all, I want to say EVERYONE that I had with me loved it.  They unanimously agreed it was the best sushi they've ever had and the entire dinner was filled with sounds of Mmmms and Ohmahgawds.  I think some agreed it was the best meal they've had.  

There were a few overlapping items for me, but it was different enough for me to be satisfied.  

Consistency!  It was just as good as the first time!  

This place makes every other sushi restaurant in Arizona seem like supermarket fare.  

Finally, a few people may think it is too expensive for a meal.  
Here's my take.  We had six courses with a dessert for a total of 7 courses.  
The second course was six different small portions of completely different items.  If you're counting the six pieces of nigiri in course number 6, that is a lot of different dishes and items to prepare.  Osetra caviar, huuuuge pieces of fois gras, nigerian tiger prawn, giant clam, toro, Kumamoto oysters, black sea bass... were just a FEW of the ingredients in our long list of bites.  That is sooo worth 125$.  

Best deal and best meal in Arizona.  Period.
