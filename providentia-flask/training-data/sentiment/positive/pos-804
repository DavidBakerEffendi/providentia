Have loved the Venetian for many years now, stayed here at least 4 times.  It's certainly not the newest place on the Strip, but it has a good casino, the best poker room in town, and a bunch of great places to eat.  Also, Venetian has nice casual options such as Grand Lux (the best 24 hour coffee shop in Vegas) or Public House in addition to the expensive places.  There is a requisite food court, and choices on the canal shops.  Lots of dining options, and some excellent ones at that.

The rooms are larger than typical, with the sunk in living area and large couches.  You can easily sleep another person on the couch.  My buddies and I have done that on more than one occasion.  

The staff is excellent, and the front desk works people through in very quick fashion during busy times.  

The location is solid as well, right across from Mirage, near Caesars, and if you want to gamble lower, a short walk to Harrah's and other places that generally have cheaper gambling.  Highly recommend the Venetian.
