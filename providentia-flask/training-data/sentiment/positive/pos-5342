I love this place specifically for the Butter Chicken Roti.  It's insanely good, a hearty portion and can vary in spice depending on your mood.  

I love that getting take is quick, efficient and almost transactional.  They aren't wasting your time when you are in a hurry.  

I discovered recently, that should you decide to stay and eat in the restaurant they are the sweetest and most considerate hosts around!  I should try more dishes off the menu but at least have a roti here!!!
