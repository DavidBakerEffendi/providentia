My favorite thing about this place is that it's 24/7/365!!! It's hard to find vegan restaurants and most close earlier than regular restaurants. Service was great, employees were very friendly! Food was really good! We had the daily brunch offerings that were protein pancakes and chipotle burritos. Both were delicious! Coffee was great too and I love that they serve a 32 oz large! Will definitely be back!
