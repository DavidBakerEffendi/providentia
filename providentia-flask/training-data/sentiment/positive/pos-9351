Great for date nights, or just hanging out with friends, Chada Thai has become one of my favorite spots in town. The space is cozy and intimate, with lighting that's dim but still bright enough so you can see your food and music that provides enough ambient noise to entertain without forcing you to raise your voice to carry a conversation.

If you're a fan of Brussels sprouts, the Pad Hed ($8) is a must try. The silky smooth quality of the sauce had hints of sweetness that enhanced the savoriness of the mushrooms, lotus root and Brussels sprouts.

A challenger for best dish at Chada Thai (at least from the ones I've tried) is the Moo Hong ($8). Tender cubes of pork were covered in a thick, subtley sweet and acidic sauce. I have no idea how they develop these flavors, but they're unlike anything I've had in town.

Wanting more heat, we tried the Nua nam tok ($12) -- charbroiled rib eye with rice powder, onion, cilantro, chili powder, fish sauce, and lime juice. Even ordering it as a mildly spicy dish it still produced a good bit of heat. The kind of heat that lingered in my mouth and lips and made my nose run.

On the more mild side, the Mussamun curry ($9) impressed with its depth and complexity. The pork in the Kana moo krob ($9) was reminiscent of the dish Lechon with it's crispy and crackly exterior, while the drunken noodles, chicken, and sauce in the Pad kee mao ($9) was perfectly balanced.

With dishes that will please those that love heat and those wanting a milder experience of Thai food, Chada delivers the best of both worlds in a spot perfect for locals and worth the drive as a dining destination for tourists.
