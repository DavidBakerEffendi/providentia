My husband and I came here once before with some friends and loved it. This place allows you to order mixed bags and share with the whole table! Now I've been to the other seafood places similar to this place and they don't do the mix bags. For those that don't know when I say mix bags it means you pay $70 you get 3 choices of seafood, corn, potatoes and sausages and fries. There are other mix bags options and different prices of course. Other similar places you order the seafood individually and yeah you can share but it's not the same.

They come out with 1 big bag and rip it open on a platter to share amongst the table, I'm telling when I come to Vegas I like to bring our group of friends here. It's definitely an experience for them.
