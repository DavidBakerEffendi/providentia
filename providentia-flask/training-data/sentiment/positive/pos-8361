Great time on a Saturday evening. Chose this place since they had a Saturday HH. Devon (sorry if I miss spelled it) our server was awesome! She took such great care of our table. Go see her! Delish chips, salsa and guacamole.  Loved the hot mango margi. Nice patio/atmosphere as well. My only negative...it's not your super cheap happy hour place. The larger size margaritas ended up being $16 and that happy hour price...
