Let me first say I love Indian food & my daughter's tennis coach is from Punjabi so we know good Indian...this is legit. I had the chicken tikka & my husband ordered the potato dosa. We ended up sharing each others meals bc it was so delicious. I will return to this location for sure on our next visit to Vegas. What a find that we literally just stumbled upon. Keep up the good work Curry Pot.
