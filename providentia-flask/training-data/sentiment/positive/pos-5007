While this may be a good drive from the Charlotte area, about 15-20 min, it's well worth it. If you're a BBQ fan & you're looking to find some locally owned places with some of the best stuff, then head towards Gastonia to check it out.

This place is always packed, but you shouldn't have to wait too long to grab a table. It's a small building, so you're crammed in there with plenty of other people clamoring to get their hands on good BBQ. I've been here plenty of times, & have really only looked at the menu once, so that tells you just order the BBQ plate. For about $5, you'll get an order of BBQ, slaw, & hushpuppies, & it will be one of the greatest lunch time meals you'll have. The BBQ, combined with their homemade sauce is out of this world. Taking into consideration both the BBQ & sauce, this is the best BBQ joint I've ever been to.

Not only is the food 2nd to none, but the atmosphere makes it all that much better. It's locally owned & still has that personal touch feel about it. The walls are covered with ACC memorabilia, mainly the good ole Tar Heels, which gives it a hometown feel as well.

Everything about Kyle Fletcher's is great, except maybe the fact that it's cash only. I have no idea why they haven't given in to the debit card take over, so just remember to bring your cash with you.

Other than the cash only, this is the best BBQ joint in the area that I've been to. I can't see it getting much better anywhere else, but if you've got a suggestion let me know cause I love me some BBQ. So head out of the big city for once & grab some small town BBQ that will make you glad you made the trip.
