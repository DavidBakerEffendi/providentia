This hidden new treasure is all the way in Bradford. I went in and had a great experience. 

The place is clean and classy. 
Servers: friendly and sweet. 
Food:   Falafels were nothing like I'v ever had before. Served over hummus and some side fresh pita.  Chicken skewers were juicy and delicious. You get a pickled cabbage and sauces to go with everything !!! 

They cater as well !!!
