So excited another dog friendly restaurant opened and the food and service is amazing.  Had dinner ...we all tried something different, everything was very good, large portions, reasonable prices. We also enjoyed the house brew.  Nate was a very attentive server...on top of everything....he was on the spot.  Cant wait to come back with our furbabies.
