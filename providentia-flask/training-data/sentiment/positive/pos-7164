On our way out of the airport and had the most delicious mixed green salad with grilled chicken. Of course ordered smash burger fries and they didn't dissapoint. Have been a huge fan of their salads - use the freshest ingredients and love their balsamic salad dressing. Portions are generous and I remain a fan!
