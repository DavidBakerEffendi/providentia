I can't wait to return!! Talk about a 5 star, upscale experience and this is your place. I went for restaurant week. Out reservation was at 5:45, however I arrived about 30 minutes early and they went ahead and sat me as I waited for my party to arrive. The Shrimp amuse-bouche was really nice. I used my dinner roll to soak up the remainder of the juice and that made it even better. The pork was super tender and full of flavor. The Mac & Cheese looked like it may be overcooked, however, it was nice and cheesy and paired well with the pork. My Favorite was the dessert. That Apple Galette was delicious!! Nice and flury with the apples sliced thinly and baked into it. And the Hazelnut ice cream was delightful paired with it. I never had Hazelnut Ice Cream before but I am officially sold! I asked for my Ice Cream on the side. They brought it out in a Martini glass. I quickly moved it to my plate. Our waiter was very attentive and shared lots of information with us. We didn't know that they changed their menu every 6 or so weeks but they just made us even more excited to return.
