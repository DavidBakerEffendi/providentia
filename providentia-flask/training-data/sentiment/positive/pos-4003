Was told to go here and I did the other day for the first time... THE best Chinese food EVER!!! Make sure to get the pork eggrolls, I guarantee no other place makes them this great. I also got the orange chicken with chow mein and my husband got the broccoli stir fry.. Everything delicious!!!! This is the only Chinese food restaurant I will go to from now on.. Just wish they delivered :(
