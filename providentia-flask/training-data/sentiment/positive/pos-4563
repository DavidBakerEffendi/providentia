I have been to this place multiple times since my first review of it and I really do not understand what is going on for them to be getting so many bad reviews.. I always do the AYCE wings and start off with the spicy BBQ sauce which I think is awesome.

The servers are all right on top of refilling my wings as soon as I get down to my last leg.. The last time I was there with a friend of mine they recognized us and would bring out the next basket before we finished the one in front of us. 

In my own wingy opinion this place stops on Wingstops Tiny wings and Buffalo wild wings over priced for the atmosphere wings.
