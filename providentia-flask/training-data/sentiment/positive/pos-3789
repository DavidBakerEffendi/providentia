Wonderful fit for Mill Ave considering there was no other breakfast option. Tables were close together and could be easily pushed together in the event you have an encounter (get it!) with a stranger and want to become better acquainted. The restaurant was well staffed with friendly people striking up conversations and answering questions. 
Plus the food was terrific. (It reminded me a lot of Local Breeze: fresh, local, healthy.) The coffee is local and comes from Press Coffee. Delicious and it comes with free refills. They also had a large assortment of baked goods and I'm pretty sure I saw someone with a mimosa. I welcome NCounter to Mill Ave and wish them nothing but the best.
