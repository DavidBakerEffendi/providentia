I was quite impressed with this fast casual Indian-ish place. As other have noted, the interior is gorgeous - modern, clean and open to their kitchen so you can see what's going on. 

It's a similar concept to Chipotle - you pick a protein, a rice choice, a side (mostly lentil based), a naan - it's a LOT of food for about $8-9. I picked chicken, yellow daal and regular naan. Things are definitely mild in terms of spice but you can add their "fire" sauce which reminded me of a vindaloo (vinegar based).

The workers seemed to be really nice and the place was spotless when I stopped. Even better, they have an industrial handwasher for you to use - I think every place, every where should have these as people are dirty as hell. (I also think restrooms should have a "did not wash hands" alarm) 

In terms of food - really quite good. I've had FAR worse Indian at more expensive prices for sure. My chicken was lean and tasty and their naan is absolutely great. They even had a respectable green chutney for their samosa bites. 

For fast food, this place is a winner. They only have two locations now but I would heartily support a third location in Milwaukee!
