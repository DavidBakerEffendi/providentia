I always see this place but never stop in. I finally did and was very pleased. The menu is pretty straight forward and posted all over the walls. Despite what you order you're getting a carafe of wine (red or white), salad or soup, garlic bread, and pasta with marinara, and finish the meal off with a cappuccino. I ordered Steak Pizzaiola. It was a huge sirloin (big enough for 2) covered with a tomato and vegetable sauce. The meat was tender and I left feeling nice and stuffed. I will certainly be back.
