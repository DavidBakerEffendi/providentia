This place has some amazing food! The service is great...we had Maria this last time and she was fantastic.  Cute PJ's too!! Oh yeah, the staff wears pajamas,  love it   my boyfriend and I played giant Connect Four  (I kicked butt) but that's great to have too.  Only complaint is the parking...not so bad in the early am, but when I went for lunch holy moley good luck finding a spot. I'll be coming back again and again and again
