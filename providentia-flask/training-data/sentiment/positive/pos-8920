I've been here a few times now but every experience I've had has been excellent. The service is fast and friendly but not bothersome. They really understand that as diners we are trying to enjoy the food without too much interruption. The menu is not too expansive but the few things they have are done quite well.
I like to start off with yellowtail sashimi. With 8 pieces costing $12 it's a pretty good deal. Additionally the fish was a nice temperature and tasted fresh and tender. Each roll that I've tried has also been a delight. First off the Oh My God roll has a smokey eel flavor that is not overwhelming but compliments the rest of the ingredients well. The H3 has a spicy kick that most japanese restaurants don't have, it might be a korean thing. The caterpillar roll is melt in your mouth from the fresh avocado to the eel. I've had the chance to try the mango crunch roll which has a sweetness to it mostly from eel sauce, the mango I found was a bit tart and made the roll a delightfully light flavor. The oasis is covered with cucumber instead of their signature purple rice, it's cooling and refreshing for summer, but I'm not a huge fan of that much tuna. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone that has a standard for raw fish.
