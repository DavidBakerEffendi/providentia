I found MadisonTap when I was searching for restaurants offering "deals" on Yelp. It was a bit difficult to figure out all the details on the web, it appears they have an incomplete website and social media page. But, I figured, why not? 

I was definitely not let down. My dining partner is pescatarian but we still found many options on their small dining menu. We ordered shishito peppers, fried mushrooms, poutine (no glaze = veggie friendly), and the bruschetta. We ordered the food at the bar and then sat at our table, where it was brought to us. 

The food came out one item as a time (maybe 1-2 minutes apart ). This worked out for us as we were sharing everything. The peppers were great. I had never had a dish like that before but they were very mild (my dining partner compared them to pea pods) and served with a delicious sauce. Mushrooms also great -- addictive vinaigrette. Poutine was indulgent. The dish we were least impressed with was the bruschetta, the bread was toasted but cold/maybe stale? No trouble though, the servings were huge and delicious food was plentiful. 

I love the tap takeover idea. They were wrapping up Karbeb4 in our visit. The bartender offered a sample or two to each of us before we ordered our pint. Great service. Aesthetics are great, very clean and sleek looking.
