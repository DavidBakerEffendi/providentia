Often times some of those organic places stinks of hipsters and overpriced food. The Pickled Peach defines organics as a broad reaching to all circles and is absolutely competitively priced compared to their processed lunch neighbors. I've never once been disappointed in the service or the food. Fresh is an understatement for all of their menu items. There's even a giant board honestly listing where every ingredient comes from. It's the type of meal that your palate, body and wallet will thank you for. 

Let's also mention that on my second trip in there, regardless of its generally busy lunch patrons coming in, they already remembered my name. 

Wonderful teas, coffees and sweets, also. I've tried most of their sandwiches and the shaved beet and honeyed goat cheese while although simple is perfectly executed and absolutely delicious. You're going to want to splurge on one of the ever-changing fresh soups made daily also as a tasty partner.
