Loved this place!! I don't remember ever having such excellent service anywhere. At this place, if your drink is at half, it gets filled. Not necessarily by the wait staff in charge of your table either. It gets filled by the first person to walk past and see it.  I have been here twice already and I am always pleased with the service and the food.  You get a good portion of food for what you pay for, and it's always great quality.  I always get their chicken n' waffles with strawberry butter and OMG is it simply amazing!  The waffle is hot, fresh and flaky.  The chicken is hot, juicy and fresh.  I have never received an over cooked and burnt piece of chicken. It's a good place, take your family here once on a weekend, worth it.
