Second time back in a week and a half. I'm super happy my husband had us come back here last Tuesday!

Even though Tacos el Gordo is closer and more well known, I am now a HUGE fan of this place! More so than Gordo. The meat here is much better. I've tried the asada, cecina, pastor, lengua, barbacoa and carnitas. Every single taco is better than Tacos el Gordo. The meat isn't oily/greasy, and their salsas are great, too. The tortillas were just the right size for the amount of meat- which was overflowing. 

When I came here last week with my husband, we each got the 4 taco combo. It comes with rice and beans, which I don't usually eat, but they were great. The rice was super fluffy and flavorful. The beans were creamy. I liked it, and thought them to be of the same quality as Lindo Michocan.... Maybe even a little better.

This time around, I got the 4 taco combo, little T got a small Windy City fry with just fries and pastor (hold the pineapple, please) and we also shared a side of chips and salsa. I love the salsa selections. The red is my favorite- super spicy! The chips were good too, not greasy and crunchy. 

We came around 6 and there was steady traffic in and out, a combination of sit down and to-go orders. We didn't have to wait in line but we did have a bit of a wait to get our food. I'm good with that- it means it's fresh. And I know it is because you see them make it right behind the counter. 

T's fries were so fresh and crispy! No pineapple either- thanks guys! My 4 plate combo was awesome, as it was before. 

As stated before, I'm REALLY glad my husband had us go back. We'll be regulars here for sure!
