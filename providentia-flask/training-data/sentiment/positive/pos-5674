I got take out from here one night for me and my wife. The food was awesome so I just wanted to give these new guys some love on Yelp. We got the cheese appetizer, if you're like my wife and loves anything cheese you'll go nuts over this.

I also wanted to add that the decor is nice. I know this means things to many people...personally I would eat out of a dumpster if the food was awesome, but that's me.
