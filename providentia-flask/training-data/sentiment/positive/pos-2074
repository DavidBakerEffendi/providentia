I know I have reviewed this location before. However, I do really like it. So here is another one. It seems that they have fully redone all their Staff. OK that is why they were closed for awhile. 
Anyway, we got a great coupon for and entree. So I called in the order for pick up. When I got there I added on the Crab Puffs. We have always really liked them here, they sure seem like they have real crab in them. So there you go.
This time around we ordered Kung Pao chicken which was very good, with lovely crisp snow peas. As well as Sweet and Sour Chicken several sauses on the side.
It was hot and fresh. Very good as always.
We were extra Greatful for the coupon as well.
Everything is still nice and clean inside. But, I took it to go.
