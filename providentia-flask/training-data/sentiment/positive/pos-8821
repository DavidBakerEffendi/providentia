yay! I've always loved this Pizza Hut, been coming here since I was little. 

came today and it was just as i remembered it. pizza was good..those cheesy crusts and pan pizza :D

our server was great, she was attentive and gave us drink refills when we were getting low, and she got one of our orders wrong but she brought it to us knowing already and she had fixed it and told us it'd come soon and that we can have the wrong cheese pizza that they made for free if we wanted it!!!!!! hehehe that made me happy. she also auto-applied one of the coupons that we're going around at this time that we didn't know about :) 

5* !!!!!
