Back in home in Washington State, I always loved Papa Murphy's.  But since I left in 2007, I wasn't sure if I would ever see a Papa Murphy's.  But after a few searches, there happens to be one, just a few miles from me.  I was really stoked.  

Located on Decatur and Craig, right across the parking lot of Albertsons is a small and hidden Papa Murphy's.  In a way, it was convenient for me, since I live off Decatur.  But if you live in the north end, it's in a pretty open space and right off the road of Craig.  Enough parking, but small waiting area.  Inside, it's well decorated for people to understand what's going on.  Decent color scheme, and a bench to sit and wait.  

I got there and looked at the menu, which is right at the counter.  Ordered a Chicago Style Pizza and the pricing was decent.  I notice that they have some pizza all prepped out in the fridge they have.  Some customers came in and ordered, a pepperoni pizza.  The cashier turned around and pulled out the pizza and the next minute, you got a happy customer walking out with a prepped out pepperoni pizza.  Unfortunately I had to stay a little bit longer for my pizza to be made.  But it didn't really take them long to make it.  I was probably in and out in 5 minutes.  

Went home, popped it in the oven, and 30 minutes later, we got a very well made Chicago Style Pizza.  The crust was very good as I remembered it.  Just the right amount of meat and cheese.  It made my day.  

Overall, I would recommend this, if you like Papa Murphy's.  They have good customer service and friendly.  They are quick on making your order.  You can also call ahead of time, so when you get there, its all prepped and ready.  The end result, a pizza that will taste great out of the oven.
