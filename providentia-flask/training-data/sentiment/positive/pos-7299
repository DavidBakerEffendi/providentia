Came for Valentine's Day and although we were 40mims late we weren't given any hassle about it and the service was amazing. Enjoyed every dish we had and although a little on the pricey side, everything was really well made and had no complaints. Would definitely come back here again and try their different menu options AND the lychee creme brûlée was to die for!
