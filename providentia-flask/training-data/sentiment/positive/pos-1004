Very good food! The sesame chicken is perfect. I've also tried the beef and broccoli. Their fried rice and noodles are perfect. It seems like they actually care about the food that they make. Their cook time is very fast compared to other places. 
Portions are smaller than other Chinese fast good restaurants but the quality is much better. 
Very clean environment.  Very nice workers. In a very convenient location. I wish they would deliver!
