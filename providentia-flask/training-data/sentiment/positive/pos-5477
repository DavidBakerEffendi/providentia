This place is the best bet. The hotel and Resort is amazing.  I'm really not much of a gambler. So I like to walk around and enjoy the hotel. As with many of the hotels in Vegas, there are gambling tables, restaurants buffets, shops and shows. But the nation is an excellent place if you consider the service the place is top notch. Although the place is huge I did not feel overwhelmed. The shopping area of wines in and out of the resort along with the gondola. The food here is exceptional I happily stayed most of my time two days here.
