How in the ever-loving, joyous world of immeasurably delectable Vietnamese cuisine have I not reviewed Lang Van until this day?!?! Upon my visit last night, I was astonished at my lack of review. Well, as they say, better late than never.

I've been a patron of Lang Van for years and have never had an experience where the food, service, and company have not been unique, memorable and utterly satisfying. The owner(?) or manager is one of the friendliest people in all of the Queen City. Regardless if you visited this week, late 2012, or even 5 years ago, she'll remember your face. She'll come up to you and give you a hug, welcome you, ask how your family is, and then hastily launch into bringing you a menagerie of Vietnamese foodstuffs. 

The menu, which is not for the faint of heart, houses an abundance of options. I used to order anything with coconut curry or just the simple Pho, but the owner (I really need to remember her name!) simply asks me what I'm in the mood for, proceeds to list options -- "What do you like? What do you want? Do you like crispy tofu? Do you like noodles? Coconut Curry? Vegetables? Meat or no meat?.....Ok, I'll bring you something nice." --------- THAT is why Lang Van is an incredible experience every single time. Not even seeing a menu anymore is a dream come true. 

Recently, I was introduced to Vietnamese coffee. Check out my photo or some of the others. It's an experience to be had. Condensed milk, a small urn of drip coffee...strong coffee above a tall glass with ice. Truly amazing. 

Lang Van is a staple in Charlotte's Vietnamese dining scene...nay. Overall. If you're even close to the line of wanting to try Vietnamese cuisine, start here.
