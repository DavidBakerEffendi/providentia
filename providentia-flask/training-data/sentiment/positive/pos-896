This is a cool place too hang out.  They have a large beer  selection.  Good food choices.  The avocado eggrolls seems to be very popular. Salads are made fresh. My waiter so super cool with his man bun.  Very easy on the eyes lol.  I will definitely come back and try new things and bring a friend. This place is clean and alot of really cool art work on the walls.
