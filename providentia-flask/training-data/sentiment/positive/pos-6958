Love this Fuddruckers location. We eat here all the time. Sign up for the email list for BOGO offers weekly. Food is served quickly, prices are reasonable, and it's easy to get in and park and just as easy to get back out. 

Great burgers, great fries, great salads, great onion rings. Can't stand the fish (too greasy) but if you stick to the items listed above, you can't go wrong with the home made buns and meet patty's.

We eat here at least twice a month and it's always a great experience. The worst part of eating here is sometimes the employees go a long time before wiping down abandoned tables. We've seen 15 tables and booths with dirty plates just vacated and ignored, which limited where we could sit that day. That's really my only complaint and that is really minor and doesn't happen very often.

I'm getting hungry just writing this review!
