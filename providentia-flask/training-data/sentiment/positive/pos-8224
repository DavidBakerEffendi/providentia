OMG Talk about freshness and a very reasonable price!  I am beyond impressed.

I ordered a chicken tikka naan wrap for $8.99. I seen their simple "A Board" sign outside the store and decided to walk in and give it a try.

You are greeted right away by one of the owners.  A young lady.  Pleasant and I knew I was in for a treat.

She took my order and I told her very spicy.  She asked of I could wait 10 minutes.  Of course.  This is going to be FRESH!

It took a little longer than 10 minutes... No, not really, but the anticipation and my growling stomach had me wanting it now.  Of course, I patiently waited!

My order was ready.  Paper bag too... Like a BIG paper lunch bag with my sandwich inside.

I got into my car and started driving home.  I probably drove to the end of the parking lot.  Stopped my car and revealed the gem inside the bag.  

OMG.. My jaw dropped.  The generous amount of chicken chunks and fresh vegetables starting at me and the fresh naan bread and the aroma of these fine ingredients combined... My first bite had my tastebuds dancing and me wanting more!  This has to be the best take out sandwich I ever had.  No joke!  

I was so impressed, I wanted another!  I will go back and give this another try!  However, I am one who loves trying and exploring different things.  

Of course I am  going back again.  They have an extensive menu.  Great prices.  Fresh and really delicious and homestyle cooking.

I would rather eat here than at a franchised restaurant or takeout store.   This is real food.  Fresh.  Everything is from scratch.  You won't be disappointed.  The flavors are amazing.
