I'm in Scottsdale for flight training and wanted to avoid the many chain restaurants, so on the Yelp I went.  Taberna Mexicana was a GREAT find!  Tucked away in a shopping mall which looks abandoned after dark (no so nice), the food and attentive service were a surprise and delight.  The Taberna Margaurita was delicious, the guacamole and spicy salsa fantastic and Yucatan pork stew delicious.  Coming back before I head home...wish they were in SoCal...
