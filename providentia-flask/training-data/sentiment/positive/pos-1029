I'm a little embarrassed to admit that it's been almost 2 years since I've gone to Mitchell's. It's the perfect lunch of happy hour spot for downtown, what have I been thinking?! I stopped in for lunch today and was truly impressed with the changes I saw. Even the bathrooms have been redone! They've way upped their menu game too, it's not just divey bar food anymore. My lunch was delicious, and served with a smile. 

I really need to come back for a happy hour or maybe before a Pens game. They have lots of drink specials posted in the bar area and I'm also a huge fan of no smoking (I do think you can smoke late night still, but you cannot smell it during the day!). Mitchells has really stepped up their game since my last visit and I will certainly not wait another 2 years to return!
