Ocean's 11, end of the movie, the guys are sitting gloating over their illicit triumph over Benedict and the Bellagio/MGM/Mirage vault.  Where do they go? to watch the fountain show.  Movie magic aside (somehow no one else was there watching), this remains the premium free show on the strip.  Every 15 munites or so the bell goes  goes off beginning an impressive collaboration of music and dancing water jets.  I am always amazed at the height of the jets.  It is actually a simple concept from a production standpoint but it outshines the Volcano and Pirate Show and never seems to get old thanks to the ever changing music rotation.  The kids love it, the out of town guests demand it, and even amid the flashing lights and traffic noise, it gives you a chane to break away from the madhouse that is Vegas for a relaxing, romantic moment!
