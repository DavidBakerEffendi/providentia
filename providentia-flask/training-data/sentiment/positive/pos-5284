I've been back to this place 4 times since my first review. An additional review is in order.

Looking at a few of the newer reviews that are less than stellar I must wonder how I happen to get the best service while the others are less than pleased. Maybe I should play the lottery today?

The only thing about my last visit that was not as pleasant as my first is that the tzatziki sauce they were using that day was from some greek festival the other day. Too much garlic.

First time meeting the owner however. Was just as pleasant as the other employees that I have had the pleasure of meeting.

Still the best gyro in town.
