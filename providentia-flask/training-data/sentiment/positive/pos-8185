I stopped in here with my wife to meet a colleague for a meeting that ended up lasting a couple of hours. The coffee was again incredible and I was taken away with the little shop. I wish that every town had such a great cafe at its heart. Barriques has really grown on me, and it now ranks as one of my favorite cafes anywhere. 

About me: I've roasted coffee for the last 9 years and own two professional espresso machines along with pro grinders and a lot of other equipment, so it's rare that I find cafes that can prepare coffee on par with what I make at home.
