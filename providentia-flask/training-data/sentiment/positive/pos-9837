Yum yum and more yum, tuna crackers (fresh raw tuna on rice crackers), mackarel and the fish tacos were the highlight. 
Not crazy about their soft shell deep fried crab (I like white meat only) or their agedashi tofu (I am native Japanese sot his is completely Hawaiian style)
I am definitely going back for more, the prices are fabulous, the portions are generous and the owner/staff was exceptionally nice (like most Hawaiians that I've met) 
They have this wonderful sugar scrub complimentary in the restroom =)
