Rox Grill and Bar is a cool restaurant bar. The restaurant area is huge whereas the bar is small. The bartender was very friendly and suggested popular menu items. We ordered a philly cheese steak, fries, and boneless wings. The food was tasty. I also ordered a long island, which was strong. I will be visiting again and I suggest you do as well.
