This review is really just to say, again, how big a fan I am of this location.  The pricing is fair and there really isn't much guessing about whether your food is local or organic because it's usually both.  I pretty much get all my food from here!

My favorite areas in the store are the produce and the meat.  The meat section is especially special to me because the guys behind there are chock full of recommendations.  I found a killer alfredo recipe, a great fish recipe, and just great convo from the guys that run that section.

The customer service here is great as well!  On a recent trip I found out that they unfortunately do not take American Express.  Because I live in Fitchburg, coming back with a new card was not really a great option for me.  Franchesca, who I believe is a manager here said that I can take the items with me and just give a call back when I get home and have my card.  I doubt Copps or HyVee would have done this.  This store pretty much sums up everything that I could really ask for in a grocery stop shopping experience!
