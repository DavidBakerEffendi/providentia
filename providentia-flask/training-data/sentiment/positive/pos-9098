My mouth waters just thinking about the lunch I had here a few hours ago. The menu has a lot to choose from, and I immediately went for the Yellow Curry (which seems like what I do at Thai places I haven't tried yet), just to see how it is across the board.

Anywhoo, it was the lunch menu special that comes with an eggroll. I added a glass noodle soup on the side as well. Lunch portions could be slightly bigger, but my I was definitely full by the time I scarfed down the curry and soup. Definitely a medium spicy as they promised, and was impressed by the authenticity of not only the food itself, but the decor and atmosphere.  Sauces and spices were used just right in the dishes, and I find that imperative when it comes to Thai food.

I'm glad I ran into this place on accident since it seems like a hole in the wall place that knows its thai food like nobody's business.
