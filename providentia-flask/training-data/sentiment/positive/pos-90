I came here for the first time last week. My friend works here and recommended we spend the evening there with a group of friends. We had a blast. From start to finish the customer service was great. The menu had a wide variety of options. The food was really good and was appropriate for the venue. I also like that there are different game options to chose from. I will be coming back to this location again. Plus the view is absolutely beautiful.
