The Palm Court at Happy Hour is underrated. They have great drink specials. Half price small plates including oysters. They have a special called "oysters and bubbles" with 1.00 oysters and 2.00 prosecco. It's really one of the better happy hours in downtown Pittsburgh. 

The Palm Court is inside the Omni William Penn Hotel so it is beautiful and spacious inside. Even when busy there's plenty of seating and good service. I mean the place is freaking gorgeous. Very fancy looking but no dress code worries. There's no music really so the atmosphere is very relaxed. Large comfortable chairs or a large dinning room.  place for cheap drinks and food in a fancy atmosphere. 

If you have never been give it a try.
