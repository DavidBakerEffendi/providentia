LOVE LOVE LOVE the folks at Makers & Finders, the downtown location (their first location) is our usual hangout spot when we need to step away from the office and refresh our eyes but their second location at downtown Summerlin is equally as great, we love their new layout, seeing the new staff and just seeing their business grow!!

Everything on their menu from Empanadas, Latin Hash, Coconut Chia and of course coffee is simply amazing which complements the always amazing service they provide as well.

Thanks guys, we'll keep coming back for those Latin Hash ;P
