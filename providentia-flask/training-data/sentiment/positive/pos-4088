This is my very first time staying at a suite(also 5 Star hotel) in Vegas and I don't think I'd stay anywhere else after the Venetian/Palazzo. 

The quality of the entry level suite(Venetian only has suites) was perfect for our group of 3 as it was spacious, clean, and elegant. Beautiful paintings on the wall, neat decor, and a nice bathroom with a glass shower and bathtub. If you happen to get a suite with two queen beds, you can comfortably have 6 people in a room as the sofa does have a pull out bed. 

Aside from the excellent rooms, another reason to stay here is that the Venetian is located near the middle of the strip, so walking to other casinos/hotels is fairly convenient, especially not having to take out your car to drive into traffic on Las Vegas Blvd.

Also, let's not forget to mention the TAO Beach pool party here along with the acclaimed Bouchon restaurant that make this place worth staying at. Obviously, the rates here are going to be expensive as it is a 5 star hotel, but if you book ahead, good rates can be had.

Of course, I may try another hotel on my next trip in Vegas, but The Venetian has raised the bar so high that I may just come back here for every Vegas trip. :D
