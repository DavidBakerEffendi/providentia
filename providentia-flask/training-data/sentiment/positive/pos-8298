After so many years, this is still the best Vegas buffet!  It's ~$35 per person for weekend dinner, but I think it's definitely worth it.  They have both Snow Crab AND Alaskan King Crab legs that are already pre-cracked for.  Their selection of red meat is also much better than the other buffets, including Kalbi-marinated Ostrich, Prime Rib, Quail, Pork Loin and more.  And don't forget to leave room for a plate or two of desserts.  All the mini-sized desserts are delicious and just the right portion for when your stomach is starting to run low on space.  Be sure to get there around 5:30-6pm as the line does start to build up later on.
