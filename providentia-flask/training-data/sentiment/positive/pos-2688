This place is a little hole in the wall paradise that we found and did not know existed.  One of the best things is open til 3am. The food's taste is surprisingly good.  Drunken noodles,  coconut soup and the dessert, has nothing to envy lotus of Siam. I forgot,  the customer service is excellent!! There is someone ready to serve if they are not doing anything they will stay in the dining area standing and observing to make sure the clients have everything they need.  The atmosphere and decoration Is very modern matching and cozy.
