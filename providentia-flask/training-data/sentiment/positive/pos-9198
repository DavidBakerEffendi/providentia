Somehow I missed this place but am so FREAKING happy to have found a Vancouver quality sushi spot. This gets a five out of five for Calgary sushi because it laps any other sushi place in this city. The avacado yam tempura roll was delicious and the Mexican roll was a spicy delight. Can't wait to go back
