SO FRICKIN GOOD!!!

We were in Vegas last week and one of the stops we HAD to make was the buffet. Bellagio or Wynn? We decided to eat the buffet at Bellagio since we were at the hotel. We came in at 2:30pm and did not leave until after 5pm. Paid for lunch ($21something with tax) and stayed for dinner. It was awesome!!!!!!!! I love it! So many good food, so little stomach. 

Their bread pudding was the bomb!!! It was HELLA good esp when you eat it with ice cream. My friend told me not to eat it because it's a filler (carb) but I couldn't stop...it was really really really good! Their prime rib and crab leg and baked salmon sashimi and tuna roll and roasted chicken (i asked for a slice and the guy cut me HALF a chicken. DAMN) and the cocktail shrimps (super fresh) and all the pasta and gourmet desserts...OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG DROOL!!! I want to go back now! YUMM!

Some tips: come in around 3pm (2:30 was too early...we were full before dinner menu came out and had to stuff our faces for the prime rib and crab leg). If you come around 3pm-ish, then you can pace yourself before dinner menu comes out. Dinner starts at 4pm. skip all the "sugar-free" desserts. WTF if you're gonna eat, then EAT UP. you need to try the bread pudding. No joke. It was seriously one of the highlights of my buffet experience at Bellagio. LOVE THIS PLACE!
