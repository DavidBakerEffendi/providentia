We have been going there for almost 10 years now.  It is our number one favorite place for brunch after church on Sundays.  In all the times we have been there we have never been disappointed with the food, and every server we have experienced is always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  You must have a great orientation program.  I also should say, prices are very reasonable.
