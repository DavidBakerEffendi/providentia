We arrived in Montréal late on a Wednesday and were wandering around the unfamiliar neighbourhood looking for somewhere to eat dinner. We happened upon Le Ballpark and decided to give it a try.

We were greeted by the friendly waiter/bartender and seated right away. He came back with menus and was kind enough to also bring us English menus. He explained the dishes to us (mostly boulettes, which are meatballs) and gave us recommendations.

We ordered several small plates to share and were not disappointed.

We ordered the smoked meat and sausage meatballs (my husband's favourite), which were served atop sauerkraut and with a sauce and pickles on top. We also had coq au vin meatballs which had mashed potatoes and a rich gravy. The salted cod meatballs were my favourite. They were crisp on the outside with a soft, mashed potato filled centre and were served with tartar sauce. We had a dozen oysters (only $1 each!!!) that were so fresh and beautifully shucked. The waiter also brought us a local hot sauce that was made with smoked jalapenos. It was amazing with the oysters. The shrimp and pork meatballs were served with shrimp crackers and a sort of sweet, red sauce and were our son's favourite. On the side we had frites with mayo (yummy) and sautéed greens which were perfectly cooked and in an interesting sauce which tasted a little gingery. The only (tiny) complaint was that the sunflower seeds on top of the greens tasted a bit rancid. We told the waiter and he insisted on getting us a new dish without the sunflower seeds. 

Every single thing we had was fantastic and I refuse to take away one star just because of the sunflower seeds as that mistake was rectified very quickly.

As amazing as the food was, the waiter was even better. He was so friendly and helpful and had us laughing several times during the meal.

If we lived in this neighbourhood, we'd be frequenting Le Ballpark weekly. Really, it's THAT good!!
