Second time coming here and I am blown away by the exceptional customer service and bagels. We tried a sausage egg and cheese sandwich on a jalape√±o bagel and a sesame bialy. The bagel was what I envision eating a bagel in NY would be like and the bialy was equally as impressive. I will definitely be back
