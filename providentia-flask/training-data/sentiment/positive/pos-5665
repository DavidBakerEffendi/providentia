It started off rocky for us, place was packed full I was shocked we walked in and were seated right away.  Country themed, clean, calming and relaxing.  I really didn't care for the Corned Beef hash & my boyfriend's French toast was kind of sad, and too dark. We asked for the Manager,  Ashley was so nice she asked if she could get us anything else we'd like... we were unsure.  I decided I was craving French toast and I really can't eat it because I'm allergic to wheat.  So I ordered it for myself but really I was planning on eating two bites and making the bf have it since his first order was just bad.  The French toast was delicious the second time around, nice golden brown.  By that time the place has cleared out and I decided maybe I will get something I can eat since they passed my "french toast test". Let's be honest if a brunch place can't nail French toast I wouldn't of stuck around.

So I wasn't crazy about the Corned beef hash serving I had, I figured I'll come back and try it another day maybe without onion next time and decided on the "garden omelet" it has mushroom and spinach on it.  I ordered it from the Gluten Free menu, totally loved the fresh ingredients veggies and melted cheese.  

**They're Gluten Free Menu is the biggest I've seen anywhere ELSE!**

We plan on going back and bringing more friends/family here because I prefer this place over the Egg & I.  I want to try the coffee next time too. I don't know what I was thinking a soft drink with Lunch.
