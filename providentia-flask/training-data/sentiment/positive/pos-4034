First time here. Always wanted to try. Interesting menu indeed. 

Had the smokehouse burrito and added falafel 

Made fast. Good service. Amazing value for the price!

$10 lunch including drink!  Freshly made. Great ingredients. Perfect amount of spice. 

The place is also spotless clean. One of the busier lunch places in the plaza. 

I want to come back and try their Cobb salad. Someone else ordered it with chicken on top and it looks amazing. 

I will be back for sure!
