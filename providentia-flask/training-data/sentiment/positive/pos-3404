This place is an experience, and there's a definite buzz there every time I've come.  When ever someone from out of town visits, I always make it a point to take them here to play some games, and have a brew or 2.  I'm also a fan of the food.  While it's not fine dining, it's actually really good for drinking beer, and their presentations are pretty on point.  The Mushi is a good one to try, and their flatbreads are pretty tasty as well.  They also make a great bloody mary.  For the true golfers out there, feel free to bring your clubs, but if your driving by and are thinking about needing to go home to grab them, forget it.  The clubs they have there are decent enough.  Besides, you're not really at Top Golf to golf, its really more of an experience where golf is just part of the equation.
