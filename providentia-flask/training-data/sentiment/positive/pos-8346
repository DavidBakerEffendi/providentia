Found ourselves in Scarborough at 9am looking for an early brunch/takeout options. Contenders were hand pulled noodles (Omni Palace), lamprais (New Quality Bakery), or Schwarma (Empire or this one).This place was the only one open, so ended up going here. Couldn't decide between chicken or beef, so got both. Chicken is my fave. But they both rock, and great value for around 7.50 each. This place also puts the schwarma on a grill making the pita crispy on the outside :) Hence, it'd be eaten in the first 10-15 mins tops ideally. Along with Empire (opposite to this one) and Mashu Mashu (Foresthill village, not been there in ages), easily among top 3 in GTA imho.
