This is one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems. It is tucked away in the Southside and most people probably walk right by not knowing it is a restaurant. We went here based on a recommendation and I was glad I knew that I should walk to the back of the shop and around the corner to get to the restaurant. Otherwise, I may have though I was in the wrong place.

There is usually only one person working there during the day (probably not the case for brunch), so be prepared to wait a while, although you may not have to. If you have to, definitely walk around and check out the antiques. I believe everything (even the table you are sitting at while you eat) is for sale.

The food is fantastic. I have tried a number of different items on the menu, and have been blown away every time. They seem to switch their menu up often enough, and I have heard great things about their brunch. I will be back soon to try it!
