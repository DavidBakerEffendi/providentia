I don't do a lot of 5 stars, but this is the real deal.  Straight out of Nawlins, Junior Battiste is careful that every visitor gets a taste of both authentic Cajun cuisine and the hospitality of the culture.  What a guy.

This is real étouffée, real gumbo, real jambalaya.  You'll know the difference in first bite.  Ask him one too many questions and he'll be sure to explain the difference between light and dark roux, give you samples to taste, and talk about his favorite flavors.  He just loves food. Period.

The quaintness of the place just sets it off. It's awkward. It's cramped. But that's why you'll be back.  Because instead of feeling like a cafeteria it feels like a dimly lit living room with smells wafting from the adjacent kitchen.  For you New Yorkers - you know this setting is special.

He best Cajun outside of N.O.  Guaranteed.
