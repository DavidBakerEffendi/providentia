First off, awesome service! Came here for an early brunch and was immediately greeted by two friendly hostesses who allowed us to choose wherever we wanted to sit. We ordered the Huevos Rancheros and got bottomless mimosas and a nitro coffee. The mimosas were brought before the first one was gone, we were checked up on by multiple staff and enjoyed sitting outside in the misters.
