I always love it here but tonight exceeded my expectations.  We called and placed an order for pick up and got stuck at an appointment a lot longer than expected.  We arrived 45 minutes after we said we'd be there to pick up our food and they said they wanted to remake our order so it was fresh.  It only took about 10 minutes and our order was hot and fresh and delicious and so worth it.  Thank you for superior customer service when it was our fault we were late!  I always get the hummus fafalel rolled and added tabbelouh with a side of hot sauce.  Tonight I got the stuffed grape leaves for the first time and they were fantastic.
