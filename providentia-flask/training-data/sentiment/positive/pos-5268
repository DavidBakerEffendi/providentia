What a place. 
I came in with two friends and we were not immediately sat down since it turns out I came in "during rush hour." 
I waited one hour for a table and was allowed to make reservations for a table in one hour: we went to the foot spa in the same plaza as we waited. 
I recommend a reservation as there is limited seating space. 
I came in with two of my friends and we ordered a salmon, vegetable rolls, yellow potato chicken curry, chicken pad Thai, and a coconut curry soup. 
Our minds were BLOWN. 
When you walk into a restaurant and read a menu, there is a description next to the item: we could identify the BOLD flavors in EVERY bite of EVERY plate. 
Absolutely amazing plates. 
Absolutely incredible wait staff.
