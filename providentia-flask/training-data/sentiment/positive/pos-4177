Food tasted great! I got the avocado and basil sandwich wrapped in a collard leaf and my bf got the pad Thai. Both tasted bomb. The cauliflower rice is really good alone but I added the tahini dressing to it and it taste really good. The almond milk drink is really good and smooth. I will be returning
