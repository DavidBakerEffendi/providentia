Came here with two friends, one of whom knew the band that was playing tonight. The band-Questionable Attitude - was fabulous. They played a mix of original songs and covers of classics. I got the plain cheese pizza, which was fresh and simple. And piping hot out of the oven! The hummus starter was fabulous, and I'm picky about my hummus. It was a generous portion and served with veggies and homemade pita chips. Chill, indy atmosphere in general.
