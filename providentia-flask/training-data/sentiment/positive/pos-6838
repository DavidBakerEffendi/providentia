This was completely unexpected.

If you are reading this review, please grab your car keys and head over here.  This place is a gem.  Yes it a gas station.  Its not like any other gas station.  It's a gas station that has full-service pumps, high octane racing fuel and a wonderful restaurant inside that has won "Best of Phoenix" awards.

Inside the "gas station" are two different seating areas.  There is also a patio.  Since the weather is still nice, we ate on the patio.  After you order they bring the food to you.

I did have a mistake made on my order and it was corrected very quickly.

How would I summarize this place?  It's really cool.  I wish it was closer to my house.
