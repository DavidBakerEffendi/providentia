This unassuming little spot in a Myers Park strip mall is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Admittedly, their regular menu is on the pricey side. In fact, I'd only been once during restaurant week because the high prices scared me away. (During that visit, I loved every bite. Lumiere's flavors are fresh and well balanced with the deep richness you expect from French food.) But, after getting weekly emails highlighting $25 entree & wine specials like duck a l'orange, fall bouillabaisse, beef bourguignon and more, I couldn't resist going back. 

On this visit, I had the bouillabaisse special that included a nice glass of Rhone. This seafood stew simply blew me away. I have no idea how they can serve that delicious dish -- full of octopus, artic char, scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams & lobster -- for $25 but I'll take it!! My boyfriend had the scallops. Served with pork belly for $30, it wasn't bad but seriously you guys. The Tuesday night special is the way to go. 

My favorite part about Lumiere is the top notch service. (Great service is getting harder and harder to find in Charlotte.) Everyone from the wait staff to the hostess to the expediter fall over themselves to treat each and every guest like a VIP. They're all so knowledgeable about the menu as well and happy to talk food, describe dishes, etc. for days.
