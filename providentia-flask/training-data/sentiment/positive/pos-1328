Seriously, I almost don't want to write a good review so I can keep this place all to myself. First off the menu is adorable and perfect options. Homemade everything and daily specials. Service staff is friendly and upbeat, I hate a caprese Salad and they keep it simple and traditional which I love, dont mess up an already perfect item. Prices for drinks are very reasonable and wine choices are good. I liked it so Much I decided to go the next day for a coffee. I ordered a latte with honey and it was perfect.  Perfect temp and flavor. The gentleman at the window was up beat and happy which is great for a Wed am.
