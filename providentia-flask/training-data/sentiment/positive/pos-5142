Canters was the best Deli sandwich I have ate in my life.  Yes, Im new to the experience, but I know a damn good sandwich when I eat one.  There's a few spots in Portland  I NOW HAVE to go to HOPING it's as good as Canters.

My wife and I needed a bite to eat, but didn't wanna spend a whole lot, yet didn't wanna eat a whole lot either.  Well during our stay at the TI we noticed the advertisements of Canters with this DELICIOUS looking sandwich representing them on the posters.  The name of that sandwich is the "Viva Las Vegas".  And I highly recommend it.  The sandwich is made with pastrami, cheese and thousand islands. It even seems like there's a type of coleslaw they top the sandwich with that gives it a great flavor.  The sandwich is 15.00.  The nice thing was we would split it, and it was just enough to fill our stomachs so we could tequila it up!

We stopped here twice to eat.  The first time my wife picked it up and brought it back to the room.  The second time we ate in the deli.  The line was short thank goodness.  Took about 5 min for our sandwich to come out.  The sandwich did come with a small side of potato salad.  I liked it and so did my wife.  Some people may think I was too generous to kick down 5 stars.....If you try CARNEGIE first....you'll see why i gave Canters 5.  

Canters was the best thing about the T.I. by a long shot.
