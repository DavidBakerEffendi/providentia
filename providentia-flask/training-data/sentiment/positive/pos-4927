I love Sam Woo but I'm absolutely no connoisseur of Asian food.  I'm the kind of guy that gets by with going to the Teriyaki place in the mall.  I've never really been interested in Asian food much but a friend referred me to Sam Woo's and I was hooked.  Its small, quaint and simple. PERFECT for me.  'Cash Only' is a bit of a difference for me for my love of the debit card but I don't blame them, they're just being smart.  The service isn't one of 'Hey how ya doing, hows your parents, how's your dog, blah blah' and sometimes I really don't want that.  I just want to order and eat my food, cuz guess what, I'm hungry!  They're quick and it tastes phenomenal to me.  Until I read other reviews, I didn't even know there were more than one, and if like some say, this isn't the best of them, I'm in for a treat when I travel!  I like them a lot. They're nice people and they always have my take-out ready and hot when I come to pick it up!
