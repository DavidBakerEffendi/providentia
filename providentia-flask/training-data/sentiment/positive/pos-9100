Eek!!! This was our favorite meal from our girls trip to Vegas this past weekend. I chose this place because the menu sounded tasty and the prices were reasonable for a large group, and we were staying at the MGM Grand.

We had eight girls and I easily made reservations through OpenTable about a week before, and then had to push the res back 30 minutes at the last minute. They were very accommodating.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous like most restaurants in the hotels on the strip. The ambiance felt romantic and intimate. The lighting was dim, but not too dark.

Everything on the menu sounded super amazing, so we decided to share everything. We ordered three flatbread pizzas (wild mushroom, grilled chicken, and the curry shrimp) - they were all really good, but my favorite was definitely the mushroom. It had the right amount of cheese and mushrooms were yum!

The kale salad was also a hit too. The arugula salad was a close second. Other notables included the octopus ceviche and ricotta gnocchi (very generous portion of the braised short rib!)

Surprisingly, that was enough food for the eight of us, and we were VERY satisfied with the whole meal, and the price! It came out to less than$20 per person for all that good food. We didn't get drinks because we were fine with water, but the cocktail menu looked pretty delightful.

Service was great and the food came out super fast! We finished our food in 30 minutes - we were totally shocked, but it was great because we were already behind schedule.

HIGHLY recommended for those staying at the MGM!
