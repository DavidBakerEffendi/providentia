The Skinny: Sicilian pistachio was so good, I nearly creamed my pants. So delicious! (5) Service: awesome owner who doesn't shy away from offering samples (5) Value: innovative flavors, great service, orgasmic ice cream.... need I say more? (5)

Normally, I don't write a heck of a lot of up dates but with the Art of Flavors, I'll make an exception.

All I have to say is this: Sicilian Pistachio.

When I was a kid, I never used to like pistachio given the propensity for the artificial coloring and flavor used to make this particular flavor. As I got older and tasting real pistachio ice cream/gelati, it's become one of my favorite flavors. 

This is one of the best pistachio gelati I've had - so incredibly creamy and delicious.  It would have been great with some real pistachios thrown on top. Like I said... I nearly creamed my pants it was so good.

I also got to try their regular chocolate which I like better than their chocolate mint - rich dark chocolate, remarkably smooth.

The blueberry sorbetto was quite good as well and my husband loved the lightness of this contrasting with the deep chocolate/pistachio flavors.

Oh and to confirm, they do serve brioche con gelato which is brioche bread with gelati pressed in between. 

I love the fact that every time you come, you will have something you've never tried before. I noted that other than the base gelati that they have, I hadn't had most of the flavors they had out 1 week later. So much fun but I will be sad if I never get to have their pistachio again!
