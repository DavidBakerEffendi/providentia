You will earn bonus stars if you: A. Offer Brown Rice Sushi B. Serve Me Peruvian Corn

I didn't know that B was true until I had the pleasure of nibbling kernels of this P-country delight with chopsticks at SushiSamba, so another bonus for educating me about a delicious snack. Snacking is what brought us here. We were wandering around following a mini beer fest and decided we should eat again. When the hostess told us they could do brown rice sushi rolls, we were sold. I really applaud this option, and I hope it will become more popular.

We sat at the sushi bar, and even there, I could appreciate this was an all-eyes-on-fun atmosphere. Attention big parties looking to par-tay this should be on your short list. 

Our server was super sweet and helpful. I ordered some miso soup and asparagus and chicken robata. The miso soup did feature cilantro, but I can't say it went to anyplace that miso hasn't been already. The robata were as well prepared and flavorful as any I have had in town. And, oh that Peruvian corn: giant kernels of sweet maize. It came with the robata, and I thought it was divine. I also had several bites of the passion fruit shrimp ceviche, and it was a fruit sensation for sure. My husband ate the brown rice sushi, and I was happy for him to have the option. Overall, the menu and execution are fusion done right. 

The server confused my chicken for a beef, really no big deal, but management was quick to intervene and remove the chicken from the bill. This flat out amazed me. 

Yes, prices are Strip prices (but they aren't outrageous), and I only sampled some light bites, but based on my overall experience from atmosphere to service, if you are looking for a fun spot to enjoy some creative eats or just some fabulous light bites on the Strip, this is a pretty complete package.
