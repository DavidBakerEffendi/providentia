Our favorite Chinese restaurant! Lots of flavor and minimal grease. My husband usually orders beef and broccoli and I always get their veggie egg foo young. Perfect comfort food. Great friendly service too! Slightly pricier than other Chinese restaurants but well worth the quality. And the portions are huge!
