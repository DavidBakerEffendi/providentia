They have great food and one of the best beer selections in the North Hills. Go on Wednesday night for their burger special ($6 for an awesome burger) and occasionally trivia. The prices are good, they also have great pizza. It's really a good place, just not a great location.

Also, if you like soup you'll love this place. Fresh, homemade soups daily.
