Message was heard loud and clear...another top notch meal at Zoe's. After some great meals and some not so great meal, communication of concerns were clearly addressed and am pleased to see the Zoe's we originally enjoyed.
Four of us enjoyed an early dinner. Some of us had old favorites and others continue to explore the menu.
Thanks for listening and reinforcing all that we've come to enjoy
