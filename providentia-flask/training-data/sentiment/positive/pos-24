How can Aka get better. Well how about brunch on the weekends. Make sure you call ahead as it's pretty full. 
How can I convince  you. How bout thick slices of French bread with truffle syrup or spreading your toast with creamed cranberry butter. That's right talk about making a meal pop with creamy pinks.... So fashionable and so Devine.
I can't say enough good things about this place, wait one more... The desserts.
Check it out and this one to your taste bud must visits
