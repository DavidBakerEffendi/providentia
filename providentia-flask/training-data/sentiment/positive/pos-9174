It was off again to Peppermill for another great meal!

This time I enjoyed a Spinach Salad with cut eggs, spinach leaves, substantial bacon, and tangy French-style Dressing (although Hot Bacon Dressing would have been more appropriate), followed by two fine Gyros with soothing cool cucumber Tzaki Sauce, tomatoes, and White Onions.  The large sandwiches were accompanied by great skin-on Red Potato Salad.  

Other guests in my party savored a Gourmet Chicken Salad, Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, and Scrambled Eggs, Canadian Bacon, and crispy Hash Browns, along with an excellent warm Bran Muffin that I sampled.  The ambiance here is always upbeat, casual, and comfortable.  And service was very good.  My only gripe is that my salad wasn't removed after I finished it.

I will surely return another day for more fine comfort food!
