This place deserves 6 or 7 stars...it's friendly from the second you walk in, speedy from te second you sit down, and tasty from the second you are served...the yellowtail was the absolute best, blue fin tuna was spot on, and excellent all the way til the last piece of purple rice...the sushi chef and waiter snuck us some mochi and a special salmon fish dish that was amazing...if you're still reading wondering if anything was bad, there wasn't anything to say other than new favorite sushi spot in Phoenix.
