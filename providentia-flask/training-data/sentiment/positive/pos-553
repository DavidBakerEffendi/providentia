When I first came in the restaurant I didn't have very high hopes because of the restaurant's size and the fact that we were the only customers. However, I was really surprised because everything tasted so good! We chose to order form the dine in special because everything was around $2.50 per item so we got to try a bit of everything for under $20!

I recommend sushi pizza, spicy salmon rolls and the shrimp tempura rolls (I'm not sure if that was the exact name).
