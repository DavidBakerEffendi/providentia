Went back today, Charlie had already closed but was sweet enough to offer to cook for us supper anyway. He apologized for not having everything available, and then proceeded to feed us a delicious chicken and pork belly sandwich with tomatoes, hot sauce, caramelized onions and those tasty fries. My salad was beets, goat cheese, mushrooms, pickled onion, blueberries. It was an amazing amalgamation of different menu items.  We had such a great time, and incredibly appreciative that he took the time to feed us. Can't wait to go back.
