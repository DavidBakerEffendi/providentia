The resto just opened like a month ago. already a fan of their other BYOB (Quartier Général on the Plateau)

food and prices are really amazing; 4 course meal for less than 40$ 

fantastic service, our waiter was very polite and very knowledgeable; explained all courses very well

u pick a main dish add 12$ and u end up with: starter (soup or salad), appetizer, main dish, dessert
u can go ala carte if u want, but really recommend the table d'hote

mostly market cuisine, very simple in most case, but very tasty.

i had a pied de veau (veal foot!!) wich is one of the best appetizer i'va had!! very difficult to explain (kind of pulled veal with a bit of fat, made in a fried square??!! kapish?!!)

took the rabbit for main, same rabbit that they serve at Quartier Général, and it's always sooo goood; not dry at all, stuffed with yummies

they only "letdown" was my baba o rum for dessert, it was good but not at the level of the other 2 courses.

my GF had a duck tartare for app wich was excellent and the beef cheeck for main that was very good and tender, but maybe had a little too much fat?
dessert was a chocolate type of cake/mousse/fondant wich was perfect for a chocolate lover!

hands down the best BYOB in the area... and in my TOP3 in MTL
