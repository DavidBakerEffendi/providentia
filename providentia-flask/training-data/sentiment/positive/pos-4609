Another pizza place to add to my list of favorites! Before coming to Madison I'd never dreamt that pizza could be this good. I have heard all about Salvatore's but I'd never tried it before, the Sun Prairie location is just too far out of the way for me. But the people there must have heard me (and other pizza-lovers like me!!), and so they open an outlet here. Thanks to my co-worker I got to know about their opening and off we went on their second day. 

For being a new place they were pretty busy. It was a nice and cozy restaurant on the east side (about 7 or so tables with a small bar area). Ordered the popular Carbonara pizza and it didn't disappoint. Runny egg yolks (3 eggs!!) and smooth egg whites right on top of the pizza. With mushrooms and bacon. With all the eggs on the pizza the crust is still super crispy. Enjoyed every moment of it. The small pizza was enough to share between two people. 

But we were greedy so we also had the bruchetta as the appetizer. Fresh house made mozzarella with dipping bread, roasted garlic and greens on the side. I love how light the cheese is, it goes really well with the pizza. 

I am so excited about Salvatore's. Can't wait to be back again for more!!
