On business in Cleveland, a friend took me to Happy Dog and I had no idea what to expect. Pulling up, the place is very unassuming but once you step foot inside, you are overwhelmed by a place with almost too much character to handle (in a good way). This place is pretty hipster, but as a non-hipster I felt like I fit in just fine. I was fortunate enough to visit Happy Dog during "Polka Happy Hour" where I was delighted by the first (and probably only) Polka DJ I have ever heard. Such a fun atmosphere and I can only imagine it gets better as the night goes on.

Enough about how cool this place is, let me talk about the food. With a build-your-own, checklist style menu you get the chance to be invested in your meal. Everyone starts with a hot dog but after that, your possibilities are really endless. With all sorts of meats, cheeses, and other toppings (as normal as bacon or chilli and as obscure as fruit loops or spaghettios) you can create a culinary masterpiece. For me, I went with bacon, mac n cheese, sauteed onions, garlic aoli and siracha. I was super impressed and very satisfied. Pair that with the tater tots, also topped with anything you'd like, and all sorts of beer options, there is not much negative to say about Happy Dog. OH and did I mention the hot dogs, with anything you want on top, are only $5??! Such a steal.

Basically, if you want to have the time of your life in Cleveland, make sure to hit up Happy Dog.
