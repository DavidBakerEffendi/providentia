We went here because we saw it on Yelp, of course, and would never have found it otherwise. Too bad, because it's located in a strip mall on the East side, unfortunately notorious for being half full of vacant storefronts, so you don't just stumble across it.

It's pretty spacious and clean, with your standard Mexican fiesta decor. Of course, my friend and I had to sit at a table with two pink chairs so we didn't have to fight over one.

The server was a sweetheart and very patient about describing the menu with it's many sauce options to my friend, who lives in mortal fear that someone will order something better than what she got. 

The chips and salsa were just ok, but that;s not what you're here for. Fideo soup is a pretty good version of a dish for which we have no expectations anyway.

The enchiladas, on the other hand, proved to be mighty tasty. I thought the tomato sauce would be like standard red enchilada sauce, but it was very light and fresh tasting. Nice, but I prefer more complex flavors, so my favorite was the pumpkin seed. It was very deep, mellow and toasty with just a tiny bit of sweetness. Really should have tried the mole but  I was intrigued by the variety of exotic combinations.  The plan is definitely to go back on Wed. or Sunday when they have AYCE so we can try 'em all.

 And to walk in first and grab the pink chair.
