Unlike my husband, who has worked for a Japanese company and spent time in Japan, I am not a fan of sushi. When I can't avoid a Japanese sushi bar/restaurant I try to order tempura and skip the dead fish no matter how pretty it looks. I owed my husband big time so agreed to go to O2 which is close to home. Newly opened, this place is clean and interesting. Various types of sushi come rolling by your table in little, covered dishes. Signs with explanations announce what is on its way past you on the conveyor belt and you get to pick and choose. My family is now in shock. No, I did not take the "safe" pot stickers. I thoroughly enjoyed three different rolls (whose names I can't remember) as well as a refreshing cucumber salad. The sushi not only was beautifully made, it was flavorful and it tasted so fresh.  Intriguing as it was, I passed on the green tea cheesecake. The sushi chefs are quite visible and I stopped by and watched them create their delicacies. The restaurant's staff was friendly and helpful. Our waitress, Sun, introduced me to "cheaters" that help those uncoordinated individuals like myself, better manage the chopsticks. She apologized because the restaurant was new (opened less than 2 weeks) and they were still working on things to improve. As picky as I am, I could find no fault with either the food or the service and am looking forward to returning.
