Fresh tasting, colorful rolls. Love the purple rice. Prices are very reasonable for the quality. The main sushi chef is super friendly and offered us two fish samples (seared salmon and a fatty tuna, YUM) and a mochi green tea ice cream sample at the end of the meal. We are new to Phoenix and this will definitely be our go to sushi place.
