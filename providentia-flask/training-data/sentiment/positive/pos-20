Love this place. Love the quality and uniqueness of the selection. Love the owners. The Green Regime has been a staple to my nutrition goals for a couple of years now and I am grateful that there is a local small business where I can stop in and grab something quick and nutritious on the go M-Sat. Give it a try. I love the Chocolate Thunder and the Beach Body and my son and husband love the PB & Chocolate Thunder. Plus, I am obsessed with the greens they use here. Call ahead if you're in a big hurry.
