This place is sooo damn far from where I live so I wasn't sure if it'll be worth coming.. my friend recommended this place to me so I came with my cousins.. the staff is really nice our server was Herran.. he suggested some really good alcohol drinks and food.. he kept coming back to make sure everything was good and that we didn't need anything else.. if I'm ever on this side again I'll be sure to come again
