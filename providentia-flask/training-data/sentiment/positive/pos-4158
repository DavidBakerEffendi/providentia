Perfect spot to cure a pizza craving.  The bread at the start literally melted in my mouth.  The pizza is perfect with a thin base and a chewy crust so you can appreciate the breading.  I love the Libretto now offers vegan cheese so I can actually have a pizza with cheese (I am used to ordering a pizza without cheese at most places).  I have gotten the eggplant pizza with the vegan cheese and never feel I am missing out on the real thing.  Service has always been prompt, attentive and friendly.
