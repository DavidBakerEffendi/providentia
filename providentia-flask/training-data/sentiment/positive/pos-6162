Love this place. Usually go here after comiccon or fan expos.

Mood is relaxed, calm and collected. Dim, but a good dim (ie you can see). Clean place, usually see all kinds of nice people and friendly staff. 

Food: DIM SUM! Love the har gow and the shu mai. It is qualiTy (emphasis on the T :D ). You have to have it with their mustard wasabi = I dont know what they do, but its good.... or it may kill you....

Everything else s pretty awesome, I have not had a bad time at this place yet. I guess I was Luckee ;) ;) ;)
