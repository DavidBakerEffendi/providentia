We love our Village Pub! Rene, Penny, Noah, Chris all the bar tenders are absolutely amazing. You'll have a great time and sometimes free entertainment too. We do not eat much in the dinning room but when we do we have had either Brandon, Marlon or Chris. All severs are great. Very attentive. Anytime we have had problems (small issues) they have been fixed with a smile. Such a chill place to hang out have amazing food great happy hour specials and your not pressured to gamble. Must try the chicken fried chicken, California chicken panini with sweet tots, Village Pub chicken, Cobb salad, baked penne pasta, pot pie, broccoli cheddar soup with Prime rib on Saturdays, and the chicken wings and tenders are huge!! They also have a fantastic breakfast menu. Really can't go wrong with any of the food items. Love love love this place and everyone that works here!!!
