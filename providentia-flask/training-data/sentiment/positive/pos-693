Possibly the best tex mex in Charlotte, NC. We don't have a lot of great Mexican restaurant around but if someone was to ask me where I want to eat for Mexican food... I would either suggest Paco's Tacos or Sabor Latin Street. 

I have sampled a few of the tacos and they're all pretty delish. If your not as hungry I would suggest ordering the chicken tortilla soup bowl. It's perfect for cold nights and it will fill you up for only $5. We also tried a jalapeno shot. Please do yourself a favor and don't try it thinking it's cool or something. We tried it and I felt like there was a goldfish inside my stomach instantly... No bueno. Other than that everything is pretty awesome not the mention the service and the lovely dim light atmosphere. Enjoy!
