YUM with a capital YUM. I was a bit surprised after reading the reviews to find this little gem in a strip mall. It's right by Lolo's, by the way. We walked in and the place smelled delish! We were seated immediately in a clean and comfortable booth. Our waiter took our order and answered all our questions. He did forget to bring our water even though we asked twice, but I forgave him that when I tasted the refreshing ginger limeade. We shared the veggie spring rolls - so fresh and minty! And we ordered three different bowls of pho. Amazingly flavored broths in the veggie and beef  bowls. I love how fresh the vegetables were and hubby loved the spice in the meatballs. My brother-in-law was a bit unhappy with the thinly sliced tendon but it wasn't on the menu initially and they made it all special for him. Thanks Noodles Ranch for putting up with my crabby brother-in-law by the way. Super tasty and we will definitely be back.
