Wildflower is my family's go-to restaurant during the weekends. My dad always gets the Wildflower Pick Two: chicken continental and fruit. My mom typically enjoys a caesar salad with chicken salad. I change my order depending on my mood: chopped salad with sweet potatoes, cauliflower masala soup, BLT+ made vegan, or pasta primavera. The pastries are delicious as is everything from the rest of the menu. Wildflower is truly amazing. :)
