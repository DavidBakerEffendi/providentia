Topgolf is honestly great for any occasion and you don't need to be a great golfer to love it. Think bowling but golf! Whether you need a fun place for a corporate outing, birthday celebration, bachelor party, retirement party, you name it, this is your place! Not only is the golf fun, but their food and drinks are spectacular as well! (Usually at these types of places, the food is 'eh' but not at Topgolf!!) 

We came here for a company offsite and EVERYONE had a blast. I personally, am definitely not a great golfer (like, i'm lucky to even make contact with the ball), however, I was still able to score some points and most importantly, laugh and mingle with my teammates. The balls have a micro chip in them so that they can keep accurate scoring. We nibbled on delish appetizers like shrimp cocktail, antipasto skewers, pot stickers, and queso. Their Moscow Mules are also on point (and yes kids, they come in a copper mug here!). 

I will most definitely be back for another fun occasion, or even just a date night, again soon!!
