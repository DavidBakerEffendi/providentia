Toronto's best Mexican restaurant! They are so consistently good! Every time I go back, I get the same great tasty food and awesome service! The (fried) fish taco is simply, perfect! SOOO GOOD..must try! unlike all the other mexican/taco places in Toronto, Hacienda actually has good portion sizes and you leave feeling full!
