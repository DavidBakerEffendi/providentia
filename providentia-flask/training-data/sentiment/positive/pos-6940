went there last night for the first time, as I was picking it up, I told the guy that it was my first time and he said, "you'll be back." well he is right! I got the 16" pizza with pepperoni, meatball, and sausage. It was wonderful! I'll be back. Oh! the meatball is $2 extra, all other toppings were $1.50. I'd skip the meatball as it didn't add anything really so next time is pepperoni and sausage.
