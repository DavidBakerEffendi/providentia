This place is like my new fave place. 

The prices change depending on the time of day. It can be a tad pricy but if you go in group setting, it's totally reasonable. You can play for an hour at a time, and you can add after that is up. Or, you can just set a specified time frame. The atmosphere here is fun and it's a good time. 

The food tho, is delicious. I love the mushi. It's a burrito that is cut like sushi. It's delicious. My son loves the donut holes. You get to inject it with flavors. Delicious.
