My family and I came in here for a post Thanksgiving Day brunch that they were having. Unfortunately for them it wasn't very busy but fortunately for us, it wasn't very busy. We ordered from a special brunch menu that they had.

Everyone got sticky buns to start with and they were excellent. Soft, warm and very rich. I ordered a delicious soup and other people got salads and a fruit plate. We had a variety of items but for my main course I got the Eggs Benedict with filet mignon. I loved it but I found it was difficult to cut through the filet mignon, egg and bread all at once and came out a little messy. They also have the Eggs Benedict with crab cakes which someone else got and they loved it. I would probably do that next time.

For desert we had some ice cream. They have a home made mint ice cream that is out of this world delicious. I'd like to try this place during regular dinner hours. Service was impeccable.
