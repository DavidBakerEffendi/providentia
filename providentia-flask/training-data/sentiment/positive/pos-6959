When I first heard of the Gold Spike, I knew absolutely nothing about it except that it was located downtown. I imagined this old school smokey casino full of elderly people spending their last pennies in the penny slots, so I was surprised that my friend wanted to go there so badly on Saturday night.  I could not be more incorrect.  

The inside is a giant game room with giant sized games that include darts, connect four, corn hole (or bean bags for those of you not from the Midwest), shuffle board, etc. There is also a bar and what looks like a little restaurant.  Even though it's a giant game room, it still has a swanky feel to it.  Then there's a huge back patio area with more corn hole, a giant Jenga game, and chairs and little fire pits, as well as a stage for bands to play.  

It's just such a great and fun atmosphere.  It's relaxing and not at all pretentious.  There's so much to do and the drinks are cheap.  My friends and I were all very excited to have found a new fun spot downtown.  We need more places like this!
