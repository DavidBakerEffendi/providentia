The eatery is new to our neighborhood so we decided to check it out. My party and I got there early in the morning so there was no wait and we were seated right away. The decor was modern yet made you feel right at home. Our server was great and gave us the rundown. He suggested what to try and what his favorite dish was. It was very helpful as there are so many options; the menu was a tad overwhelming. I decided to try the veggie omelette and upgrade to have the raspberry brûlée pancakes. Well I'm glad I wore elastic pants because the portion sizes were huge! The food was absolutely delicious and the perfect balance of sweet desert and breakfast foods. I will definitely be back as I can't wait to try other items off the menu!!
