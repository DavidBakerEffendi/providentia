What's not to like?  Breakfast is the best meal of the day and this place does it right!  I can usually find a coupon for a buy-one-get-one-free meal (up to 8 dollar value) in the weekly View newspaper.  GREAT value.  

They have a huge menu with lots of choices, including lunch options (burgers, sandwiches, etc.).  The omelets and a few other meals have the option of either toast or a homemade banana nut muffin and I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't emphasize how freakin' awesome the muffin is!  It's served warm and fresh before your meal comes so if you're starving going into the place choose the muffin to get you started.  Also, the potatoes are perfectly seasoned and totally addicting.  I couldn't leave one tiny morsel behind, even if I wanted to. 

The decor is cute and has a country feel.  There is a condiment tray on your table that has a little egg on it to signify if you're OK and don't need your server (black egg that smiles) or if you need something from your server (yellow egg that frowns lol).  Cute touch! 

The service was decent - no complaints there.  

If you have a coupon and are around for breakfast or lunch then you just can't lose coming here!
