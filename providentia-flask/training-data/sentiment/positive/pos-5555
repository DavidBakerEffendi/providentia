This was our first visit here and we fell in love! We called to find out if they had a bar and the person on the phone answered all of our questions and also let us know happy hour was all day on Sunday! We we walked up to the hostess stand the hostess was polite and smiling and nice! She directed us to the bar where we were greeted by 2 very nice bartenders! They were knowledgeable with the menu and also let us take our time and look at everything! They joked and were very pleasant. The food was amazing! I ordered the surf and turf and my husband ordered the steak christofor. Everything was cooked to perfection! I literally was cutting my steak with a butter knife! I didn't realize I had the wrong knife until I was halfway through with my meal! This was overall a wonderful dining experience for us and hope to come back as often as possible. Natalie and the gentleman behind the bar made our date night dinner spectacular.
