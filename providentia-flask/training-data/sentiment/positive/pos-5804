Love this place for breakfast.  As a recent transplant to Vegas (last year), I found this local spot and have been here almost a dozen times.  

First and foremost, the 3 things that bring me back are the the coffee cake, the service and the food.  The Coffee Cake is perfection..  I've had at least 4 different kinds and they're all great (although the mocha/chocolate flavor is my favorite).  Lemon and the berry flavors are great as well.  The service here is wonderful as well.  Everyone working here is very friendly, fast and very helpful.

The skillets are really good.  I get the veggi skillet and add bacon.  The Pesto Scramble is also a family favorite (egg whites only).  Half-portions on the breakfasts are available too, so I would suggest a half-size or sharing for the lighter eaters.  

A definite favorite of mine so don't miss it!
