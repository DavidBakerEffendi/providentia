I was for a long time planning to dine at The Keg
Today I treated my wife and I with a memorable dinner for a lovely occasion 
We both chose classics and picked the sirloin stake, mine medium rare
It was fantastic, very properly cooked, flavored and decorated. Baron Philipe's glass of red wine matched the steak beautifully
I had a choice of salad and side dish, i took Caesar and double baked potato with bacon. Both acceptably delicious 
Finally the dessert, crime brûlée! Voilà! Could not be better
Staff: friendly and helpful
Ambiance: romantic, under lit (i do enjoy it)
Wait time: on a Tuesday we had to wait 20 mins. It was fully packed. U can always reserve 
Highly recommended after having ordered steak in many Montreal restaurants this for sue is number one so far
