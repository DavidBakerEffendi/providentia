Super-friendly service, great value, and a healthy vegetarian menu make for an unbeatable combination!

For about $6 you get a "set lunch" consisting of rice, a vegetable curry, pickled vegetables, bread, and a dessert dish. Everything tasted great and the bread was made fresh. The woman behind the counter, I am assuming she is the owner, was  super friendly, treated me like her grandson. She asked me if I wanted a particular dish, I shrugged and said I would love to try it. She smiled and laddled some the yogurt dish onto my tray and then added a pokara on my tray, saying with a smile "you try." Talk about friendly service!

On top of everything else, the market the restaurant is attached to is great! Spices, exotic ingredients, cooking utensils, you name it. They even have Marmite!
