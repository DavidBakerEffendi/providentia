One of my fellow yelpers (Tim) led me to this little gem. I had it booked for some time and wish I would have tried it sooner. The location could be difficult for some to locate, so plan accordingly. For lunch today I tried out the Kiss salad and taco. The salad was full of goodness, that included cucumbers, tomatoes, egg, superb chicken, and tasty dressing. The Kiss taco was made with some awesome pork. The tacos themselves are a little small but priced right so just order two, or three, or hell, just make it a solid five. The staff was very friendly and the dining area was cool and comfortable. Will definitely be back.
