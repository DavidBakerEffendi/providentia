Best prime rib sandwich!! Serious hidden gem in a dumpy mall (Agincourt Mall) in Scarborough looks like a dump but the sandwich I've had since I was a kid. I sometimes do the 40 mins drive just so I can get this freshly carved off the roast piece off perfection. Word of advice, just have the kaiser sandwich with the beef no accompaniments except their amazing jus and a sprinkle of salt. Better then the Keg's and seriously just a notch below the prime rib sandwich I tried at Harbour 60 - difference is this one is only $10 for thick slabs of juicy prime rib. One of the best things I've ever ate in Toronto - and no one knows about it!
