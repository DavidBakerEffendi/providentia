We live in Seville, and have been going to the Blue32 up on Val Vista and Williams Field.  We waited anxiously for this to open, and all of the anticipation led to some really high expectations.  

I'm happy to report that our expectations have been exceeded twice in a row. 

Last time, we were seated at a table with a server named Amanda and we loved her.  The food was great (I had the Alfredo pasta, very flavorful) but my favorite every time is the strawberry daiquiri.  They're made with real strawberries rather than gloppy corn syrup mix, and the taste is miles apart.  

We couldn't remember our awesome servers name this trip (sorry Amanda) but we won't forget because we've now immortalized her in this review.  

She's thoughtful.  We had been dithering about what to order (flatbread? Shrimp poboy? Steak?) When a massive party arrived, requiring extra tables and chairs to be brought in, she was nice enough let us know so we could get our order in before they were all seated.  

We never wanted for a drink or water refill, food was correct and piping hot, and she's just delightful.  

Also... Fresh Strawberry daiquiris... Did I mention that..???
