I've been hitting this Chinese food gem for years--and it's always good and cheap.

Their General Tsao's Chicken is one hearty portion with fresh broccoli surrounding it like the picture, and their House Pad Thai and House Special Rice is seriously delicious!!!!!! 
You have to try their great noodle in soup and won ton soups, as well as the reason why I travel all the way down to Yonge and Wellesley--their Dim Sum. Great siu mei. 

Sit upstairs if you're going to dine in, and take in the passersby on the street below; or sit on the cozy leather seats downstairs for a quick lunch special. They deliver and do take out too, and they are pleasant enough. Service is usually quick and bathrooms are kept clean.

I have yet to find a place as consistent in tastiness and service as Not Just Noodles!
