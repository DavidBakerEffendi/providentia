Stopped in for luch today and boy, was I impressed!  My favorite was the bacon-wrapped jalapeno peppers--the whole group loved them.  Also had their half price homemade pizza which was delicious.  The piece de resistance, however were the homemade pies!  tried two different kinds:  both  Pina Colada and Peanut Butter were devoured by the group with smiles cheek to cheek as evidence of their deliciousness!
