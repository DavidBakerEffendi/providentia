Absolutely fantastic. It's a must see when you visit Vegas. Some don't do the tourist stuff.. But everytine I visit I want to go here. It's so relaxing at night f there are shows all the time nice music playing. And from what I have see the cleanest concrete in Vegas . I have seen so many romantic things at this location. Take your friends and family and enjoy the Bellagio lifestyle
