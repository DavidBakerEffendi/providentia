One of my favorite spots in old town. They always have a perfect list of different types of wine and craft beer! The place is intimate and cozy yet hip. It reminds me of a bar in NYC, small space, with brick walls and a big bar. There is usually only one person working (often the GM). Despite it always being busy, whoever is working is always very attentive (even if you are not sitting at the bar). I have always loved everything I have ordered...wine, beer, and their food is all good!
