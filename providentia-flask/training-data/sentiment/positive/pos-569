I love this place so much I am anxious about writing a review!  It's just a delightful slice of heaven.  The food it delicious - especially the salads!  They are so generous and very unique and yummy.   

 I like the breakfasts -- my son even likes the food there!  The meat plate is fun to eat with wine.  I love being outside - the fire pit, the trees, and the music!  I love being inside, the big garage doors, the mirror, the scooter!

They support local the local school and they are so nice!!
Go there...bring your family.  My parents like it, my son likes it - my fiance likes it.  GO!
