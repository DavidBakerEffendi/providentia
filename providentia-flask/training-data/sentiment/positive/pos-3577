Very tasty food, fast service, nice location. The pulled pork sandwich, fried shrimp moe boy, baked beans, Mac n cheese, spicy corn sides all good. Good portion sizes, filled is up. Sandwiches run $9.50 bit come with 2 sides and drink, so that's not bad. The do catering as well. They have a lot of craft beers on tap. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich "bama style" with pickles, slaw, bbq sauce and white sauce. Awesome!!
