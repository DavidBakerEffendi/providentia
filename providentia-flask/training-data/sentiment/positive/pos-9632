Dang, I'm so FILIPINO!

My friends and I always try to go here when we're craving for Filipino food, and we're in the area. Great Filipino food for the price. It reminds me of the one back home! We always get the combo plate with two entrees and rice. If you eat in, you usually get a bowl of soup, which is usually nilaga. Too fatty if you ask me; one sip of the soup put a layer of oil on the top of my lip! YUCK, grease mustache!

One thing to watch out for here is your cholesterol! Geez! You should see the fat swimming in it! hehhe I guess that makes it good, right? 

The line could get long here during lunch time, but it tends to move fast. Also, you can have ulam to go if you don't want to cook at home! The prices are not too bad, so you don't have to cook when you get home!

Salamat, DJ Bibingkahan for always satisfying my craving for Filipino food! I just wish the dishes had more veggies...
