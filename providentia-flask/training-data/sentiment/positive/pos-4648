Edited: I had to give fuku another shot after my first review. The owner graciously reached out and offered another chance to change my mind. Boy, I wasn't disappointed. I tried the Tamago (egg) burger with side of garlic fries with some Chicago to wash it all down. Being a burger lover I have to admit it hit the spot. The patty they use is high quality and you can just taste it. I will return again to try all of the selections .

It's no surprise now to me why fuku deserves the recognition here in Las Vegas. Great spot!
