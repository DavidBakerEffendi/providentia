Rare is it that you get the occasional great deal on the Strip, and even better when the food itself is actually pretty good! It's Vegas, so we didn't even bother sleeping after a long, long...well, LONG Sunday night that somehow turned into 9 AM on Monday morning when we rolled through here. Luckily at that time, not much going on aside from other similarly displaced stragglers, so no wait whatsoever.

If you need some solid breakfast food (or honestly any kind of food) to cure your morning woes, then you've definitely come to the right place. Ordered the chicken fried steak, absolutely hit the spot for me. Plus the portions are HUGE...definitely getting your money's worth here. Also, if you get a chance, their onion rings are completely on point.

Service was great, decor really did remind me of those old school diners from back in the day. Honestly not sure how I hadn't been here before, but it will definitely become one of my go-to spots in the future!
