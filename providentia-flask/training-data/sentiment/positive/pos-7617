If you know me then you know I love basic American favorites like apple pie and... hot dogs!!  So I was super excited to see JJ's Red Hots when I was visiting Charlotte.  It's in the trendy Dilworth neighborhood, has friendly staff, quick service and rooftop seating.  The hotdogs are grilled and delicious!  They have specialty dogs that would satisfy any palate!  I got the Char Heel Carolina style red hot.  It was cooked to perfection and topped with coleslaw and mustard.  It was served on a fresh roll and I got some of their house made carrots and pickles from their "famous" pickle bar.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for affordable tasty cuisine.  I hope to be back one day!
