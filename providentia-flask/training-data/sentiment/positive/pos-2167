I've been to this location multiple times. They have the new "electronic" Cola-Cola soda fountains so there is virtually an unlimited choice of flavored carbonated beverage options. One piece of advice I give all my friends when visiting ANY Five Guys location for the first time: one order of the small French fries will feed about 2-4 people.  You'll see why after your first visit.
