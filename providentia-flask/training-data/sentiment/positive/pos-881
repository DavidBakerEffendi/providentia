I love this place! the food is really fresh and delicious. i've had the grilled chicken salad a few times, and it's always delicious - the honey chipotle vinaigrette is wonderful! i've also had the bacon eggs benedict for breakfast, which was also really good. my grandma's bleu cheese burger was excellent! i highly recommend this place!
