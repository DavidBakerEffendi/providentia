My mother and I were looking for a new crepe place to eat at.... We've finally found the new best place to eat crepes. The fruits are so fresh and sweet. They're not stingy with their items; they pile the fruits, ice cream, and sauce. The crepes were delicious; crisp edges with sweetness from the fruits. I would highly recommend this place.
