Biaggio's has awesome delivery!  Their website is very easy to use and like many have said they deliver everywhere.  The delivery time can be inconsistent, but I try to plan ahead and give them at least an hour for my food.

I have had a hard time finding a good calzone in this town!  Biaggio's has the best!  The crust is perfect, chewy on the ouside and gooey on the inside.   And if you don't like sauce inside the calzone, just ask!  The salads are very nice - fresh and huge.  

Their delivery charge is only $3 and it is worth it!  This is where I always order from when I want a calzone.

EDIT TO ADD: Some people have complained about the kindness and generosity of the owner.  What?  He is not trying to buy a yelp review from you, but he is trying to please his customer base and get your repeat business. That is something every successful business MUST DO, especially in this economy.
