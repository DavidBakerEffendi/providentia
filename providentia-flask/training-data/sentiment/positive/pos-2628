I've eaten at the Keg many, many times (various locations across the country) and have never been disappointed.  Service and food are always consistent, and this is why you choose the Keg, because you know what to expect. 

However, I had a business lunch here yesterday (I've been to this location frequently as well) that far exceeded expectations. 

The staff was very "on" that day, but our server Lynette specifically was fantastic.  She was bubbly and charming, came over the "right" amount of times, our orders were perfect with no mistakes, all while juggling a busy patio of customers.   

We truly did not want to go back to the office.   We left the restaurant smiling.  Job well done!
