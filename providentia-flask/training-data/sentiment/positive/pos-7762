I drive by this incredible breakfast spot every day on my way to work, so when I finally got to try it out this morning I was eggstatic!! Eggstasy did not let me down. 

To start, the staff was very welcoming and friendly. We were sat right away. The coffee was strong just the way I like it and cucumber water...refreshing! We were randomly and happily served the banana macadamia pancakes on the house. Not overly sweet and very hearty. 

I ordered the prosciutto benedict and my boyfriend ordered the avocado benedict. So we did a lil swap and had one of each. I fell in love with both but the prosciutto really stole my heart! The hashbrowns were crispy just the way I like em! 

Then some man with authority, perhaps the manager or owner, stopped by our table a couple times checking in on us, realizing we were newbies. He was very nice and accommodating. 

Basically, I can't wait to go back!!
