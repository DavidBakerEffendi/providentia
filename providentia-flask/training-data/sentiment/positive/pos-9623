The Peppermill is highly recommended- even The Killers' singer Brandon Flowers and guitarist Dave Keuning, who both live in Las Vegas, like this place because it's more local, and a break from all the tourists. But I'll stop and let this interview excerpt do the talking: 

"Flowers and Keuning head for lunch at the Peppermill, an all night restaurant on the strip. It opened in the seventies, and it's just the kind of place the Killers dig- a bit weird, and seemingly immune from vacationing Midwesterners. "We hate big crowds," Keuning says."You can always just pop in and get a bite here. It's a cool place." Eating their salads and runny egg specials, Keuning and Flowers stick out among the Peppermill patrons, most of whom are dressed in tees and tank tops. Flowers wears a cream colored, fake alligator skin jacket he got in London: Keuning is in a shiny gray vest and Dior aviators. But no one bothers them or even seems to recognize them, and you sense that's one reason they like places like the Peppermill. Especially Flowers."

So go on, maybe you'll even spot Vegas' most famous rock band...
