Nothing like a gyro to brighten a challenging day!   Greek food has always been my #1 favorite.  I have always wanted to check out the Simple Greek but anytime I've been "dantahn"   they are about to close or all ready closed (close at 7).

Simple Greek is no doubt a Greek food lovers palace !! Build your own bowl or pita - with your choice of meat, toppings and even sauces people!!  Everything was so fresh and could barely finish the gyro I ordered... it was big. The staff is super friendly too.   Two different types of fries offered- Greek and Fresh cut fries!! I just love that!    It was pure ouranos!!!  

You can buy beer and wine there too (limited availability in the fridge case) Theres so much more The Simple Greek.. I totally recommend.
5 stars easily ...

I cant wait to go back and try something else..

                     Efharisto  "the Simple Greek!"
