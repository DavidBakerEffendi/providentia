Being in Green Valley for 10 years and my kids going to high school and going to Enzos for many many years we've ordered pizza even though time and time again they been rude and tonight when Enzos wouldn't answer the telephone to take an order I decided to try somewhere new m. We placed a order from Jesse's the food was here quickly and we had the wings the garlic knots and two pizzas and it was fantastic if you're looking for a good pizza place that delivers anywhere in Henderson give this place a shot the food was fantastic and it was nice for somebody on the other end of the line to act like they appreciated your business you got a new customer!! Keep up the good work
