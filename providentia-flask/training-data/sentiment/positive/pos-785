I come here all the time, the parking lot kinda blows bc of the way its set up, But theres a liquor store next door so that's awesome. I'm always in and out with no issues I'm so surprised about the other reviews.
I love that they have orange Fanta also. I have bought some cookies and they were good. I'm picky about cookies I like them to be soft not hard and store bought tasting.
