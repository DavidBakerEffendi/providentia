After reading great reviews on yelp, I decided to satisfy my thai food cravings. The place looks newly constructed and clean. I couldn't wait to try the sushi after looking at the scrumptious looking pictures on yelp. So, i ordered Spicy Salmon Maki roll and boy it was delicious. I also ordered Pad Kee Mou with tofu and spicy level 3, it was just perfect for my preference. The entree is big enough to be shared or to be taken home aa leftover. I was very pleased with the food, i am already planning to go back and try other items :)
