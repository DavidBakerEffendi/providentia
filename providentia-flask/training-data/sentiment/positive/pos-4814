Great lunch deal! Gotta love the $10 for appetizer and entrée. Tastes were on par with what I've had in Turkey. 

Got the baba ganoush, which was creamy & served with warm wheat pita. Entrée was chicken andana, perfect flavor & very tender, with wheat bulgar that's beautifully fluffy. Goes terrifically with the hot sauce they give you.  Date had the doner, generous slabs of beef with yogurt sauce. Even their white rice tasted great! We were too full to try dessert but they have a lot of the traditional Turkish sweets. 

Service was attentive & friendly & knowledgeable. Couldn't ask for more. The restaurant is pretty large, with comfy seating & huge windows for people watching.
