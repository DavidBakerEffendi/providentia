I only had a blended peanut butter drink here and a house coffee, but both were to my liking.  The ambience is very relaxing and unique. It feels homey with comfy chairs. I usually feel odd hanging out places if I'm not a regular but this place was welcoming. Only reason I haven't been back is because I moved out of the neighborhood. Would definitely go if in the area and wanting a cup of coffee.
