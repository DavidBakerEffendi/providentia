I was on my path to Viva Arepas and happen to notice the place I have been seeing so many yelper's mention.  So I immediately detoured inside and was greeted instantly.  I told her after I have my lunch I will come back for dessert. Well I did and it was very inspiring first of all to meet such a passionate person. She loves what she does and I can see she works very diligently into her desserts. I was impressed with all the flavors of ice cream and how she was unhesitan to allow me to try them all, as well as suggested some of the lucky charms Gelato for me. 

I love the enthusiasm she has for her business and I truly wish her all the success she works towards. 

On the side note it was pretty cool to stand there eating my delicious Gelato gazing out the window looking out at las vegas blvd, and occasionally at the Indians booty cheeks... ;) and Betty boop panhandling..haha..cooooool!
