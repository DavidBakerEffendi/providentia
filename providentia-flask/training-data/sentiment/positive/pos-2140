When you live in Scarborough, the thought of trekking to the west end for brunch is a tad daunting. The only thought that kept running through my mind was "This better be good, this better be good, this better be good..."

AND IT WAS! In fact I would be so bold as to say, it's one of the best brunches I've had in the city.

My friend got the Fork Scramble composed of Smoked Salmon and Scrambled Eggs topped on a piece of Puff Pastry and drizzled with Creme Fraiche. They got the eggs perfect! They were light, and fluffy like clouds. I stole a bite, and the composition of all the elements was delicious.

I had the Toronto Eggs Benny with Peameal Bacon. Again, perfectly poached oozy egg. I was so happy. And the Hollandaise was top notch. So silky and luscious. Definitely nom-worthy!
