The place is beautiful and after the renovation it will be Gorgeous.
All the worker are happy & friendly. The air quality is good not a fog of smoke like other casinos. They're making the place brighter which I love. Don't like dark places, I need to see my chips and the dealer who is taking it or giving it to me better.

Love the fact that all the rooms are big suites. Love their pizza place by the food court on the right side on casino level Enzo, my favorite pizza place in Vegas. 
Poker room has free coffee & tea station. The poker tables are more roomy. Don't like it being soo tight & can't move. Love the fact their comp is the most, get $2. per hour and you can use it anywhere inside like cash.
