We went with friends to the Tavern for dinner and a charity event featuring a great local band the MacDaddy O's. The food here is just as awesome as you get in Tarbell's main restaurant. Salads are large and awesome especially the the beet salad, very sweet with a drizzling of a light creamy dressing. My husband had the kale Caesar which is huge and easily could be an entree. My husband and I had the flat iron steak which was tender, had a wonderful spice rub and perfectly cooked. the potatoes Comte' was the perfect compliment with the beef along with crisp asparagus. We ordered a bottle of Barbera wine, a full-bodied red which was only $23.00. For dessert we shared the salted caramel chocolate mousse which was thick and chocolaty. All of our friends enjoyed what they ordered especially commenting on the scallop ceviche.
