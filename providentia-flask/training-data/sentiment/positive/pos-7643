I am so excited to have a lazy dog near henderson. I'm from West Covina CA and was missing this place. The food is delicious as always. My favs are the chile verde nachos, bison meatloaf, and ahi tuna burger! You could never go wrong with these 3 choices. Good selection of beer and as always a very friendly staff at the bar area! I will definitely be back! Glad to have them here! Good place to watch your sports games. Best part is they are pet friendly on the patio. I use to take my fur babies to the West Covina location with me.
