There are some places you just want to keep to yourself. Tarbell's Tavern is my hot bath, favorite jammies, great glass of wine, crawl into bed, fire burning, book reading, tummy super happy deliciously full ~ kind of place. I'm not even going to discuss the amazing plates because it's Mark Tarbell. Upscale pub. Excellent music, perfect acoustics for the music and hearing the person next to or across from you. The bartender turned me on to a delicious way to finish off my oysters. It' s hard to stump me on the oyster front. Yet, he did. I never would have picked that liquid accompaniment. I could tell you. But, they can deliver it. I am so lucky this is in my neighborhood. But, I would drive, bike, or pogo there anytime if it's wasn't. Thank you Mark for this amazing little gem and the attention to such fine details. except the pens...wood grain would be amazing with the block. Just saying...Cheers!
