I've wanted to come here forever and Restaurant Week 2014 seemed like the perfect opportunity.  I arrived on-time for my 7pm reservation but had to wait for my table to be made ready which took about 5 minutes.  That showed me just how popular this place really is!!

My guest and I each ordered the prix fix menu and decided to get the opposite of each other so we could taste everything!

For starters I had the turkey meatballs, which were served very tender with a tasty red sauce on top, they were gone very quickly!  I had a few bits of the Caesar salad which was very fresh and crisp.  There was also a bread basket, the butter which has both a hint of honey and salt (HAH) was really good!

Next up was the oven roasted chicken with Mac & Cheese.  The chicken was tender with only one bone, which allowed me to enjoy it instead of hunting for bones and fat to pick out.  My guest had the scallops, she said they were amazing, I've never had them so I have no standard to compare to.

Finally was dessert, the best part.  First a bread pudding served like a tall square cake, and a apple crisp a la mode.  I'm not even a bread pudding fan, but that thing was amazing, so warm and soft.  I love apple crisp and this didn't disappoint, but next to the bread pudding it was definitely second place.

If you want to impress someone who isn't a foodie, come here because the atmosphere and food will leave you wanting to come back.  I can't wait to come back here and have lunch and get more of that bread pudding!!!
