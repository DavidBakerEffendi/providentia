Pick a curry, order your dish on rice or in a roti and voila! It's all just so. Damn. Delicious.

Yesterday we got my toddler a mild butter chicken and ourselves spicy mutter paneer and lamb vindaloo, all on rice. It was a perfect feast for three, plus leftovers. 

I've had their rotis which are also good, but I'm an on-rice dudette when it comes to curries and these places do curries in a hurry very well.
