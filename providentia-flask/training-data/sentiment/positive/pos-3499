Love this bubble tea place! There's two locations in Calgary - one in Brentwood and another in Chinatown. Really great drinks and service! Wish they were open earlier in the morning so I could get one before work haha 

I usually get their early grey milk tea - which any earl grey tea lover should try - but I have ventured out a few times and tried their jasmine milk tea and mango green tea! You can choose to have less sugar and less ice in the drinks so I usually get it half sugar and less ice. My friends love the roasted milk tea and the mango slush with lychee jelly as well! I don't think you can really go wrong here! 

Also I recently discovered the Chatime app where each dollar gets you a point and 50 points is a free regular drink! 400 points gets a gold membership so every 50 points after that gets you a free large drink! Its going to be a bittersweet moment when I get this gold membership knowing that I spent $400 here haha
