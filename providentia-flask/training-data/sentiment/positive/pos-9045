I came here for lunch with friends. First impression: it is beautiful inside and makes me want to ask them to decorate my house! The service was quick and friendly and the server was happy to recommend a dish when I was humming and haaing. Mind you, it was pretty dead, I think there were about 3 tables with people at them.

We had hummus and baba ghanoush to start. They did not bring enough pitas at first, but brought a refill when we asked. Both dips were good and the pita bread was hot.

Then we shared the special Greek salad. The chicken had a great rub on it! I'm glad we shared though because it was HUGE.

I had Jenny's penne for my entree which is a spicy penne with chicken. It was very good. My friends had the chicken masala and the beef kabab which they both thoroughly enjoyed. 

We also were lucky enough to try some of the mixed drinks. My favourite was the mojito relative that they do.
