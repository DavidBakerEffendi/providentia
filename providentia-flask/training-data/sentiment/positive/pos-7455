This hookah Lounge is a nice place to come relaxed and just vibe! It's located right across the street from the Hard  Rock hotel. Came here with my sister around 10:30pm and the main area was packed with folks on a Sunday as well as there patio (which is always a good sign). We were seated in their VIP section (there is no extra charge for this area) in a enclosed section with a walk way. The place itself is dark and from what I saw clean.

We ordered a few things from the menu since we were hungry after a show. The Peach Bellini was $14 and tasted good, the Ka-Baba-Q with beef was $15 and it was good although the beef was quite tough to eat, the CryBaby Curry with chicken was $13 very good and spicy and lastly we had the watermelon freeze hookah for $20 and added a vanilla alcohol flavored base for $10. Total bill came to about $77 with taxes. 

Overall I am satisfied with my visit. This place will be a go to every time I visit Vegas and I definitely recommend if you want a relaxing, chill time with friends and good eats.
