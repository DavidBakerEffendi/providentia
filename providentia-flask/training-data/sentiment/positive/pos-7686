Out of all the buffets I have been to in Vegas, this one is tied for first along with the Wynn.

Even though the wait for dinner was long and the price made me want to shoot myself, it was worth it for a nice splurge. I remember the buffet being big with tons of selection. The quality of the sushi stood out to me and I must have had several plates of it. Couldn't tell you about the crab legs and other seafood items (I'm not into those things), but I did notice that people were piling their plates high with crab and lobster. It's been a while since I've been back, but I remember their "Asian" selections to be really good.

The desserts here were also some of the best I've had. Everything I tried was good! I would definitely come back for dinner.
