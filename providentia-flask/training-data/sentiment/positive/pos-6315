Honestly, it has been an extremely long time since I gad a good pizza. I live right around the corner from this place but have always chose to not go in for whatever reason. This review is long overdue, I have been to this place a few times now and I LOVE this place. Well, the pizza anyway, haven't tried anything else. Well, I did try the mild wings, which really didn't wow me at all. But the Sicilian Meat Lover's pizza rocked! Everyone who has any fondness of pizza needs to try this place out!
