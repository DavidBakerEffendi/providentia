Sitting inside the restaurant right now and I am so in awww of how come I have never thought of coming here before. I have passed by this place so many times but never thought of trying it out. What a mistake that was!!!! Braseiro has taken chicken to a whole new level. I had the quarter chicken leg, it was juicy, grilled on charcoal, it had that charcoali taste. It came with a side of fries and salad. The fries still had the skin on it, which made it even better. The food was fresh, the staff is very nice and friendly. Deserts are as good as the food itself. Coffee was excellent. The restaurant itself is small but cozy. Prices are very good, portions are reasonable.
