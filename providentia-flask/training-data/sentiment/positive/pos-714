Great food and excellent service! I was visiting from the bay area but I will definitely go back! The fajitas were delicious! Our server was Santiago (It's been a few days so I'm pretty sure that was his name). I've dined at five star and Michelin rated restaurants all over the world, and he provided some of the best service from behind the bar I have ever experienced! Great service is hard to come by these days and it was definitely noticed and appreciated!

In summary, this place is a hidden gem! Make time during your Vegas trip to go!
