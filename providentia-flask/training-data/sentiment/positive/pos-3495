Very cool vibe as soon as you walk into this place. I went in around 3-4pm on Thursday and it was dead (which may have been a good thing since I noticed in other reviews that people were complaining about the service) Luckily for me, the service was excellent. One of the employees was on his break and still gave me extra napkins without me even asking and the other employees were nice as well. I had the UFO spam x kimchi fried rice with cheese and it was really great, never had anything quite like it and my boyfriend had the sizzling pork. Both dishes were really good. I would definitely come back here again because there's no other Korean restaurant quite like it. And also the music was good!
