I love the Wynn buffet just as much as I love this one, but the Bellagio buffet gets that 5th star due to VARIETY!

I've only had the Bellagio buffet for dinner, but I've had it at least 4 times.  Each time I enjoyed myself thoroughly, and during my successive visits I knew what to avoid and what to get a ton of right off the bat.

Love their Kobe beef, pesto mashed potatoes, sushi/poke, large variety of pre-made salads, pasta... pretty much everything!  Their steak tartare used to be better, I'm not sure what's happened to it the last couple times, but it just doesn't taste as good...

The one thing that disappoints me is that everything else is higher quality than regular buffets, except for the dessert!  They still have machines filled with artificial and yucky frozen yogurt, average cookies, average cake/pie, good but not amazing bread pudding and cobblers.  This is the one area that makes me want to change the Bellagio to 4 stars, but I will resist.
