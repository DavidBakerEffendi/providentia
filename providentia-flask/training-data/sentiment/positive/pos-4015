Checked this place out at the Desert Ridge location, and on Saturdays they have all day happy hour! I highly recommend the fried green beans! The Margherita pizza was also cooked to perfection! Very intimate small place with a nice outside patio and bar area. I would have liked another side with the pretzel, the mustard was very overpowering, also it was not very busy and our service was rather slow for it being a slower night. Overall great date night spot or if you're in the mood for good pizza, drinks and apps! I'll be going back:)
