Probably the best ramen I've had in Pittsburgh so far. I've been here twice on two separate occasions and have not left disappointed once. The first time I got the Gomoku ramen because I wanted the bokchoy in the broth, but it wasn't worthwhile since there was only one half piece. The second time I got the shoyu ramen and man was that a filling meal. 
The amount of noodles they gave was sufficient to fill even my guy friends, although I have to say I took my leftovers home and enjoyed them later. The charisu was so soft and tender and very flavorful. The egg was sweet and soft in the center. Honestly my favorite part! On a cold winter evening, the soup warmed me right up. And charisu isn't the only meat that's good! The pan fried chicken was also very tender and delicious, didn't taste try and tough  and definitely better than any breaded chicken I've had. It wasn't white meat, maybe dark meat? In any case, the staff really knows how to make their ramen.
We got takoyaki in addition to the ramen. It came with the moving fish flakes and packed with sauces on top and flavor within. Soft and chewy, a little spicy from the mayo I assume, and sweet from the other sauce! It wasn't my favorite because I personally am not a fan of octopus, but I would recommend it to anyone who is! 

I would definitely come back. You have my vote!
