Absolutely excellent! We walked in and were seated on stools located directly infront of the kitchen. It's a long narrow restaurant with only seating facing the kitchen. She asked if this was our first time and after we told her it was she explained the menu and how to order. You get a ticket with a very small menu of 4 items then extras lastly your drink. After we made our selections with their little pencils we put the ticket up on the counter infront of us and they took it and began to cook. The meals came fast, beautifully prepared and presented! It was delicious! Keeping such a small menu had allowed them to cook crash ingredients with homemade noodles. It was a pleasure to watch and a bigger pleasure to eat. The service was wonderful and I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone!
