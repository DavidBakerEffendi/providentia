El Chorro Lodge is not the place to go for cutting-edge cuisine to tickle your tastebuds, but exactly the right place to go when you want to entertain friends with a unique Arizona experience and no risk of disappointment.  You will find great southwestern atmosphere, a beautiful patio, good service, pleasant outdoor service with great views of the mountains, plenty of  good food for fussy eaters, and lots of history.  And sticky buns.  You won't find uniquely southwestern food, just traditional American fare.
