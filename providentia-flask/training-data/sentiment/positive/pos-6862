Wow!!! We had high expectations from reading the reviews and looking at the pictures but we were blown out of our mind by what we got. 

For the $30 incl taxes and tips, we got enough food to feed four. We ordered a daily special composed of vegetables, chicken chop with mushroom sauce served with friend rice and topped with a fried egg (that alone is one dish) and a baked tomato pork chop rice. Both came with a soup and the chicken chop came also with milk tea. 

Flavours were typical of those found in traditional Hong-Kong style caf√©: giving an Asian twists to western dishes. Both our choices were amazing and the flavours definitely reminiscent of the cheap "asian western food". 

Indefinitely intend on returning here sometime in the near future !
