What a great little find!  My first impression was positive when we were asked if we had been in before.  Upon learning we had not been, TSM (the sandwich man) proceeded to welcome us and tell us about their product.  Almost everything is made from scratch.  Salads, soups, desserts, even the condiments are house-made.  They roast their own meats, too!  The only thing I'm not sure of is bread.  I don't think they make that.  They've got a ton of options on the menu, but if you can't find anything to suit you, order whatever you want.  They also do catering. 

My husband and I split a "Rubens Place."  Maple turkey, roasted red pepper, cole slaw, and swiss on rye.  Damn that was good, and I only half-way like a ruben to begin with.  Soup that day included some concoction with chicken and poblano chiles.  Damn that was good, too. 

Perfect lunch spot or easy dinner.  Might want to consider "to-go" because the place is pretty small, although there's a little outdoor space, too.
