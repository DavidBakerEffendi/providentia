What a deal! We got 5 rolls for $25. This place is a hole in the wall sushi spot but worth going to. Not to fond of the neon light feel inside but it doesn't bother me either. They typically are steadily bust so the wait time is never too long which is really nice. Sushi rolls are fresh and tasty. Customer service was on point and our waiter was attentive. This is in the rotation of our sushi spots that we visit.
