Omg! Delish is all I can say! I had the Arizona burrito and it was chucked of wonderfulness!. This Rudy's is the one on Sossaman and Hawes. It is far better that the one by Albertsons. Very very clean, unlike the other Rudy's, I stopped going there because of it. As I entered the restaurant, there were 2 young ladies cleaning and sanitizing the counter tops and even the front of the cabinets! So I was happy right off the bat! At this location you also get free chips and salsa's so I'm sold! I will be back!!
