What an amazing place! I don't know why it took 2 years for us to go, but after seeing the "Diners-Drive Ins and Dives", we had to go since we are trying to go to all the local places seen on the show we had to try it. 
I would have given 5 stars, and I may be ultra critical, but I really didn't care for how noisy the chairs were. The metal legs were screaming against the floor every-time someone pushed their chair, and it sounded like nails a on a chalk board. Now for the food and service: Perfection! The waitstaff was very busy but attentive to our needs. They know their wine selection, and menu like the back of their hands and will give you a recommendation you won't  regret. Have you ever had homemade mozzarella cheese? Well look no further, so silky. I challenge you to find another Neapolitan certified pizza, outside of Italy or New York, as good. The cheesecake and Cannoli were also a very good ending to a wonderful dinner. Word of advice- get there early, boy are they busy! We will be back over and over and over.
