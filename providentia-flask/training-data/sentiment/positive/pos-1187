How can you not love this place? The food is amazing and healthy. The staff is super friendly and nice. The decor is great. Even their washroom is better than mine. The owner must have put some thought into decorating the washrooms and having a proper hardwood floor in there. Ok, coming back to food. Seriously, this place is amazing. Their menu consists of only 2 pages, but they're packed with solid options. My all-time-favourite is the Taco Wrap. It's divine. A perfect meal on a hot summer day. Oh and don't forget to check out their vegan desserts...mmm

Now, stop reading the reviews and go have some food at Rawlicious if you're in the area. Even if you're not vegan / vegetarian, I doubt you will regret eating freshly made raw food. It not only tastes great but also carries a high nutritional value.

TIP: If you feel like having some quality tea afterwards, Bampot Tea House (201 Harbord St) is 5 min away by foot. You're welcome ;)
