Best buffet of the few my girlfriends and I tried. I went back for more plates than I should probably admit to! Lunch was definitely the only meal I needed that day.The food was wildly rich, so I tried to fit some veggies on my plate when possible.

My buffet favorites:
smoked potato salad (ohmigodddd...need this recipe)
seaweed salad
hijiki salad
shrimp cocktail (delicious smokey sauce)
terriyaki strip steak 
kobe prime rib
creamed spinach (the best I've ever had in my entire life!)
mashed potato and beef gravy
flan
bread pudding with peaches

Of all of the dishes that I sampled, none of them disappointed, rather some were better than others.
