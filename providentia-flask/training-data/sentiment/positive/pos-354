I was originally very nervous coming here due to the fact that my boyfriend loves to horrify me about peruvians eating guinea pig.  
However... for my more conservative people out there ...do not be afraid. 

I was completely blown away with how awesome everything was. Sure ...certain entrees cost a little more... around 20.  But the amount of food they give you is insane. Its like ordering two orders at a normal place. The rest of the menu is completely within range of normal food prices.

I had beef kabobs and my boyfriend had a giant seafood platter. Everything was cooked to perfection and the quality was amazing. Love that the food is spiced well, different, and tasty.  They have healthier options as well as fried stuff when youre in the mood to be a fatty. 

The place itself is really welcoming. We showed up 10 minutes before closing and the staff were really nice and did not make us feel like an obligation. They gave us things to snack on while we waited for our take out and had some beers. I never once felt rushed. Even though we showed up 10 minutes before closing on a monday, the food was made to order and did not taste like we'd been given the leftover scraps of the day. 

I Cant wait to try other things on the menu!!

Seriously. GO HERE
