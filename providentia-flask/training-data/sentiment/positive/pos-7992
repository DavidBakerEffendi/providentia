Maybe it's because I'm Scottish, maybe it's the insane selection of great Scotch, maybe it's the wonderfully prepared comfort foods or maybe it's the people who work there who are always so welcoming. 
At the end of the day it's a great spot, I highly recommend it to anyone for a night out or even to sit at the bar have a wee dram after a long work day. I could sit there all day and keep ordering the haggis balls, sausage roll and Scotch egg plate. 

We have enjoyed Burns Supper night and there are many evenings of Scotch tastings offered regularly. 
There is a hidden gem of an outdoor patio for summer sipping and dining. 

But don't just take my word for it, get yer arse over there!
