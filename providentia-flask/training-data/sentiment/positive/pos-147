Caught up with Hey Joe for some delicious Filipino food!  There were four of us and we all ordered the same dish: pork belly. 
Four big pieces of seared pork belly, served with seasoned rice, daikon radish and carrot/jalape√±o slaw plus dipping sauce. Yum. 
Saw someone coming away with a monster lumpia that wasn't on the menu. Wish I knew- I love lumpia.  It was about 8" long and stuffed to the brim. Missed opportunity there!
The pork belly was crisp yet juicy, perfect for the vinegary dipping sauce. The slaw was outstanding and the sticky rice was good too. 
Highly recommend Hey Joe, especially the pork belly.
