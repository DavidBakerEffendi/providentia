Right off the plane if you're around here go buy "The Animal".  I love this little place.   It's quick and simple.  The staff is not grimey and ghetto.  This location is busy but you don't wait more than 5 minutes.  The milk shakes are bomb too.   I love coming here to this specific location when I visit Vegas.  Who wants to get into a Gud-food coma? This spot needs a 6 rating.
