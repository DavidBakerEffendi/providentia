I'm not vegan but I'm a pretty clean eater.
My boyfriend on the other hand is the opposite. A meat loving, junkfoodaphil. 

I took him here just to show him that not all vegan food doesn't taste like dirt. He was a skeptic, but when he left he was like "wow." He loved it...

Everything about this place is perfect. I would give a food review but everything is excellent. I alway stop and get juices and shooters for a pick me up. 

Even if you aren't a super clean eater, you will enjoy this place.
