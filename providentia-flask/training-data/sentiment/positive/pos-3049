Delicious "burrito" take on spring rolls! Filed to the brim with lots of fresh veggies, vermicelli, your choice of protein and avocado, what's not to love? Love how fresh the veggies are and how light yet filling it is. Disclaimer: even the mild peanut sauce has a tiny bit of spice to it so maybe not the best for kids who don't tolerate any level of spice. In a time where healthy food is a craze, I enjoy this take on it. The prices are very reasonable for something so filling and fresh. Not to mention it's great (and wonderfully messy) to eat while strolling around the Farmer's Market. I'm a big fan of supporting small businesses, and I hope I can catch them around more often.
