Rarely do I get the chance to post a five star review but everything was excellent at Roy's on Saturday night.  It was my girlfriend's mom's 82nd birthday and they could not have been more gracious or hospitable.

It started with menus that were special for our table wishing her a Happy Birthday, waiters that catered and understood how 80+ year olds are and did everything they could to make us comfortable.

The waiter even showed up with a camera, took a group shot of all of us at the table and then came back with the pic and a nice little frame as a memento of the night.  Plus they took those one page additions to our menu and rolled them all up and gave them to her.

OH YEAH, and the food was great as well.  Presentation was excellent, hot and flavorful.

Under the "you get what you pay for" column, Roy's delivers!
