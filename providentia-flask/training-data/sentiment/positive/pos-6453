A friend invited me and my husband to the Top Chef challenge across the street from the 7th Street Market, and after she RAVED this was her favorite pizza in Charlotte, we had to try out a few Pure pizzas. 

The setup of pure is like a food court-- order at the counter, and take a seat, and wait for your food. The pies took no time to come out. 

We tried the pulled pork pizza, which was divine.  The dough so chewy and crisp, and slightly sweet.  The pie is topped with pickled cabbage for a nice fresh crisp and tang.  

The chorizo pizza was flavor packed too...as was the simple tomato and cheese.  

BTW: Each pizza comes with a tiny container of local honey.  Honey!  To dip your crust.  Even folks who aren't crust eaters will appreciate the touch.  

BTW Part 2: If you can't make it down to the market, Pure made an appearance at the last Chow Down food truck rally. 

BTW Part 3:  We had the regular crust and the sprouted...and honestly, there's not much difference when your pizza's got so many toppings and intense flavors.  I'd try both...the sprouted just makes you feel healthier :-)
