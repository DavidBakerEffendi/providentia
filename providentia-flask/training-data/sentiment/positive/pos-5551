Haven't had a 5 star breakfast in a while!

What's so different then?  FLAVOR!

I am a sucker for a great omelet...I glanced in that area on the menu and noticed something odd...PASTRAMI as a meat choice!  Let's give it a try :)

Pastrami Meat Omelet ($9.95). I wasn't sure how this combination was going to work out, but I am SO glad it did! Very flavorful pastrami, and everything here was perfect! Love their "home fries" aka breakfast potatoes and it comes with a bagel as well!  One of the BEST omelets I've had to date.

All the omelets come with a choice of side...including a Bagel.  I gave the Jalapeno and Cheddar bagel with Jalapeno Cream Cheese a whirl. So good!  A lot of the flavor was in the cream cheese...love how they pair em up!

I also grabbed some goodies from the bakery side....give the ITALIAN COOKIES a shot if you want a super rich, thick chocolaty cake like dessert.  Not sure why it's called cookies, but I am not complaining on taste!
