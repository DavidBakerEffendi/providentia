I cannot understand the negative reviews! We were met with a smile, no wait and friendly advice to the new-to-us-menu. The whole experience from food to service was above expectations. We were shocked when we finished that the GM said she was buying our meal because she wanted us to get to know them!  

She's right... We will be back to this clean, happy breakfast or burgers restaurant that beats fast food and IHOP. 

Thanks for unexpected 5 star service.
