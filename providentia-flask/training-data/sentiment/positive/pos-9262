Jim Gould is as good as it gets for the Champaign, IL area.  I had the pleasure of being part of a private party that had dinner here, and we had the rare opportunity to learn about how the establishment was revitalized and reinvigorated the Champaign community.

Coming from Chicago, IL, Jim Gould reminds me of a classic Chicago steakhouse, except with much more space.  The ambiance is softly lit, I really like the interior wooden awnings and yes, you will be dining with white tablecloths.

Entree items are priced high for the area but reasonable for what you are getting.  My yellow fin ahi tuna entree salad was well worth the $16 base price and this may be the best compliment I can give a Champaign, IL dining establishment: I slept well after dinner.  Honestly, if I do not have a satisfying meal, it is difficult for me to sleep.  My Jim Gould's meal was satisfying on multiple levels.

Based on our talk with the owner, it appears that the restaurant will try to offer some lower priced items to make it a more regular place rather than a special occasion place that most people know it for.  Definitely check back.

I also have yet to come here for their infamous ~$24 sans tax Sunday brunch.  Maybe I should treat myself, and so should you.
