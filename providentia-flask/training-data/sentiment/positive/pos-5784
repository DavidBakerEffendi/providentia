Let me just start by saying that everything is gluten free in this bakery/cafe! We came here today for lunch and goodies. We were all pleasantly happy by the taste and variety of foods offered. I look forward to trying breakfast and dinner. They just started dinner service recently and the menu looks DELISH! They use local ingredients including Olive Mill and Pillsbury Winery. 
I had the berry salad with seared ahi tuna, mom and sis had the quiche, nephew had burger and fries, niece's had veggie tacos and waffle with syrup. Everything was very good and very fresh. 
I got my free cookie with Yelp check-in which led to a further purchase of goodies including a rocky road brownie and pecan pie square. I can't wait to taste them!!! I did nibble on the chocolate cookie on the way home. Yummers! 
I will be back for sure.
