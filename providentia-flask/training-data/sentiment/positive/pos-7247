i'm a bad yelper when it comes to days and time. I was suppose to yelp this place last year in August. LOL.

My boyfriend went to this place w/ his friends. He called me up and was saying how i should really try this place when we both go to Vegas. I was like okay. 

So i decide to go to Vegas in August, of last year, we made reservations here around lunch time. The place was big and nice. Although it didn't have much people, i still like the atmosphere. 

I didn't know what to order because everything looks so yummy and i just wanted to order everything. Sushi is my favorite food. I'll eat anything or try something new if i never had it. So anyways, my bf was telling me that he had the waiter choose his food. I was like really wow, thats nice. So we let the waiter pick our foods. of course, he asked us what type of dishes do we normal like. We told him our preference and he did all the ordering. 

Man, can i tell you everything was really good. I can't even remember the dishes he picked. Thats how dam good it was. Hhahaha. Well besides it was last year. LOL. I am going to Vegas this summer. I can't wait to go to this place. I'm drowling. J/k.......
