This is a great back-yard-type-char-grilled burger. Expect that and you'll be fine. 

I've seen some comments about the burger being dry. Yup. I've never asked for rare or medium. I'm not sure they could do it right. If I were paying $10 dollars for the burger then I'd expect them to do it right.  It is not a gourmet burger place nor do they claim to be. 

Onion rings over fries.
