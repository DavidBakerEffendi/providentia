We were hungry for lunch at about 11:35 am on President's Day (Monday) in the NW side of Las Vegas. Many choices in the "Boca Park" area. However, wife and I were drawn to a place we both heard about but had not tried yet.
We easily parked nearby and got seated right away. Nice decor of Country Sheik; farmhouse-style but not cheap or cheesy. Simple menu (I like it when there aren't too many choices-just make quality dishes, right?) Splendid surprise for us-was the "Monday Menu."  We both decided on the server (Ace) recommended "Biloxi Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich." The order came with, either Caesar Salad or FFries. We got one of each. Everything was cooked just right, portion-sized properly and delicious. The staff were pros as they were knowledgeable, friendly, timely and available whenever we needed anything.  Monday's Slash the Prices menu is more than worth it!  Run, don't walk to get here and fill your belly with what it deserves! We experienced solid quality customer service from the hostess, server, cook and d√©barrasseur; same as I observed every other party getting.  Bathrooms were clean, stocked and NOT right by a table where people are eating; such a "turn-off" for me when I go places like that. This restaurant is run well. You can tell when you get there and just observe for 5 minutes. Bravo-Honey Salt. We'll be back soon. Probably next Monday : )
