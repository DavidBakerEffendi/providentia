Chapala's is so convenient for me, because it's so close to my condo. I came here during dinner time on a weekday, but their service was great.

As soon as we walked in, we were seated right away. I was craving the authentic Mexican dish, which is why we came here. Before ordering, they bring you chips and salsa (one mild salsa and one hot salsa), so you don't really need to order any appetizers. Score! For my main dish, I had the mojarra with rice and beans. It's basically a HUGE fish (in which I did finish by the way), and rice and beans. Love that dish! You can never go wrong with it. My boyfriend ordered the camarones a la Diablo. It's a dish with shrimp covered in this spicy sauce, ay ay caliente! My boyfriend likes his food spicy, so he really enjoyed it. For drinks we just had horchata. But the great thing about their drinks here is that.....they give FREE REFILLS!!! Yes that's right, you definitely get your money's worth, and they don't try to jip you by charging for refills. 

Definitely want to come back on a Sunday. They have their brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's! COUNT ME IN!
