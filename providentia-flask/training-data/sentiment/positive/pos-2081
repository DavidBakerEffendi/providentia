Awesome service from being greeted to having food cooked perfectly by our server (Min). Always ask for Min, he is the best and very kind. 

The Kalbi is perfection in marbling and just melts away in the mouth.  Other mentions would be the beef belly which is perfect in fat content to where it is like eating kobe slices.  

Pro-tip would be to not cook the meats over medium to retain the best flavour and tenderness! 

Definitely would come back with friends, party of six all left feeling like we got a perfect fulfilling meal.
