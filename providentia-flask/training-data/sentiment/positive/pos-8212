Vibe was a little Uber hip for us, but the incredible, savory, delicious food was worth it. We got the daily toasts, pierogies, and special sandwich. The special sandwich was the most bomb of all, smoky and incredibly filling with mushrooms and cabbage galore. Everything was delicious. The cocktails were well-balanced and beautifully presented. Highly recommend for dinner. (But don't get the laurel tea-it tasted like hot water.)
