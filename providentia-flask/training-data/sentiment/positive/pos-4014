Can't believe I never got around to writing this review.  I have been here a few times, including Mother's Day Prix fix.

The atmosphere here is very inviting and warm.  It is an excellent setting for date night or for special occasions, and the service has always been exceptional.  Rarely do I tip the busperson above and beyond the waiter, but I usually drop a few bucks directly to them for their assistance with the dinner here at Roy's.  They really go above and beyond making sure you need nothing.

The food is always great....I have had some very very good dishes here, but what they excel in IMO, is seafood.  Roy's has some of the best tasting fish dishes I have consumed, and has prepared me my most favorite Sea Scallops to date!   Whether it is full fillet of fish or shrimp and scallop dishes, you can't go wrong!

Only thing that is a bummer is the prices...seems like I never leave here without spending over $200+ with tip and drinks for two, but I always leave with a smile on my face and a memorable food journey, so I will continue coming!
