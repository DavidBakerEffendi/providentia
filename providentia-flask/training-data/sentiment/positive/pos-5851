I have no idea how it has taken me this long to get back to Avenue B. Maybe it's because you have to call over a month in advance for a reservation at a normal time (unless you eat at 5 or 9:30). Seems that every time I call weeks in advance, I can never get a reservation. Why must you be so darn busy? Must be the amazing food, adorable atmosphere and incredible service. Did I mention that I love this place? If you asked me right now, where should we go for dinner, my answer would be Avenue B. If you asked me again tomorrow and then next day and the next, my answer would always be Avenue B. But seriously people, stop going there so I can actually get a reservation!

This trip, I decided to go with one of the specials on the chalk board. A pasta with sausage, spinach and fresh cheese which was not mozzarella though the texture was the same. The best part of the meal? The "garlic crumbs" on the top. What are garlic crumbs and how do I find them so I can literally put them on everything I eat? I was also able to reach across the table and try the schezuan green beans. Didn't mix well with pasta but phenomenal on it's own. For dessert; I couldn't resist the holiday themed ice cream trio- chocolate thumbprint, sugar cookie and (I think) gingerbread. Hubs had to steal the bowl away from me to get a taste. Yet another incredible meal from Avenue B!
