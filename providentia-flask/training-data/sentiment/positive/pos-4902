Ate here about a week ago & Im STILL thinking about it!

Marco the waiter is so awesome you'll wish you could take him home.

The food was unreal. Absolutely mouth watering, incredible, blew me away.
No joke, no exaggeration. With so many Italian restaurants around it is mind blowing when you eat at one that actually reminds you of when you were in Europe.
Seriously dense hazelnut chocolate cheesecake that took me two days to eat! Is it possible it tasted even better the second day? Yes.

The atmosphere, music, ambiance all fantastic. Like being in a real italian family's house instead of a chain restaurant with decor that's trying to emulate it. I adore all the pictures.
Even have super cute & very clean restroom.

Impecable service. 

I am so glad I checked this place out. It might not seem obvious from the outside, its in a shopping center but this place is a true gem. 
Yummy oh man soOo yummy! Go & check it out
