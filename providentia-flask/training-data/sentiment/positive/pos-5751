Vegas buffets are always sort of hit-and-miss for me. Either they offer cheap grub that's usually mass produced and swimming in mystery juice, or it's something akin to a fine dining experience that tantalizes the taste buds and leaves you wanting more even though you're already busting at the seams. Cravings is more of the latter.

First and foremost, yes, it is a bit pricey, but two things that help offset that. First, the quality of the food that you're getting is pretty gosh darn good. Second, you need to use myVegas rewards, if you have them. Getting a two-for-one deal or even a free meal altogether makes it so much more worth it. 

On to the food. Let's just say that nothing here disappointed me. They had plenty of hit soups available that were absolutely wonderful. Their selection of Asian cuisine was unusually good, and what I'd refer to as "Americana" was pretty spot on, too. What I like about buffets like Cravings is that the food comes out in smaller batches compared to other places. This means that the food is fresh and the quality tends to sit a little higher across the board.

Oh, and who can say "no" to unlimited booze? Yes, that's right. Included with dinner is free beer and wine. You can always pay for something a little more fancy, if you want, but why would you? Enjoy what you are being offered!
