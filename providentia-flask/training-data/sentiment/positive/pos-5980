Let me start by saying I do not love chicken... I am very picky when I do cave and eat it.  My hubby drug me here to try and wow... blown away!  Best chicken I have ever had!  My husband got strips and some thighs/legs and I got the Blue Ribbon sandwich!  

Oh let me tell you the chicken is cooked perfect!  It is so juicy yet still has an amazing crust on it!  Also the seasoning they use is out of this world!  It is a bit salty/tangy/bbq'ish/very little spice, so no worries if you're sensitive to spice.  I am and this seasoning was great for me!  And all my goodies that came on my sandwich were so fresh!  Also make sure you try their house sauce... I can't express enough how good it is!  I get a side so I can dip my fries in!  Oh yes also they have the best fries ever... hands down!  Highly recommend!!!!  Also we have been there several times and it is always clean and tidy and the employees are great as well!  Enjoy!!!
