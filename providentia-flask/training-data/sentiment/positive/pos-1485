Don't let the outside fool you, this place is huge inside. A nice bar area with a large dining area and patio. The atmosphere is casual. This is a good place for after work drinks with coworkers, date night, eating out with friends, or entertaining potential clients. Dinner for 2 people including drinks, appetizer, and one shared dessert our total was $65 and some change, but well worth it. 
Our appetizer was the Willow Chips with white queso cheese, bacon, and grilled chicken. These were awesome. The chips are thin slices of fried potatoes. They used real bacon chopped up and a whole thin sliced grilled chicken breast. I ordered the Shells Galore. This is 2lbs of mussels & clams in either garlic butter sauce or spicy diavolo sauce. I chose spicy Diavolo sauce. This was awesome also. My husband enjoyed his Hawaiian BBQ Flatbread made with pineapple, ham, red onions, and BBQ sauce. There are 3 types of crust to choose from, gluten free, crackered  (thin & crispy), and traditional (soft). He chose crackered. I had a Riesling and my husband had the fruiy Willow punch. Our dessert was the rasperry cheesecake, to die for! We have recommended this restaurant to close friends who have company coming into town this weekend. Glenwillow Grille is a must try, we definitely will be going back ourselves.
