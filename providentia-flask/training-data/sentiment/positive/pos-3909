Well, it looks like this has become our regular breakfast joint. We;ve been coming here once a week now to enjoy the oatmeal or fritata or bagel. Lately, since I discovered their delicious sourbread, we've been leaving with full bellies and loaf of bread in hand. Maria, May, Cassandra and the young blond lady who's name I haven't cought yet have been more then helpfull a made our breakfasts something to look forward to. Thank You.
