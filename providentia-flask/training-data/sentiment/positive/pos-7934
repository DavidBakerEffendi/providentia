This place is legit. Dog owners, they allow behaved beasts of all sizes on the patio. For me, this is the best selling point.

I've had a ton of dishes here, including pancakes, french toast, omelettes, sandwiches--probably 10+ meals. I've only come here for breakfast and I think they aren't open past the late afternoon.

How it works is you walk up to the counter, order your food, and pay/tip right away. They'll give you a metal table number and if you ordered a hot or alcoholic drink, they will attach a laundry clip to it so the bartender can find you more easily. I recommend their mimosa or bloody mary. Great iced and hot teas, as well. Come here before/after a walk on Tempe Town Lake.
