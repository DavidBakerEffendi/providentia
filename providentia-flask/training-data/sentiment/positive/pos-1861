In the red corner is falafel and hummus from Nate's Deli.  In the blue corner is falafel and hummus from Maha's Falafel.  The bell rings.  It's a good, old-fashioned slobberknocker of who has the better food.  Both are extremely delicious and offer different eating experiences.  Nate's and its "I let customers know at 4pm that we close at 5pm" waitress hustle and sit-down atmosphere vs. the standup and eat thrill of Maha's at West Side Market.  Both are killer, killer good.  I do like the spicy sauce at Maha's.  But I have to hand it to Nate's overall.  The falafels are less greasy and the hummus is super smooth and flavorful and it doesn't have as much garlic as Maha's.  What made me chuckle at Nate's is they bring you pitas in their original plastic bag and slap them down on the table.  Nothing like saying, "Hey, no frills here."  I don't know why people waste their time at Aladdin's because this place is head and shoulders better.  Everything is made from scratch.  Shishtawook (chicken) rolled sandwich is good but be prepared to each chicken chunks slathered in mayonnaise and nothing else.  Delicious but could have had more "stuff" in it.  Cash or check only.
