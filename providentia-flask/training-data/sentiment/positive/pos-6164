1st off, Breakfast all day 24/7. Who doesn't love that!
2nd, The pies selection is fantastic. I found out that they come from the Market Street bakery in Sun Prairie. Hats off to them!!!!! 
Burgers and dinner menu- Great home cooking! fresh well made food that gives mom's at home cooking a run for it's money! 
"If you are hungry for a great filling meal, just head to Monty's" is my new Motto. 

Love the huge parking lot! Easy in and out every time (if you can find a spot due to me being not the only other person loving this joint)
Wish they had later hours. They are only open to 10pm, which I'm kind of confused with considering they are directly across from the Barrymore theater. 
But...I still have a solid 5 stars for this new love of my life.
