I have been to many sushi places, but this place makes the best tasting sushi ever. Everything here tastes so fresh. I usually order the veggie combo. Their sushi with the shiitake mushrooms is amazing. For the price, you get a decent amount of sushi. The service is very friendly. I also love how they give you a free handroll. I love this place!
