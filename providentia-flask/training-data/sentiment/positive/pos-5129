Stepping into this establishment is like stepping into New England on the coast.  This place is so charming, I love how its entry door is a little shack, and leaves one with woderment of what is to come once you walk in, and down the staircase.  The lighting is slightly dim, giving way to a great spot for a romantic date, or just an elegant touch to any dining experience.  The seafood is amazing quality, fresh, and although a bit pricey, its worth it as AZ doesn't have an ocean, so save a little to enjoy the dishes here.  My favorite is the salmon wellington, and don't forget about the escargot!  By far the best seafood offerings in Arizona, in my opinion.  When its hot out in the middle of the summer, hide in the Salt Cellar, where its cool and charming.  Its a great place to go to all year long, especially great for birthdays/anniversaries.
