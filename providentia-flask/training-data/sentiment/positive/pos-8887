The Old Towne Market Square is pretty darn enchanting.    My cutie pie and hubby were suddenly surprised by the cages of birds along the meandering paths.  The early 1900's cottages are transformed into eclectic shops.  I would never have found this place.  The credit also goes to Miss Monique H.'s review as I scrambled to find a breakfast place for the boys closer to home.  

Hubby ordered the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito ($5.99)  with potatoes.  I told my son that the burrito was almost as big as he was when he was born.  He beamed in ...horrible to think I likened him to a burrito. It wasn't sickeningly huge, but enough to skip lunch and have a light dinner.  It was so fluffly and moist with enough heat to tickle the taste buds.  My cutie pie picked from the KIDS MENU-he decided on the Hawaiian French Bread Sticks ($4.95).  All he wanted was a side of strawberries, which our server happily substituted.  

I had to ask if the Mornin' Monte ($7.79) was similar to the deep fried Monte Christo sandwich-a friend's favorite-my nightmare.  I've never had it, but deep fried battered sandwich scares me.  I've never had a thing for Thai toast either.  They take Hawaiian bread French toasts, turkey slices, havarti, egg whites and bacon to make their Monte.  While all the flavors worked together, I miss the yolk.  Though, should thank them for less cholesterol overkill.  Spicy marmalade....yum!

I noticed they serve AZ raised Angus beef on their burgers...must try next time!

We found a Sunday breakfast fave!!!
