You can never go wrong with this place.  I don't think I've ever had anything bad here.  I love coming here with family on Sundays.  You never have to wait long even when they are crowded.  There is something to eat for everyone on the menu and food is always fresh.  We always get great service as well and prices are reasonable.  The manager always comes and checks on tables to make sure everyone is doing good.  I love my neighborhood egg works. Keep up the good work, guys!
