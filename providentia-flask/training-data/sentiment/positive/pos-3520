Holy mother!!!  Here is the best bulgogi, teriyaki, and spicy pork I have ever had. Potstickers... not so great but the deliciousness of the meat was far to superior to give them a 4star rating.

I was really full when we went here... and good lord did I eat a ton. I just kept eating and eating and eating and eating and.... well you get the freaking. The meat was perfectly marinated and was accompanied with some delicious onions that were soaking in the marinade.

I really wish I could fully explain the experience I had here, but suffice it to say that all you need to do is stop looking at the screen turn on your GPS and get here just to try it.  oh and ps... the random ass macaroni salad that came with the meal was really good to. Not to sweet or salty but the perfect food to cleanse your pallet to get you ready to stuff SOOOOOOOOOO much meat in your mouth.

THE VERDICT: best bulgogi I have ever had? maybe. best spicy pork I have ever had, absolutely. and if you are able to make me even question is this the best ever it makes me think. maybe the best korean fusion place I have ever been to. welp... see ya later.
