Went here for my sister and moms birthday. The service was absolutely amazing. Refills were prompt server was readily available whenever we needed something. 
The food was  really good. I got the salmon and shrimp scampi combo with mashed potatoes. The seasonings were amazing and complemented each other. 
My mom got the steak dian with shrimp scampi the steak was a pepper crusted with a sweet glaze I will be trying that next time. We ordered a whole cheesecake to go the chocolate mousse which we tried a piece before we left and my dad got the teramassu which was also really good. I can't wait to come back and try more food off the menu. The place was clean enough you could eat off the floor and the servers were all dressed in white dress shirts and dark pants to give you a classy feel.
