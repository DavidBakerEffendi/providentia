As a Belgian Beer lover, I was ecstatic to find this place. Initially I thought it was just another British pub, but I quickly realized it was Belgian when I saw the beer menu. Yes, they have everything! Basically a Bier Markt without the pretentious wannabees, the ridiculous prices and focused on Belgium. What else can I ask for???
Been there twice already and every time 5/5. Service is courteous and the food is awesome. They even have the Charbonnades Flamandes (famous beef beer stew), although a bit runny for how I know it from Belgium (in BE it is a bit thicker) but still good. The pork schnitzel was awesome as well, same with the open faced burger. 
Beer wise they got everything - all the Trappistes, Delerium, Grimbergen, Abbaye des Rocs, Straffe Hendrik and Zot and several others that I didn't even know of. There is the occasional risk that they don't have the specific beer, but nothing horrible.
Love this place... exactly what I needed. Belgian Beer fix without having to put up with the terrible things that happen in other big diversified beer places... strong recommend!
