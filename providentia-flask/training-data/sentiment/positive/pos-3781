It's as good as great Argentinean good gets..I had their empanadas, they make them great! This place transports you to Miami. There are so many Argentinean restaurant/Deli' s there...Its great. It's like a once stop shop for Argentinean delicacies and great hot food too! The service is warm and prompt. Their bread that is served complimentary is actually Cuban with their chimichurri sauce, which is awesome! Great place to try, highly recommend.
