Maxwell's continues to be great.  And it is ever growing more popular and crowded.

Come early and you can call in to get your name on the list, but when your name comes up, you need to be there.

Seating is tight, so don't count on large groups getting seated.  The traffic is too heavy to accommodate.  

Each day there is a soup special, each home made, and the menu remains static with some items on special each day.  Not a lot of variety but they stick with what they do best and that is what you get.

Bring a coat for winter if you get stuck inside the door.  It is just a door without a wind break, so that cold air envelopes you quickly.

Lunch is a better bet and especially if you are outside of noon to noon-thirty.  11:30 is good, likewise 1pm.
