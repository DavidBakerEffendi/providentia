Where the hell did this come from?!  But I'm glad it came!  I happened to overhear some people talking at the coffee shop who stopped for lunch at Casa Rasta, and were raving about the tacos.  Never let it be said that eavesdropping doesn't pay off.

Having taken over the ever changing former home of Broadway Pizza, there isn't even a real sign up yet, but don't be scared off by the lack of advertising.  When you walk inside, the small dining/waiting area is completely clean and organized, if a bit plain.  You definitely know you're in for quick take out or a fast meal.  But it will be a fantastic fast meal.  The owners, the two Rastas in question, have taken the taco to wonderful heights.  

Corn taco shells are standard for the tacos, with larger flour shells for the burritos.  Their menu is small, but potent.  On this first visit, myself and my lovely eating partner had a mix and match of the Pulled Pork, Citrus Marinated Fried Pork, Chorizo, and Jamaican Jerk Chicken tacos....and they each blew our minds.  Filled with a good helping of meat, each taco comes with cilantro, onions, and a bit of shredded lettuce.  The meats are all perfectly seasoned.  My personal favorites were the Fried Pork, which had its own special pepper sauce, and the Jerk Chicken, which had a mango salsa that will blow your mind.

There are also beef, steak, and two vegetarian options.  Any of the fillings can be made in taco, tostada, burritos, tortas, or quesadillas.  The prices are good with with Tacos being $2.50 and Burritos being $6.  There's none of that price up charging for extras, as has become the norm in many places.  They also have weekend specials and homemade salsas.

Fantastic food, good prices, nice people.  It's all you could ask for.  Well, maybe a credit card machine.  But as they are still only about a week into being open, and they are already hitting on all cylinders, hitting the ATM for some cash is totally worth it.
