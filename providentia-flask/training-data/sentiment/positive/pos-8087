For all of you who LOVE the pies at Sun Prairie, DON'T order your favorite pie at Sun Prairie, and here's why.... 

So we came here for the Farmer John's Smoked Gouda- something we tried at Sun Prairie. It wasn't on the menu, but I was dead set on getting it (it's delicious), so the staff pulled up the ingredient list, and did the best they could with what they had- warning me it was not going to be the same. I got home, and it wasn't the same, and  I was disappointed. I wrote a bad review. 

So why the five stars?
1. They did the best they could to get me the pizza I ordered, and warmed me it wasn't going to be exactly the same (I didn't heed the warning, and that's on me). 
2. The owner replied to my bad review! Whoa! Explaining that two locations do not carry the same ingredients, and therefore have different menus- each boasting their own specialty pies.

I was hoping that the downtown location was just another place to get Sun Prairie's fantastic pies. It's not, and I was disappointed. Kind of like being disappointed that France is not Rome. What I now realize is that the downtown location is a place to get a whole range of totally different fantastic pies. Much like realizing that France has something completely different to offer than Rome! 

There are two places I am going to miss when I move out of Madison- Square Wine Co & Salvatore's Tomato Pies. One provides the best wine in the states, the other makes pizza better than anywhere in the world (yeah, I went there). Both have service that can't be beat.
