This is definitely our go to bagel place. The bagels and bialis (by the way never heard of these until coming here but they are great!)  are always fresh! Whether we take bagels to go or eat breakfast there we are always very pleased. Everything we have ordered there is delicious and the service is friendly and quick. Sometimes on weekends we bring our dog and sit on the patio. It has a very homey feel.
