This place is cool. They have a gigantic bed that is really fun to lounge on and 5 super big been bags and tons of games. They even now have these cabins they built in the back that you can rent if you like and it is next to the only PLEXI GLASS Skating rink I've ever seen. Everyone that works there all the way down to the security guards are super friendly. It is clear that the owners and/or managers have a cool outlook on things and have made a point to make everything (about going to the GoldSpike) great.
