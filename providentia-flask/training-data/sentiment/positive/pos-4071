Oh wow this is good. We just moved to Spring Valley and have had to pass this plaza a few times but for company this weekend we stopped in for some delicacies.
I just paced and paced and enjoyed the view of Bulgarian feta, sour cherries, blintzes, sausages, salmons, seasoned cooked chickens, noodles of all kinds, hams, salamis, pickles, Armenian eggplant sauce, pickled mushrooms, breads, pretzels, Russian and international cookies, chocolate treats, cheeses, unique beverages, pastas with fillings, grape leaves, German plum and berry cake, apple pie, and on and on and everything so delicious.
We got 6 lbs of sausage, some apricot filled chocolate covered gingerbread, herring, and some of the cooked chicken and onions.  Of course while we were shopping the very helpful young woman at the counter fed us more samples than all aproned people serving treats at the Costcos in New Jersey all at once. We tried ham, chicken, sausage and then she pulled out a little plate of different foods: including the best potato salad. We had left our dinner marinating at home while we shopped. I have no right to eat anything now til Midnight!
We just moved here from LA and missed Schreiner's German deli in Montrose near Glendale. The woman at the counter told us that they had just opened this shop 2 months previously. 
Well we think we have found most of what we need for my dear Bulgarian chef who misses his Westfalian ham from Schreiner's.  We shall return. What a treat and also a great spot for those lovely little Christmas surprises you would want to put under the tree as well.
I have not really covered all the amazing treasures here so you should really check out Tina's.
