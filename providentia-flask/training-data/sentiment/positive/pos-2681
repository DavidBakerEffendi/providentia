We went for happy hour and sat outside. Kool retro 80s 90s music was playing. He enjoyed the saki bomber and i sipped on the sake and some hot green tea. We enjoyed the shrimp tempura roll and the Las Vegas roll. He thought the Las Vegas roll was a little too soft and creamy because it is deep fried with cream cheese in it. The shrimp tempura roll was just perfect. Nice place and atmosphere. Will be back!
