I quite enjoy this place! I work right behind it so I go here alot. I mean really ALOT. Since September I have received 3 free sandwhiches! (Buy 9 get the 10th free)
The King of Queens and the Bronx Barbecue (without butter) are my absolute favorites, but everything I have tried there is really good! It could be $1 or so cheaper per sandwich. 
Its always dead when I go there though, I hope Jimmy John's doesn't put them out of business! (there's a new jimmy johns opening in the old quiznos space in the building right next to Gandolfo's)
