God, I love this place.  In fact, I'm obsessed and I haven't been anywhere else for dinner in months.  The charcuterie is outstanding and very well priced.  The pretzel fondue app and the rock shrimp make me cry.  They recently added a filet and, although I'm not a filet fan at all, that's all I ever get.  The wines are really well priced and the cocktails are fun and festive and awesome.  But the servers may be the best part of AB. 

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
