As I stated in my earlier tip, they have beignets AND chicory coffee. The beignets are prepared (fried) fresh and you can request to have chicory coffee, served in either single or double service in a French press (how appropriate). I have been to New Orleans several times (I had many outstanding reviews on my experiences proclaimed on Yelp, but Yelp staff elected to delete most of my BEST reviews--out of state and intl travel) and this experience was mildly reminiscent of Cafe du Monde. Only mildly so, because there is no outdoor seating available. But the service was charming and so was the serving setting. Step in the door and feel yourself propelled to another place/another time.
