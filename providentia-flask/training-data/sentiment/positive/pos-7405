I fucking love the Venetian. 

Let me count the ways: Bouchon for brunch. A casino that's always poppin'. Tao, still hanging in there. Sephora next door. Bouchon bakery for real morning coffee and a midday sugar rush. The fake Sistine Chapel skyline. Huge rooms with huge beds and huge bathrooms. The Canyon Ranch pool deck. Carnevino next door. Walking distance to Fashion Show Mall. Glorious Vegas tackiness without the sadness that some of the other casinos exude. 

The Venetian is Vegas perfection and I hope this little piece of fake Venice stays here forever.
