Y'all. JJ's takes hot dogs to a whole new level. Service is always fantastic and the food is so fresh and yummy! My favorite is the Char Heel with house made chili and diced onions and yellow mustard - definition of a Southern hot dog. Perfect for a summer day, especially with a yummy treat from King of Pops!
