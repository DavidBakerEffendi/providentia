Everyone is always so friendly here, the staff is great and being knowledgable on  food allergies which is SO appreciated. 

I like the casual flair of the interior, chalkboard menu, lots of food allergy friendly options as well as "regular". ASSIGNED ovens and fryers so there is no contamination. 

My go to here is the GF Hoagie, Italian. If there is one thing my allergy makes me miss it's big messy Italian hoagies. And it never disappoints. Perfect level of crisp toasted texture from the bread without the gross heaviness abs texture some gf bread can have. Great amount of meat and cheese. So awesome, it's a great try! Maybe next time I come into the city from Greensburg I'll try the ravioli !
