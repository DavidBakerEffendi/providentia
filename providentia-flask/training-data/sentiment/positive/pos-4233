I asked my korean friend where to get good authentic korean food in K-town and he told me Kimchi house. So I had high expectations when I came here. 

It was very quiet on a Sunday evening with maybe two tables busy. My boyfriend and I ordered their army stew (everything unhealthy but oh so yummy in a spicy broth). Everything we ate, from the stew to the side dishes tasted very authentic and had another depth of flavour. The stew wasn't just spicy but rather you could taste that there was a broth that was beneath it giving it richness. The kimchi was tangy just like others but slightly different.

All in all, one of the better quality korean restaurants (they also have a lot more options) but its slightly pricier than the other places surrounding it (I would totally pay the extra dollar or two).
