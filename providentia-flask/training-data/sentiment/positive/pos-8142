Quite possibly the best Vietnamese place in downtown, and maybe the best I've ate at in Calgary.  Lightspeed service, an extensive but affordable menu (sub $10 prices on most items), and lots of flavour. Excellent spring rolls. Note that this place accepts cash only. Also note that to pay, you'll need to go up. They won't bring the bill to your table.
