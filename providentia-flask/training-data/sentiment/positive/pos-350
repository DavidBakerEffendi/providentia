I have been going to "Tom's Thumb" now called "The Thumb" for many years, the food here is excellent and I can't say that I have had anything that wasn't of top quality. My only complaint would be that pricing can be really expensive, especially for the casual style eatery it is. But you get what you pay for and that is especially true when eating at The Thumb. A must stop for anybody visiting in the north Scottsdale area.
