This treasure of a restaurant is worth driving the miles to reach it. We had tapas last night and all 3 were delicious. Had the shrimp ceviche, cheese plate and grilled veggies. As usual I remember too late to snap a pic. We will be returning later in the week before we leave town and I'll try to get a pic or 2. 
Our waitress was attentive and gave us excellent suggestions on the menu.
