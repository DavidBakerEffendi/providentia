Even though I go to Concordia I don't think I would have had the pleasure of visiting this place had an Iranian friend had not taken me here. 

Food was absolutely delicious. Tried the chicken, beef, and sirloin kababs and all were yummy  pieces of smoky, juicy, and tasty goodness. The rice that came with the kababs was like crack. It was buttery and fragrant and enough of it that I think I could have split my plate with another person. The lentil soup that came with our meals was forgettable, but that's ok. 

Decent prices, very good food.
