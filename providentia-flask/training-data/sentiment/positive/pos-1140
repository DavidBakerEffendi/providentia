More people need to come here :) My nephew's birthday was today, and wanted pizza for his birthday. After reviewing pizza places on Yelp, me and my sister decided on this place.

Right when we come in, the owner welcomes us warm and friendly. He talks to our whole group, and makes my nephew the birthday boy feel special. He gave him a donut and a candle, and made his whole crew sing Happy Birthday to him.

The owner knows how to keep his customers happy, he brought out italian cookies, and offered us drinks. I've heard the meatball sub was fabulous, I have yet to try. Everything seems reasonably priced, and reasonably good.
