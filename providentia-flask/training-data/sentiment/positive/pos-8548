Everything was PERFECT!  Dying for peanut chicken and curry on my way home...a few hiccups with understanding when the order would be ready for pick up, but so worth a confusing phone call!  

Crab Rangoon had a delicious, seasoned filling.  Peanut sauce was a little thick, but so flavorful.  Kung Pao chicken at medium heat smelled spicer then it was.  Yellow curry at medium.... PERFECT!  A little burn in the mouth, sweet vegetables, broth consistency was dead on.

Can't wait to go back!
