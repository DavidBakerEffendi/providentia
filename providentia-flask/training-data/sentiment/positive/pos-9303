Was at a mall for the first time in almost a year. We decided to try the food court. It had some interesting choices. We came across this place. The menu looked good, then I saw they had felafel. Had to try it. My wife and I ordered a felafel pita, fries, chicken souvlaki, and baklava for dessert. It came to $30! Then we got the food. Wow. It was great! Well worth the$. Only drawback was their ketchup, or the stuff they try to pass-off as ketchup. Chef choice from restaurant depot is not ketchup! Hunt's is not ketchup! Only Heinz can really be considered ketchup. If it ain't Heinz it ain't shit! Anyway, the food was great and was some of the best baklava I have ever had. We ordered more to-go. My wife doesn't eat leftovers, but she actually got a to-go box for later. All in all I was very happy and will eat there again if I have the opportunity.
