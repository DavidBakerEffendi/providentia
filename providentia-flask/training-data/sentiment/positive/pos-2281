Can someone ever top Poké express in Vegas ??? The answer is NO ! I always end up getting Poké express pretty much every week now. I always go to the Craig location but love going to the eastern one due to the fact we can dine in there. Also a Hawaiian restuarant is is next to it where we can order some Garlic chicken & mochiko chicken with rice ! 

Just to summarize my review I love Poké express and I wish I can be sponsored by them. (Ahahahha) all the workers are very friendly and not stingy with the food.
