Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar serves hands down one of the best lattes I've had in Montreal so far! Located in the Village, it is easily accessible to downtown dwellers, workers, tourists and passersby. The only downside I find is that it closes so early (6PM everyday).

Small and simple, the venue is decorated with cutesy works of art for sale. The barrista was very nice and produced a killer frozen latte. What more could I possibly ask for?
