Texas Roadhouse has it all for sports fans and steak lovers! Great prices, service and quality food. 

I've had both the chicken and filet salad and have to say the filet is phenomenal and the chicken was tender and flavorful. 

The sirloin is a bargain with 2 sides for $10.00. Burgers and side salad are good as well. 

Big secret: you can call ahead and reserve a table. This is necessary on busy nights.
