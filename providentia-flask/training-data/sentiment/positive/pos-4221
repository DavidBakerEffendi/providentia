Like many of the other reviews, I took advantage of the Restaurant.com offer.  You get $50 off but need to spend $100.  

My advice is to wait when they offer 80 or 90% off the Restaurant.com offer.  Normally you can get the $50 coupon for $20 but they offer discounts and then you can get it for just a couple bucks.

Onto the review....

I love this place because of the food and service.  You really feel at home and it does not feel stuffy.   The owner comes by and talks to you about the dishes and gives every table attention.  

We ordered  the following:

Carpaccio di manzo con arugula - Thin slices of raw beef tenderloin with arugula, parmesan cheese, and EVOO.  This was very light and fresh.

Butternut squash Ravioli with Brown butter and Sage  - Very fresh...pasta had that nice bite in texture and the sauce was the boss.  You can also order a smaller portion which is what we did so these were our 2 apps.

Branzino Served Tableside - This was one of the off-the-menu items.  As stated in previous reviews, the restaurant typicaly has 8-10 daily specials.  I recommend def ordering one of them up.  The fish was simple but fresh and good.  A little lemon, EVOO brings out the freshness and taste of the fish.  

Ossobucco served on saffron risotto - the best dish i ve had in months.  so much flavor and you can tell some old lady's been slaving away cooking it in a dutch oven to get all the nice, juicy flavor.  You don't need a knife for the shank and it's so rich but worth it.  The risotto is perfectly cooked.

To round it out, we ordered a side of broccoli rabe, tiramisu (awesome!), coffee, and with tax and tip we were out the door for just under $80.

For the quality of food and service, the meal would have been close to $200 on the strip, but with the coupon we had a great time for a very reasonable price.

We'll be back fo sure!
