Wow I know this place looks like a hole in the wall, but do not pass it up! The menu is huge and I didn't see one plate in the place that didn't look amazing. Also if you don't know what to get they will suggest something perfect for you. It has been a long time that I went somewhere for lunch and really wanted to go back for dinner.
