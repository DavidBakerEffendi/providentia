My favourite take-out place in the city. Period.

These roti's are absolutely delicious. I've tried most of the roti's on the menu but my favourite is the "Mixed Vegetable Korma Roti". I like it extra hot! 

Half a roti is a more than satisfying meal (which means you have lunch ready to go the next day).

The prices are good, the service is friendly and quick. It doesn't have the nicest looking storefront but the food is amazing. 

Take my word for it and check this place out!
