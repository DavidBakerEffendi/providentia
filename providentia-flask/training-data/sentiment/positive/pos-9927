We have been driving past this place for weeks and always curious about it. We like qdoba and chipotle so we wanted to compare. Let's put it this way, we've been back 5 times in three weeks. What keeps us hooked is the quesadillas for my wife and the spicy steak for me. I also highly recommend their signature sauces, my fave being the hot head sauce.
