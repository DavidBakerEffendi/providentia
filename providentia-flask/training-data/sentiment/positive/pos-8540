Wife and I have been back twice since the first review, and, holy cow, this place is absolutely deserving of 5 stars. Hey, Yelp, give me star discretion and this place gets six. 

I love local businesses that show how much they value their product and their customers, and Z's got the formula down. While they don't have the sheer number of flavors of some place they still have a solid selection. And every one we've tried has been as good if not better than their competitors. And you cannot beat how they treat customers. 

Seriously, if you live in the SW burbs or get through here every so often, stop in and give Z's a try.  It's worth every calorie.
