We rode our bikes down to NCounter on Saturday for lunch. I now have a new favorite breakfast/lunch spot! The menu was great ( breakfast, salads, sandwiches) and the ambiance was fun.  I had a delicious sandwich and my wife had an omelet. Both were very tasty and well prepared.  Next time I plan to try some of the delicious pastries at the counter. Cinnamon Pecan roll looks great. Definitely headed back.
