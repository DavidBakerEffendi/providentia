That chicken sandwich is no joke!!! I enjoyed this restaurant the week before Christmas with 4 others at lunch time. I had to try the chicken sandwich after reading the reviews on here of course! It came through with flying colors too. The taste was spot on, and the combination of crispy breading with crunchy cole slaw and pickles elevates it to another level. The most amazing part was the chicken itself. I don't know if it's because it's organic or what, but the chicken was so tender, juicy and full of flavor! I usually don't think of chicken as having much flavor, which is why so many sauces and breading are added, but this meat had actual mouthwatering flavor. The chopped salad that accompanied the sandwich was a very substantial side dish that could be equally successful as an entree itself. It was delectable and unique with the faintest taste of salad dressing. Chef Kim came over and introduced himself and told us about the restaurant being an inspiration of his and his wife's to expand their home entertaining. He pointed out furniture and a chandelier that came from their personal home. He also expressed their love of re-purposing furniture, and cited various items that had a previous history of serving another purpose. I absolutely loved that the bathroom walls are lined with plastic hotel cards (keys) to various destinations that the owners had traveled to. Some even had their names on them. 

The service was outstanding. The day I was there, the place was packed and the service still remained efficient and friendly. We all 5 left there amazed by our dining experience. I can't wait to go back, but it's going to be really hard to try something other than that chicken sandwich!
