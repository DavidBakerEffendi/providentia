I've been here twice and both times were AMAZING!  I got omelets both times, once with a side of waffles.  My husband got sandwiches both times (not a breakfast man).  We both have agreed that this is one of the best brunch joints around.  It's a little pricey but very worth the occasional visit!  Service was quick both times as well, even though we went during very busy Saturdays.  I think we maybe waited 10 minutes after ordering despite the place being packed.
