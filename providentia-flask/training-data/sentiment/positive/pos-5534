Our 2nd time at Anthony's and it was so good!  The bread basket came out and it had sourdough, raisin bread, baguette and bread crisp with poppy seeds.  Reminds me of poppadums.  Fresh bread, what can I say!

We ordered the following:
- 12oz Prime Rib rare - Like butter and sitting in a pool of au jus, comes with an heirloom tomato, a grilled artichoke and a bit of greens.
- 14oz Rib Eye - Tasty, tasty, tasty!  Grilled to perfection and rare as I had asked.  Very well seasoned with salt and pepper.  Also comes with an heirloom tomato, a grilled artichoke and a bit of greens.
- Sea bass - very well received and tastes out of this world!  Comes with bok choy. 
- Halibut - also delicious with a pineapple garnish.

Side dishes:
- Mashed potatoes - very creamy and smooth
- Sweet Potato - very well prepared
- Asparagus - I love the way they prepare the asparagus!

Excellent wait service at M Resort.
