The food is always great and fresh! I love the specials, the atmosphere and the service! Robyn is the BEST (Asian waitress) and she always remembers my drink order and never gets my food wrong. My husband and I only come here when Robyn is working because we know we will have a great experience. We come literally every weekend! (Also have multiple friends that do as well)
