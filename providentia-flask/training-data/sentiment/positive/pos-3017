Service! Service! Service!

This is the industry where bad service will break you. Zeera's does not have to worry about this. 

I have been meaning to come here for quite some time. I went in alone as I do most of the places. Took a seat by the door and awaited a server. Avtar the owner came to greet me. He was very welcoming and friendly. I decided to try a few things from the menu. Avtar pointed out that I was ordering too much and I should stick to a couple of dishes so that I can enjoy then. I settled on the butter chicken, my all time go to favourite Indian dish. I judge every Indian restaurant on their butter chicken. I was not disappointed at all. The Kingfisher beer was a nice compliment to the meal. 

The thing that really stood out during this visit was the service. Avtar asked if I minded that he sit with me. He figured that since I was eating alone, I wouldn't mind the company. Now normally, I would have declined, I actually enjoy my solitude.  We had a wonderful conversation. I felt like I was having a meal with an old friend. 

I will be back very soon.
