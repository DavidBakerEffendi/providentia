I'm a local and this is easily the best bar I have been to! The laid back and sexy vibe will keep me coming back. Jeff and Cesar were so knowledgeable on every one of their specialty spirits. Not to mention they have a great Gin originating from the Rouge in Oregon, where I am from. They have a different punch cocktail everyday that I have learned to love. Myself and my friends will definitely be back!
