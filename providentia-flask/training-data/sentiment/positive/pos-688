This is one of the best free attractions in Las Vegas. I never get tired of seeing this fountain show. It's in front of the Bellagio on the top of the hour. 

It's a mesmerizing site to see the water dance to the music. The choreography is outstanding. There's always different songs playing. 

The best song I heard for the fountain show was Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman's Time to Say Goodbye. It just moved me beyond words. Definitely a great thing to watch with your significant other.

It's beautiful in the day and even more spectacular at night to see. You will love it. I guarantee!
