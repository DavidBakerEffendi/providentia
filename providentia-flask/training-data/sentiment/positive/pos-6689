URBO is brand new, conveniently located right off Fillmore and 7th Ave easy to get too from any location.  URBO is located on the ground floor of a brand new gorgeous Apartment complex.  URBO opened 4 days prior, and it still preparing menu and drink menus, very excited to see in the next few weeks.  URBO also has a section of items needed such as snacks and drinks, for customers.  Very convenient for Apartment renters as well as patrons from local areas. 

Food;  Waffle with Nutella and Strawberry, was delicious - waffle crisp with nutella drizzled on top with Strawberry bites.  Ordered a Iced Latte, and Barista recommended adding Jasmine, the hint of Jasmine was just perfect to add a little sweetness.

Service;  The Barista was outgoing and friendly, very patience with me looking at everything.
