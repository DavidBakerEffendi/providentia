Summary:  Awesome Hot Dog's and Burgers. We have visited this new restaurant a few times now and find the food and service to be consistently good. We plan to go back. I highly recommend it !

Location:

Nicely decorated and modern looking. Short and easy to navigate Menu. Their core focus is Burgers, Hot Dogs, Fries and Shakes. There are a few (well placed) large,  wall-mounted Flat Screens usually on ESPN. There is (limited) seating in the front for a quick in/out or waiting for your takeout. However there is seating in the back. I suggest you secure your  table before ordering if you have a larger group because space is limited. 

Positives:

Details of last visit: We brought some friends by for our second time and they loved it too. There are good food choices for Kids; our Daughter really liked the kid's grill cheese. Her friend gave a 2 thumbs up for the Kid's Burger and they both LOVED the fries - actually we all did :-) The adults tried the Sweet Potato and Regular Fries, Barbecue Burger, Hot Dogs and the Garden Veggie Burger. We all found the food to be Hot, Juicy and VERU Flavorful.  

Opportunities:

Hamburgers are Delicious but a  bit pricey; $1 or $2  higher than I would expect. Overall Meal Price-Point for the 3 of us was $33 for Hot Dog, Sweet Potato Fries and a Drink / Barbecue Burger With Fries no Drink / Kids Meal Hot Dog and Juice. Feels like it should have been closer to $25. We would visit more often if the prices were a bit lower. 

Need some level of Hostess service to help (at least) larger groups of 3 or more. For example: in our last visit, we had to arrange and clean our own tables to accommodate our group of 6.
