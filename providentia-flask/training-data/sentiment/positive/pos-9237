Oh my lord, amazing BBQ! 

Just like Jeff P, I was quite surprised to find amazing food at a random gas station/convenience store/car wash. But Guy Fieri knows no wrong (for the most part). The wait is worth it if you have time, especially during the lunch rush. Both times I've been here recently, the line hadn't been terribly long, just enough to barely make a decision on what to order (both times the pulled pork and sweet potato fries). When you order, they're upfront with the wait time, and I appreciate that. 

Mostly everything BBQ-related comes plain so you can choose your BBQ sauce(s) and douse or lightly dress it to your liking. I'm a huge fan of the original, the Texas (a bit spicy), and one of the southern q's. Also major fan of using them for dipping in the sweet potato fries (both times have come out fresh from the kitchen!). I like that they give us all the BBQ options at the toppings counter and a description of each. 

Plus up for their fresh teas (that don't come out of the Coke Freestyle), and the Coke Freestyle machine that has the best crushed ice ever! 

If you have some time to kill, peruse thru the convenience store part and you're bound to find something interesting to play with or buy or both.
