How does this place only have three stars?! This was our first time trying it. It looks like a cute old diner! We got the three appetizer platter. The fried mushrooms were okay, the fried mac n cheese was heavenly, and the fried pickles were amazing! It was only $8 too! We got the Oreo cheesecake shake and it was delicious as well. I got the 3/4 patty and it was way bigger than I expected. It was so good and juicy. You get to pick what you want in it too. (: Sasha was an amazing server too!!! Will be back. (:
