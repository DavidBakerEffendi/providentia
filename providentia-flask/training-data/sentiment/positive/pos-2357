With all the hype surrounding this place, I was prepared to be disappointed; it turned out to be quite tasty. We had a shackburger and a shackstack, fries and vanilla concrete- all delicious. The lines at 330pm were minimal but I am sure they'll be worse again by 5pm. They run a very efficient operation, thankfully!
