OH MY GOSH!!! If you have not tried Bertha's Cafe, you, my dears, are sorely missing out.  Great lunch. I mean really, truly great.

If I could give Bertha's 6 stars, I would, darn it.  From the adorable "scrapbook"-like table numbers they hand out, to the homey restaurant, to the mini-red velvet cupcakes, to the best pasta salad I have ever had, this place has it down to the "T".

They have perfected their sandwiches, the "cracked pepper and sea salt" chips are tangified and kettle cooked, the Chicken Tortilla soup had just the right amount of "kick" to it, and the harvest salad was enough to make me come back every day.

Bertha's Cafe is a quaint, quiet delicious nook of a restaurant where everything is home made, no trans fats, home made dressings, you get the gist.  They have unique sandwiches and fabulous salads that come with a bag of chips AND a cookie! Seriously! I felt like I was stealing from my grandma because it was all too good to be true.

Just a tip: Get there before the end of April!  They will be closed from April 24 - June for a remodel and they will reopen on Indian School and 32nd Street (the owner told me all about it today!).  The new place will be bigger, and hopefully the restroom won't be in the back of the kitchen!
