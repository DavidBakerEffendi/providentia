Zarra's is on the short list of places I hit every time I visit Pittsburgh.  It's the closest thing you'll find to eating at your Italian grandmother's house.  The decor is a hodgepodge of antiques and odd artifacts that make it very homey.  The staff always includes Zarra's family members and they always remember you.

The food is fantastic.  The sausage and meatballs are made in house by Johnny, the recipes are from Judy's family and some of the dishes, like the ricotta noodles, you won't find anywhere else.  I get mean cravings for the sausage and peppers over pasta.  Your entrees will come with giant garlic bread and a salad with homemade dressing.  Unless you stop eating halfway through your meal, you'll never fit dessert, but, if you do, the sweet creations are also all made in house.  I recommend the homemade cheesecake, it's light and fluffy.  One year Judy made me a homemade cake for my birthday and it was the best cake I've ever had in my life.

Sometimes the meal takes a bit longer than you may expect but that's usually because the staff is chatting at your table but I'd rather have an overly friendly staff any day.  It's not uncommon for the owner to pull up a chair and shoot the breeze.
