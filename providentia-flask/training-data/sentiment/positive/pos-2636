I have been there twice, and it's one of the best Asian restaurants in the neighborhood. First things first: good drinks. Then, all of the food items I have ordered are delicious. The kind of place where you can shut down your eyes, point to a coupe of things on the menu, and no matter what it is, it will be delicious. You want to be amazed and surprised? Try the buns. I have been thinking about the buns again for several days, imagining the texture in my mouth, wondering how they make it so moist, and how they give the "bread" this black color?! It's a place to go amongst adults (like a date, or a night out with girl friends, etc.); they were friendly when we brought our baby in, but it's just not convenient given the setting. 
I want to go back (again)!
