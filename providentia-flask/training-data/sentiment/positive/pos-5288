This is my favorite Asian restaurant in Tempe!  Also, my boyfriend Mr. Picky Eater likes it too!  They GET tofu.  They have tofu so good that even my non-vegetarian friends order it instead of meat which is fairly unusual.  Every time I try something different (the broccoli dish, the Mongolian, soba noodles... ) I have a new favorite!  The manager seems really cool and attentive.  He really seems to care and that is at least as delicious as the food.
