So I am a newbie when it comes to sushi, but Ive fallen in love with it and fallen in love with this place. I hate going to restaurants and only being able to try a few rolls and already having a tab of 30 bucks. This place I tried so many different rolls on their badass conveyer belt and its sooo not expensive. Each plate is between 1.5 dollars to 3 bucks. We had a stack of plates and 4 big brewjas and it only came out to 40 dollars.... Will definitely be back loved the atmosphere and the chill mood.
