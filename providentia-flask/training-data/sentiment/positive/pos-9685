With little changed since my original visit save for an upgraded decor I'll keep this update brief - order the Lombardo Grilled Gelato Panini and thank me later for it is by far and away the best "ice cream sandwich" I've found to date.  Ever innovative and amongst the very best businesspeople in Las Vegas suffice it to say that Desyree, et al are a true local gem and with textures on par with reference standard operations like Capogiro, Grom, and Il Laboratorio with daily innovations far outstripping any of the above I would go so far as to say that there is no gelateria doing what Art of Flavors is doing stateside today...a grilled ice cream sandwich with savory and sweet in perfect harmony just another feather in the cap of a space that continues to wow.
