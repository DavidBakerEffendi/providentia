As a huge seafood lover, how is that I did not know about this place before?  I know this place is tucked away on Temperance Street but am I ever glad I found it.  

We ordered oysters, the smelts and the grilled octopus as apps.  All were delicious but the standout for me was the octopus.  It was melt-in-your-mouth tender and incredibly well seasoned and very flavourful.  I would have that dish as an entree if I could!  Amazing!  

I ordered the scallops as an entree.  Three plump scallops were served on a bed of creamy mushroom risotto.  Again, the scallops were perfectly seasoned and cooked and melted in my mouth.  The risotto was also delicious.  My dining companions had the special of the day (sea bass) and the halibut.  Both were excellent.  

We ordered the chocolate brownie for dessert to share.  It was served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  A very decadent finish to an amazing lunch.  No dinner for me tonight!   The risotto and brownie made this a splurge meal but it was so worth it.
