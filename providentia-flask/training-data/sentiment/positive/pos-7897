Awesome spot. We have been wanting to try this place for some time now and finally made our way there. My son loved the fish tank and the grandmother loved the shopping area. As for the food, all of us enjoyed it. It's definitely a different experience and can be a little odd when driving up, as it is a gas station and car wash. But don't let that be a deterrent. Give it a try and enjoy it!
