We returned for a second visit, after really enjoying our first. We were not disappointed !! :) It was just as good as the first visit. It was very busy hectic Saturday but we got a great booth and did not feel rushed. I ordered a classic english breakfast with coffee and it was all fresh hot and perfect. Again, the service was great. Cant wait for round 3!!!
