I really like this place. It's bright and cosmopolitan. It feels like an oasis in the middle of downtown.

The best part by far, though, is the music. In particular, they have someone named Dane Vannatter sing there every so often, and he kicks ass. He sings all types of songs, but I remember his rendition of Al Green's "Let's Stay Together" in particular. He's amazing and is alone worth the trip to Andy's.
