If I had to die, my last meal on earth would be Mexican. I love it so I rate it very highly. And after a recent bad experience at a competitor's Mexican restaurant I decided to try Paco's Tacos for the first time. 

I came here on a Thursday night around 8 with my husband and a friend. It was pretty busy, but we got seated right away. Our server greeted us with water, chips and salsa. The salsa was great. It wasn't chunky (my husband isn't a fan of tomatoes) and had the right amount of spice. The chips were light and crispy. They tasted homemade. They were too good I couldn't stop eating them. 

I ordered the two taco combo, which came with rice, slaw and beans. All for only $11 (they are full size tacos too!)  I got the charro beans. It reminded me of baked beans and was something different from your typical black or refried beans. For my tacos, I mixed and matched. The shrimp taco was my favorite. The chipotle ranch sauce was on point and there was TONS of shrimp on it!! There had to be at least 10 pieces. I also got the turkey carnitas. The turkey was moist and not dry. I would recommend the shrimp instead. My husband got the Paco's taco (beef brisket), which was my second fav. 

Overall good vibes at Paco's tacos. I would highly recommend it to anyone and I will be back soon! 

Ps try the slaw with your rice. It's awesome.
