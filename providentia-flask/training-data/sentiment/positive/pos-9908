This place is great! They have typical food + 5 beers or 1 soju combo. The food is good, the side dishes are awesome, and the waitresses are nice. If you order a lot of dishes, they give you generous on-the-house dishes! I brought my friends here and they love it. We keep going back and we haven't had any bad experience so far. Definitely one of my favorite bars in Toronto =)
