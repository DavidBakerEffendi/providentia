I am a HUGE fan of Roy's in general.  I've been to his Hawaii Kai, Woodland Hills, LA and this location in Vegas. 

There so many new restaurants that keep popping up in Vegas but why mess with a good thing.  I know I will get top-notch service and superior food.  The staff are extremely knowledgeable and will bend over backwards to handle any special requests.  

I even got a Thank You card in the mail from the manager a couple weeks after dining there in early January.

True ALOHA spirit!
