Found this place on Yelp this morning when searching for a new place to grab some breakfast/lunch to go. It's just a few miles down the road from us, in a strip mall you wouldn't look twice at, just above the Tempe border on Hayden. 

After reading enough convincing reviews, we checked out the menu and called in an order to pick up. The guy on the phone was so friendly and helpful! He let my bf sub turkey for ham on his bfast sandwich, and explained that he could just straight sub out the same amount of turkey for ham and it wouldn't cost extra, but if he paid $2 more he would get a full serving of turkey (same amount they'd put on a turkey sandwich). He opted for the upcharge and reported that it was well worth it!

I ordered the Prima breakfast sandwich, which says it comes with bacon, but I didn't see or taste any (which ended up being just fine). The first bite was a taste explosion in my mouth-so much flavor! The eggs tasted fresh and the tomatoes were perfect...combined with the gooey cheese, the perfect pesto, and the crispy/fluffy ciabatta bread it was exactly what I was craving. Definitely my favorite breakfast sandwich in the area, and it's cheap to boot!

I ordered an iced soy chai, which is so unlike chais anywhere else-it's FRESHLY MADE! From actual tea and spices! And the lemonade tasted like a state fair frozen lemonade, only better-super fresh and tangy but sweet. The total for both of us was just under $20 (two sandwiches, one with turkey added, and two drinks). Great deal, considering how fresh everything is!

As for atmosphere, I can see coming here with a laptop and getting some work done (they have free wifi!), When you walk in, it's bright and friendly and the dudes working there take pride in their ingredients, which shows. I can't wait to come back for lunch!
