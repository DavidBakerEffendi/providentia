My Vegas stay was absolutely perfect - mainly because I stayed at the Venetian.  I was in town for work and was by myself, so I really didn't get out and do much.  This makes the hotel you are staying at that much more important.  I've stayed at three different hotels in Vegas now and I can honestly say the Venetian was the best of all three - it was like heaven!

When I walked into the suite I was so impressed, I thought they gave me a free upgrade.  There was a sunken living room and three flat screen TV's - all for one person.  It turns out all of their rooms are mini suites like this.

Wi-Fi worked flawlessly and there was a good selection of restaurants within the hotel.

To sum it up in one word - SUPERB!
