I normally go to the Pete's in Mesa. Work down the road from this Pete's. They did not disappoint! The food was great and the service was great as well. I don't see how everyone has so many complaints. Yes the area is really sketchy but it's south Phoenix. I will continue to come here as long as I work in the area. They do NOT accept cards. CASH ONLY. I almost forgot.
