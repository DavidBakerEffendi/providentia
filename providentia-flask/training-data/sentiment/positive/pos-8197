We saw this show several times during our stay in Vegas.  They have them every 15 minutes (after 8 PM) or half hour during the day.  They play different songs every time, so it's not the same show every time.  It's a great show to see during the day AND night.  If you have a chance, try to catch both daytime and evening shows.
