This has become a regular hang out for me whether dining alone at the hidden bar or dinner with friends in the dining room love love love the eggplants rigatoni Roberta is one of my favorites shrimp scampi outrageous and the antipasto salad is out of this world I like the fact that I can bring my dog when the weather is nicer and sit outside it is perfect and 2 minutes from my house I'm super happy
