Love this place, walking into the front desk area, takes my breath away every time.  Seeing all the rich marbles and mosaics, love the look.  Here for a conference, and appreciated it in this venue, so I could stroll through one of my favorite casino's on the strip.  Perhaps one day I'll get to stay.
