Finally-good pizza in the desert! I grew up back east and had a summer gig at a Jersey Shore pizza joint for 10 years. I never understood why it was so hard to replicate. This is the real deal-from the crust, wings and homemade dressings. Your first bite will hook you in. Next time we are trying the subs and such and dining in!
