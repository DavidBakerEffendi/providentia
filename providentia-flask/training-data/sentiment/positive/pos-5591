This place was recommended to me by a fellow Yelper and I couldn't be happier to have taken the advice. We arrived a bit early for our reservations so we sat at the bar and had a pint. The bar is located right inside the door but you don't feel like its too over crowded. 

Once inside, its quite the gem. The wait staff were brilliant, the food was very well made. We had the Calamari to start and then I had the Gnocchi while my BF had the Pasta with Sausage. We were both very satisfied! My only complaint would be that the wine menu didn't offer a whole heck of alot. 

The prices were beyond a bargain. I highly recommend this place for date night or for a social gathering. Its worth it!
