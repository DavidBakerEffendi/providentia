I returned to this location after followup with a manager, and I feel a lot better about the service here. As usual, the food is craft made and very delicious. Our waitress, Carol, was upbeat and helpful from the moment we walked in. She made sure to be attentive to the table and check up on us often. I wish I had this experience the first time. We ordered Buffalo Chicken Pops, Nachos, Pizza, Chicken Parmesan, Thai salad, cajun fries, and a flatbread. The flatbread was PHENOMENAL. It was by far my favorite thing. Simple, yet the flavors were wonderful. The cajun fries are awesome with Chipotle ranch. I was impressed with the nachos, as well. The food is quality for the price. The manager, Jose, stopped by our table to introduce himself and made sure everything was satisfactory. We had a much better experience this time and very much appreciate the extra care that staff took.
