Only been here once for a birthday lunch but tried a decent amount. 

There is only one important thing you must know. Best BLT EVER. I have had my fair share in my day and this one will always stand out as best. Tomato jam paired with the smokiest bacon I've ever had? Genius. 

Cuban sandwich was also ridiculously delicious but it was hard to follow up the amazing BLT.
