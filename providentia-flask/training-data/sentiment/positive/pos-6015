Top-notch everything.

 Pop corn shrimp, calamari and sashimi for a wonderful appetizer start, followed by steak and swordfish that was perfectly tender and seasoned, creamy lobster bisque mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus for entrees. Smores, cinnabons, and icecream for dessert. Oh my, and my drinks from the bar was made how they are supposed to taste!

To die for!! Service was on it, not too over-bearing, not ignoring you.. just right. Got us pretty pumped for the night to go out, can't wait to come back. Not to mention one of the pastry chefs is my friend and totally knows how to customize our food to our liking.
