Burritos seem to be the next food on the rise and thank god for that cuz I love em. This place is awesome, went here to grab dinner for me, my boyfriend and 2 friends one night. I ordered the steak, you get to choose whatever toppings you like and I'm pretty simple so I just got cheese, jalapeños, hot sauce, burrito sauce and lettuce. The burrito was like the size of my head and for 2 plus 2 drinks came to $17. Not bad seeing as I could have eaten it for a week. The steak was flavourful and delicious but I warn you, the hot sauce plus the jalapeños was a taddd too spicy for me, so unless you like the eye watering, nose streaming kind of hot I wouldn't recommend the combo.  The only thing I wish they had was avocado but I guess beggars can't be choosers. You can bet your bottom dollar ill be back for another burrito real soon.
