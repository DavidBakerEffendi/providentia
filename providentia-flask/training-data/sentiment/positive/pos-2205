I love Postino.  I have been several times including brunch and am always extremely happy.  The re is a great selection of wines and craft beers which they will let you sample before committing.  All glasses of wine and pitchers of beer ( a little over 2 glasses) are $5 before 5 pm daily.  This is a great deal and makes for a perfect weekend activity on the outdoor patio.  

The bruschetta planks are incredible.  I've tried almost all of the different options and they are all great.  My favorites are the prosciutto combined with dates and the warm artichoke spread.  The other food options look good but I can't get away from all the awesome bruschetta combinations. 

The service is always good as well.  The servers and bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly.  

The location is good in Kierland Commons so if you want to shop after that wine you have plenty of options.  Sometimes parking can be a bit of a challenge in peak times.  The same with seating as the location is pretty small.  Get there early on weekends!
