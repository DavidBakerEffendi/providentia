This is a must see attraction when visiting the Las Vegas Strip. The fountains move to the sound of music in a rhythmic fashion, a pretty cool one and done experience. Be sure to get a good spot because it can get crowded around the Bellagio. If you miss it, don't fret, it is on a timer so will repeat. At night it is beautiful.
