Best service I've EVER had here. Sat in the bar, had three servers more than attentive. There was never a moment I was looking for anything. The food was hot and delicious. Ordered the rock lobster (amazing!) with snow crab legs and shrimp scampi. I told my server I'm never able to effectively open crab legs and bless his heart he grabbed gloves and offered to do it for me. Biscuits are great as usual but I am more impressed with the exemplary customer service today.... Kudos to this location and the management for getting it right! I will be back....
