First time there today (I got a mailer with some coupons and decided to try it out) 

I placed my order online and was ready in 8 minutes! Very fast! 

In my opinion, pretty affordable place. My large bowl was $9 

I ordered the Mac and cheese with buffalo chicken and was very happy with it. I used a coupon to get a free app and I ordered the Korean meatballs. Holy smokes! Tasty!!! But spicy. Everything was cooked well and loaded full of flavor. 

I'm looking forward to my next trip.
