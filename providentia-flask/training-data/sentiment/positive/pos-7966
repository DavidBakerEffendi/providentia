I LOVE this place!  I could eat here every day!  I never have any problems getting in and ordering.  The staff are very nice and friendly.  My favorite dish is the chicken bowl and chips.  I love Chipotle's "Food with Integrity" motto.  Chipotle isn't just good for me but good towards the animals and the environment!
