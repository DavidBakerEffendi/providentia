This was my first time at TC Tacos and it did not disappoint! I ordered a breakfast burrito (eggs, cheese and potatoes) with avocado instead of meat. Wow! The tortilla was soft and warm, with the perfect balance of each ingredient. They have a great salsa bar as well, and both the mild salsa and tomatillo salsa were incredibly fresh and flavorful. The price and quality of this giant burrito can't be beat. I look forward to coming back and trying more menu items.
