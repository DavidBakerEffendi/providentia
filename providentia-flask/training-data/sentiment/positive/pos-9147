Been here a few times and everything we had was good and the service is great especially with the call button that is attached to each table. This place reminds me of an Asian style Buffalo Wild Wings or Wing Stop just with the fusion of American comfort food and Asian influence with emphasis on Korean specialties. I love the bulgogi fried rice and the Soy Garlic Chicken Wings. Great place to sober up after going to the club or a long day at work.
