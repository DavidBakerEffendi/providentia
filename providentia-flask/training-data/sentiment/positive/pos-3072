The review is based solely on the food. If you want something different and something tasty, you should give this restaurant a try! 
I tried the Pollo Saltado and it was very good. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the sauce with the tomatoes and onions was delicious. The rice was cooked the right way, not undercooked at all, it was almost melting in your mouth!
My husband tried the Aji de Gallina, it's a chicken stew made with cream, cheese, aji amarillo and nuts! It was so tasty and so delicious! 
We like to try new restaurant and support local businesses, it was my first time trying Peruvian food and won't be my last!
