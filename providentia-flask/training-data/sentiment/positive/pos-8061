One of my favorite things to see in Las Vegas. From when I first visited, to when I moved here, to this very day 8 years later, I still love to see the fountain show.

The best thing is it's free! I usually plan the vending with visiting near by attractions and make sure I get to see at least 4 shows. The music and the water show is different each time and are coordinated accordingly. From Frank Sinatra to Andrea Bocelli to Michael Jackson there is something for everyone. The shows are a half hour a part and later in the evening 15 minutes apart.

A perfect place to bring you out of town guests or just visit with your own family.
