So delicious!!! I made plans yesterday to visit for some poke and malasadas. This was my first visit and definitely won't be my last. When I arrived I ordered 1/3 containers of spicy avocado poke and one with furikake seasoning. I also wanted some with mayo but a girl in front of me some what cleaned it out.

Afterwards, I ordered 4 malasadas. Two regular and two with custard.

It was all so good!! Next visit I'm going to go all out and order my poke again and something from the lunch menu.
