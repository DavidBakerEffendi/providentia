A diamond in the rough! The freshest, most spectacular seafood selection in all of Las Vegas. This place is exactly what fine dining is all about. We love the atmosphere, the service, the selection, and the quality. It's a unique and adventurous treat. We are local Las Vegans and we usually avoid The Strip like the plague and even on occasions when we've ventured down to splurge on some super luxurious, high-end restaurant we've been disappointed but we'd come down for RM Seafood ANY day!
