I have stayed in many hotels around the country and this one is by far in my top 3. Four friends and myself decided to take a long weekend trip to Vegas in March 2007. When we arrived to our room we were in love. 2 big beds and then step down 2 steps into a nice sized living room. We had so much room for 5 people (and it was a good idea since the room was so damn expensive). They have ok slots, card games and roulette. But I prefer other casinos for games. The gelato is delicious in the lobby area and they have tons of restaurants,shows and activities to keep you busy 24 hours a day.
