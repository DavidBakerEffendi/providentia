My boyfriend and I love this place! Best place in the Valley for sure! Young, the owner and his staff are super nice and friendly! We usually get the Orange Chicken (which is made with dark meat), egg rolls and pad Thai  and it is AMAZING!! After coming here, I don't want to go to any other Chinese Restaurants. It is all reasonably priced and large portions. Thank you for such amazing food!
