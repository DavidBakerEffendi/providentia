2 story Italian restaurant with unique food choices and themes on each floor. I ate on the second floor and we ordered the margarita pizza, arugula salad, and beef tartar with an amazing bottle of chianti and for dessert the chocolate hazelnut marjolaine. I have no complaints about the food or the service. I am excited to come back!
