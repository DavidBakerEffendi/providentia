After receiving a much needed facelift in decor and menu, the Field Club has entered the 21st century in style. We dined here with friends who are members (we belong to Longue Vue across the river) and we were thoroughly impressed with the service, food, wine selection, and atmosphere. We had an incredible, reasonably priced Meritage wine, delicious salmon with rice, roasted tomatoes and arugula, and homemade sorbet. The chef brought our food to the table and it was a beautiful touch. After being outdated for some time, the Field Club has stepped up their game and has delivered an elegant and fresh dining experience.
