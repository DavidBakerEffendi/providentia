Not one complaint here, this burger place is right on time. Got " The  Big One" with American cheese and fries for $5.49. The place was packed when I was there during lunch time, we waited about 10-15 minutes to get our food, and I was VERY pleased with every bite. 

They have a condiment bar to add your own toppings, all I added was a little mayo, ketchup, and mustard.....that burger was a flame broiled disc of greatness! Fries were perfectly crunchy and tasted extra special dipped in ranch. 

The place has great atmosphere and a cute patio area to sit outside when it's a nice day, service was prompt and courteous....can't wait to go back here.
