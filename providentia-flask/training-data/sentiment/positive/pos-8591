Great place. I love in Lakewood and pass by here a lot and have been wanting to try it since it says organic. Stopped by today and was impressed. As a multiple business owner I always look at the details of a business and this one guy 5 stars in so many areas.  The place was very very clean, the owners were friendly, they even wore gloves while they made the juice which was a plus.  I got the energizer.  It was great.
