Battista's may not be considered "fine dining," but it earns a 5-star rating from me! I love bringing visitors here, and here's why:

  * Ambiance: This is old-school Vegas. There aren't many places like this anymore, with big red booths, dark secluded rooms, and celebrity photos on the walls. 
  * Service: From the hostess to our waitress and busser, everyone was friendly and professional. Too bad we missed the accordion player on the night we visited.
  * Price: Meals range from $23 to $41 per person. A steal, when you consider they offer tons of food and all-you-can-drink wine!

And, most of all ...

 * Food: Great cheesy garlic bread. Great salad (more like an antipasto than a traditional house salad). A tasty cappuccino after dinner. And Italian classics like chicken parm ($31) and veal marsala ($34), plus faves like spaghetti and meatballs, linguine and clams, lasagna, and ravioli. Although the underseasoned entrees are the weak links in the lineup, they are still pretty tasty. And did I mention ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK WINE?! And they aren't stingy with it, either. Ask for red, white, or both, and they will bring you a carafe or two--or more. (Just don't be a lush and spoil it for the rest of us!)

This may be just a "hole in the wall," but as the landscape around it changes, I wholly hope Battista's is here to stay!
