Mall food, who would have thought it could be so delicious! 

Take away the screaming children, punk-teenagers, and the smell of Abercrombie and insert Kyklos, a delicious hidden treasure within the Galleria Mall's hoppin food court. 

Greek eats, gyros, rice and meat plates, enormous salads, and FANTASTIC SERVICE! The chicken gyro was one of the best I've had in a very long time. Most ethnic cuisine leaves me a bit weary when it comes to meats, especially chicken. But! Kyklos serves recognizable, lean meats served with tasty Greek sides. 

If you are in the area, in the mood for Greek, give Kyklos a try! This joint is definitely a healthy and delicious option and one of the Mall's most redeeming food court qualities :)
