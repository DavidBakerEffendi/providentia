My son and I came here for breakfast. I love crepes, and this place did not disappoint. The current place is rather small. But pic told me they're moving to new location as soon as it is finished. We both had the strawberry shortcake crapes and they were delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try some of their other creations. They all look delicious.
The two gentleman behind the counter were very courteous and friendly. And seem to enjoy their jobs very much.


The new location next to Williams and Sonoma is fantastic. Plenty of seating and French music, what more can you ask for. 
They have expanded their menu with some me items. Everything is delicious. I love their crapes and their panini's delicious.
The crÃªpe club continues to be my favorite Saturday breakfast spot.
