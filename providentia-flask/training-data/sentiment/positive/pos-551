I read a review here on Yelp and I was interested in trying them.  I live on the east side of town so it was across town to find.  I found it and was I happy.  The Gentleman behind the counter could not be nicer he explained how it was his wife who ran the shop who had to run out.  The selection of cupcakes for a Monday afternoon was impressive.  I ended up buying 4 and piece of the sugar cake square.  Everything was fresh, the store was small but very clean.  I even got the chocolate cake pop that was out of this world.  I gave it 5 stars because it was worth going too.
