If you want to have a good time in Downtown Las Vegas you need to come here. They always have great live entertainment, great beer, and any drink you can imagine. The party is always lit here weather people want to dance and drink, or if they want to socialize and play their larger then life games. The games range from oversized corn hole, to beer pong, to Jenga, and even 4 square. You can feel like a big kid in a play ground when you are here.
