I've only had one kind of pizza at Pure Pizza, but I loved it. I had the 5 cheese pizza on sprouted grain dough. I went at lunchtime on a weekday, and it wasn't that crowded (granted it was a Friday in the summer, when it seems to me like half of Charlotte doesn't go to work, so maybe it's busier other days). The 7th Street Market is a series of different, almost booth like, stores, from fresh juices, to a coffee bar, to a bakery to a butcher's case, and Pure Pizza is just about in the middle of it. You order up at the counter, and then site in a food court like area, and they bring the pizza out to you when it's done. It took a while for the pizza to come out, especially since I was on my lunch break, but once it arrived, it was well worth the wait! The 5 cheeses blended perfectly, but the best part was really the sprouted grain crust. They gave us a litle side of honey to dip the crust in, but it wasn't even needed, The crust had almost a baked in sweetness to it. I did dip in the honey once, but it was almost distracting from the full flavor the crust had on its own.

I ordered the 10", to share with someone, and it was the perfect size. 3 regular sized (not those extra huge pieces you see sometimes now) for each person.

I loved the pizza, and I will definitely be back.
