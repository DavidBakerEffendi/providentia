I love this place. It's unassuming, unpretentious and just downright delicious. It is the mother of all things coined "hole in the wall." It's a family owned and run joint, and the place before this restaurant was open was probably not a restaurant. Even cooler. Even though the menu has English, no one here actually speaks English so just point. 
Self serve rice and water, utensils are in the box at the end of each table. Get your own drinks from the cooler. They have bek soju, raspberry (I think) soju, and chamisul. Hite is always the beer of choice at Korean joints. 
I've had almost ever dish here, and you have my word when I say NOTHING on the menu is below DELICOUS level. Order the pork and squid bulgogi (spicy) and thank me later. The meat is always quality, and the soup is always piping hot. The older lady will come by and harass you a bit if she sees left over food, but you won't understand her because it's in Korean and she does it with a huge smile so it's all good. But don't break her heart and finish you meal ok?
