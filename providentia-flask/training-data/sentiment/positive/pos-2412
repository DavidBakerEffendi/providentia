My wife and I like this place. A lot.

Most people know about their happy hour, it is one of the best around.

Make sure you get on their email list. Some of their "off menu" specials are a good excuse to have a fun night out.

Friendly service and really good food and wine. This place is always a good choice for dinner.
Steak, lobster, scallops, cooked to perfection or they will certainly make it right.

Cheers!
