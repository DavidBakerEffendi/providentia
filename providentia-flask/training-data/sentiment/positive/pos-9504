Best Pizza in the city hands down!  It was love at first bite when I tried the Americano. Think big mac in pizza form - genius right?!  Other pizza places don't even exist to me anymore.  Another great choice is the Mila - a delicious white pizza with mushrooms and prosciutto.  Other honourable mentions are the Pepe (hot!) and Bonjourno (Think breakfast).  

As if a grande Americano wasn't enough - you can also get their dessert pizza which come in nutella or cookies and cream.  Hungry yet?
