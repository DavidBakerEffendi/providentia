This place is unique and fun. My boyfriend and I went here with another couple right before the Indians game for some beers, tots, and hot dogs. The sauces you can order are memorable. Make it fun and order a bunch! I enjoyed their tater tots but only because of the sauces. Besides that, they weren't too memorable. They have an excellent beer selection and their hot dogs are unique. Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed!
