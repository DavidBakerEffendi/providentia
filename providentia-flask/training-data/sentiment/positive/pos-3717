THIS PLACE IS AMAZE BALLS!!!! THE FREAKING CHICKEN WINGS ARE THE SIZE OF A BABY'S FIST! I think I've been to this place like 15+ times already. This place is really that good. I get so excited talking about this place.

Location: It's located in a plaza with icy juicy, modas cafe, and cue-d's. Parking can be a bit of a hassle depending on the time of day you get there, but you shouldn't have a problem finding one. 

Vibe & layout: The place has changed a lot from it's early days. There's a decent amount of tables, I never had to wait for one. Everything is pretty modern, they have buttons on tables that you ring if you need a waiter. 

Customer service & Food: I haven't had one bad customer service so far, the waiters are attentive and if you ever did anything just ring the bell. Prices are very fair too. I always order the family style half and half soy garlic, and sweet and mild. You can definitely share it with 2-3 people so it ends up being really cheap per person. Beware of the SUPREME SAUCE it's a bit spicy. Get the cabbage salad with thousand island too! Their sauce is dank 11/10. 

Protip: They change their check in offers every once in a while, but still take advantage of it! So far I've seen free dessert, free soda, free shot, and now I think it's free shaved ice.
