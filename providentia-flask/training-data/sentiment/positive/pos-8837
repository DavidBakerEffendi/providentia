A Montreal staple, Romados serves up some damn good Portuguese chicken along with other bar b q specialties. The fries doused in herbs and spices give the meal a nice side piece. 

Romados doubles up as a bakery serving fresh baked breads and pastries for ya sweet tooth. Finish off the meal with a refreshing drink that you can't find at your local grocery store.

Spacing is limited during busy hours but take out makes for a nice little picnic at the park down the street (Mont-royal and Parc Jeanne-Mance to the west and Parc Lafontaine to the east).
