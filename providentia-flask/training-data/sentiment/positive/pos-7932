I came here with my family at noon on a Saturday and we stood in line for at least 45 minutes.  (No surprise.)  We eventually got seated and the service was decent, could have been better.  (But hey, I'm here for the food!)  The food spread was great in that there was quality and variety.  You've got your seafood, your sushi (limited variety here), your meats, breakfast foods, pastries, fruits, salad bar, pastas, Chinese food, fruits, ice cream, mini cakes.  (I'm probably forgetting some, but you get the idea.)  I missed the dim sum that Cravings has but my family said that they had gone to Cravings the previous day and it was terrible in that they had gotten rid of a lot of stuff, such as the dim sum.  Disappointment!  The consensus among my family was that everyone was very happy with Bellagio.  I'll be back here.  Forget Cravings.
