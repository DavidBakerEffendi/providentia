By far my favorite breakfast joint in Las Vegas. I get the same exact thing every time I manage to make my way over here: Half order of the Denver Omelet w/ Wheat Toast. Most people do not know that the half order is 2 eggs and the full order is 4 eggs but let me tell you... if you're constantly going home with leftovers, try the half order. It is still extremely filling and it's literally only $6.75 for the Denver half order. It comes with potatoes, toast and the omelet still!! Best bang for your buck at this place. Check it out.
