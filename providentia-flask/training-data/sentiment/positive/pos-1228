Delicious! Place is family owned. Very clean, good service. Our waiter, was very friendly and personable. I ordered the beef taquitos and Jamaica. I was also able to trying a chicken enchilada. Everything was very flavorful! I will be back! We got complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was a little too hot for my taste.
