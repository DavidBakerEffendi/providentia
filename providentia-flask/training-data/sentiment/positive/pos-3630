My friend and I went out for lunch again today. I swear, the whole diet idea is out the freakin door because once again,  We ate a whole lot again. It is two hours lata from our outing and I am still hella full. I was soooooo excited because they had one of my favorites... BULGOGI.... bulgogi and steamed rice... YUP YUP YUP. We also had shrimp, sushi, and lots more. As I was eating, I was looking around and noticed the sign (but forgot to take the pic of it) ----- ALCOHOL and MEAT (A GOOD COMBINATION)....The best part was that we picked what we wanted and got to cook it ourselves... DEFINITELY A YES... we plan on going back again. We went during lunch time...$12.99. Not bad, not bad!!! This was my first time there!!
