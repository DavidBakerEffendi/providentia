Who doesn't love hot dogs and tater tots with unlimited topping choices? I love Happy Dog on Detroit and this one is just as good and I almost like the layout better. The bar is up against the wall with tables spread out in front which almost seems to make it look bigger. The bar was extremely busy but the bartenders were very attentive and very good at making drinks. My Bulleit old fashioned was absolutely delicious and perfect. And just like the one on Detroit had a great beer selection as well!! I would definitely recommend checking out and its nice for East siders to finally have a Happy Dog they can call their own!
