First think you think is a bottle of wine and 4 choice of bread for $20?!?! You will probably get the worse wine and food but NO 
The food is AWSOME the team is nice and working fast 
They are super clean and smily 
They also serve 2 days this deal Monday and Tuesday 
I would love to be there everyday but I can't 
If you have extra time go there Monday and enjoy it all
