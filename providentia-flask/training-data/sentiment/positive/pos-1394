My last review still stands. This is more of an update on the dumplings. I'm eating them as leftovers right now, and after having been microwaved, the wrappers are still super thin, and some of them still have juice inside. There's also a pretty good amount of filling inside. At $5.99 for 12, I really should come more often. I'm definitely planning on it!
