How many times you all think we can get a unicorn to high five a T-rex in outter space???  Let's make it happen!  I've had the opportunity to use Yelp's Eat 24 a few times.  Mainly for pick up orders.  

But this time with Pan Asian I requested delivery.  My worry wart brain activated and wondered how hot my food would still hopefully be by the time it got delivered.  Especially cuz I'm in a gated complex where people sometimes wait to get in the gate.  Twiddled thumbs...

Food was delivered within 25 minutes of ordering which is not bad considering cooking time and a little over 2 miles away for delivery.  I expected such quality.  I can't assume a 4.5 star standing rating was only for dining in.  But because of the following, I'm really happy with:
- they have pumpkin curry
- rice is included with the dish ordered
- food is delicious
- they're close by
- pricing is comparable in average to local Thai 
- they have Yelp Eat 24 DELIVERY which arrived with edible hot delicious food

How good was it still?  The fried noodle stuffed egg rolls were crispy.  That's how good.  Pumpkin curry so yum.  I think I can handle medium spice next time.  The rice however had some hard pieces - the kind that stuck to my molars.

It's a 4.75****/  I'll try to dine in next meal, when I have more time.
