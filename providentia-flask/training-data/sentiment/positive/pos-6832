WOWOWOW! Holy crap, but this place is beyond awesome! Finally was able to try this place! I've been to swish and this place is soooooo much more better! All you can eat vegetables, need I say more?! I, like everyone else, love those tofu noodles. They are a little chewy, but no way near as chewy as udon noodles are. I love the fact that you can get shabu shabu broth AND sukiyaki broth! 

First off, the one lady who works there all by herself is just... I'm speechless. She works so hard. And she is so efficient! 

I got the Queen 1/2 beef and 1/2 scallops. Both soooo juicy and tender! I had to take advantage and ended up getting two orders of salad and veggies! Mmmm. Vegetables include napa cabbage, carrots, bamboo shoots, tofu, snow peas, and the tofu noodle. The bamboo shoots & snow peas were really delicious... never would have thought to use those! The real reason behind second order of veggies were for those tofu noodles!

The place is easy to find and very clean. And did I mention that service is friggin' great?! And the food is even better. I will definitely be visiting this little joint much more often now.

OH! And I forgot to mention you get a complimentary vanilla ice cream at the end of the meal! You get a choice of strawberry or chocolate syrup or green tea powder!
