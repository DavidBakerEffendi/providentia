Though Bistro 19 isn't really close for us, I can't wait to go back. The service was wonderful and the food was amazing. I wish I'd thought to take pictures of it before we started eating. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious. I highly recommend a couple of the courses you could only get on the restaurant week special menu. The Sea bass corn tart with bacon guacamole & brown sugar and ginger seared tuna served with basmati, crispy carrots, and vegetable curry were amazing and my Dad really enjoyed his salmon, too.

Side note: Though they don't say it on their main page, they recommend reservations and we went early, but it's a very small restaurant and I can see it getting crowded easily. You need to call for reservations, but it's worth it to make sure you get a table!
