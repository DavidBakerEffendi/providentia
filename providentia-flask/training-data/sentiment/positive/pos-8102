I hired Izzy and his team to cater my wedding food truck style. They did an AMAZING job!   It started out being a dreadful 100% chance of rain with a low of 52 degrees. Not exactly my dream summer wedding.  After talking to Izzy about it he made me feel so much better and that we would get through this.  He assured me it would all be okay.  

Cut two, day of wedding, still rainy, not as cold.  Then five o'clock rolls around and the sun starts shining!  That's what time my ceremony began. 

He had the Mac n cheese bar setup inside along with a summer salad and Mexican street corn on two tables.  It was beautiful!  We had a grazing bar as well.  He served pulled pork sliders and mahi mahi tacos from the truck.  It was perfect!!  It had such a nice flow of things.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Everyone was and is still raving about the food.  

Not only is it great quality and well put together, it's affordable too. 

Thanks Erica (the chef) and Izzy for making my dream wedding come true!
