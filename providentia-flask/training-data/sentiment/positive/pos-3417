This place was way more fun than we even expected for Toddler Time! Definitely recommend going if your kiddos are a little shy and need some good kid time, don't be afraid that they won't have fun. Toddler Time is perfect whether they're a crazy hyper playtime kid or more reserved, it will bring the crazy fun out of them! My son loves it here. We have yet to go with all the attractions open but we definitely plan to soon.
