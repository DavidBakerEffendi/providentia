This place is seriously the best.  You may have to wait a couple minutes but you get your order freshly made.  They make fresh fruit smoothies, my favorite being mango papaya, and they make fresh spring rolls the size of burritos, for only 3 dollars! I always get an avocado shrimp spring roll, and the best part is that the avocado is actually ripe so you're not chewing down a solid, nonmushy avocado.  If you want fresh food at a great price, this is the place to be.
