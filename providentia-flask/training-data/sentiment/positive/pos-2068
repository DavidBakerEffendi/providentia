Best burger in toronto hands down!!!!! The quality of the meat and the ingredients they used are amazing, it's a bit pricy here but ur getting a good quality burger that sure filled me up...I got the supreme burger as recommended by our server, had onion rings, fries, cheese, lettuce and bacon in it with 2 onion rings attached on top of the burger 

They say all their ingredients are organic and such, who knows how true it is but all I can say is try this place....they have a great atmosphere as well, everything is wooden from tables to chairs, service was fantastic..
