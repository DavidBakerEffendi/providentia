(read the following review to the tune of bobby brown's "every little step")

i can't sleep at night, i toss and turn
dreamin' about the peppermill
but i get a crave so i'm all choked up
can't believe i need another fill
and as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
how delicious your dessert drinks can be
because the drinks you do is a dream come true
a real life fantasy

no matter where i am in vegas
i've found a great place to love
and we will be together, drinking grasshoppers forever
it's like that, it's like that

every little vegas trip i take
i will go there
every little vegas trip i make
i'll be at the peppermill yeah.....

the peppermill brings tacky-chic to a whole new level. first of all, don't tell me you don't love plastic foliage, red and blue neon lights, AND fire shooting out of the middle of a watery pit. i sure as hell can't get enough of this place and i don't say this because i'm intoxicated. i say this out of pure, on bended knees kind of love. try their "grasshopper," an alcoholic mint milk shake that flows smoothly through your straw, and i swear, YOU will be as smitten as i am. happy drinking folks! you won't regret it!
