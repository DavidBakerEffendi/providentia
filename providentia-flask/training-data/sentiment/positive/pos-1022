I went to college in Bellingham Washington where haggen is from.  I have missed this grocery store ever since!  I love how they highlight local products,  but they have a great selection too.  The deli and hot food are to die for!  So fresh and tasty!  Their prices are competitive and they have a huge organic selection.  They have only been open a few weeks now,  and I think are still transitioning from the vons. I believe one they get rid of the old vons inventory they can make room for more tasty haggen goodness!
