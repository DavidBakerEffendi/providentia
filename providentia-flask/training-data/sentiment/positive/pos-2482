If you have not joined Top Golf.....why not!

We went to the soft opening today and we could not have had a better time.  

Having been to the Houston location I was already familiar with the layout.  Imagine a high class, yet comfortably non-snobby, driving range with cabana like personal bays inside an enormous club/restaurant.  The food and cocktails are destination worthy on their own (you have to try the donut holes that come with injectable sauces.)  And everyone from age 5 to 85 can participate.  (I don't even play golf and yet I couldn't help but play a game....and I won!)  There are also pool tables and video games etc for those that prefer to wander around.  And I cannot speak highly enough of the service level; their staff is groomed to perfection.

Whether you want a family day, a night out with friends, or a team building event for work, you cannot help but have a fantastic experience.
