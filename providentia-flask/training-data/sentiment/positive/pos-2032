This place hasn't changed at all, still unpretentious, reasonably priced and good food.  The steak and eggs (pik attached) still one of the best deals in Vegas, $6.99 plus tax = $7.57.  Drafts are $4, higher than at Ellis Island (they just raised the price there from $2.25 to $2.50) but still a great price.  Servers, bartenders all down to earth and friendly.
