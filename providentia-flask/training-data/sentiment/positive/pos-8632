This hotel has excellent architecture with several stores and restaurants inside.  This includes a food court.  The employees were friendly and courteous. They go out of their way to help you.  

The hotel has numerous security guards who verify one has a room key before allowing them to proceed to an elevator.  I did appreciate this security check!

The hotel has a gym.  The gun has several running machines and a separate weight lifting area. The gym is clean and is a large facility.  The gym attendant was excellent.  They even had a rock climbing area!  This hotel has the best workout facility I have ever seen at a hotel. 

Our room was a small suite with modern furniture and a good view of Las Vegas. The room was clean.  In addition, we could not hear any noise from the adjoining rooms.  The bathroom was large with a bathtub and shower. The bathroom also had a television.

We were on the 32nd floor and we loved our room. The total cost was $300 including taxes, which was a very good value for a Friday night in Las Vegas. We used valet parking and there was no charge for valet parking.

I did not mention the several outdoor swimming pools at this hotel. The swimming pool area was crowded with guests. However, we ran out of time at this hotel! I do recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend a night in Las Vegas.
