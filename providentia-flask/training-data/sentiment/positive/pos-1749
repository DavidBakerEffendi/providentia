I was initially a little off put by slow service.  But that was a minor hiccup that was very quickly a memory when I had one of the best banana pancakes of my life.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, I always order scrambled soft and I NEVER get them back the way the first time.  Here I did.  Which is great since Egg is in their name.  So they ought to get it right -- but I've been saying that about Waffle House for years.  Worst waffles on the planet.  Anyway, U.S. Egg lives up to the name.  The sausage was really good too, but not especially noteworthy like the perfect eggs and amazing pancakes.  

I returned the following day and couldn't bring myself to try anything different...I will.  Someday.  But I already can't wait for tomorrow for another damn banana pancake.  

Everyone is great.  The service aside from the first momentary slowness has been stellar.   And honestly, looking back -- I might have just been hangry.
