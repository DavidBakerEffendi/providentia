Joe Maxx is a small new coffee shop located in the bottom of the Langston apartment building. There is a short bar height table in the window and a booth/chair combo table running along the wall opposite the counter. The cozy seating area was about half full when I visited on Monday just before 11a. 

There was a surprising number of staff behind the counter; they all were friendly and each smiled and greeted me. I was quickly served. The basic small coffee, not a pour over, and a bakery item only set me back $4.50, near the price of a coffee alone elsewhere in the city. The coffee tasted good to me.

I tried something from the small bakery counter: an apple cinnamon scone. It was soft, moist and blobs of cinnamon were suspended throughout the dough. A gooey layer of apples floated near the top. It was very good and much, much better than I expected it to be. It's a good thing I got it to go or I might have wandered back up the counter to try the other two flavors on offer.
