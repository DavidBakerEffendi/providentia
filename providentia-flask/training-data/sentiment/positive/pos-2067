It is a bit hard to see inside with the old house sort of entryway, but if you brave it up the few steps, you will be pleased.

There was no one here when I came for lunch with colleagues, and I was wary at first. However, after the friendly service at the counter, and the almost instantaneous presentation of my pie, I was sold.

The pies (a small, yet meal sized pie) include options such as sweet potato, butter chicken, steak and cheese, pork and others. They are priced at 7.95 or 8.95 each and are delicious.

A side of cole slaw and a soda makes this a 16-17$ meal after tax, which is a bit rich. That being said, my BBQ pork pie was one of the tastiest things I have eaten in a while.

It is worth the effort to give the Pie Commission a shot. Fast, friendly service and a great pie.
