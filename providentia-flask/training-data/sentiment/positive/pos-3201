Eggslut is located in the Cosmopolitan and it is great for any breakfast lovers. They really do the cage-free eggs justice here. I hear that there is often a line, but I think it's worth it. Eggslut is definitely one of the top choices if you are looking for a delicious quick bite, without eating a heavy meal. I can see it being a convenient option before heading to Marquee Dayclub or Nightclub. 

My 2 Favorites here are the Fairfax Sandwich ($8.50) and the Slut ($10.00). If you are with a friend, I would even recommend that you each got your own Fairfax and then share a Slut ;) 

The Fairfax Sandwich is a delicious savory breakfast sandwich with soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese and sriracha mayo on a sweet warm toasted brioche bun. You can upgrade with bacon, turkey sausage or avocado if you wish, but I enjoy the Fairfax as in. The savory eggs and caramelized onions really go well with the sweetness of the brioche bread. Great for any meal!! Breakfast, lunch or dinner. I can eat this stuff all day. 

The Slut is their specialty. This glorious creation has a potato puree base topped with a coddled egg and slow cooked in a glass jar. Then it is topped with salt and chives. It is served with slices of thin baguettes and the workers will instruct you to mix up with ingredients in the jar very well before you proceed. Personally I like to take a few pictures before I proceed to the mixing and eating. 

Eggslut is a great squeeze in between all of your Vegas festivities.
