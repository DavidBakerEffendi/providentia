I have quite a bit of family in Phoenix. So, I generally frequent the area quite a bit even though I am from CO. But, this place definitely offers quick Chinese food if you're on the go. The food is pretty fresh and the taste is on point. The crab rangoons are quite tasty and I am always a fan of dumplings. I am also a huge fan of Chinese noodles. If you are in the area, you should definitely give this place a chance. It is definitely fair and I don't think you'll be disappointed with the taste. Oh, and the people that work the counter are incredibly friendly. Although they are lacking a bit in English skills, they definitely try their hardest to make it up in service!
