Love this place! All the food is delicious and fresh; the pizza had a beautiful, fluffy, crispy  crust, a wonderful sauce, and fresh vegetables. 
     I'd put it right up there with any Pittsburgh pizza anywhere. Soups are delicious, too.       The service is good and friendly, the place is cute and pleasant, comfortable, and warm in ambiance. Its attached to a bar with great music, but the doors are kept closed and you cannot even hear that theres a bar there. All in all, cant wait to go back!
