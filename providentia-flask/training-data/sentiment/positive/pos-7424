By far, the BEST Indian food in town!  I could eat her every day!  One word, "AUTHENTIC!"  Homemade spices and sauces and truly amazing.  No salt or any other additives needed!  The only problem is that when you try one dish, you want to order more, more and more!  Truly a phenomenal place that seriously makes your taste buds explode!  A must to be hooked!  Healthy and majority gluten free!  I would drive a long distance just to eat here!
