I will be the first to tell you, I am the worst at golf! When we came here I was kinda concerned that it wouldnt be any fun because I am so bad!!! But, it was quite the opposite! We ordered drinks that were delivered to our area, and food too! I wasn't really worried at all because it was so much fun! There are fans going, and music playing... the vibe is great! And the staff is really attentive... so now I don't really care that I suck at golf, cause now it's fun!!!
