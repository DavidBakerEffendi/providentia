We were here for the Stanley cup final. One of my colleagues recommended this place for the match day and I don't regret taking their advise. Service was great even though it was a busy day. 

First things first, if you are looking for a place to watch a game with a group of 4 -5 friends, I highly recommend this place. I suggest you to occupy one of those cabin seating that has a TV. It was a good experience.

We ordered milkshakes, drinks, fries, chicken tenders and fried pickles. Everything was great. The Cajun flavored potato fries are the best fries I ever had. I will go back for those fries again after completing this review!
