This is definitely a top-notch restaurant....all the way around.  The food. The drinks. The service. The atmosphere.  Perfection.  Since it's in the neighborhood, it would be wonderful if everyone else didn't think so because just popping in for dinner doesn't always work out so well due to it's popularity!  So, we have been going for late lunches at Bistro 19 and we couldn't be happier that we do!  They had a sea bass cake on their menu for lunch that I literally fell madly in love with so I kept going back!  To my horror--they took it off the menu for the season when we went last week.  Thankfully, their crab cake is also amazing so I only whined for a moment.  But....still....BRING BACK THE SEABASS CAKE!!!!!  Everything at this place is wonderful.....!  Yeah for them!  Yeah for us!
