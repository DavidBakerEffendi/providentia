Amazing!! Bean dip and salsa were worth going. Food is super. Staff and service are a 5+!
Update: Tonight I went again. It has been a month since I had the time to get back. Amanda was our server and she rocked it!! She was on point, funny and friendly. Food was AMAZING!! It is so hard to explain how phenomenal this place is!! 
Update: I went again tonight for my birthday late about 9:30pm. It was awesome like always. Sebastian was our server and he was fantastic. 
Time and time again a truly amazing experience. 
Thank you!!
