Nice sitting area.  this place has a healthier food option.  you basically build your box with noodles/salad/ or rice, add sauce(s), choose meat or tofu (you can choose half half for 2 items), choose toppings such as nuts.  You can get milk tea and other drinks or just tap water ^_^.  Service was good, staff was friendly.  Food was decent, pricing was decent.
