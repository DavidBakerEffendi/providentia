I'd just like to thank Andrew K. for introducing me to this gem. You are a wonderful wonderful man because dudes, this place is delicious. Strawberries, Gorgonzola & candied pecans on fresh greens - hell yes. Perfect pizza crust that is crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside covered with delicious fresh toppings. Cozy seating AND a full bar. This place is pizza perfection and you need to go here immediately. The mouthgasm is totally worth the drive.
