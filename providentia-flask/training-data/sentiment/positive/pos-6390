Our first meal from Second Helping exceeded our expectations. We tried the Carolina Shrimp & Grits and Central Ave. Fried Chicken.  Both were very tasty.  Each dinner plate comes with two sides and cornbread. 

My favorite side was the Fried Green Tomato Casserole - it was a new dish to me and when they said a fresh pan had just come out of the oven, I couldn't pass it by.  A few bites had a little spicy kick to them, but nothing too strong. Try it!

Ginger Ale Glazed Carrots was a new dish to us as well, but one we will certainly order again. They were sweet and tender, with a bit of what I guessed was brown sugar, giving the dish an occasional crunchy bite. Very nice. 

Our meal was very tasty and the portions were generous. All that and our bill was only $15.05!

Right now Second Helping only offers carry-out service, but they hope to expand soon into the adjoining space so patrons can dine in. Try them soon!
