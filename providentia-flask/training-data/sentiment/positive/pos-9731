What a delightful quaint quiet little restaurant!!
The servers are friendly and attentive and the food is fresh and flavorful!
I had an assortment of veggie sushi and was very happy with my orders.
The miso soup is wonderful!!
I loved that the tamago sushi was perfectly done, most places don't hit the sweetness of the omelette, this place does. The tempura was perfectly crisp and not oily. 
Highly recommended!!
