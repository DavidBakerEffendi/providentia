The staff is fun and friendly and the food comes out fast for such quality meals.

I would rate this as the top for Vietnamese stir fry dishes in the city. Viet Thai has the top pho, but Lang van kills it on every other dish available. The lemongrass tofu is excellent and can be made very spicy if needed. I have not been let down here. I just wish I lived closer!
