i love this place. its a gas station with gourmet food, good prices, and good service. and the market has a lot of cool specialty items you won't necessarily find elsewhere. I've had the salad that has grilled chicken, cranberries, gorgonzola cheese, and it is wonderful. and huge. so it wouldn't be the worst idea to share, or plan on enjoying some later! for breakfast i got the bacon benedict, and it was delicious. my brother had that too and we both loved it. the grit cakes that come with it are really yummy! my grandma has the breakfast wrap and she really enjoyed it as well. if you're in the area, definitely make it a point to enjoy a meal here!
