Amazing!  We stopped for breakfast this morning and I was very impressed.  The decor is very classy; it almost feels you stepped into a NY deli or something.  Wood counters, huge thick cutting boards displaying baked goods, jazz playing, and artfully written chalkboard menus on the wall.

The coffee is good, and the breakfast sandwiches are better.  I had local fried egg + cheddar on a pretzel roll, which to my delight was HUGE and came with fresh lettuce and tomato.  For $4?!?!  Take that, Egg McMuffin.  The husband had pastrami cured salmon and cucumber on an everything bagel.  He said it was awesome.

We will definitely make more breakfast stops here, but I'm also looking forward to trying lunch.  Everything on the menu looked so delicious, plus they had pumpkin pecan bread pudding...couldn't bring myself to order it for breakfast, but I'm going to have to try it someday soon!
