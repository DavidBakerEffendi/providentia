Parallax is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  Great atmosphere, good location, great food.  My wife absolutely loves the sushi.  I've had the short rib and the pork chop.  The short rib was one of the best meals I've ever had.  The pork chop was delicious also.  My wife and I were dressed kind of casual and didn't feel out of place at all.  Great food in a laid back atmosphere.  It's certainly not cheap, but the price matches the quality and then some.  Watch your drinks if you're looking to save a few bucks.
