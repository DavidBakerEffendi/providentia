Walking down queen west, I noticed this beautiful yellow and blue tiling. After taking care of a few things and hungry, I had to walk in. 

The first thing you notice is the wall sized, vintage style portrait of Carmen. She, in addition to the beautiful flooring, help make the ambiance of the space. 

I enjoyed a flavourful Spanish tortilla with killer marinated olives. (Personally, I could have eaten an entire bowl of those olives! Good thing the rest of them were behind glass is all I have to say!)  I paired that with an Americano it was the perfect midafternoon snack.

I had opportunity to try a sugar cookie drizzled with dulce de leche. Sweet, sugary goodness! A nice crunch but such a smooth finish when that creamy caramel sauce melded together in your mouth. Yum. 

A comfortable space with an excellent variety of Spanish foods for you to eat or take home. There's a fridge and products situated along the wall for you to purchase.

Customer service was spot on. Friendly and informative. Very happy to share information about who they are and what's in their products. I was pleased as punch with learning how much time and effort they took to open this space. I am rather excited to see this space in the summer. The garage doors finally opened for sidewalk seating, would make this place a definite go to space in the summer.

This was a great surprise from start to finish.
