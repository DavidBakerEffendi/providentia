Ravisoups never disappoints. I visited again recently and the "combo" of the special soup (it was butternut squash & pear, or something like that), and the free range chicken wrap with cranberry & greens, was just the perfect amount of fresh, chef-prepared goodness. So no, I generally don't think soup is a meal, at least not butternut squash soup. Thank heavens for Ravi's perfect combo.

Since it's a cold city for nearly half the year, I really think they should ditch the metal tables and chairs for something warmer.
