Stopped in here for a late dinner with my hubby after seeing a movie on date night. When I say late it was probably about 8pm when we got here. The place only had 2 other sets of people in there. Even though we came late, the food was excellent and the staff was very friendly. We opted for a Wildflower Reuben Sandwich which to our surprise came with a side of potato salad and a bowl of the potato cream cheese soup. All of the food was AMAZING. The Reuben was great and had just the right amount of ingredients to make it perfect. Sometimes you can get a Reuben places that have too much of 1 ingredient and that just throws the whole thing off. Not this one. The potato salad that came with it was probably the best potato salad I have even had. I normally don't like potato salad because it is so heavy, but this one was light and airy. Not sure what they used to bind it but I wish I could find out. It was great. The potato cream cheese soup was amazing. I had never tried it before and I loved it. I really like the tangy zip (probably from the cream cheese) that hits you at the end of the bite. The prices were decent and totally reasonable especially for a made to order handmade restaurant. We will definitely be back.
