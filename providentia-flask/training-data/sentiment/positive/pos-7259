If I could give this restaurant six or seven or eight stars  I would in a minute , in one word fantastic
This is my first time here with my wife, and we were pleasantly surprised to find the small little restaurant to weigh in the corner just off of South Durango. The tastes and the selections of food do you get in this restaurant should be found in a five-star establishment
David Wong's hand Asian is truly a hidden gem.
