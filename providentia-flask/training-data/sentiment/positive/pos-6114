Very nice, believe me, I enjoyed my brunch very much. Fantastic French toast and s portobello Florentine, very nice indeed. All of our friends meals also impressive in appearance and full and fantastic flavors. We sat next to the kitchen door and every plate caught our attention! Fantastic!

One improvement I would like: cappuccinos please. I enjoy a cappuccino with breakfast and brunch.
