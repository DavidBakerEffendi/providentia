I'm not sure how big the niche is for gourmet southern food while waiting for your car to be detailed, but apparently there is a large enough demographic to develop in one in North Scottsdale.  

The best way to describe it would be to imagine a QT where every aspect of the traditional gas station/convenience store concept was redesigned by the shopkeepers at "La Grande Orange."   

While I didn't have my car shined, I can attest that the southern-ish cafe inside serves up some of the tastiest southern food I've had in the Valley.  They absolutely nail their pulled pork, grits, bacon, eggs, etc - and good lord their Carolina BBQ sauce would fit right at home in Gastonia.  I'll be back with friends - and maybe a dirty car.
