Update:
It was my understanding that the 1st time I tried the wings here, the cook was in training. So today we went in at 11am and ordered a dozen of the PB&J wings which we really enjoyed last time and 7 PB&J fingers. We also got 6 Hot Garlic and 6 Red Rooster. This was the first time we tried the fingers and let me tell you these were a really generous size. 2 fingers and we were full! Therefore the wing would have to wait till dinner time. The PB & J wings were delicious. The red rooster were like an Asian sweet red Chile. Very good as well and the Hot Garlic are good and spicy but for my taste lacked garlic flavor. However, I am Cuban and have an incredible love of garlic in everything so that might just be me. :)
Anyway, I am very happy we went and tried it again. My whole family LOVES the PB&J flavor and there are still a few other flavors I would like to try. My husband reported that the two young men working were very friendly and polite as well which is another reason we will return.
