The sushi here is AMAZING.! High quality sushi every time. Very tasty selection of Maki/Big rolls. Tempura roll, Crazy Tuna roll, and Tuna Cube*** are a few of my favorites. Also, the service is always perfect and everyone is super friendly! Definitely a worth a visit if you enjoy sushi.

This is my new go to sushi spot... LOVE IT!!
