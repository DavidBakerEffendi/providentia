This is my absolute #1 go to pho spot hands down the best! Went to other pho places and they arent up to par with Jenni Pho! I've been coming here for years! The portion size is huge and if ur really hungry super size it! Don't settle for less the price is very reasonable considering how much u get!

SOOO ITS HALLOWEEN !! And its a 70's theme and Jenni's all dresses up! With matching music in the background! Its just an absolutely wonderful way to end the night :D
