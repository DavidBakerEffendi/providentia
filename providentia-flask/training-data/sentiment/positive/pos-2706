I'm gonna cast an appropriate review for this type of cuisine and experience. So those of you looking for elegant ambiance need to head elsewhere or check those expectations at the door and just bask in the tasty glory.

Philly's Famous is the unparalleled ZENITH for cheesesteaks in the valley, maybe the Southwest... but I'm gonna keep an open mind, I haven't been everywhere in the SW yet.

I've had 3 steaks from Philly's so far. They have all been tasty authentic representations of Philadelphia's gift to American joy. My frame of reference comes from numerous work trips to Philly, PA. I'm talkin' TRUTH - John's Roast Pork, Joe's Steaks, & Steve's Prince of Steaks... not the touristy nastiness of Pat's or Geno's.

So! Philly's Famous steaks are amazing. And that's the way it is.

The owner is very friendly and always happy you've come by. In fact, everyone there makes you feel welcome. On our first trip, my wife asked about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich while we were ordering. The owner turned from working his magic at the grill and told her the Buffalo Chicken was his favorite. "I make a different sauce I put on mine. I'll give you some. I think it's even better with the sauce." He visited us at our table with the sauce. Darcie said the sandwich was great by itself and even better with the sauce. I thought it was excellent as well, but I'm more of a purist and I have to have a cheesesteak. And, MAN! those do not disappoint. I get the Jack Cheese Steak with onions and peppers. Lordy!

The ambiance definitely has the Philly feel, with the exception that the staff does NOT exude the patented Philadelphia impatient attitude. It's a great experience, full 360Â°.

If you're looking for a way to boost your happiness, head over to Philly's Famous.

QE-em-effin-D!

I'm really not sure why I'm not there now. Where are my keys?
