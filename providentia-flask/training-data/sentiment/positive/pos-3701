I'm still searching for the best pizza in Phoenix....so far, I think Pizza Heaven takes the cake.  I go here with coworkers on lunch breaks.  They have a really good lunch special you can choose between pizza and their one-of-a-kind hot wings.  You'll melt if you order them hot.  I did that and I'm still paying for it.

The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  Great atmosphere.  Delicious pizza.  And a tv.  What more could you want out of a pizza place?
