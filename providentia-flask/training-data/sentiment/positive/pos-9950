Rick was wonderful and the food was worth the price tag. People get so caught up in quantity when it's the quality you pay for.

Wonderful decor even down to the plates. 

We got the fry with clams and calamari. Delicious but the ricotta app our neighbors had looked mouth watering. Going to entrees the brick chicken was the best I have had in my life. It is the chicken you dream about when watching those stupid chicken dinner commercials and then some. Boyfriend had the New York stake and loved it. Needed to order a side of the Mac and cheese since he stole most of mine. It was fantastic!

The cherry on top was the salted Carmel chocolate ice cream. I liked that more than the layer cake. SAVE ROOM! I work at a chocolate restaurant and this is literally the best ice cream I have had in my entire life!
