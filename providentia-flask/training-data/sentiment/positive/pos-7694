gastronomic bliss
unassuming location
foodie shock and awe

I've been meaning to come here since this place opened a year ago. 
-Now I could kick myself for not going sooner. 
Arguably the best food in Cleveland. A concise menu focused on perfect execution as opposed to a sprawling menu of mediocrity.  Also the "local and house made" theme is taken to another level by the restaurant having its own plot of veggies in an old repurposed dairy farm. 

Here's what we had:  a board with seared scallops on a warm corn relish type thing, foie gras and toast points, and the "reuben ribs". The ribs were brined in a pastrami-ish brine then cooked and served over a cabbage slaw.  Brilliant.
Entree's were a swordfish and I had fried chicken with mac&cheese.  All I can say is that it was a flawless meal.  

Run to Cork and Cleaver.  RUN!!!

Carry on...
