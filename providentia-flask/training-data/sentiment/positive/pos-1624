My husband and I went to Block & Grinder last week for a date night dinner. We had never been here before, but have heard good things.

After taking a look at the photos on Yelp, and looking at reviews we decided to try this place.

When we arrived we were seated right away, as we went early on a Friday night. The wait staff was friendly, and service was quick.

We ordered beverages, I got the dark and stormy cocktail , that was delicious.( I like that they put half a lime in it).

For appetizers we order the fried oysters which were served on a delicious bed of roasted corn and arugula. These were very good and I enjoyed the sauce that they came with.

My husband and I both ordered steaks, he a New York strip, and I ribeye. Those steaks were cooked perfectly as we ordered them and were absolutely delicious. My steak came with a blue cheese crust that was creamy and rich. We also got the mac and cheese and zucchini as our sides. The mac and cheese is delicious as the noodles are cooked al dente in the cheese sauce is rich and very smooth. The zucchini was very good and cook so that it wasn't squishy but still crisp.

Well the dessert menu look great we didn't have enough room for anything else. The whole overall experience was great, and we can't wait to go back again and try their burgers.

Highly recommend this place, if you're looking for a nice date night or a place to get a delicious burger!
