Love love love this place! Food is awesome and their all about business. Other customer complaints that their not overly nice is because they're busting their butts to focus on my food getting made so I can get to work. They always say good morning and ask for your order and get it out ASAP. I eat here at least 3 times a week and have never had a bad experience. Amazing sandwiches at a great price and no awkward small talk to worry about, just amazing food and the assurance you'll get the same consistent food when you come in again. Those ladies are awesome!! I'm on my way there now ;)
