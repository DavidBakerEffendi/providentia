This used to be called El Taco Fresco, but I believe the brother, Antonio, bought it from his other brother, kept everything the same, but changed the name to El Taco Feliz.

This is damn good Mexican!

We were having a casual holiday work party and I went over to El Taco Feliz to talk with Antonio about catering the party.

Carnitas, Beef, Chicken, Beans, Rice, Guacamole, two kinds of Salsa, Cheese, Lettuce, Limes, Tortillas and Shells.  (I'm trying to think if I am missing anything...)

EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!  (I even had Jersey Mike's subs and they were barely touched!)

I'm not a pork person, but these carnitas were amazing!  The chicken was VERY good- moist and shredded and great flavor!  Beef had lots of flavor!

The salsa's are great, my favorite is RED HOT!

He dropped all of it off in this container that keeps food PIPING hot (and it did!!)

I will DEFINITELY cater from them again.  Hands down, no questions!!!

Thanks Antonio & El Taco Feliz!!!

p.s. if you go into the restaurant just for food, their Chicken Nachos are so delish!
