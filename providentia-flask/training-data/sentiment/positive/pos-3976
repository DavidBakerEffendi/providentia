Came here for lunch and the food was superb! The price is also OK. I ordered the kebab and it was really good. It comes with a huge portion of rice and some hummus. The meat was so well-cooked I cannot describe. I was told the grilled chicken was also good.
The place itself is pretty quiet and staff were friendly and willing to explain the dishes in cases you are not familiar with it. I def recommend this place.
