This is THE steakhouse to go to if you want a really good steak and you really don't want to pay steakhouse prices.  I've never had a bad steak here and my wife & I have made it a point to eat here at least every other week.  Reading other reviews- I can't comment on anything other than their steak, and their steak is DELICIOUS.  

The servers are always nice & friendly and try to be as accommodating as possible.  My one issue is that sometimes the entrees come out way too fast- like when we're only half way finished with the appetizer and we still have our full salads in front of us!  The server told us that it was because the kitchen basically runs the 'meal service' and when it's ready- they gotta get it out to the customers.  Our next visit we will order each item ourselves, and take our chances with how long it takes the kitchen to get it out.  

Keep up the great food, TR!
