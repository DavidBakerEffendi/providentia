I first learned about Tammie Coe when at a Holiday party, no one but me dared to cut into a cake they thought was a decoration (her Santa's Sack). When I asked the hostess, she told me that Tammie was now the hottest cake designer in town, having replaced Cathy (of Rum Cake fame). Newly engaged, I knew I had to check her out for my wedding cake. Since my (now) husband and I both are public servants, we had to be creative in order to afford what turned out to be the culinary hit of the wedding. Instead of a stacked cake, we bought plant stands of varying height from Home Depot and then ordered a variety of large single cakes from Tammie who wrapped them in her signature fondant all in the same way. I picked them up myself and took them to the wedding location, and in this way I saved about half the cost of a traditional wedding cake. The individual cakes looked amazing set up on an oblong table, and everyone said they were the best cakes they'd ever had. 

I must say, however, that these days, I stop by the Roosevelt location most often for her husband's bread. Those crusty delicious loves are truly cravable.
