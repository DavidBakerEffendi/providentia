Amazing! That's all I can say.

Because I'm a gym rat, I have to give them credit here first: Their gym is fantastic for being at a hotel! Lots of cardio machines, all sorts of machines and free weights. Everything you need for an intense workout. They offer towel service and you can borrow headphones for your workout.

The room service, customer service and overall care they show their guests is second to none at The Venetian. We asked for a crib for our baby boy and they delivered it all assembled, with a bib, blanket and baby toy. We asked for a mini fridge and they delivered one in 20 minutes and there was no additional charge.

We signed up for special pricing on Venetian's website directly and so they periodically send special pricing for booking. We get amazing rates for their suites compared to the other higher end hotels on the strip with similar size and design.

They have two pools and a beach party type of people as well for day parties until 6pm.

The indoor shopping area is beautiful. They have indoor lake with gondola's riding people around and the gondola staff signing songs. Cost is $20/person. The ceiling is painted like a clear blue sky to make you feel you are outside. The ambiance is amazing and our favorite go to hotel in Vegas.
