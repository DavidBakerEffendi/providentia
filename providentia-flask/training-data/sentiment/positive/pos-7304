I absolutely love this restaurant. Do yourself a favor and order the chicken biryani. You are welcome! Make sure you get some of the yogurt sauce to go with it. Trust me!

The service here is always excellent. The tables are always neat and perfectly set every time I've come here. The staff is friendly and helpful. 

I have brought friends here and they've been just as impressed as I've been. It's not a crowded place, so it's great for get togethers with friends and family. You'll actually be able to hear each other. 

The food portions are rather large, so they're great for sharing, or keeping to yourself for lunch the next day. 


There really is nothing bad to say. It's an awesome restaurant!
