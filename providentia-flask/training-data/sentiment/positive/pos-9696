The food here was really good. It's in a super cute hidden spot. The breakfast combo was perfect and I got to taste a little bit of everything I wanted; the French toast was very yummy. All the people working there were super helpful and friendly as well.
The part that made this place even more awesome was that they had a bunch of bird cages in the front with a singing cockatoo, love birds, parakeets, parrots, macaws, and more which were so fun to watch and take pictures of. It was a very fun experience overall.
