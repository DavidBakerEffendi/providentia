My sister and I took out my Mom for her birthday.  

My mom had the vegetarian special - a stuffed zucchini filled with cheeses, mushrooms, carrots which she loved which came with a vegetarian tamale, rice and smashed black beans.  She loved it!  My sister had a gorgeously plated green salad with large prawns and a chile relleno.  She gave me a bite - and it was breaded so lightly, very delicious.  I had their two item plate with a chicken tostada, I love it layered with refried beans at the base, cheeses and shredded plump chicken with a chicken enchilada, by the way I love their sauce. It has a bitterness to it, which reminds me of a mole which I almost opted for.

My mom said this is one of those places that when you start to eat wonder why haven't come here more often!  The waitress remembered us which made us feel welcome.  And to me customer service is what brings me back and returning to a place I love over and over!

Keep it up Frank n Fina's!
