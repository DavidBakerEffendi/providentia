We've been here several times, for brunch and dinner and only had wonderful experiences. 

The cocktails are interesting and always well executed. The food is incredible. The nice thing about this place is that the menu changes with the seasons. It's always a nice surprise to see what's being served. Even the items that are always there (ie. the mussels) change every time, and have always been amazing.

The service is wonderful. Friendly, knowledgable staff each time.  We were trying to think of a nice place to go for a birthday dinner... looked up all the restaurants in the neighbourhood to finally settle on this one, since we knew it'd be great, and we're not disappointed at all that we came back here.

The only thing to be aware of is that they don't take credit cards, which may come as a shock if you've spent quite a bit on dinner and weren't prepared.
