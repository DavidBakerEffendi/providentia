Although I don't live near Banzai anymore, so I only tend to visit a few times a year, I love the food & if I'm in the area around meal time I'll make sure to carve out some time to visit.

I usually do take-out (it's been years since I dined in). They have a large seating area for those waiting for food, as well as tables for those staying to eat. I usually get the spicy chicken rice bowl - highly recommended. Got a good kick to it but not too spicy.

The staff is always friendly & the price is comparable to other locations in Calgary. 

Highly recommend a visit if you're in the area!
