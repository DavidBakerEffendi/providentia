This place rocks on Tuesdays with $1 tacos and cheap drinks.  Try the Lobster Sampler Platter (if you're not going for the $1 tacos on Tuesdays).

Chips and Salsa and right on, everyone friendly, ok for kids in the restaurant section.  Has a little patio, and an upstair couchy loungey bar area (never been there for drinking, but I did sneak upstairs with my son to check out the layout -- it's a habit I have of pacing out real estate!).  Would be a perfect place to rent out for a party or event, probably holds like 40 seated, standing room for another 30 or so).
