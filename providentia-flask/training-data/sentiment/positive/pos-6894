if you haven't eaten lunch yet, i suggest you get your cute little butt over to sonora right now. 

i had the carne asada taco combo on flour tortillas. It comes with two tacos and rice and beans. I also got fresh guac. aaannnnd i was coaxed into the mexican version of bingsoo (the mexican version is better in my opinion) 

I had to get it to-go and head back to work... and since my hands were full of that delicious little fruity icee treat, the lovely lady working carried my lunch to my car. how stinking sweet is that? she didn't want it to spill, however, spills were the theme of the day.

as soon as i got in my car i forgot about that fruity concotion and stuck my elbow in it. and it tipped over and fell.

then i took a sip of my drink and that went down the front of my shirt. did i mention i was wearing white? 

the tacos were amazing, and the beans were amazing, and the rice too. I could have used a little more heat and I am sure if I used the salsas it would have been perfect, but i didn't want to spill that all over the place so they stayed closed. 

the fruity dessert thing that i got was so delicious. she made me a special concotion. it was shaved ice with coconut, mango and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. if she could have just blended that with a little rum it would have been the perfect mid-work cocktail. they should seriously start blending that little treat. amazing. 

next time i will go back when i have time to sit and enjoy, i will also bring a bib with me since i can't seem to avoid making a huge mess all over myself.

love this place. delcious.
