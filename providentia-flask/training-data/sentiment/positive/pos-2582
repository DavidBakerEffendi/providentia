THANK YOU!!! Thank you Juan's Flaming Fajitas for being one of the VERY few Mexi places in Las Vegas that gets it right.  

The b/f and I ordered delivery (via Bite Squad) two nights ago and were very, very impressed with the quality and flavor!  I ordered a steak taco salad, and they had an option for steamed grilled veggies instead of rice and beans!! (Healthy-mex?? Yes please!!) He ordered a carne asada burrito.

Our food arrived in less than an hour and it was piping hot.  (Thanks Bite Squad!)  My steak was super tender and the veggies were a really nice touch. Plus, their green salsa is to die for!  I used it instead of the dressing  He took one bite of his burrito and said "no way!" FINALLY, we found a place that has So Cal style carne aside!! (We lived in San Diego for years...and there's just nothing like So Cal Mexi....mainly because San Diego is basically Mexico.)  

Two nights later and we just did a repeat order.  Can't wait til the doorbell rings!
