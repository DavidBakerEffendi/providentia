2 words : Gobi Manchurian!!!!

We had an awesome time here for dinner. The food was awesome and plentiful. The mixed grill was an expertly grilled combination of lamb, shrimp and tandoori chicken. I had the pleasure of dining on the lamb korma which was the best  have ever had.  Tender chunks of lamb in a creamy korma sauce. It was so good I could have licked the plate. The chicken masala was also very good but spicy. The nan was precut so it seems like more than it is which I didn't like. The best of the dishes was the delicious, crispy, sweet, spicy Gobi Manchurian. This is a must have dish.
   The restaurant is byob so bring your favorite wine. The corkage fee is 10.00 and we were told by the manager that this was per bottle but our check only showed 1 fee and we had 2 bottles. this brings me to the service which was excellent. I have no complaints. TIP: on your way out visit the grocery store next door
