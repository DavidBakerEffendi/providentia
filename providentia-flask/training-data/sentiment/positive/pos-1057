Great sushi for lunch.  I had the Sakana lunch special. 10.99 including tax with a water as your drink.  Includes a salad with a soup. 5 star meal and the waitresses are friendly and efficient. Make sure you are there right at 11:00 am for lunch because the small dining area fills up fast.  They make the sushi fresh after you order so plan on being there for about an hour for lunch.
