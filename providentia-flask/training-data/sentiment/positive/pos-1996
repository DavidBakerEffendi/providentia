I absolutely adore this place! The staff is attentive and friendly,  the food is always consistent and delicious, and the atmosphere is calm, ambient and clean. 

My favorite dish to order is the Pho vegetarian- many Vietnamese places around the valley offer this dish, but Noodles Ranch serves the best bowl by far. They never skimp on the veggies and have an incredible vegetable broth. 

Try their chili oil- it's what dreams are made of.
