Good consistent casual Chinese food at a great value. 

Located close to home, China Tango is on the corner of N Green Valley Pkwy & Pebble Rd. I've been meaning to write them a review for some time, so here it is. Whether I've dined in, gotten delivery or carry-out (I've done all three numerous times!) I haven't been disappointed with their food, service, and overall experience. It's been my go-to spot for fast, affordable Chinese food.

What I love:

- No MSG. Enough said.
- They offer brown rice. Healthy!
- Generous portions. Cause we're hungry people! Or we just love leftovers.
- Lunch specials are till 4pm. Who can always fit lunch before 2pm?
- Lots of vegetables. Crispy veggies too, not the gross wilted ones you get at other places.

They have all the traditional orders, from chow mein, sweet & sour pork, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, fried rice, hot & sour soup, it goes on and on. Prices range from $7.25-$9.95. Lunch is from $5.95-$6.50, which includes fried or steamed rice & chow mein & egg drop soup (dine-in only). Complete family dinners start from $24.95 & they serve Thai tea or fruit smoothies with boba.

Most importantly, they've always been timely. Food is served fast, carry-out is ready, and delivery is always punctual. 

Tasty, affordable, reliable. It's not gourmet, but it's fresh, clean Chinese for a great price! I'll be back soon :)
