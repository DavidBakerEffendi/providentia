I love finding new cafes in my area, and this one was definitely a great find. It has a nice, cozy atmosphere, relatively low key. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but I saw good reviews so I wanted to try it out. I was not disappointed.

I had the Vienna latte and the veggie scramble. Both were delicious. I'm an avid cinnamon lover, so the Vienna (vanilla and cinnamon) was a slam dunk for me. The veggie scramble is very good, they were happy to make it with egg whites for me, and it comes with your choice of toast. I had sourdough. They also brought me a choice of three jellies, which I thought was lovely. I chose red raspberry... and let me tell you, it was one of the most delicious jellies I've had in a long time. Don't miss out on that!

The staff was also incredibly accommodating and friendly. From the lady who took my order to the lady who brought out my food, I was blown away by the kind service. I look forward to trying out more things here in visits to come!
