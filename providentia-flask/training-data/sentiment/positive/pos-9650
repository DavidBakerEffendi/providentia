I came here years ago but just thought it was OK. This time, tried Happy Hour (Daily, BTW)- surprisingly very good. My husband said "We have to come here again." The Happy Hour menu ($3/$4/$5) is available at the Bar but had booth seating in addition to the stools surrounding the bar. The alcohol ranges from $2-$5- 28 selections; beer, well, & cocktails.

We had the Fish Tacos (2)  with shoestring fries $5, Buffalo Chicken Sliders (3) with shoestring fries $5, and Crab, Spinach, & Artichoke Dip (huge) with pico de gallo & tortilla chips $5. Everything was delicious. The fish tacos had chipotle ranch sauce, which was flavorful and zesty. The Buffalo Sliders (the server suggested this) had just the right amount of spice. The dip was huge and the spinach really gave it an extra touch. My husband thought the fries were better than "In & Out" - still don't understand the fascination with that place, but that's another conversation. Also, my husband had two beers. The bill? A little over $21.00. We didn't finish everything. Great service, although very busy, still tended to us.

The server told us that people are surprised with the portion sizes- that they expect tapas sized plates, but the happy menu items are full sized here. My husband already knows what he wants to try next time.
