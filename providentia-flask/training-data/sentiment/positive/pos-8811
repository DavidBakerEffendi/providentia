Service is good, and let me tell you, the first time we were there and older couple passing us out the door said.. try the Traditional Benny (Eggs Benedict), and they were so right.  I have not been able to order anything different, because I like it so much.  I have tasted other family members food, and all have been great.  It is especially a good deal with the Groupon Deal
