Almost confused as this restaurant's name sounded similar to one of my all time favorites just around the corner (Hachi) I have to come clean and say ramen isn't my go to for soup. Often way too savory, salty, and creamy that I just want to plunge into a pool and engulf enough that the 6 foot area is the new 5 foot level but Hashi got me saying, "damn I could really go for a bowl of ramen"

Setting: It is located in the same plaza that Hobak is located. Upon entering the restaurant the seating is all bar and very long (looks like it could seat... 25?) The restaurant has a very open layout and the cooking is very honest (you can see them prepare everything). Conveniently utensils, toppings, spices, and a cold pitcher of water is all at your disposable without having to flag the staff. 

Service:  There was an asian lady that basically obtained your ramen order, drinks, brought you the check etc. The staff manning the kitchen brought you your food, and took care of any other questions or assistance needed. We had a very enthusiastic gentleman that kept us entertained but got a little too zealous while we were trying to eat. 

Ramen: They have giant pots that basically simmer the chicken/pork which looked like for days. Being the type that doesn't like the savory kinds of ramen I opted for the chicken based shoyu (waitress recommended) which took my breath away. So much complex flavors that hit your tastebuds from the chicken, soy sauce and whatever else made this God-like concoction. Best ramen in vegas hands down. House made chili packs a lot of heat but actually has good taste than just burning your bum.

Overall: Get to this place now before the hype gets any bigger
