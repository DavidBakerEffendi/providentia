mmmm.. good stuff! a mix of korean, japanese, and hawaiian food.  12.99 for all you can eat (specific menu). the menu offers a lot of goods.  bulgogi, chap chae, katsu, short ribs... shrimp tempura roll, dragon roll, garlic shrimp, musubi etc.  everything is good!!!! the owner who seems to be running the show all by himself.. was really friendly and attentive.  it's a cozy place that I definitely appreciate. mmmm..
