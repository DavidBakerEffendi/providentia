When in Vegas, always try new food! Kudos to my colleague who found this little gem in the Cosmopolitan. The bread is delivered fresh every morning and all of the ingredients are made fresh. Compared to other "sausage, egg, cheese" sandwiches? Doesn't come close. Every bite was succulent and rich, hell, the line wasn't too long either. The service was fast. I would definitely visit again!
