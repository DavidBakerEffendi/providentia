After a hot sweaty day at work with no breaks allllll daaaay,  we were absolutely starving when we were NW looking for a place to finally grab some dinner , we came across jimmys a&a. What a fantastic find !! Not sure if I want to tell others about it ?? So very busy already !! But I gotta put that word out there it was too good !!!  Too good !!!! Make sure if you order a large anything there you are with about four others !! Portions are huge and so very tasty !!! Love this place will be returning again .. And again .. And again ... And maybe even again !!!!
