I love their Blackenzola and filet dinners.  The seafood dishes are tasty.  I tried the roasted beet salad this past weekend and loved it.  Will be ordering that from now on instead of the standard mixed green which is also good.   Service is always good and consistency of the food is great. I have been enjoying this place for 25 years.
