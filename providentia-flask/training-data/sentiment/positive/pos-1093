What an amazing place. The chicken is very tender and tasty and you have to try a beef patty for an appetizer. Definitely get the Anthony's sauce on the chicken. I have taken many clients here for lunch because it is economical and has a very friendly staff. The sweet tea is fresh but not too sweet. 

I wholly recommend this restaurant for everyone.
