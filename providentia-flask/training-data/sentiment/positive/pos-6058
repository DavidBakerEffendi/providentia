Once again, thank you Yelp!

I was in NLV and hungry, so I turned to Yelp for some guidance on something tasty and cheap.  Chicago Style Tacos pops up and it's only .3 miles away.  I head over to a little plaza and initially can't find it.  I see a Carnitas Tacos, but no Chicago Style.  I circle the plaza and see a Chicago Style banner hanging in the Carnitas Tacos window. It's held up by some duct tape.

Uh oh...do I dare go in?  Am I going to regret this?  I'm starving so I enter.  

It's pre-lunch so I'm the only one in there.  I ask the guy what the difference is between Chicago style tacos and others.  After all, I'm from LA and have had some of the best taquerias in the world in my backyard. 

He says they use yellow corn tortillas instead of white.  And they make everything fresh to order.  Umm...okay.  

Now my initial concerns from the exterior aren't alleviated when I walk in.  They don't have cash in the drawer so it's cash only at the moment.  Their fountain soda machine isn't working.  Ugh.

Anyways, I'm hungry so I order three tacos: asada, pastor, and pollo. Plus an old school glass bottle of Coke for $1.

Food comes out and it looks great.  They have three sauces:  Spicy Red, Spicy Creamy Green, Mild Green.  I take turns between the two spicy ones and both are delicious!!

All three tacos were delicious too.  Next time around, I would have a hard time ordering just one of the meats. They're all equally tasty.  

Yea, the place is a dive.  But service was good, prices were right ($2 each taco), and the food was fresh and delicious. 

I'll be back!!
