My buddy and I were looking for a late night option last night (around 9:30), and stumbled across this place thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app.  We were seated outside, which was lovely, and we got the bruschetta (the one with pancetta and mushrooms was ridic).  Then we got some of their tomato bisque soup, and the Italian flatbread.  I wasn't crazy about the tuna or the salmon options on the bruschetta, but almost everything else was spot on.  Yes, we dunked the flatbread in the soup - and it was ideal.

Great service, great ambiance, and right across the street from Paleta's Betty - which, consequently, has the best popsicle EVER (the orange creamsicle).  All in all, it was a great night and I look forward to going back and trying their entrees!
