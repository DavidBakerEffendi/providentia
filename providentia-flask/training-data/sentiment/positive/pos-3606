Came to try out this new restaurant on a weekend and it did not disappoint :)!

Restaurant is bright and spacious. Walked in a got a table right away.

We ordered one cream toboki and one spicy toboki plus popcorn chicken. Both tastes amazing. However, if ur not a spice lover, I strongly suggest you to not get the spicy toboki because it's way too spicy. I looked at other people and they were all dying from spice at the end.

Definitely will visit again :D
