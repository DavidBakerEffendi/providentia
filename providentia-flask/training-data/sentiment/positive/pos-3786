I love this place. I could drink their enchilada sauce as a hot beverage. Their cheese enchiladas are my absolute favorite enchiladas in the entire world. I also enjoy their beef tacos with rice and beans. Priced nicely, served hot and all the soda a human can consume. They do get jam packed at lunch time but offering good food will do that. I always get a dozen tortillas to go which I believe they make themselves. 
My one complaint is I hate eating off of styrofoam and everything is served that way. If you ask they will give you paper plates to transfer you meal onto.
