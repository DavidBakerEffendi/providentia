I seriously don't understand how this place isn't slammed every time I go it. THIS IS THE BEST RESTAURANT.  Not only is the food AMAZING, the staff is always so friendly! My girlfriend and I were talking about how WE ALWAYS make friends when we come have dinner. It's just such a relaxed and fun environment.
