I love ordering delivery from here. Honestly hands down the best Chinese food between Tempe and Scottsdale. It has been our go to whenever we don't feel like cooking or going out. Which is probably once a week. Their pan fried pork dumplings are bomb! Sesame chicken is super good and noodles and ma po tofu! My boyfriend is white and he loves it! Which makes my heart feel warm. It doesn't take close to an hour to get your food but doesn't that mean they are probably cooking from scratch? Not frozen? That's a good thing!
