The best Indian food, hands down, anywhere. It is important to have reservations, which we had. 

There was an Indian couple sitting at the table next to us, and even though I have had Indian food in London, where it is the national dish, we watched what they were eating and at least for one dish, we said "we'll have what that is." Good thing because as we were leaving, we found out that the place is their "family restaurant." I would venture to guess that translates as they owned the place.

Like spicy? The lamb vindaloo was three alarm in my mouth and very good. Glad we had a couple of orders of naan to cool off. Don't drink water with a mouth fire, tap it down with naan! I also had spoonfuls of some other great dishes and tried to get close to the names on my photos. Next time, I am definitely taking a photo of the menu.

I also had a few bites of two of the desserts, the mango kulfi and the kala jamun, which also cooled down my mouth and were excellent.
