So I remember coming here around the time they first opened back in June but never wrote a review. I came with a couple girlfriends including Karen W, and every time I go somewhere with Karen W. she writes killer reviews so promptly that I might as well just write "ditto Karen W.'s review." They definitely have improved their food and service since their opening.

I came here by myself around 8:15pm on a Sunday night for a quick meal. I ordered their tonkatsu ramen and asked for it as spicy as possible. They delivered! It was delicious :) The charsiu was quite tender, more so than I remembered before so that was a big improvement. The broth ran out quickly so I had to order extra broth and I enjoyed the charsiu so much I ordered extra. 

I ordered a spicy tuna donburi bowl and salmon donburi bowl to-go. The donburi bowls are very reasonably priced (around $5) and a good portion for a light but satisfying lunch. 

Thank you for the great meal!
