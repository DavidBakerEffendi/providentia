So sad when they closed this location.
We've been coming to this location on Central and Camelback for years. This place was always clean and well stocked. Employees were pleasant and helpful. Many a nite we would stop in here for dinner and many days for lunch. Never any complaints. And it was always great getting the coupon for half off on your next visit. 
A tear drop for you Sweet Tomatoes on Central and Camelback.
