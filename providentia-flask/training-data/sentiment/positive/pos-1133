It took us awhile to find it since it was downstairs of the shopping center, but we did! This place is a hidden gem, and now my favorite restaurant. It's hard to balance between different types of Asian cuisine in one restaurant (especially Korean and Thai like whoa) but they pulled it off!!! We ordered a ton of things like the Bibimbap, the Sushiritto, Green Curry, Seafood Pancake, and for dessert the Purple Rice with Vanilla Ice Cream. I was not disappointed with a single dish. The service was amazing, the seasoning of the food was impeccable, the the theme and decor of the place is so cute. The Curry was the perfect spice, the seafood pancake was crispy, the Bibimbap actually had flavor, and the sushiritto is the best I have had so far! I will be back FOR SURE
