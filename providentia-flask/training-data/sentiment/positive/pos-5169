I'm from Ohio and it wasn't until I moved here until I found out what Topgolf even was! So much fun! Even better that I won :) Food was good and our waitress AJ was fantastic. She had us laughing the whole time and recommended some really good things on the menu I hadn't tried before. Also, my pop never even came close to empty! She was always there before I could even ask! The experience was awesome and our customer service was excellent. Please never get rid of the Mushi! It's my fav! Thanks Topgolf and thanks AJ!!!
