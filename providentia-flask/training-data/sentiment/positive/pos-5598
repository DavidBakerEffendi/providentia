Alright if you want the best of the best service this is the place to go. I have never been more impressed with a restaurant. Two breakfasts in a row and absolutely fabulous service. From the moment you order there are multiple people that come and ask how you are doing. If your drink is half way empty multiple people will ask if you would like another. The friendliness is a league of its own. If you want to be treated like royalty at breakfast this is your place! Can't wait for tomorrow morning
