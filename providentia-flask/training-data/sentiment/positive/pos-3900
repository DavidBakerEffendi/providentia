I live nearby and just ventured over to Wildflower for my first lunch! What a pleasant surprise! The food is great-ingredients fresh, bread fantastic and the meatball sandwich my husband ordered-"one of the best." It was a busy Saturday and lots of kids and families were there, but no waiting in line to take our order and the food was at the table in less than 10 minutes. I will definitely be a regular-the prices were great and food was memorable! I like salads and the choices were amazing-I had the salmon chopped salad and it was delicious!
