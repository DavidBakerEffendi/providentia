Amazing service! Great atmosphere and most importantly...real good food! The people are very friendly and want you to stay and enjoy yourself. Took my parents here for some Mexican tacos and burritos and they were happy with how friendly the owner was and how great the food tasted. We sat and talked after we were done eating and didn't feel rushed. Very cool place! Definitely going back, and taking some friends too!
