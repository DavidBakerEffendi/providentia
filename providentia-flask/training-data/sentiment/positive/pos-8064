After living in the SF Bay Area for 14 years I was surprised to learn that there were very few Filipino restaurants in PHX.  Hey Joe does a nice job of getting around the Valley to make it feel like you can easily get this cuisine.  Fresh, young coconut, lumpia and skewers of chicken and pork are all I need for a great meal.  The truck delivers on that very well.  The clean truck and presentation are also appreciated by me.

I completely recommend Hey Joe and hope you'll help keep this truck running to events and brewery stops!
