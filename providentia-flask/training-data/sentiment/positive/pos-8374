House of Jazz was recommended by some locals. Reservation is required. Tables right up against the stage. You walk in and get to your table by the host. Bar to the left and seating area at the back and into the side. You can see the stage from whichever direction. Depending on the performer- you may sit and enjoy the music but also can be pulled up on stage to dance. Recommend sitting in mid section as you can see and hear the music. Won't be too loud and you won't have your back to the performers or be knocked down by avid dancers who want to dance on stage. Food itself was good. Pricey but reasonable portions - ordered the Paella- spicy with Louisiana touch. Drinks were good. Did not have desert but others did and people commented on how good their was. Cost of admission also part of the bill just a heads up. Did not have to coat check so no issues.
