I love Ancora. I've been visiting this location for years. I remember when they actually had a roaster in the middle of the room. I do believe this establishment  changed hands a few years back, but it still has kept it's good vibe and great coffee/service. It's a pretty roomy cafe with tables and chairs and a few more comfortable seating options for "camping out" a while longer. The coffee is excellent, both the brewed and the espresso drinks. I'm never disappointed with a latte from Ancora, ever. Sometime we stop here on a Saturday morning before the farmers market to get a good, hot cup of coffee and a tasty, warm and toasted, freshly made breakfast sandwich. Yum, yum. In more recent years they have added the service of making some evening cocktails, which, I'm never in the area that time of night, so I haven't tried them, but it's a cool idea.
I highly recommend giving these guys a try if you never have. You will also be able to enjoy local artist's work displayed on the walls, that is for sale. It's a great place to stay, drink, eat and relax in a comfortable atmosphere.
