My first time ordering last week. The chili chicken was really good. The Hakka veggie noodles, very good. Mango chicken is amazing. The veggie fried rice was apparently very bland. The service was nice and the place was clean. There's only 4-5 booths for seating. If ordering over $20 and paying cash, they offer 10% off. Woild definitely recommend. I will likely try the other Hakka restaurants on 48 but I'd consider coming back here.
