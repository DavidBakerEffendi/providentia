amazing coffee/bakery shop! on the weekend, i like to go here for brunch and get their french toast which is to die for! my go tos for this place is an almond croissant with spiced chai latte. their croissants are small but big in flavours. and i normally don't drink chai latte but their twist (spiced) is so hard to resist! i would prefer this place over what a bagel which is a few steps down the street because of the free wifi and it's not as crowded
