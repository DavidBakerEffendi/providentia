Provision opened two days ago as I write this (on December 10th) and as such most people arent aware that it's opened, so when I popped in just before noon I was the only customer. This was actually quite a nice thing as I got to chat extensively with the manager, exec chef and the pastry/sous chef. All wonderful people. It was brunch time so I ordered off that menu and got steak and eggs, the priciest thing for brunch at $25 (everything else is much more reasonable but I've never in my 52 years on this planet ordered steak and eggs and decided to treat myself).

It was just outstanding. The portion wasn't massive but every bite was delectable. A perfect cooked to medium steak (skirt I think, a relatively robust cut, cooked perfectly I repeat) with the most fantastic, lemony hollandaise atop- one of the best two restaurant hollandaise sauces in memory, the other one being at Full Circle's brunch- with gorgeous crispy potatoes, two perfectly (see the trend here?) cooked eggs and I got a couple of slices of toast from a house-made white bread aside. It was just magical. 

This is a great use of a great space from the Avec Bistro folks. Great experience start to finish.
