Some of the best sushi I've ever had, which isn't saying much since I am not a sushi connoisseur and I'm also not very adventurous (I stick with spicy shrimp, shrimp tempura, california, sweet potato), but I am never disappointed and I always leave happy.

Really friendly staff, and on Tuesdays and Wednesdays they have discounted regular rolls. YUM!
