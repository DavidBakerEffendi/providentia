The Green  Valley- Veggie Pizza is a winner!

We had an impromptu gathering at my big sis' house in Vegas and ordered in a large veggie and a large pepperoni pizza. 

If you prefer your crust light & airy, almost Brooklyn pizza style, then you'll give this pizza a thumbs up. The vegetables are fresh & tasty. The tomato sauce is light and seasoned to perfection.  Green  Valley pizza is comprised of the following toppings:  cherry  tomatoes; zucchini; black olives; onions; and mushroom. 

On a busy day,  the Friday after Thanksgiving, the person taking the tel. order was patient and friendly. The delivery driver was polite. The pizza was at doorstep in about 40 minutes. 

I will definitely call up pizza from Metro again the next time I'm in Vegas.
