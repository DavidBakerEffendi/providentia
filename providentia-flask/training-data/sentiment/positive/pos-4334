Cute interior, really friendly staff, and one of the best pulled pork sandwiches in the city.

I had been meaning to check out the Hogtown Cure for a while, and one Sunday afternoon after looking at houses I was so hungry on my way home I thought I might stop at Porchetta and Co. Sadness came over me when I arrived there to realize that it was closed on Sundays. As my journey down Dundas continued, and the pangs of hunger increased, we drove past the Hogtown Cure and I immediately yelled "Pull over!". Initially my girlfriend thought I was sick, and that I was going to hurl, but then she realized my intention was to pick up a pulled pork sandwich.

I think it must have been fate, because that was one mighty fine pulled pork sandwich. With pulled pork being everywhere, including Subway Restaurants, it's a little hard to stick out from the pack, but the Hogtown Cure achieves this by letting the pork sing. It is not slathered with sauce like so many pulled pork sandwiches, yet it is still so moist. And even without the excess amount of sauce, it is full of flavour as it is by far the smokiest tasting pulled pork sandwich I've had in the city. On top of the huge pile of pulled pork is some creamy coleslaw and grainy mustard. This sandwich proves you don't need pulled pork dripping in BBQ sauce. The pulled pork sandwich is 9.50 and for the size of the sandwich, and the fact it came with a large pickle spear, and some potato salad, I'd say the prices are definitely fair. 

The restaurant interior is cute, and the staff was really friendly. Couple that with one of the best pulled pork sandwiches in the city, and I would definitely return here, and recommend others try it as well.
