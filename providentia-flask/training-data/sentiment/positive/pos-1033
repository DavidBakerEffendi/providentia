Love this levetto location! It's cozy and the food is amazing. The service is always so friendly here. This location has limited seating but they're not as busy here so you don't have to worry about not getting a table when you drop by!

I come here on a weekly basis to either dine in or get takeout and every time the experience was great. I love how all the levetto locations have the open kitchen concept where you get to see the chef cooking your food right infront of you. 

Their pastas are the best in toronto in my opinion. I love coming here when they have $5 wine specials! They also have a offer and deal for each day of the week too!

Love the food and service here! It's honestly top notch!
