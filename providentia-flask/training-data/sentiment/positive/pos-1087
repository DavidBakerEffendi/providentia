Seeing some pictures of these dogs on Instagram drew me in for a birthday lunch. (Happy Birthday to me!!) 

We walked in and were welcomed like regulars. Cheers anyone?  Being a first time customer I asked for the run down and a suggestion. I took the suggestion and got the Sonogran dog (southwest), my husband went for the The CharHeel, and my little guy got the kids meal corn dogs. 
We noticed the awesome prices of beer too. 

We got our drinks loaded up on pickled what nots and sauce from the little bar. Once we sat down our food was ready. Normally I have time to wash my hands get back and read a novel at most restaurants...  Not today! 

I got some onion rings to go with my meal and whatever the guy on here was complaining about was delusional! They were greasy & crunchy yea, but that's the damn style. Let the chefs make it how they want. This is 'merica right!! 
The hotdogs themselves were like little works of culinary art. The flavors created a mind bending journey to the west where I devoured this angelic dog much like I imagine Kanye did after his mouth was opened after being wired shut. The freshness and creativity are much appreciated.  

We loved the first round so much we spilt the weekly collaboration dog Jam Session... It was fucking balls the the wall delicious. 

I could go on and on about this place but I will just be making the trip from Spencer Mountain  to check in occasionally to show my support.
