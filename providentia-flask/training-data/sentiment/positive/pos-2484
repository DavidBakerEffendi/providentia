Everything on that menu is crafted to perfection. The fried rice is perfect... Aromatic and perfectly spiced. The duck and the noodle dishes are the same. Perfectly spiced and the ingredients are fresh! The chefs are Chinese and are not kidding around. They are pros. Given that finding a decent Chinese place in Vegas is like searching for the Holy Grail, I feel like I've hit the jackpot! How it's Done!
