Round Two at Buldogis! Here's what I ordered:

Angry Dog:  A juicy, plump dog topped with Asian Slaw, fatty pieces of spicy pork Bulgogi, diced jalape√±o peppers, and spicy mayo. This dog gave my tastebuds a bite! 

Although I've only dined here twice, I've made the decision that this is my favorite dog, -- at least for now. I prefer The Angry Dog over the Bahn Mi Dog -- which is also worth a try -- because it's much spicier. On the other hand, my cousin ordered the Bahn Mi Dog and thought it was too spicy. Either way, both dogs are  geared towards lovers of spiciness, though you can request to tone it down a few notches. 

Euro Fries: I think these tasted better the second time around, or maybe it's because I haven't been here in a while so they just tasted bomb to me? Mmm, pork belly, cheese, and garlic mayo. What an irresistible combination.

Hm, I wonder what's in store for Round 3? Perhaps Angry Kimchi Fries? A Teriyaki Dog? A burger? Don't know, but I think I should start visiting this place more often.
