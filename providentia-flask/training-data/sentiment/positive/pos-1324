Fish is super fresh and their bonito broth is also super tasty, I haven't had better soba/udon in Toronto. Almost everything I've tried on the menu is fantastic (especially their curry, which is apparently home-made). Service is also attentive, sometimes they take the time to describe the dish and tell you how to eat it if it's a bit complicated.

Their grilled fish is generaly really good (especially the blue mackerel filet), but I avoid the atlantic salmon shioyaki since they have a tendency to burn it a little bit. Maybe it's supposed to be that way, maybe not; either way, it's not really to my taste. Service can also be a little slow when the restaurant gets super busy, I wouldn't go during peak hours unless you can actually look inside to see how busy it is.

Overall this is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Toronto.
