We came for Lunch using our My Vegas 2 for 1. Had we not had the discount I would still say that the price is worth paying. Upon arriving we learned that they have a weekday brunch, which made me really excited since we missed breakfast. The omelet was perfect as were the country potatoes and bacon. I also got a piece of French Toast but between that and the syrup, the sweetness overwhelmed me. For my second round I tried a little of their Asian cuisine. To my surprise they had pork buns(so yummy) I enjoyed their chow menu, green bean and chicken broccoli. My only complaint was the coffee. This was our first cup of coffee for the day and it tasted just awful. They came from dispenser machine, which is probably why. Other than that, everything was delicious. I hope to come back for dinner sometime!
