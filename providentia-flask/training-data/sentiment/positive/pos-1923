This place will definitely be out go to for Mexican food! It's so good and the fajitas had such good flavor and the flaming of it in front of your table is a nice touch. It's kids friendly which is good being we had our daughter with us. Happy hour menu was good but we got a Margarita they had for cinco de mayo. Will for sure be coming back!
