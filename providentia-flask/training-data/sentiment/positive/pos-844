What a nice find! Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood in the North Side.  Quiet, intimate and cozy. Food was so delicious and service was great - in laws are still talking about our meal. Prices are reasonable too - all entrees were at $20. Our table had the asparagus soup, pelmeni, chicken pot pie, noodle broth and the pear torte. The pelemni could have used a little bit more salt but seriously everything was so tasty.
