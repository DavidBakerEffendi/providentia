If you're looking for a nice little local restaurant for breakfast, then look no further! Bertha's is where it's at!

I come here often for a book club meet up. They have a huge table in the back of the place which is great for a large group of people. They have a wide variety of baked goods (I recommend the cheesecake and the mini red velvet cupcakes. Yum!) but the breakfast is the main reason we go.

The waffles are so delicious and very kid friendly. Very fluffy and comes topped with whipped cream, strawberries, bananas, and candied almonds. The turkey jalape√±o egg sandwich has a nice balance of spice and avocado and a nice serving of turkey. But my personal favorite is the Breakfast Wrap. 

The environment is very laid back and cozy. The staff is always friendly and they always have a smile on their face. Tip: if you're every there in the summer, you HAVE to try the Watermelon Lemonade. That's on my list of things I look forward to in the summer.

Best place for a nice delicious baked treat or breakfast with some friends
