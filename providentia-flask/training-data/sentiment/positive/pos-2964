The service here was so awesome and the girl who took our order was the sweetest server I have ever met. She gave us complementary tacos pastor which were BOMB!!!! So if you come here please come for those they are amazing just explodes in your mouth with flavor and the tortillas are handmade. I had the chicken flautas which were on the dry side and was okay and my friend had the Mexican scrambled eggs which were toooo spicy for him. I tried it and it was reallly spicy. But me and him are not really into spicy foods So if you like spicy scrambled eggs then get the huevos a la mexicana but personally I would recommend the tacos pastor. Omg so good.
