The drinks are amazing. The food is fabulous. They are always so busy and usually the servers are running around. Like any where, some seem pretty uninterested. The chef fortunately makes up for the table service. Which, I think table service doesn't even start till 4p. Before that it's a multi-tasking bar/barista. Great spot. The owner surly know how to design a place, make good drinks, and good food.
