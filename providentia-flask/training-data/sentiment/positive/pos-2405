Took the initiative to Yelp a breakfast place after our basketball game and came across this place. Enjoyed the ambience of this place, very friendly, with GOOD costumer service from the greeters to the waitresses. Affordable pricing for their menu and have an array of selection for breakfast and lunch. I ordered the Denver omelette that came with a good amount of potatoes and your choice of toast or banana muffin, which I got the muffin. They were quick and efficient in making sure we got our food and didn't miss anything. I recommend this place if you are in the area and are in need of a spot to eat.
