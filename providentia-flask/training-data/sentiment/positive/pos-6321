Finally an ono 808 kau kau place near my house!

Kauai Cafe is not your typical cookie cutter "Hawaiian BBQ" place. It is ohana owned and operated and they serve legitimate island style home cooked food. No half-hearted bootleg island-wanna be food here. I put my local seal of approval on this place. (I'm born and raised in Hawaii just in case you couldn't tell by now) 

Some menu highlights and recommendations that I've tried:

Heineken beer batter chicken. It's a solid size hind-quarter. The chicken has a nice solid crunchy skin and still moist and juicy on the inside.

Portuguese Bean soup. man I wish they served this as a main dish instead of a side order. I look like a fatty when I tell them I want a big bowl of this. My dad would've loved this.
