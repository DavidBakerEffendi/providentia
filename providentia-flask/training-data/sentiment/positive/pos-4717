OMG I still have dreams of my meal here at RM Seafood.  Super nice place, but not so high end that you need to wear a suit and tie to.  The servers are cordial and very knowledgeable to steer you in the right direction if you have no idea what to order - or you are on the fence about how much to order.

Located in Mandalay Bay Casino, it's a great spot for celebrity chef Rick Moonen's vision of a restaurant that supports sustainable fishing practices while having a unique dining experience.  Totally dug the clean modern lines and warm wood tones in the dining room.  We had a large party so we were sat at the larger tables that are partitioned by a curtain.... it was almost like a private room (until other parties started coming for dinner).  Still a great space and a great experience if you come to Vegas!

I went with the "Surf and Surf" which was one of the restaurants "Best Sellers" according to our server.  Shrimp and lobster placed over a bed of truffle butter risotto - it was so melt in your mouth and the shrimp and lobster cooked to perfection.  Some of my friends had the fresh Cobia special over mushrooms and fava beans.  My more daring friends ordered the seafood sampler which our waiter steered them away from ordering the largest "Kitchen Sink" which ended up being the right call.  We all left with full bellies and a great impression of the restaurant.
