Love the Philly Cheesesteak Pita which is always a winner! Thinly sliced Ribeye Marinated with onions and peppers inside the Pita which is a great combination. Once you have had that it is difficult to eat there again and not order the same thing over and over.

We generally order the hummus and Shawarma which are both very good. It is difficult to share these items but maybe just take a bite so you could have a taste of different items.

The staff is very attentive and also there to fill your drink.

The restaurant offers a wide variety of healthy items including pizza. 

Will be back again and recommend to others.
