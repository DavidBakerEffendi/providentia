Natalie at the meat counter is always a delight and Todd does a good job ordering items that are not typically carried (i.e. fresh Rhubarb). I was at Albertson's just up the street and was going to but two Salmon Filets for the BBQ recently, but unlike Smith's, they don't have skin-on filets (and cut to order, if you ask nicely).
I actually put down the items I was going to buy and went back to Smith's - where I know I can get what I want. I like that Smith's still sends me coupons for the things I buy the most, and that the cashiers are always friendly and helpful.
