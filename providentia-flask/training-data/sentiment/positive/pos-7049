When I first heard of Roots Cafe I was a little confused as to why Alex Haley had decided to open a restaurant. Once I got inside and didn't see Lavar Burton I realized I was mistaken. They also don't have Quest Love of Black Thought inside the venue. 

I came in here for a bit of breakfast on Saturday. They weren't very crowded and had a very laid back atmosphere. The menu for breakfast was pretty simple but very filling. They also had a lot of coffee options. If you're looking for a nice place to grab a light bite to eat and a latte this is the spot for you.

I also asked for a side of toast and it was so big it might as well have been a loaf of bread! LOL I wasn't able to finish it but good to know you get your money's worth. The same way you'll get your money's worth if you go see Thor: Ragnarok. It's an excellent movie that really breaks the mold. 

In a time where it feels like so many things in America threaten to pull us apart Roots Cafe is tying to bring us back together.
