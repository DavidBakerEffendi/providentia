We went on a Sunday at an off hour, found it quiet.  I ordered the Tennessee ribs.  I really expect ribs to stand on their own without sauce and these were there. Lean meat, good smoke flavor.  They aren't nearly as salty as some I've had in town which is a plus.  Sauces at the table if you want that. I was impressed and will be back.  Service was good.
