We came here on a Friday night around 6p before it really filled up. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken. This place has quite the selection of craft beers on tap, I was amazed at the variety of local beers on draft. We tried some wings and they were incredible good. The pizza was just good but it hit the spot. My buddy's kid ordered a kiddie dish of wings with the sweet bbq sauce and it was a little to spicy for the kid and I was extremely impressed at how one of the staff could tell by observing that something wasn't cool and he came over and asked. He had no problems bringing a new order of wings for the child. Throughout our meal the service was probably some of the best service I have experienced in a long time even for the place being completely packed. 

Be careful though trying to make your way to the restrooms it is a little confusing and it is easy to go into the wrong one if you aren't paying attention. That happened to me HA!
