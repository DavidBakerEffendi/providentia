Tacos Chiwas.... where have you been all of my life? We needed a quick place to eat before taking me to the airport. I was reluctant to go but the boyfriend has been good all week so I gave in to his cravings. It's definitely a hole in the wall place but I'm glad we stopped by.

I ordered the lengua and carnitas tacos. They were both garnished with chopped cilantro and onions. Both were delish but I preferred the lengua over the carnitas... flavor and texture wise. I checked out their salsa bar and got some of the sauteed onions and the roasted habaneros. The sauteed onions - a must try. The roasted habaneros added a nice spiciness to the tacos - but take small bites. You'll thank me later.

We shared a large horchata - I really enjoyed it! It's properly spiced and not overly sweet like most places.

They serve menudo on the weekends - I love a good menudo! I will definitely come back to try that. 

Price - 2 tacos, a asado burrito and a large horchata came to about $15.XX including tax. Not too shabby. 

Service - quick and friendly

Atmosphere - random decor like it was decorated by a person with ADHD. Look squirrel...
