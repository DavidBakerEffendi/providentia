We've gone here a couple of times.  It's ever so slightly more expensive than the places we usually frequent and it's a bit out of the way from our apartment, so we don't go as often as we should.  The food is delicious (though I don't claim to be an expert on Lebanese food, just what tastes good.) and the service is great.  They've also got a couple of interesting beers that I don't normally see around here, which is a plus.  

Last time, I had the beef shawarma rolled and a falafel appetizer, and she had the falafel salad.  I tried one from their beer selection and had their delicious mint tea, she just had water.  With all of that and a tip, we spent about $30.  Worth every penny.
