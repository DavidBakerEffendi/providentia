This is one of my favorite haunts for lunch! I love Emily and Erin - twins that are both the best and make me feel welcome every time! I have never had bad service at this location and it is close to work. The coffee cake is so unique - different all the time - and their coffee is wonderful. I love the food - tasty and plentiful. There is a lot of fun pictures and decorations on the walls -  the coffee pix are my favorites. Their rewards program is really great - I get coupons with $$ off all the time which brings me back as well.
