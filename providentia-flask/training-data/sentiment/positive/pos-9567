This is one of the best and most authentic middle eastern restaurants around! Although the name suggests a fast food oriental restaurant, this place is anything but that. Food is homey and delicious and reasonably priced with very generous portions. 

My recommendations would be the hummus, chicken shish kabob, and shawarma. 

Great place for lunch!!
