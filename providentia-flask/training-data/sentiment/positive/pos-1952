OMFG!!! Found this place by mistake, 4 of us ordered from all over the menu.. other than pleased grunting there was no words once the food arrived and everyone was ecstatic about the food they ordered once finished! Would consider planning my trips to Vegas around stopping here on the way in and out of town. MUST TRY THIS PLACE!!!!!!
