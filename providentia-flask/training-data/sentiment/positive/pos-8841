Maura was a fantastic server - super friendly and attentive - made the end of our trip so perfect - give her a raise!  And this place is a staple for whenever I visit Pittsburgh and specifically when I'm downtown (likely for the Replay F/X festival).  After a long day of pinball or even in between Sienna is a great stop for their awesome meatballs!  And there's a rooftop beer garden which is sweet at night as well.
