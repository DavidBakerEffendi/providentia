Flavorful fresh ingredients! I came here on a double date after wanting to try it for a while. We started off with the grilled zucchini appetizer, I would come back for this alone! It was very well done, the combination of fried egg, lemon, mint and cheese was amazing, it worked really well together. I had the eggplant strozzapreti and my husband had the gnocchi, they portion size was large and the pasta was fresh and full of well put together flavors. We asked the server for a recommendation on wine as we like lighter reds and she suggested the pinot nero which was very good. Service was attentive as well. I will definitely come back here as now I want to try everything on the menu!
