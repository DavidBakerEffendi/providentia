I wouldn't call myself your standard pizza fan so take my content how you will...

Thick gooey cheesy gobby pizza with tons of tomato sauce and thick crust is just not my thing.. I'm into a more light crunch, delectable, high end type of pizza. Maybe pizza regulars don't like that, but I do. And this hit a home run on my spot

I custom ordered my pizza with pepperoni, arugula, anchovies and mozzarella. They tend to skimp on all the ingredients, including the crust being thin... But the quality, damn, the quality is real. The flavor is masterful and the oil brushed on top is intensely pure. Don't forget the dash of salt that is savory

I loved this pizza and will be back again
