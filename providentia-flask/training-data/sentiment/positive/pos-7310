A great local joint that's super casual, with affordable, fast and tasty food.

Located in a residential area, they get a lunch crowd thanks to nearby high school.

They have fantastic pizza and pasta. Food is put out in hot plate fashion. So it's kind of like fast food.

Not too much seating - but most people do take out anyway.

Also a great place to pick up pizza dough, sauces, and other ingredients too if you love to cook and experiment at home!
