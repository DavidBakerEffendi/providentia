Outside of the excellent food, the customer service stands out. Waiters really knew their menu & was always giving great dining suggestions & prep suggestions too.

The pork belly dim sum was really good. Something different & not too heavy. 

I had the fish trio and all three fish were cooked perfectly, what stood out from the three fish though was the "Butter Fish" so much that I ordered an entree of it! Delicate & it lives up to the name! Melted in my mouth like butter! Only complaint was some of the fish had some bones, but that's expected! lol 

Definitely recommend going here.
