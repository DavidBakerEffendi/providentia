I've gotten take-out here twice, and it's been great both times. The sweet potato maki was the best I've ever had (seasoned perfectly), and the fish was fresh and well-proportioned. The purple rice is tasty and looks beautiful. Service was friendly and very quick. This is probably the best sushi I've had in Phx.
