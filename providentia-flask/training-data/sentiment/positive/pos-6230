Delicious!!! Yes, yes, yes. 

We stopped in here before a tango class at urban winery (yes, check that out) and loved it. We got the yogurt chicken kebab (amazing), cold mezze starter (a bit overpriced for what you got but great, fresh taste) and the signature dessert. We loved it and I would definitely recommend!
