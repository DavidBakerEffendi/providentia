If you're looking for a Jewish NY deli style breakfast/brunch you should definitely stop by this place! 

Probably the best most authentic Jewish deli in Vegas. 

Yummy food. 
Big portions. 
Comfy booths and large space. 
Lots of parking. 
Friendly service. 


The menu is like a newspaper and you actually get a cool vibe while being inside. 

I would recommend to go with the:
Lox platter- smoked salmon is heaven made. 
French dip.
Eggs Benedict.
Most Sandwiches. 
Home fries. 

The only thing that might be a downside is a waiting list over the weekends. 15-25 min.

Great place overall! Highly recommended. 
Trust me. I know food! :)
