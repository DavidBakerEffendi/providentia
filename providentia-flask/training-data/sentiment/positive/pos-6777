Wow my fiance and I have been here twice now. First time around noon on a Monday wasn't bad for a crowd the grab and go had already been cleaned out. We stayed for a rainbow roll and I loved it so much the purple rice is so pretty I felt so good after eating it. The second time was right when it opened at 11am on  Tuesday which was nice. I tried real Wasabi which is OMG amazing! I had no idea it would be so good ! The seaweed salad was also perfect. This place is definately my favorite spot to get sushi.
