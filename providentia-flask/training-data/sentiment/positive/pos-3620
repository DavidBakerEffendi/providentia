Wow, Pizza Bogo has some of the finest pizza in Northeast Ohio!  In general, the pizzas all taste incredibly fresh, and the prices are amazing!  It's the type of pizza that tastes great while you're eating, but doesn't leave you feeling weighed down when you're finished.  Additionally, the menu is very friendly to those who restrict pork from their diets.  All of the pizzas we ordered were out of this world: Bangkok, Tuscan Fiorentina, Milano, Napa Valley, and Meat Works.  Both the original crust and the Miracle Crust were spectacular.  Even the Bread Stix with marinara and garlic sauce was awesome, but I'd rather eat pizza!
