Operated by the same owners as Thai taste. Hibiscus seems to be a similar restaurant with some Korean flare and a bit more elevated than Thai taste.

We came one night with friends for a double date. Our server was so kind and very helpful in explaining the menu.

My husband and I recently travelled to Thailand, so we have been in search of similar flavors. We started with the papaya salad. This is a staple in Thailand and we were excited to try it. It was excellent, but way too spicy. We only ordered a level III spice, but the papaya must've absorbed more than other dishes.

My husband ordered the pad Thai and he was very happy with this. I ordered green curry at a level four spice, and it was delicious. I even had some to take home with me. This, surprisingly, was not as spicy as I expected.

I was able to finish the meal with mango sticky rice, which I was so excited about. I believe the serving on this was small for the price.


We did have an appetizer, two entr√©es, and dessert, but I did feel like things were a bit expensive. Drinks were good as well and I was pretty happy with my cocktails.

If anything, I will be back for the curry and the nice service. Price for the curry seems to be consistent with other restaurants in town.
