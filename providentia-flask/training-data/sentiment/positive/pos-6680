We ended up here after reading glowing reviews from the Yelpers. However, it turned out to be as fun and cool to look at as it is to eat. Although our pretty waitress/bartender in the circular bar in the middle of the resto did comment that the lighting makes things look funny- so your steak is kinda blue. Watch out for the drinks here 3 glasses of wine ended up costing $84!  We enjoyed 3 courses, seafood, steak, fries and 2 desserts. The scallops and steak were perfectly cooked- like actual perfection. The place was packed- recession what?
