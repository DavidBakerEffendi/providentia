I have seriously never been very adventurous with hot dogs. Honestly a bum and ketchup is all I need. I don't even like mustard. Booo I know I'm boring. However I was pleasantly surprised to have the pleasure of trying JJ's Red Hots at a yelp event. For someone who normally does not like mustard, both dogs that were offered had mustard on them. Oh man and did I scarf them down like no tomorrow. Today I had the pleasure of having anything on the menu on them as a thank you to veterans. The quarter hounder, and was it delicious! Bacon, queso, lettuce, tomato. With a drink and side of fresh house made chips served with ranch. I ate every bite! So far it's my third dog there, and I plan on trying all of them. The signature is awesome. Mustard, relish, onions and a dill pickle spear. And I will say this is not how I would normally want my hot dogs. I've also had the whistle pig with bacon, onions, mustard, and shredded cheese. To all hot dog fans you must try this place. They are all also very nice here and it's almost like your at home. Thanks for the meal JJ's! I will be back.
