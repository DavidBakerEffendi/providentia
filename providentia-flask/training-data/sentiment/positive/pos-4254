Have been here twice and both times constancy is amazing, not to mention their service. It's a husband And wife team who are both genuine and honest. The portions are awesome leaving you wanting more but stuffed. they don't use No MsG on many of their dishes. Freshly made and different ways of sprucing up your combo  while you wait! 4 tables to sit. And bar to have quick meal! Awesome for quick stop by very close pickering town centre! Try their Beef short ribs! So far have tried scallops and shrimp, side noodles side steak and side beef Short Rib ribs. Excellent customer service for a take out and eat in joint. It's possible quickest freshest you can get. And they literally will keep you entertained while they cook. Kitchen cooking is visible so you can see your food being prepared!
