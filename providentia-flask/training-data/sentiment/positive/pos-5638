I seriously hate trying new places, especially for chinese food cause you never know if it's gonna be the same as ones you tried before. So anyways I was out of luck because the other close by was closed or at least wasn't answering and I'm super hungry. So I decided to order a pint of Sweet and Sour Chicken for 5.25 served with a side of rice, and fried dumplings. I got a huge portion of chicken and a huge pool to dip my chicken in which was amazing to say the least. And the dumplings, they weren't as I've had before, they were really full of flavor, the sauce it was served with was a little thicker, which I really enjoyed because it didn't drip all over me and it was so flavorful. The dumplings were really big compared to the ones I've had at other places. Anyways, long story short I love this place! Thanks!!
