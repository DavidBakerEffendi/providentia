We dropped into the Koji China Bistro and Sushi Bar for dinner last night. It is in the mix of all the hub bub of the Orleans Casino and we were unsure of what to expect. Of course the place was beautiful and setup perfectly for dinner. We were a bit early by Vegas standards - It was 6 PM - and the place was very empty. I want Chinese I said t myself and in we went. The Hostess was friendly and playful to my humor, asking her if she could possibly fit us in for dinner. Well a beautiful booth was ours and the wonderful, speedy and personable waiter, Antonio, was there to help us with drinks and menus. I just wanted a simple meal f cucumber salad and vegetable lettuce wraps, and Anet had a Schezuan chicken dish. Wow! they came out so quick and beautifully prepared. The cucumber salad had a beautiful tang to it I liked a lot. The lettuce wraps with the hoisin sauce weretp grade. Then the chicken Schezuan had a colorful mix of vegetables, was piping hot and had enough spice to get the lips buzzing. All in all I am ready to go here again and try more items as this visit was a winner.
