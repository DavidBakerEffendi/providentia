Honestly it's a dessert place... who couldn't leave happy? It's sinful decadence and worth every calorie and penny spent. The portions are large and generally I will ask for a 1/2 portion of Ice cream as I never finish. The hot couture is amazing and so are their teas. Staff are exceptional, attentive and very good at helping you decide on what would suit your current pallet. Love this place, it's a must try if you've never been. It's fairly inexpensive when compared to chain restaurant dessert prices and vastly more worth your while.
