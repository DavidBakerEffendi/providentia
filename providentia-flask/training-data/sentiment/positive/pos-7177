This was for a togo order. I was in a rush after doing some grocery shopping and I just saw this place near that Von's center. Apparently they had just opened. I almost went to the Hawaiian place but I like to try new places. 

When I stepped in, I felt like I was under dressed and they may not have lunch specials cuz it looked small and the d√©cor was a bit fancy more than a casual looking setting.

This is their second location and they already had one opened on north side.

I decided to see if they had lunch specials at fair prices. I got a panang curry with chicken with spicy 5. I almost ordered an 8 but I remember that panang usually is spicier at a lot of places so I just asked for the spicy stuff on the side. So the 5, really was a 5. I think I should've ordered that 8 but I didn't want to be dying in class so good choice for me I suppose. 

It was really delicious and plenty of chicken in it. usually the chicken lacks at places. The lunch portion was a perfect portion for me. we get a salad and an egg roll. usually the portion is too much but I ate everything and didn't feel that food coma!

I also had a Thai tea. I believe 3 bucks for a Thai tea is a bit steep but I enjoyed it still. I'll give it another try and actually dine in next time.

Don't forget your stamp cards! every time you spend at least $20 they'll give you a stamp.
