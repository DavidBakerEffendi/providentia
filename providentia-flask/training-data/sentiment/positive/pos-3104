I am so glad that we chanced upon this little place, an off-shoot of Q Karaoke lounge next door.  We had actually intended to go to a Szechuan restaurant on Spring Mountain, but upon arriving decided it was a little too Szechuan...  Checking on Yelp for a high-rated Asian, we decided to head over to this place just around the corner.  It's always great to chance upon a great tasting place, but when it is a great Korean place in Vegas, it makes the night.

This place is small, nice but simply decorated, with two large screen TVs.  It's an L-shaped place but the TVs are right next to each other, so there is no view from the other side of the L.  Wish they change that.  We are greeted by an adorable hostess, who ends up being our server as well.  Super cute and super sweet girl... 

We order fried calamari, beef brisket, and sweet potato fries, along with a bottle of makgeolli.  The calamari was good, some pieces were a bit dry but generally meaty and served with cocktail sauce and a soy sauce/sesame oil mix.  The sweet potato fries were great, sufficiently crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The real winner was the brisket though, served with awesomely yummy side dishes and Korean-style leek salad.  Brisket comes cooked on a bed of onions and jalapenos.  Dip the meat in sesame oil and eat it with the leek salad, and it's marvelous.  I also have to mention the side dishes - fish cakes, sausage, kimchi, japchae, and mung beans - all of which were all fantastic.  

We came here early, around 7pm or so, and it was basically empty.  I'm guessing, since this is a Korean bar, that it comes alive later in the night?  It surely deserves to be crowded, so I'm wondering if we were just early.  Anyways, with great food, cozy but good atmosphere, and great service, we will definitely make our way back here, perhaps after 9pm.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Probably not a good idea, it's a bar with no bar, and not conducive to accommodating single patrons.
