I walking by Bob's a few months ago while running an errand and promised myself I'd go back and check it out. Today I was concidentally running another errand around lunchtime so I stopped in. What a fool for waiting so long... that was easily the tastiest Korean food I've ever had. This takeout place easily beat all the Korean restaurants I've been to. The restaurants' food was "ehh.. ok" so I assumed the whole cuisine was "meh". I apologize :)

I ordered the spicy beef bulgogi with noodles, and had a small spicy kimchi and the free miso soup on the side. The cuts of meat were good and lean, the noodles were the right firmness and it was spicy enough for flavor but not so hot that I'd need water to cool it down. And, it was prepared very quickly!!
The place is tiny, only 4 chairs in front of a window. And it's easy to miss from the street... they could really use a sidewalk sign. Regardless, it is now firmly in my downtown finance district lunch rotation along with St Lawrence Mkt and Ritz for good cooked food.
