As you can obviously see by all the GREAT reviews, Carolina's is the TOP for quick Mexican Food. 
Every time I go there the place is packed WALL TO WALL with people! yet you STILL get in-and-out in about 5-10 mins TOPS! 
I'm the type who LOVES the occasional Filiberto's, but ever since I've gone to Carolina's I haven't stepped FOOT inside another mexican "fast food" restaurant again! 
Try it and you WILL love it!
