Lumiere is truly as good as it gets for French cuisine in Charlotte. I've eaten here probably 5 times and always had an outstanding experience.  I recently dined on the pork cheeks which were kind of like a braised short rib consistency-truly incredible. Their seafood preparation is always great and I love the baba au rhum dessert. It's only for true rum lovers because it is strong! It's great for special occasions and if you subscribe to their newsletter, they offer discounted meals through the week!
