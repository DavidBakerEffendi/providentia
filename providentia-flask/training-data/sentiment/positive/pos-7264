Awesome place! Customer service was excellent! The food, although inexpensive, were very tasty. We got the chicken burrito and they were very good. The hot sauces were also very good and fresh. I will be coming back and I recommend it!! Overall, extremely clean environment with a good dine in experience and yummy food.
