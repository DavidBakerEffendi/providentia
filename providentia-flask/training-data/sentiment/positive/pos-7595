Today I visited this relatively new restaurant for lunch.  I work out of my home and usually eat lunch at home but I did some business at the local bank and decided to pull in for lunch.  They have a lunch special for $6.99 that lets you pick your pasta, a salad and a piece of foccacia bread.  Adding the fountain drink made it $10 bucks and some change.  The "cashier" brought my salad out promptly.  My fresh made pasta came out about 4.35 minutes later.  Perfect.

They have created a nice brand.  Since I am a graphic design I must like the logo or I will not set foot in the place.  They have some other discreet features that really make it a cool little joint.  They grow their own herbs and display them in a counter.  They play some indy rock that is not too overbearing.   They have a wonderful large format arty photograph on the main wall.  I have seen this place jam at night.  Be a great place to bring a date.

All that being said, the salad, the pasta and the bread were delish.  I would highly recommend the experience.
