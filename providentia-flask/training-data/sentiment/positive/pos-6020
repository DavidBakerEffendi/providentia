Best gelato in town! I'm so glad I tried this place because everyone with a sweet tooth should try it. I love the sweet stuff like chocolate hazelnut, cake batter, mango, pineapple, Nutella and the list goes on.
My friends get crazy sometimes and they've had flavors like rosemary olive oil, sweet onions, Margarita pizza and they like all the savory stuff too. 
The store is owned by the nicest lady ever and she gives you as many samples as you want. 
This place is a must for all!
