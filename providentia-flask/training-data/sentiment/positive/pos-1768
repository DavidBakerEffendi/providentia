This place is VERY special. Small but intimate, effortless cool invested in the decor (ape skull x-rays hung on lightboxes on the walls, brick, industrial lampshades), and absolutely sublime food. 

To understood how good it is, they once opened for breakfast a few years ago and served astounding dishes, like eggs in sunflower oil/milk and curry cakes, and the place was MOBBED by patrons. The owner/chef couldn't handle the load so he went back to lunch/dinner only.

I would say this place probably rotates in the top three French restos in the entire city.
