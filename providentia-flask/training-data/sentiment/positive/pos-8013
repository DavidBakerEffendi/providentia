This place is so good, we went 2 days in a row so we could try more menu items! We went during a weeknight so it wasn't very busy which meant we got excellent service. We got the tuna sushi-rito wrapped in soy which actually had a good amount of tuna and crab in it (possibly because I specifically asked if there was a lot) and the red curry. Both were absolutely more than we expected taste-wise. The next day we got the bibimbap and the bulgogi, two more solid dishes. 

This is a great spot to take a date. The decor inside is very swanky yet soothing (make sure to check out the bathroom, it's like a spa). Also they have outdoor seating by the fountain. This will be a place we go on the regular.
