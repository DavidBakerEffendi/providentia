Solid 4.5 stars. 
This place is quite legit. Lovely ambiance, perfect for a date night or intimate group party. The servers were very polite, and maybe not too much on top of their game, but, very kind and sweet. 

The chips were by far one of the best I've had in a while. The salsa is average, but with the habanero sauce mixed in, it made it amazing. I think that's the key, otherwise the salsa was lacking herbs, onions, and salt. 

The cheese enchilada was amazing--the red sauce being the best I've had to date. I was quite blown away by it. I got the combo with the fried beef tacos. Will skip the fried tacos next time as the beef was a bit tough. 

The grilled chicken plate was quite good...ours was slightly overcooked, but the flavors were there. Overall, I felt this place is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas. I shall go back and try more, as well as try see if they are consistent with the food. It will definitely hit the spot if you're craving for some good Mexican food. Try the cheese enchiladas!!!!! quite impressive sauce!
