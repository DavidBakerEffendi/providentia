After reading the other reviews, I really don't have much new to add. Momma Mia's was my go-to pizza place (as someone else already said). The same lady is working the counter. She even remembered me. I always ask for "the usual" which for me is the 2 slices of pizza and a drink special for $3.50. Good stuff, good price, fast service and large slices.
