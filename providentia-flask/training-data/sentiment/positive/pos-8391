I don't make it out to this seemingly shadier part of town very often.  It is after all near the intersection of OG, a bail bond business and an alternative fashion shop (where I visited to offer my second opinion while stripper girlfriends do their shopping).  But I am glad I came.

Art of Flavors definitely lived up to the high praises offered up thus far by the Yelp community.  Their selection of gelato is sizable, even compared to other much better financed operations up and down the Strip.  The thought process that goes into developing and making each flavor is something you can taste in the final product behind the display case.  Chef Desyree is very passionate about her products, and is more than happy to let customers sample the gelatos that are available.  Feel free to ask her questions, because she will be happy to tell you about her gelato and how they are made, the inspiration for making it.  The foodie in you will totally dig it!

Besides the really good gelato, they have Gelato Panini on the menu.  That is something I have not seen anywhere else and have yet to try it.  It is probably the same concept as a tempura ice cream, where the batter and cake layer shields the ice cream from melting during the frying process.

The hot chocolate is also very good.  The flavor is definitely not water down, and very good once the weather cools down in the coming weeks.

Stop by and give the gelato a try. You will leave happier than you came in.

*Amanda M just mentioned a super great idea via Yelp compliments. Making a Honey Toast Gelato Panini.  In Asia, giant honey toasts are already served with gelato orice cream, with other fancy decorations (chocolate cigarettes, macrons, square decorations), so it would just be an easy adaptation of what millions have already tried.  Probability of success: High!

**New flavors are regularly added, so come back again and again for new flavor surprises.
