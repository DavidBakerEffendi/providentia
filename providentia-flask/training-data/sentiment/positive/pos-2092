We ate here in May 2015- I have to say because of Diner's Drive-ins and Dives..WOW were we surprised by THE best pizza I have ever had. We decided right then that we needed to move to be closer to this place. It is now July 2016 and we moved from South Florida to  Glendale about 5 miles away. BEST PIZZA EVER.. great authentic Italian. Love the wine choices! Waitresses are great and friendly.
