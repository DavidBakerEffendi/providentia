Very satisfied coming here. Did not wait a second to get seated and the ladies up in the front complimented my hair. Love them! Got seated and immediately got asked for drinks. The menu is really cool, it's a newspaper. Very creative. The server and waiter were very nice and on it. The food was delicious and the portions are huge. They kept hot coffee on the table. The coffee was amazing. So I highly recommend this place. I got the Mexican omelette..... I'm Mexican so I expected more as you couldn't really taste real chorizo. They have outside seating. Come here on your next Sunday!
