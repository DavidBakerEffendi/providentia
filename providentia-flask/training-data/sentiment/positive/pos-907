Old school. Reminds me of the OG ranch style steakhouses my parents took me to as a kid in Los Angeles. Very distinct sweet hickory smell from their fire pit as you walk up to the building. Sat at the bar to eat lunch and had the rib eye. Perfectly cooked. Came with salad and steak fries. More than enough portions. Best of all (and least expected) was the service. Darla was a ...Dar-ling. Anticipated needs. Very helpful with the menu. Drink was kept full. Super friendly. If on the northern reaches of Las Vegas, I definitely recommend this piece of Vegas history.
