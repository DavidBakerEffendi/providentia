We read the reviews here on yelp and decided to rate our experience dining at Annies for ourselves....Honestly,we can't figure how anyone could give this place anything less than 5 stars!We were greeted very congenial by the hostess upon our arrival and especially liked the restaurants atmosphere,we decided to have a cocktail in the bar, Giovanni was our bartender and made my husband a fantastic Margarita,he was extremely willing to please when my husband told him how he liked it prepared.While sitting at the bar,you can see the kitchen through a pass thru window as the food is being prepared,we could see the staff and admired their professionalism as they prepared the meals.We ordered the stuffed mushrooms with sausage for our appetizer,it was served with wonderful fresh made rolls and an oil based olive spread that was delicious!!Our choice for our dinner was spaghetti and meatballs(Nice size portion)and my husband had the Rigatoni Roberta(Its made with egg plant)we brought left overs home,it was very good!!We even met the owner Annie!! We found her to be extremely friendly, she most definately takes pride in her cooking and wants to make sure her customers are happy and will return to her lovely establishment...We definately will dine at Annies again!!
