After eating at Wong's, you'll  hate yourself for having ever had Panda Express.

The first thing you notice about Wong's is how misleading the outside is. It's wedged between a used book store and a bridal store and looks about as big as a taco truck. You get inside, however, and a large, superbly decorated dining room awaits you. I have never, in all the years I've gone to Wong's, waited for a table. Literally, I'm seated half a minute within entering. Even during the lunch rush, there's always room. 

Tea is provided, and between that and the water, you probably won't want to order a coke or anything. The tea takes some getting used to, but soon you won't be able to eat lo mein without it. And expect to get your water glass refilled like at least a dozen times. Literally, I've never actually finished a glass of water before it was refilled. 

The staff is so accommodating and hospitable, it's like eating in a family's dining room table. The service is so on par that out of the years I've been going, only one guy has ever complained about his food. Have you ever seen other patrons at a restaurant tell a complaining customer to STFU? Well, that's how awesome Wong's is. No joke.

The food is, like, whoa. Personally I prefer the lunch specials, where you get the entree, fried rice, egg roll and soup for about the cost of a McMeal Deal. Dinner comes with a big pot of rice that you and your friends will never finish so don't even try.

Foods I Recommend: Pork Lo Mein, Emperor's Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Pork, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, and Chow Mein.

The menu they offer is also super easy to understand, with clear cut descriptions of all the entrees, which is nice, because nothing irritates me more than a Chinese eatery that serves you soft noodles and calls it "chow mein".
