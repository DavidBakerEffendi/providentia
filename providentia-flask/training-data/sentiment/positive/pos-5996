Lazy dog was AMAZING! Came here for the first time today (Saturday afternoon) and had a wonderful experience. It wasn't too busy unlike the rest of town square, there was no wait at all. 
We got FREE Cajun fries (which was huge by the way) for checking in on yelp. 
I had the pot roast beef sandwich with street potato tots and it was really good. The bread on the sandwich was seriously delicious. My husband had the chicken curry with carrot slaw and he said it was awesome. We were so excited to eat our food that we forgot to take a pic for yelp... I guess we will have to come back! 
Our server Heather was super sweet and friendly and provided us with great service. Thanks heather! 
This place exceeded my expectations. Great food, great service and super nice restaurant overall. We will definitely be back for our next cheat meal!
