If you want to be teleported to Korea...This is the place for you. It even smells like Korea, it's awesome. Lots of Korean food including Soju. We go for better choices in Ramen soups and also for some Korean snacks. Can't get enough Choco Pies! I recommend coming here to stock up your pantry with Korean specialties!
