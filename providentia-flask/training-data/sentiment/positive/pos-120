Went here last night for dinner for the first time since it came highly recommended. I have to say I'm not a big sushi person but this place has completely converted me!  The tuna melts in your mouth like butter, the shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly and the green tea ice cream was so refreshing; I also love their purple rice that the sushi was served in. 

The staff was super nice and the chef was incredibly friendly and welcoming!  This 100% just became our weekly Tuesday dinner spot!  I'm kind of craving it now as I'm typing this. You must check this place out, you will NOT be disappointed.
