POSTINO'S... I don't just want to visit when I'm in Scottsdale. Please make your way to Minneapolis cause I want more of you! 

This is a great spot to stop by after work or meet some girlfriends for lunch during the week. It's also a perfect place for a date night. They offer all kinds of specials but my favorite is the POSTINO 5' till 5. That's $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer until 5 pm! You just can't pass this one by. Aside from that their food is ridiculously good. I absolutely love their bruschetta boards (15). You can pick 4 from a list of about 12 options. They are delicious, filling and oversized. My favorite by far is the brie and apple with fig. The perfect combination of sweet and savory. 

The atmosphere is relaxed and there's a good vibe here. I prefer the outside seating if it's an option but indoor seating perfectly fine too. This spot works for any type of occasion. Just remember I prefer 5' before 5!
