4 years later (since my initial review) and nothing has changed! I love love love Musashi. I highly recommend coming here for lunch, which for me, means my Saturday lunches are usually here. They usually do 3 "specialty" lunch boxes: Box A, B and C. A is usually a unique, homemade-esque Japanese dish. Sometimes it is katsu curry. Other times it is ramen. Sometimes it's a little of both and other times it's a bento box. Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl. My usually order the A as it is always unique, authentic and delicious. Other recommendations are: katsu-don (katsu with egg and onions over rice), grilled mackerel, chicken katsu and agedashi tofu.
