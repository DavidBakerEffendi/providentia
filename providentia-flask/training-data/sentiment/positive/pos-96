I've driven past this place for years and always thought it was just a bagel place like another Einsteins, boy, was I wrong! The have a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu, including a bakery and take out 
Ordered the Corned Beef Hash with poached eggs, potatoes, and a toasted bagel. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the potatoes had just the right amount of seasoning, the Corned Beef Hash was amazing! Plenty of corned beef and great taste. The bagel was fresh and delicious! Service was excellent and everyone was friendly! 
I'm definitely coming back to try the Corned Beef sandwich and a Reuben next time!
