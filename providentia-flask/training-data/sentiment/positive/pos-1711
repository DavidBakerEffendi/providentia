This place is great if you're a Packer fan! We love coming here on the weekends for the games. It's a great atmosphere and they often will do drawings for different Packer items. I won an official Rodgers Nike jersey! Being away from Wisconsin for game days was a tough pill to swallow but this place makes me feel like I'm back home! Get here early though, it gets extremely busy on game days!

They also have a HUGE menu and the food has always been great. They do have a smaller menu for game days but there are still plenty of options to choose from. The drink specials are also really great, $2.75 domestic bottles so you can't go wrong.

I've had the pizza here several times and it's always been delicious. This time I tried the French dip and the flavor was insane. I was very impressed.
