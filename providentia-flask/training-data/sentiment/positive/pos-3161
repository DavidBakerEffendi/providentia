Yes, they do serve kirin and sake.  I had to call and ask as if they have a website somewhere, I cannot find it.  As much as I hate driving downtown, I was excited to try Harumi as the restaurant has such glowing reviews.  Say what you will about Yelp, without a platform like this, I may never venture out of my confort zone.  Don't get  me wrong, just because I don't like driving downtown, does not mean I don't like being downtown.  Parking can be an issue but meters are free after 5pm.  Once at the restaurant my first impression was that of a clean and friendly restaurant.  Ordered miso soup, nice flavor but I like mine with a bit of seaweed where this version there was none.  Shrimp Tempura was perfect, Salmon Sashimi perfect, Oasis Roll, MMMM, addictive, perfect.  Add 3 Large Kirin and 3 large house Sake total bill $63.36 plus tip.  Love the purple rice.  Tastes just like white rice but great color and they say more healthy for you.
