This incredibly Californian world is definitely an unforgettable experience, even when the food sometimes might be. Everything from the styling of the menus to the colors, the furniture down to the actual organic and gluten free items themselves are reminiscent of an old west coast trip. 

Got the whitefish egg scramble and it was pretty good. Their drinks are really good and have a lot of variety. 

Highly recommended for patrons with dietary restrictions - they make you feel welcome and suspend all judgement on your choices. 

I'd be remiss if I did not talk about the trendy bar which extends outdoors as well. I fully intend to check it out once the weather in Wisconsin matches the style of the decor.
