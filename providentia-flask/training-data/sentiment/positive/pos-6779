This is my new FAVORITE Place to go in downtown Chandler!!!! The atmosphere is wonderful (I can't wait for patio weather to sit out on their gorgeous patio!) I love the exposed brick and older building feel...makes me feel like I'm back home (Pennsylvania) when I'm inside the place. The food is INCREDIBLE!! Honestly, the brushetta is some of the best I've had. I compare all wine bar brushettas to Postino's which is one of my favorite, and I gotta say this is right up there. The one with the salami and ricotta is probably my favorite, it's to die for!! The pistachio/date or fig/with a maple flavor is also a fav. Honestly they are ALL good...the artichoke one is another fav...I could go on and on ;-) I had one of the dinner specials a few weeks ago, a monk fish over gnocci with an asparagus creme sauce...OH MY! It was SOOO good. I hope they special it again. A friend had their tomato bisque soup and their fries and I tried both and they were great. The fries are addictive. The wine list is huge and I haven't been disappointed yet. I've tried their chocolate dessert which was wonderful. Our service has always been on-point as well. They have a great happy hour special if you order a bottle you get a FREE brushetta plate or the meat plate...you just can't beat that!! If you haven't been there GO...you won't regret it!!
