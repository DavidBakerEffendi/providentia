I'm a huge fan of Japanese fusion, so I was excited to finally try this place during my last Vegas trip and it did not disappoint.  We came around 6pm on a Saturday and were seated right away.

For 4 people we got the seared kobe beef (demolished immediately...entire plate was cleared within like 10 seconds) and seaweed salad small plates, filet mignon with green pea puree and wasabi froth, and the BoBo Brazil, Neo Tokyo, and Capoeira(?) rolls.

Everything was delicious, the Neo Tokyo (yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca) was probably my favorite of everything we had, and my Lemon Samurai cocktail went down like juice.
