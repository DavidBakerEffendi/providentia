Wow! We found this place on google and thanks to Yelp. Looking for halal close to our hotel we decided to give this one a try. Thanks fellow yelpers!! This hidden gem was just what we wanted. The food here is so tasty and delicious! Their rice have taste on their own, their chicken was so tasteful. The service, the food, all of it was just amazing. Definitely try this out if you are close to it.
