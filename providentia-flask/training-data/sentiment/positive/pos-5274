I love this place.  It's not a 5 star restaurant, it's not on a beach, or anything special, but it's one of the best places in Gilbert. Food is reliably fresh, clean, properly cooked, and always tastes great. 

As good as the food is, the wait staff is the absolute best. To name a few, Josh, Kyle, Alison, and Natalie are some of the friendliest and most prompt servers I've ever had. Seriously, we come here because of how great the people are.

My recommendation: Chicken and Avocado Club with Blackened Chicken
