A contender in any hot dog competition is JJ's Red Hots. For some reason my girlfriend has me craving hot dogs on a regular basis now and I have to say I have found the Charlotte, NC Madison Square Garden when it comes to dogs. Today I indulged in The Whistle Pig, all I can say is the 23 minutes and 19 seconds riding in the car to get here was well worth the 3 minutes it took me to eat the dog (I devour food). The dog is bigger than some sandwiches I have seen. It had the "snap" every dog should have on the first bite and it was also soooo flavorful. I mean I can actually taste the hot dog with all the toppings I had. The ambiance of JJ's Red Hots is awesome. The dining room is nice and open with tons of natural light. Its very inviting. Even though I was unable to make it to the roof it looked spectacular and comfortable.  I will most definitely be back to have a beer and a dog chillin' on top of the roof. If your in Charlotte you must stop by JJ's Red Hots
