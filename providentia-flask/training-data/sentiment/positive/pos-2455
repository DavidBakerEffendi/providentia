First impressions are important; and as soon as I walked into this cafe, I was in love. What a quaint place to meet with friends and have a cup of coffee. Busy but not crowded, and enough tables and chairs inside and out to sit and relax. Owners and staff are lovely people.

Excellent and courteous customer service.  They bring your food to you and bus the tables as well; they keep the place very clean. Cute washroom decorated with local art that's for sale. Looks like they sold some pieces because there were a few empty hooks on the walls. There are three small tables outside where you can enjoy the fresh air and talk to the friendly locals walking by. 

Had their Mocha Frappe with whipped cream. It had alot of froth on top and the drink was thin not thick like Starbucks. Tasted like a malted drink. Found out that they used powder and not espresso and chocolate to make the drink but still tasty.

Delicious breakfast burrito with egg, tomato, green onion and cheddar cheese. It didn't need any salsa because it was delicious but I might ask for some next time just to add a little heat.

They have a meeting room in the basement that you can rent.
