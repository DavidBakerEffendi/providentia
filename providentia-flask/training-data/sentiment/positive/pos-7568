First and most important: all meals are currently 15% so get your fat tush there ASAP.

The menu is HUGE: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, hibachi, and sushi. So much to chose from.

All meals are served with soup and salad. 

I had the Blue Ginger roll (lobster tempura and a strip of filet mignon laid overtop) and pan fried noodles. The Blue Ginger roll was one of the best I have ever had. The pan fried noodles weren't bad either but had a bit too much sauce.

The others in my party all had hibachi and enjoyed it.

For being in a strip mall, the place is really nice. Very clean.

Staff was great, friendly, and very attentive.


I would definitely recommend for all the sushi lovers out there. One of the best Asian places in the area.
