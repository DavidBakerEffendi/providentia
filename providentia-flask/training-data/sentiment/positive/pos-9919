Ohhhh sooo full... We did a family event! The whole 3 of us... This include a girl's age that is 1.. 

We had a chicken both noodles with chicken, veggies and Chinese mushroom with noodles in soup. That is my all time favorite!!! Specially on cold days it keep us satisfied and warm. Please note not all location have the Chinese mushroom... Only at the metro square and commerce gate location. 

Siu long bai.. World famous! You can't go wrong with that! The skin is thin with fair enough juice inside the bun that doesn't overwhelm u.. The size is prefect not to big not too small... And it comes out steamy hot! Add black vinegar mmmm so yummy! Three ways of eating it 1. Break it apart eat skin, eat meat, drink the juice. 2. Break and release the juice in a bowl and save it with the rest of the meal to add extra flavor and just eat the skin and meat! 3. Also My favorite way!! my then bf now hubby taught me! Put the bun on a spoon. Take a bite at the top of the skin, tear open slightly so juice doesn't fall out and everything is intact . Add ginger/vinegar in the hole (where the meat and juice is in the skin. Note: don't put too much vinegar or it will cover all flavors!) blow twice and eat whole... Ohhhh soooo yummy!!! I love it!!!!

Fried dumpling: sear to a crunchy skin with juice intact like the Siu long bai Take a bite at the top of the skin, tear open slightly so juice doesn't fall out and everything is intact . Add ginger/vinegar in the hole and eat. Best to use chopsticks for this one!

Fried tofu: we once saw this order on another table and decided to order it and we never stopped! So good it's spicy but for someone that doesn't eat spicy I loved it! Fried to perfection with garlic and green onions it went well with the spicy soya sauce that came with it! Incredible!!!

Total cost under $30 for everything!
