While attending a wedding, had some down time while they were taking photos and stopped in this fantastic little place for a glass of wine. Sat outside on the "Front Porch" and had our wine in an extremely comfortable atmosphere. Would definitely recommend this place for a relaxing evening with friends. Next time will go for the food! The menu looked very interesting!!
