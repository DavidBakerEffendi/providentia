I went here with a Groupon and couldn't be more pleased.   The groupon included a bottle of Sangria and a full pizza.  The white sangria was delicious and refreshing. We had a hard time choosing betweent the amazing selection, but went with the Cinque Formaggio which included ricotta, gorgonzola, mozzarella and two other cheeses.  Absolutely delicious.  The crust was crispy, the cheese was gooey and outstanding and we added proscuitto. I will defintely be coming back.
Adorable little patio outside and.. they are dog friendly!
