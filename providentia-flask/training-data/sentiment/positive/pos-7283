We absolutely loved this place. Inside the folks working were very warm and attentive. The live music was good, and the singing was incredible, and folks were dancing, clapping and singing along. 

Now onto the food! Although I couldn't possibly hope to correctly spell the names of the dishes we ate, my party of 3 split several appetizers and a couple of entrees. They are apparently famous for a dish of flaming cheese, which was incredible. The grape leaves stuffed with rice and a spicy meat were also a party favorite and the gyros were perfect, not too oily as lamb can sometimes be. Best yogurt sauce I've ever had. All of us loved all of the food; it was very quality for the price, the 3 of us shared more food than we could finish and drinks for 55$-- not too bad!
