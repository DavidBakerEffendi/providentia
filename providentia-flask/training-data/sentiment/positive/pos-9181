I'm a huge B Spot fan and this is the location is my favorite in the heart of Crocker Park. Although parking is sometimes challenging.

Every burger is to die for and The Lola Fries are simply the best. 

I used to love coming for happy hour, but am now bummed that they changed the menu and got rid of the sliders...not cool! 

Milkshakes are the bomb, especially the chocolate marshmallow one. It is toasted and filled to the brim!
