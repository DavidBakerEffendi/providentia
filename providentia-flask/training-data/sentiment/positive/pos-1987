I came here as part of a Living Chandler facebook group event. The staff was very friendly and made it a great experience. It is good to see a nice, family run business in town and doing well. I went with the cheesesteak with mushrooms and peppers. Excellent! Grab a drink and bag of chips to make it a meal. One of the best cheesesteaks around in town.
