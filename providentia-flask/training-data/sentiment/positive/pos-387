This is one of the best places to get sushi/sashimi. I never ate so much sushi in my life and never felt full (bloated). I went to a company dinner here after the SHOT show one year and enjoyed the massive shared platters of sushi, sashimi, and meats. All the while enjoying a good time with my coworkers.

If you need to get your sushi fix and have a few extra dollars to spend, this is the place to go - you won't regret it and you'll talk about it for years (or at least until you come back)!
