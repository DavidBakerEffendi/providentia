Humble pie is delicious! Every time we go we try a different pizza, and it's always fresh and crispy! Of course my favorite is the margharita pizza, always a go to and always a great taste! I always get a half veggie salad, which is so crisp and refreshing and light! The dressing is delicious and is similar to a house Italian dressing. We also had the injectable donut holes for dessert (because why not!) and they were so yummy! I recommend the berry and the Creme and mixing them in the holes!!!!! 

The bruschetta is really yummy with fresh basil, tomato and mozzarella. Always a go to as well. 

I also highly recommend the sangria, which is absolutely delectable and I can literally never get enough!! The atmosphere is laid back, and just great service every time! The entire staff is great and has great customer service, we always have a great waiter/waitress! 

When we was pizza, this is where we go!
