Oh how I wish I had come here sooner. I don't hand out 5 stars for restaurants very often, but Fuego deserves it, shoot they deserve 6 but there isn't a way to do that.

We started with guacamole, it was perfect, slightly chunky, not overdone, just great avocados and perfectly seasoned.

For lunch I had the Pernil Asado tacos, scrumptious! They were served with the best rice and black beans ever made.  My mom had the vegetarian tacos, and 6 hours later she is still going on about how great they were.  

Our server, Alex, made the meal, she was so sweet and attentive, our chips were promptly refilled, our tea never ran out, it was a pleasure to be her customers, she was just that good!!!!!

I will be back as soon as I can get there!  

I was also happy to here that the other Fuego restaurants have patio seating which is dog friendly (call ahead) so I can take my poochies with me when I visit the other location.
