Lumpia, pork belly, everything Filipino and did you know they will do private parties as well.  They will pull up in your driveway and give your party THE BEST food, experience and fun.  Follow them on Facebook, go where the food trucks or go, or just have them over.  They are amazing, loving people, too.  Still not sure I'm ready to try the Pig Face...maybe next time.
