This is something that I would drive by everyday and never think to go in. I maybe feared it would be too much to handle or dirty but that was not the case. This is like a story book, very mysterious and personalized. I love it. I went with a mate who knew about this place. We parked behind a random building and we were not towed which was great. My friend got a bowl of soup that was giant and i got a smoothie and Chicken Schwarma. They were both great, not a vast amount of chicken but comes with hummus and pita which is nice. I am one of those weird germaphobes and take note to get silverware or hand wash prior. I did not see a bathroom, that does not mean it is not in existence; I just did not see it. Overall it was like $16 in the end so an expensive lunch but soups are cheap as our their drinks other than the smoothies. The food took a while but they were quite busy. Overall a treat and will come again!
