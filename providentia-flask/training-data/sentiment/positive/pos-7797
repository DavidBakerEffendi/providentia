I simply don't get it. Do people review the bun of their favorite burger joint? The plate that their sushi comes on? People, the questionable slice of za that transports your generous portion of  chicken shawarma, garlic & hot sauce is just the vessel. Given your late night Blandsdowne options you should be singing Chito's name from the rooftops. And all for $2.50? Cman. Never mind the noises from your stomach, it's just trying to give you a high five and say "Hey bro, well done."

5 enthusiastic stars.
