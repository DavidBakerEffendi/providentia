Not only is the food here delicious (try the Stromboli) but the service from Darlyn was phenomenal. I asked her what kind of veggie burger they use because I'm allergic to nuts. She went back to the kitchen and took a picture of the ingredients list so that I could see for myself that it was safe. In addition to that, she was courteous, attentive, and friendly.
