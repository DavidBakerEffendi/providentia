This place rocks!  I don't think I have eaten anything that I didn't like here.  Every sandwich, salad, soup, pastry is absolutely stellar, and what's even better is it is affordable!  If I had to choose, I'd say my 2 favorite go to's are the Asparagus and Harvarti Panini (add the chicken), and the Chicken Pesto.  To be quite honest, I have practically drank the pesto sauce they serve...it's that good.

If you're looking for a solid, delicious meal and love to eat local, Bertha's Cafe is my #1 go-to for lunch!!
