Oh man I am excited for this place.  So good!  Wow amazing Thai food.  I fed three people including myself with 4 dishes for 60.00.  They do have a spice level from 1 to 10 and you can add more later if you feel daring. Drunken noodle is yumms.  The tom kar soup with chicken, eggplant dish with chicken, oh can't forget the takoyaki is on fire! So delicious
