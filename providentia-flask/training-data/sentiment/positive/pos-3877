Fukuburger for lunch this afternoon! First time here at the Chinatown location on jones off of Spring mtn. The place looks great. Ordered the #1 Fuku "lucky" burger combo with the garlic fries. Proving to me as always they are one of the 5 best burger joints in town! Also got my free 4 day pass for the Foodie fest with the combo. Win/win!!! Today is the last day to get your pass, but they are open till 1am. Show this local gem some love
