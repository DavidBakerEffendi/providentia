Wow. 
From the beginning. Wow. 
Once you enter, you put your belongings and anything that glows in the dark in lockers with a key you get to hold onto. 
I used the restroom next (just in case), and it was very clean. 
On my way out, I filled out and signed a waiver, I was asked about allergens and away we went! 
Our server, Daniel, was top notch. 
He made me feel safe, which is super important, especially when following someone and trusting them with your life through the pitch black darkness of the dining room. 
He sat us safely down, I ordered a Rachel's drink (highly recommend if you like vodka)
And away we went!
Each course was awesome and he guided us through so we wouldn't knock anything down or get too messy. 
I won't say anything more about the food. 
It's an experience. 
Your senses are heightened. 
And the experience in itself was amazing. 
I loved every aspect of it. 
You really get to just experience and appreciate good food in a whole different light. 
Go in with an open mind. And it's all uphill from there.
