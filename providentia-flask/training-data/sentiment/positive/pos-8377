We chose pizza again after a bbq competition and 1 Brothers Pizza was a winner!  We started off with some chicken wings and we all agreed they were delicious...crispy and cooked perfectly.  For the pizza, I hadn't had a Sicilian style pizza in quite some time so we went with that...with pepperoni.  So good!  The sauce was incredibly flavorful and it really hit the spot.  My husband and daughter both said, "Best pizza in Arizona."  I'm not sure that I would go that far, but it really was delicious and I'd definitely return.
