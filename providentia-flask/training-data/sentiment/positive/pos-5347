I came here last week with a friend to try the place out. It's new so we had to check it out. We loved it! Friendly employees, clean place, great location, tasty snacks and amazing tea! I'm not big on tea but wow they have my mind changed. I had the Spicy Indian tea and it was very delicious. They even let you pick out your tea cup to use. It's a perfect place to take your girl friends. Great for young and old. I will be back.
