Affordable fancy pizza that's made-to-order fresh. Reviews don't lie on this one, definitely a must-go in Madison. What seems like a limited menu actually has a variety of options and it was tough to decide! We took our waiters recommendations and none of them disappointed! 

Here's our damage -
Burrata: veggies and herbs super fresh, the soft cheese was so yummy and spread easy and the crostini was crunchy and warm

Carbonara: an egg on every piece - extra gold stars! Got the carbonara creaminess and savory flavor was right on target. Yum, my favorite.

Vegetarian: almost a polar opposite as the carbonara but just as delicious. Kale was crispy, the roasted beet pesto was fragrant, and it all came together really nicely. This side was less stable to pick up the slices but we didn't mind.

Panna Cotta: presentation was beautiful, fresh fruits and it was a nice consistency

Chocolate Cake: perfect pairings with the hazelnut ice cream, pistachios, and caramel sauce. Very yummy.

You're able to get 1/2 of each so that was really nice for a party of 2, even though we still had leftovers! They take a lot of pride in serving their best - our first pizza crust was too burnt - the waiter told us right away and we had to wait a little longer, but I liked the honesty. Definitely anticipating coming back :)
