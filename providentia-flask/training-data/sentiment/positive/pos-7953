I've been coming here for years and just got around to writing s review...shame on me! This is one of the greatest little deli places I know. An Argentinian jewel. I've never used just the deli, always opting for lunch. The food is fresh and delish. For starters, you MUST have an empanada. I have the Cuban sandwich quite often, but my fav is the prosciutto and Swiss sandwich.  

Don't miss out on this great hidden gem.
