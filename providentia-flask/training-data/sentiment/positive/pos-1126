A wonderful place. The design of the space on a narrow sidewalk is just phenomenal. I wish people can implement this wonderful concept around the world. Great location, in the middle of the Quartier des spectacles, which I can only imagine how lovely of a view it would be on a busy festival night. Service was prompt, fast and friendly.  Food was impeccable with very original combination of flavours and texture. Some of our dishes were presented in a lovely small casserole, simply fantastic. I have recommend this place to many people and will continue to do so. Can't wait to go back next time I'll be in town.
