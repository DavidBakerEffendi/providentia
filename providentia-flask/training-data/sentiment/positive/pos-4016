Found out about them because they were just featured in the Las Vegas Weekly today and am a stickler for ramen so had to come try it for myself.  I once had ramen in Tokyo airport and have been chasing that flavor ever since I got to Vegas years ago, I found it at Ramen Sora but Ramen Hashi is giving them a run for their money.  Love the setup with the long bar so I didn't need to feel like a loser sitting alone and could talk with the chefs and see what they are cooking. Really awesome to see as they flame torch the meat and a massive pot of chicken boiling.  I especially loved the easy ordering with the paper and pencil.  Another amazing touch.... they have cold thermos' of water for self serve water so you don't need to ask.  They even have hair ties so us girls don't need to worry about our hair getting in the broth as we slurp up the noodles! Hahaha they've thought of everything. Love it!  Will definitely be telling others about this spot and coming back!
