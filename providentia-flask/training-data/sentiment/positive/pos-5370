My boy friend took me to the Salt Cellar to celebrate my birthday. It's one of my favorite spots! The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable, and the food is incredible! You can never go wrong with the blackened Ahi Tuna or the crab legs. My boy friend had the seasonal halibut and it was cooked to perfection! I finished the night off with some excellent desserts and after dinner cocktails. I can't wait to come back! Make sure to ask for Cara. She was an exceptional server, and extremely knowledgeable!! Thank you Salt Cellar!! You never disappoint!
