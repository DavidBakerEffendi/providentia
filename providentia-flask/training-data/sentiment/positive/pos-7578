We stopped in before a movie. My husband ordered the mozzarella, fontina & Basil pizza. The crust is very thin in crispy, which I prefer but many don't. If you're s thick crust person, this is probably not the place for you.  I had the turkey feta salad and green tea. The salad was HEAVEN! Absolutely delicious. I couldn't finish it and since salads don't save, I literally mourned not being able to finish the salad. It was a very sad moment. Needless to say, the salad was a decent size. I'll be back with a hunger large enough to devour the salad. It's myvgoal. Lol
