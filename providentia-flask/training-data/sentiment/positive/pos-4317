This place is a little gem.  Was in the area looking for lunch and came across Caribbean Palm on Yelp.  We decided to give it a try.

The menu has a variety of choices, all looked very good and it was hard to decide. We decided  on the Jerk Chicken with the vegetables. Yum, it was GOOD.  I also want to say a word about the service.  The young lady who helped us was so nice.

This was a great experience and I will be going back.
