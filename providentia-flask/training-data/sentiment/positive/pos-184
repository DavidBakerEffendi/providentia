Good things come to those whose who eat here.

Beef short rib stew green chiles, fried egg, cornbread 14. It was a lengthy decision but I had to hurry up because the lunch rush was starting up and the house soon was going to be hopping.

If you read Phoenix Magazine, my lunch was featured on the cover.

I started with the corn bread. This bread was the bomb. Moist, golden brown and would spring back just a bit upon the touch. I could taste a little jalape√±o heat. It was wonderful. I easily could have had another piece of bread.

Now the hearty beef bowl. Even tho I would have preferred to have this dish on a cool crisp day, that just ain't happening for a while longer. The gravy was just right. The brown meat was perfect. There was other stuff in there but I didn't pick at it to study, I just ate. There was a little time for the different flavors to mingle & marry as they rocked the palate. Loved the egg over easy.

Thank you Jason for taking care of me.
