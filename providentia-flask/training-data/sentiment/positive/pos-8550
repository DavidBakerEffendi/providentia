I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place already, since it's my favourite sushi in town. Everything is incredibly fresh and tasty. I could have their salmon grill or salmon teriyaki for lunch everyday and never get bored. Even their miso soup (a dish I generally pass) is amazing. This is THE place to go to for sushi or grilled salmon.
