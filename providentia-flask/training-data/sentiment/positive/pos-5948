Oh boy this place was gorgeous and classy, such a perfect marriage of a bar, lounge, and club all rolled up in one!

There was no cover for us two girls on a Saturday night and there was a very short line to get in, we waited less than five minutes.

There are two levels. Downstairs has a bar and lounge area. Upstairs has two bars, a lounge area, a DJ, and an area to dance. 

I loved how much space there was here! It was also decorated very beautifully. There were firepits too. Great for a girls night out or a date!
