Stopped in late Sunday evening to try something new. I knew I wanted a savory crepe and told them it was my first time. The gentleman  (owner?) Didn't get his name but he showed me the ordering slips and helped place my order. It's 40 degrees outside but ever since I saw this place I've been craving chocolate covered fruit so I knew I wanted to try them. You can order any six of the small chocolate banana,mango or pineapple pieces for like 4.00 so worth it! I took mine to go and they were thoughtful to poke holes in the box so it wouldn't be too soggy. The crepe was so much bigger than what I anticipated so I'm really glad I didn't order a sweet crepe too because it would have been too much. I can assume it's probably best to eat these right away but it was still warm and the crepe tasted really good.I want to go back soon and try a sweet crepe!
