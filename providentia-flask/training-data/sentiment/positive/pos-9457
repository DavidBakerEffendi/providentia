I'm now the biggest fan of this place. Why? I got a club card, got 3x points and a book of coupons like 2 FOR 1 and whatnot. I live down the street so it's a great place to chill. Plus as a local (perhaps not for tourists) it's chill and cheap. I've met countless friends and family members here and it's always been fun.
