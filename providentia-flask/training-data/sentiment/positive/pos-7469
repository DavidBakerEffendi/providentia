This place is exactly what Market Street and the DC Ranch area needed. This is a great place to catch a game, quick bite, gather with friends or have dinner with the family. 

The food is great and the staff is friendly. I think this place will stick around longer than many Market Street tenants - it's simple, inviting and provides a much needed atmosphere.
