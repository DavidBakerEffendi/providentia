I've been here many times, but after my most recent meal the other night I figured it's about dang time I write a review.  Simply put, this place is great.

If you like guacamole, this is the place for you.  They make it at the table while you watch, and you can have it seasoned to your taste.  It's a bit pricey to get the guacamole, but it's pretty delicious.  Just be prepared because you'll get a LOT of guac.  If you don't like the guacamole, you will probably be pretty satisfied with the complimentary salsa.  

If you like tequila, you have come to the right place.  There are plenty of different types and there is a good variety of margaritas.  I am more of a beer man, myself.  There aren't a lot of drafts to choose from, but they have Dos Equis Amber and when I'm eating Mexican food that is good enough for me.

So what really inspired me to write this review was the dish I had the other night, the barbacoa de puerco.  I cannot believe I've been to Cantina so many times without trying this thing but it was amazing.  The dish consisted of slow cooked, shredded pork with pico, guacamole, and charro beans and rice.  The pork was tender, juicy, flavorful, and delicious.  It came with flour tortillas to load up with the meat and sides.  It possibly the best Mexican meal I've had.  

If you aren't interested in the barbacoa, I'd recommend to get some tacos.  There are about 10 different types so there's something for everyone.  

In conclusion, if you like Mexican food you need to go here.  Be sure to make a reservation if you're going on Friday or Saturday.  If you don't, you will likely be waiting for a while.  Standing around waiting for 45 minutes watching the waiters carry around the delicious looking and wonderful smelling hot plates is a torturous experience.
