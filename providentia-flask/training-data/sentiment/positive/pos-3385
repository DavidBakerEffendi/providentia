I've been meaning to check out TopGolf since it opened and finally had a chance to go. I went with a group on a Monday night, since weekends can get pretty busy. We got our membership cards and were directed to our bay. Food and drinks were all delicious, we had the fish bowl (says to share with 4 people) and I tried the chicken and waffle sliders. Even though I didn't hit the ball farther than the green section, I still had a blast! It was a very expensive night though so not a place we can go often unfortunately! Definitely check this place out whether you are a pro or a beginner!
