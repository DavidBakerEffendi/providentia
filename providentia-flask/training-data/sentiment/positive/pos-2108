This really small spot is inside Island Grill. Chantelle was the girl at the counter , she was really friendly and patient. I asked her what her favorite was, she said everything. I planned to get 3 different kind in smallest container. I told her that it was my first time here so not sure which one I like. She offered me to sample anything looks good to me so I won't be disappointed with my choices. I got Spicy avocado Ahi, Salmon with shoyu sauce and Tako kimchi. 
I like them all, I will be back for more
