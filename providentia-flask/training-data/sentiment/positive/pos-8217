Very good soup- even if the location is alittle difficult to find but that's everything on the path for me. Pro tip, it's just passed the Rexall.

Service was very friendly and I got to tried a couple different soups before ordering. The African peanut, Jamaican lobster bisque and the chicken gumbo were all very tasty.

A medium soup is very filling and I am, as we speak, struggling to finish. In retrospect, I should have got more bread instead of fruit. The whole wheat bread is toasted and awesome.

All and all, a good lunch for a good price in financial district (I paid ~10).
