I've been going to this chipotle for years and never had an issue. There have been waves of employees that have been better (faster, more engaging, cleaner) than others but as a whole, it's been a good neighborhood location.  Also, this location always seems to have all the ingredients ready for replenishment, whereas others I've been to have been sometimes long waits for ... Chicken. Wtf?

Anyhow, shout out to the manager has been there for a while - good job, sir!
