Per our tradition on our mall outings. And After a long day of walking, shopping, eating lunch, and being silly this past weekend, before leaving we always grab Starbucks and Cinnabon. 

The combo is just part of the Latin culture too. Pastries and coffee around 4 pm. We had to wait for the coffee but the line for the Cinnabon went by quick. The staff was friendly and made sure they acknowledged us while waiting for the person ahead of us. 

The smell just gets ya every time. Yummm.  And it is total sugar over load. Trust me I know. But we needed the caffeine for the car ride home home. 

It's way to difficult to walk past a Cinnabon and not buy at least a tiny bite. Yummm
