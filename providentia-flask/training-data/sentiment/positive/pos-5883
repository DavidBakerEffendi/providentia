After having heard my husband rave about the vegan chicken and waffles at Terrace Point Cafe (TPC) for the umpteenth time, I was beyond excited to finally try this legendary breakfast. We came on a weekend at noon and were immediately seated. The service was par for the course for any Wynn restaurant: outstanding. 

The vegan menu had plenty of options, but I was dead set on getting the chicken and waffles, which didn't disappoint. This breakfast meal costs around $20, but I think it's worth the splurge. The waffles came with vegan butter and the choice of a maple and spicy syrup. I didn't order any sides, but I left with a full stomach and a happy heart.
