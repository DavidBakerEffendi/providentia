I've been going to Pit Stop Burger for many years and can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!! Not only do the have friendly servers and excellent food their prices are seriously reasonable. 

Pit Stop Burger is located right by the turn off to the dam. Just a quick detour into the Vons parking lot. It's a tiny cafe where you seat yourself. Their waitresses are always quick and friendly. I've even had them offer me to go cups for my drinks. 

Their menu has something for everyone. They offer you classic sandwiches, salads and of course burgers! Some of my favorites to order from here are the Pit Burger Combo which comes with 1/3lb burger, frys, and a soda all for $8.95! You can even add a domestic beer for  $0.70 or a import for $1.25. Sounds like the perfect combo to me. I also really like the Chef Salad. It's huge and comes loaded with ham, turkey, swiss and american cheese. If you feel like a sandwich the classic Club sandwich is always a great choice. I must mention that when ordering frys or any other fried goodies they give you a squirt bottle of Ranch and Fry Sauce!! So awesome!!!! 

Next time your cruising through Boulder City make sure you hit up Pit Stop Burger. You just can't go wrong with a place that serves a kick ass burger, has excellent service, doesn't brake the bank, and an amazing feature squirt bottles of Ranch and Fry Sauce.
