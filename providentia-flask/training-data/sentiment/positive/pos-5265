There are obviously plenty of Thai restaurants all around town so it's fair to say the best way to judge Pan Asian is via comparison and obviously the key comparison is with Lotus, especially since a former Lotus chef is involved. I will say that while I would prefer to go to Lotus if it were the same distance from my house, Pan Asian is some of the best Thai food I've had in the general Summerlin area. The restaurant is small and modern but doesn't seem to get particularly busy. Ate a few things:

Gyoza- pretty good, very crunchy and freshly fried.
Linguine- very flavorful and filling. Don't be fooled by the Linguine it's no Italian dish it was very much Thai flavored just with an unusual noodle choice.
Tempura Fried Cheesecake- lol I mean obviously this is gonna taste awesome but it's execution was a little off. The closer you get to the center of the cake the colder and harder it becomes since they basically just battered up the cheesecake and dropped it in the fryer. Would still eat a million of them though.

Priced reasonably well, around 10 dollars an item. I chose spice level 5 and it definitely had a good amount of heat to it. Will be returning until postmates or seamless let me get lotus every day instead.
