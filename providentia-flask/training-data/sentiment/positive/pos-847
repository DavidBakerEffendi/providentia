I've been going to Nate's since my childhood, and for good reason- the food and service are excellent!  I love the cozy diner feel, and the nostalgic pictures of Lebanon adorning their walls.  I always get the shish tawook sandwich- perfectly marinated, tender cubes of chicken, with garlic sauce, wrapped in warm pita bread- yum!  And their hummus, in my opinion/experience, is the best I've had anywhere in the world (including Lebanon)!  They also now serve french fries!  Make sure you have cash, because they don't take credit card.
