This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas. 

The food is great, service is quick and they have good coffee. A little speedy, but it's a trendy breakfast place so you have to expect that. 

I love the sausage and any egg dish with that in it I'm happy. I always opt for the coffee cake which is making my mouth drool just thinking about that sweet goodness. 

Coffee is great there and the staff keeps me full. I think even Mr. Pink would tip. 

Great place, highly recommended.
