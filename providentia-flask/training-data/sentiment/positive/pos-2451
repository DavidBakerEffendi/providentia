I have my bestie to thank for my love of Chik-Fil-A! years ago while living in Tucson, she got me hooked on this place! All these years later, there's a brand new one not too far from me. Went there and grabbed lunch to bring to my hubby's work so he and I could have lunch together. The drive through lanes (2) were packed but once I got in line, it started moving pretty quickly. Got my food rather fast and with great customer service. Very friendly people, always chipper and smiling. 

Love their waffle fries...so easy to get addicted to! Love their food and the prices are pretty reasonable. I also think it's cool that they are closed Sundays so that their employees can enjoy a day off.

Will definitely go there again!
