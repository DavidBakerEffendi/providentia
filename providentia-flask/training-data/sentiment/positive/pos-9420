Still takes my breath away when ever I see it. Views are great no matter where you are from the street. You can also get a more exclusive view from one of the hotel rooms or from one of the restaurants overlooking the water. 

Check website for times. It's free to watch the show. Be near a speaker so you can hear the music as it's synchronized to the water.
