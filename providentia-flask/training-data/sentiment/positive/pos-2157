Excellent. Great owner who is nice, talkative, thoughtful, and cares about his business and customers. I only ever get the chicken shawarma but I think it is the best in the area. Generous portions too! And at the time of writing, they have lunch special 2 chicken shwarma sandwich for $9. I do recommend.
