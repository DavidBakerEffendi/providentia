This is a hidden gym....tucked in the corner at 32nd St & Indian School (NW corner) in a strip shopping center with various businesses. Everything is homemade, & absolutley yummy. Turkey is a real roasted turkey breast, same with chicken. Breads are fresh & a big variety. Cupcakes are to die for. All the other desserts looked soooooo good. Long line for lunch but totally worth the wait. Prices are very reasonable.
