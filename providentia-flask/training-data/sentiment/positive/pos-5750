This place is has by far the best filet mignon and rib eye I have tasted!
My manager and I came here to take a friend to dinner and we were spoiled! 
The staff was charming, presentable and knowledgable about what they had to offer as well as recommendations.
For appetizers - we ordered the bacon wrapped dates (which was the first time we've tried anything so creative). The sweetness of the dates and the juicy smoked flavor of the bacon complimented each other well and were amazing to start! For sides we had ordered the sweet potato with a glaze and sweet creamed corn. The softness of the sweet potato was amazing - cutting through it was like a piece of cake and just one bite melted in your mouth instantly! The sweet creamed corn was to die for - a must have for sides. The sweetness was just right and the creamy sauce reminded me of cream of mushroom soup - fulfilling and delightful :) 
For the entrees, the waiter had recommended that their steaks were the best in the country - we decided to have the filet mignon (wet dry- where the meat is vacuum sealed to retain moisture), bone in rib eye (dry age- where the meat is air aged) and bone in filet mignon. All though the dry age meats had more flavor and were delicious - all three meats were tender and aged to perfection. The cuts were smooth and fresh. 
After this amazing feast - the waiter was able to sneak in their chocolate soufflé and some hot tea and coffee. The soufflé was a lovely way to end the night - the flavor reminded me of a warm milk chocolate with little dots of chocolate inside. 
To summarize my dinner - the presentation, staff and food was phenomenal. I would recommend Anthony's Steakhouse for any occasion :)
