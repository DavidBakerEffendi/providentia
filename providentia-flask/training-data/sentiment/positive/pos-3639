Pan Asian is probably my favorite all-around Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food produced. Although they don't quite have the selection as Lotus of Siam, they have all the classics. My personal favorite is the stir-fried linguini, which comes with your choice of meat, asparagus, tomatoes, and a spicy kick (there's no mild version). Other favorites like pad thai and pad see-yew are just as good. I love that the noodles are actually cooked to perfection instead of the typical half-assed versions that stick together at some other Thai joints. I also really enjoyed the DW fried rice if you're not feeling any of the noodle dishes. Their level of spiciness rates on a scale of 1-10 so if you're a first-timer, I highly recommend starting low (even a 3 is a bit too much for some people). 

I've always had a great meal here. I've even catered through Pan Asian - they take large orders up to a day prior. They also have lunchtime specials on the weekdays.
