Friendly, fast and delicious food. Got the teriyaki salmon bento box first time, then I tried the small lunch special with teriyaki chicken and the Korean noodles (delicious!) and it was only $6.95 for the smaller plate which is plenty of food! But if you are feeling extra hungry get the regular size or the bento box.
