My friend was just telling me about this place the day before so I had to come here. I'll get straight to the point. I got the 4-meatball deal (turkey) then put it all over macaroni & cheese with pesto. Awesome! The food was SO filling and so delicious. I was skeptical of being full, but I sure was! All for $15.00 as well. I would definitely come here again!

Now, for upstairs! Who doesn't love a good freaking rooftop?! I sure do! The roof is actually retractable so if it's cold, raining or anything else, the glass roof can close. Luckily, it was a nice night out so we were able to enjoy the roof open. Drinks were good, moderate in price, but I absolutely loved the atmosphere and I would come here often just to chill.
