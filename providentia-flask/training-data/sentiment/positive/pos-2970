Had dinner here on Tuesday night. The waitstaff was friendly and prompt. I had the seared ahi tuna with cilantro jalape√±o hummus. I loved it, but my girlfriend felt the tuna was slightly over cooked. She ordered the wood fired chicken. That was excellent as well. I actually liked the flavor of hers better, but both dishes were awesome! I would also like to add that the temp inside the restaurant was comfortable. Most of the time, regardless of time of year, I find most places to be too cold, but this time I was able to leave my jacket off and was never uncomfortable. The parking lot at this location is crowded but I found a spot no problem. The restaurant was full but no wait. Only thing I didn't check out the bathroom, but the rest of the place was clean, so I would be surprised if the bathroom wasn't.
