We stumbled in on a Friday night around 1am and we were beyond pleased when a security guard directed us over. There were a couple of people in front of us, though with the set up, we were all moved through quite quickly.

We opted to create our own as I don't eat pork. The meatballs are all beef and so we went for meatballs and ricotta. Nice and easy. Everything was made right in front of our hazy eyes and cooked quickly. I believe it was ~$15 and was more than enough for the two of us to share. I liked the chili oil/sauce that was provided as it gave it a nice kick. The middle of the pie was a bit saggy but nothing to be concerned about. We just folded our slices and were good to go.

Prices are right and this is a good, quick option. Another excellent restaurant visit at the SLS!
