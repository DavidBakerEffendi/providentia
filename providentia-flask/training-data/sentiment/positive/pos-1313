after the CES . We came to eat. Ordered appetizer. Firecracker shrimp and omg let me just say it was to die for .  Also the captains punch. Yummy yummy drink.  My sister ordered the fish and chips and let's just say lots of food. Better come with big appetite.  I ordered the rib eye with bake potato and man I'm so full but don't want to waste it.
