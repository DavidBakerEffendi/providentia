This place is great if you're looking for a tasty meal that's quick, wholesome, good for you, and filling. 

Pricing is fair for the portion size and ingredients - especially if you consider the place's prime location and roomy interior to sit down to eat if you choose to dine in. 

Really nice place - clean, comfortable, and spacious. You don't feel like youre being crammed into a sardine can, trying to wolf down your meal as fast as you can and gtfo like some places downtown. 

Food wise, it is super tasty! The ingredients are fresh and there's tons of options of what toppings/how to build your box. I had the chilled rice noodles, and you can tell they are fresh, because despite being chilled, they are still soft and moist - not hard and dry/sticky like ones that have been left out for too long. 

Overall I was very satisfied with my meal and the restaurant! Quick, easy and delicious. Would definitely come back again.
