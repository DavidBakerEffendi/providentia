An absolute craving meal! Have to get Cane's at least a couple times per week.  Tenders are never greasy, the sauce is great; like "fry sauce" but much better with a great spice mixture.  Food is always hot and fresh.  If you want a fast drive through, go to McDonalds. Cane's doesn't cook ahead of time, so it takes a few minutes.  I always go inside, the line moves quickly and usually by the time the food is ready there is an open table!
