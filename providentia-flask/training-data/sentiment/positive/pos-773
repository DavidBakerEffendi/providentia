Chi tea for the win! In recent years I have found a new found love for tea...many different teas but my go to one in the winter is chi tea and let me tell you their's is good really good better than starbucks good. Tried one of their cookies, was worried as they look hard on the outside was pleasantly suprised by the softness and flavor. Tried their artichoke soup and well it just wasn't for me but would love to come back and try some of their other options.
