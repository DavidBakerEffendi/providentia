I've been a Wildflower fan since 2010 and I only wish I'd known about them sooner. I'm officially a bread snob; pick a flavor, they are all delicious and preservative free. Now on to food...so good! The BLT plus is my favorite sandwich on the menu; BLT plus cheese and avocado. The soups are heaven  potato cream cheese  and French onion are my favs. The coffee will wake you up in a great way and the lemon ricotta pancakes for breakfast are all you really need in your diet. Did I mention the staff is amazing as well?! Don't waste your time on the other corporate sandwich shop, this local treasure is ON POINT!
