Although I haven't eaten in the actual restaurant in YEARS, I have been to the lounge/bar a lot recently, for their happy hour.  It simply cannot be beat!

Draft beers are $2...I had the Widmer, can't beat a good hefe for $2.  I've had the rocky point shrimp cocktail which was good, but not your typical shrimp cocktail. The shrimp was cut up, and in a ceviche like mixture served in a martini glass.  I enjoyed it.  I've also had the lobster lettuce wraps...which I also enjoyed.  Where can you get such large chunks of lobster in a dish for $5.95??  

The real gem on the happy hour menu is the Bacon Bleu Cheese burger.  It's a delicious 1/2lb homemade burger, with thick cut bacon and bleu cheese crumbles.  I don't even like bleu cheese, but this burger was so flavorful, juicy and outstanding.  The fries are delicious too.  And to think it was only $4.95....makes it all the better.  You can hardly get a burger and fries at In-and-Out for that price.  Burger and beer for $7.50 with tax?  You will find me here often just for that reason.
