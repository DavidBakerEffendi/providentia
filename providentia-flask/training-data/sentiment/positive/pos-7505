Fresh Cup is hands down the best boba joint in Vegas. Excellent service and drinks. Fresh Cup is very clean, staff is very attentive and will bend over backwards to help you, everything on the menu is very inexpensive, not as crowded as its sister store(Volcano Tea), make sure to get a card, purchase 10 items on the menu and get a free medium drink, plenty of parking, close to 168, jones market, and excellent restaurants like Asian BBQ and Noodles, HK Star, and Wendy's Noodle Cafe. Fresh Cup also has free wifi. it is a good place to meet people or to get some work done.
