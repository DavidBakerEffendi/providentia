If I had to intake carbs, pizza is my second go to after pasta. Fired Pie is a great chain where you get a personal size pizza or salad for under $9. Choose varied options or make your own. I prefer the Hawaiian BBQ substituted with fresh basil or the chicken pesto. It's perfect if you love thin crust, on a budget and in a hurry. This little location is a jaunt from my office. Never busy, staff is friendly, and food is consistent bc you are the chef of your choice own pizza. If you have the leisure time, you can grab a beer with your pizza and enjoy the patrons coming and going. Why not make time for what makes your soul happy?!?!!!
