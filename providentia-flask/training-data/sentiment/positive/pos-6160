We walked around the Central Park and then decided to stop by for the dessert. We got Vanilla strawberry semifreddo. It was delicious especially when there were tiny tomatoes infused with strawberry and slides of strawberries infused with tomatoes. Also there was some tiny flowers and greens in the same plate. The tomatoes were the best to pair with strawberries and semifreddo.
