I don't often give 5 stars to any place I got to but Dierks Bently deserves all 5. The food was amazing. We were here for brunch and just decided to try the fried pickles. They were so good. The best I've had anywhere. It's all in the batter and they nailed it. We also had the chicken fried steak which was smothered in a phenomenal gravy. I had the breakfast burger which was fixed with a homemade sausage again flavor on point. Oh and did I mention this is a heaven for football lovers. TV's everywhere you look. Service exceptional.  I will return.
