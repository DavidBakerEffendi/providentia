I love this place! I love sushi and theirs is fresh and delicious.
They have some premade rolls you can take to go (or eat there if you like) or you can order from their menu and they'll make it fresh. I believe their price's fair for the quality of their food and they use purple rice which is healthier than white rice.

The seating area isn't too big but they have a few tables. If you're part of a big group, though, it'll be hard for you to find seating, specially at lunch time. 

Service is pretty fast, even at lunch time when they're the busiest and the staff's always nice and courteous.

All in all, it's a very good place to get sushi downtown Phoenix.
