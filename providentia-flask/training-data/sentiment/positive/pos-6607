I have to take the time to review this place again. My Lord, it is heaven! The food is just delicious. I mean, it's tasty and flavorful and my taste buds are overjoyed just thinking about last nights meal. I had the stir fry lingiune with shrimp. WOW. The thai basil is so good. I mean it, it is soooo good. I know she uses it in the Thai mango salad too. It tastes like regular basil, no worries that it would be weird, but WOW. It takes the dish from amazing to in my opinion exceptional. I've tried quite a few items on the menu. The fried tofu is good and I am NOT a fan of tofu. Weird, a vegetarian (95%, I went to Seattle and haven't been able to go cold turkey on fish since) who doesnt like tofu. The roti is so good. I've had roti before, but not like this. The curry sauce accompanying the roti is delicious. I wish I knew better words for delicious. Pan Asian is the place that allowed me to try the curry couscous at DW Bistro. If not for her yellow curry, I would be denying myself something wonderful. I can not say enough good things about this place. It's clean and bright, HUGE plus! The service is great. Always make sure you have drinks and always see how everything is. What more could you ask for. If you want great Asian food, THIS is the place to go.
