I came here based on a recommendation from a friend and I couldn't be happier.
Hands down the BEST fried checkin in town!!
Their spicy chicken is simply amazing! Top that with a very tasty garlic dip and crispy and just right French fries.
There service is also amazing, when the guy knew it was my first time, he kindly offered me a piece of spicy checkin just to try it and see if I like it for FREE!!!! 
Very highly recommended 
Best part is they also deliver!
Also if u care, their meat is halal.
I wanted to take photos but it was so good I couldn't stop!
