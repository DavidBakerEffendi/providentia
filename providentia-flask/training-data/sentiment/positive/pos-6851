In my opinion eggstasy is the best breakfast restaurant in Phx. The menu is large and creative and the food is out of this world. The portion sizes are so generous that I'm usually stuffed for an entire day. The restaurant is very cool , very modern and LA-like. The waitstaff is also super friendly. They have lavazza coffee (so good). Best breakfast in Phx - by far
