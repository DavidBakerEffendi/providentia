This is one of my favorite place says to come get a burrito and guacamole and chips!!! They have The best guacamole dip I've ever had!!! Has a lemon flavor and comes in a pretty big bowl. The environment is very urban. This is a great place to take somebody on a date. Very clean on the inside in the waiters are very professional and respectful
