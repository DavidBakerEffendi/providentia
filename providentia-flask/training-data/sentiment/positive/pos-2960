Totally random place in Chinatown but we absolutely love this place! Meat heaven!  We recently started eating paleo so this is an ideal clean eating date night for us.  We always get the combination mixed bbq  ($37) with short ribs, strip steak, filet mignon and flap meat.  The meat is tender and juicy and served with a delicious chimichurri sauce.  Even the salads fit in our diet since you just dress it with olive oil and vinegar.  We went back and tried an all you can eat korean bbq recently, the alternative was Rincon.  We regretted going to the AYCE korean bbq, the meat quality doesn't match up with this place and it was more expensive.  So, if your looking for a different place to pig on out meat...this is your place.  On a side note, we really enjoyed the salad with the palm hearts, great addition to all the meat.  This is a pretty casual place since it's a deli/restaurant, so don't plan a romantic date night here.  We don't eat bread, but the complimentary bread looked pretty decent.  The only thing kind of lacking is service, we had a hard time getting our water refilled.  The servers also work behind the deli counter as well.
