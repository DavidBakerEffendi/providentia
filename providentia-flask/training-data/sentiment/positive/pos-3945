Our stay at the Venetian was amazing! It was extremely clean, the workers were professional and helpful, and its location is excellent. The rooms are all suites and are quite large. We had easy access to other hotels and shows, as well as Fashion Show Mall. I took my parents there for their 50th wedding anniversary and they loved it. The best part was staying so close to many restaurants and stores. There was even a Carlos Bakery in the hotel! My parents enjoyed the gondola ride and we listened to live music while eating gelato. The Palazzo is attached to the Venetian, which I didn't realize prior to going there. I must admit that I enjoyed The Venetian even more than the Wynn, which is where I stayed during my last Vegas trip. We will be back!
