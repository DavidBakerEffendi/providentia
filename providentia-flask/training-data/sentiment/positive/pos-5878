A friend took me to The Zenith yesterday for brunch. After hearing about it for awhile and how much of a hipster mecca it was, I was a bit apprehensive and had flashbacks of the morning brunch sketch from Portlandia. Thankfully there was no line wrapped around the building and we only had about a 10 minute wait. 

We were seated at a table with two other couples. I didn't realize it would be communal dining, but luckily the other diners were cool and kept to themselves. I could see it being a problem for some, though (groups with kids, etc). 

The deal for Sunday brunch was incredible: coffee or tea, an entree, and the buffet all for only $10. The entree I had (Almond Pancakes) wasn't anything remarkable. In fact, I didn't even finish it because they were dry and missing that sort of richness I usually crave in a good pancake. HOWEVER, the brunch buffet was FANTASTIC!

There was a homemade baked cake/bread table, full of yummy looking bundt-cake type of things. I'm not into sweets, but I tasted a small piece of banana raspberry bread and it was delish. I got my fill on the savory side of the buffet: spicy asian flavored green bean salad, a rotini pesto salad, the homemade hummus that is probably the best I've ever tasted, and much much more. In the future, I think I may skip the entree and just veg out (excuse my pun) on the buffet. 

I was certainly full after leaving here, and not in the gross way that sometimes comes from places where they use a bunch of processed canned nonsense from Sysco. This place certainly did fresh vegetarian food correctly, unlike it's competitors across town (ahem, Quiet Storm). 

The only thing that would make this place better is air conditioning. I will certainly be back!
