This has to be the best sushi restaurant in Henderson! !  We have tried several in the area and we have been always disappointed.  So excited to try this new restaurant.  It did not disappoint.  We started with the Kale & Pear Salad. Amazing presentation. The flavors were excellent. Went on to the Brussel Sprouts. Perfectly prepare. Hot and crunching in a sauce that was perfection. Then did a spicy hand roll, lemon roll, caterpiller roll and fennel roll. All were flavorful and delicious. Will return!! The restaurant is sectioned off for a more intimate dining experience.  The bar area has plenty of tv screens going to make everyone happy. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.
