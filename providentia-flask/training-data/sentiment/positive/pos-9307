The fountains are breath taking and it literally stops traffic. This is one of my favorite things to do in Vegas. I love the choreographed water and music display. It's great that they don't display the same show over and over again. I caught one of the shows in the afternoon. Later on that evening when I went to eat at their buffet, I caught another show. It was a different song with a different water show. My favorite part of the show is when the water sprouts high into the air. 

I believe that shows are every half hour starting from 3pm to midnight. Get there early to get a good spot for picture taking. It's usually pretty crowded.
