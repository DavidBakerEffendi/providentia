This is my second time here.  My first was a few weeks ago and had the Drunken noodles, which were really amazing.  
This time I opted for lunch special and the Penang Curry.  Heat factor 6 based on the 7 with the noodles.  
I suspect I will have to do a 5 next time because I have become a wuss with spice lately.  Still very enjoyable.  Great sauce and the pork was really tender.  
Staff super nice and cordial. 

Great lunch spot, I work up by the 215 so it's way nearby.  Never too crowded.  Comfy and a place to relax before heading back to the grind.
