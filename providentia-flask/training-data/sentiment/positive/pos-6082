We use Bertha's at work for lunch catering and they are always on time, affordable and delicious.

I always make sure to order myself an additional sandwich/salad combo when they deliver.

So to start, Bertha's is FANTASTIC.

Some of my favorite sandwiches:
Roasted turkey
Pesto chicken
Roast beef and blue cheese
Chicken curry

Their harvest salad and thai chicken salads are also fantastic.

I'm a fan!
