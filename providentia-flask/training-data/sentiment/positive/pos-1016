I came here once because I had a meeting down the street and discovered this adorable little house that was made into a restaurant. It looks so cute inside and out. It doesn't stop there though! The coffee is amazing!!! I'm serious!! And so is the food. 

I didn't think it was fair to keep this place to myself any longer so I took my gf there for Valentine's Day and she was so delighted with it. I took her to a very similar looking restaurant for our first date, so she kept reminiscing on it. I got the pesto chicken sandwich again, AND it was even better than I remembered it! She got the pizza and loved it! Also they have a extensive list of beer, so bee enthusiasts please go! 

The only complaints is the limited parking area and then paying at the counter. BUT everything else surely makes up for it!!
