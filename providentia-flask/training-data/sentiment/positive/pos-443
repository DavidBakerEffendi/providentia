Kings Delight deserves to win the Nobel Prize in Jerk Chicken. I'm a local. I eat here often. But to every true Yelpers (yes, I'm calling you out) should take time out of their day and try Kings Delight. 

KD is tiny. They do take out and offers seating for 10. But don't expect to sit because the line up is right to the exit. The food here is always fresh and it is jammed packed with flavour. They're chicken is very tender and moist, and you'll never have chicken this tender.

They offer chicken in variations, but jerk, fried, bbq, stewed, curry chicken is offered daily. Ox tail is a must try. Reoccurring specials also include chicken foot soup, fish and more. My favourite dish would be jerk chicken, rice and peas, ox tail gravy, coleslaw (also to die for).

Don't be alarmed when your bill comes out to be $3, tax included. No, it wasn't a typo. A small portion cost $3 and can feed the small sized adult. What is mind blowing is that quality is not sacrificed in this low priced joint.

Bow to the King.
