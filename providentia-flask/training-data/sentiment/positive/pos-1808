I prefer it to one at the Wynn but both are probably among the best in Las Vegas.  Maybe it was constant refilling of crab legs when I went for dinner once, or the time the chef cooking my omelette calling me sir was carefully using his spatula to make sure every corner of the egg was cooked evenly.  There is a bit of a line and it is a little bit more than others on the Strip but these little details that make all the difference.
