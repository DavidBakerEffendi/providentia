The food quality is excellent and authentic.  The portions are pretty big.  I really like the hot and sour and corn (egg drop) soup.  It's very tasty.  My fiance likes the corn soup there.  We normally order the spicy calamari and eggplant tofu for us two.  I made reservations for my family of 11 people and they gave good ambiance and fast customer service.  My family like the food and service so much we came back again 2 days after.  We order a lot of different dishes and they were amazing.  First dish finished was the Chinese broccoli and mushrooms.  Favorite dish was the beef stew and orange chicken.  They kids ate the chicken fried rice with no soy sauce.  All 9 dishes was finished!  The price is reasonable and fairly inexpensive.  We loved it.
