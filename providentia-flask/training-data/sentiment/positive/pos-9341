Gold Spike really needs two listings. One for daytime activities and one for the nightlife. In the day, it's a blessing for anyone who telecommutes. Sometimes when you work from home you just need to get out before your house starts feeling like a jail cell. The free wifi (decent speeds), plenty of outlets and long tables around the bar allow you to spread out and really get some work done. JAIL BREAK! In some ways it still feels like my house though. TV's, good beer, solid tunes and super models. Fine, I made that last one up. Added bonus that cafe serves solid food on the cheap and delivers it to your table. Gold Spike FTW!

At night you can really make use of the outdoor area. They provide (more) cornhole sets, jumbo Jenga, another bar and often times a band rocking out by a Silver Bullet style trailer. Def worth a stop next time you're bar hopping downtown.
