Somehow during every trip, any time of year, we catch Con te Partio as our last show before heading back to the hotel for the evening.  It's the first show we ever saw (at the grand opening - which was also our wedding anniversary) and it's remained (by luck) the last show we see every trip.  The best view, of course, is street level, center stage.  

Some of the best performances are 'One' (from A Chorus Line) and 'Your Song' (the Ewan McGreggor version from Moulin Rouge).   Any song with a more dramatic ending will lend to a more spectacular explosion of lights and blasts from the fountains.

The ultimate romantic backdrop.  Want to see it without a trip to sin city?  Rent Oceans Eleven (the Clooney version).
