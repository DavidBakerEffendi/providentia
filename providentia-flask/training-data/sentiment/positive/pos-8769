Always heard about how people raved about fuku burger, so my friend and I gave it a try and we were NOT disappointed. I ordered the Tamago burger with shoe string onion rings and an egg. It was dripping with delicious goodness. Warning, it can be messy. Be prepared to use a whole lot of napkins or bring some wet-naps. The meat was real meat. Not some combination of whatever that most fast food chains add. And the patty was thick, not paper thin like most chains. If you are looking for something different and you've never tried this place, I highly recommend visiting fuku burger.
