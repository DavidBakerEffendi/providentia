Fun fun fun restaurant.  The sushi I had was excellent, I only tried one roll so I can't really say how it compares to any other sushi restaurants I've been to but if I had to judge on the one roll I did have it would be near the top.  One plate I'd definitely suggest is "The Rock", they bring out marinated pieces of raw steak that you cook on a super hot rock.  I believe the rock flames when they bring it out.  While it might not be the best item on the menu it is still very good and its also the most fun.  As with anywhere else you will find some hit or miss items. I highly recommend also the Sasa fries, they might not be for everyone but they had a great texture and consistency nice and crispy yet soft on the inside.  The seaweed seasoning is just something that you have to experience to understand, don't let it scare you away though its good.  I actually wasn't a big fan of the Katsu ketchup they served with it though, I felt the fries were better plain.  Based on my first visit I'd definitely go back, hopefully get to try more sushi and get a better idea about whether I can keep it up at 5 stars or bring it down to four.  Its probably best for group dining or a date with someone who has similar tastes since after all tapas are meant for sharing.
