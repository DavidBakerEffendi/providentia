Hà is hands down one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Montreal (and also one of my favorite restaurants period).

My friend Claire and I went for a weekday lunch, as my friend had mentioned they have a lunch special.

Indeed, for lunch, you basically get a free starter with a select choice of meals (about 7 options). I often order the beef pho, but had been disappointed the last time I went, so I opted for the cold octopus salad as a main and the mini laksa as a starter.

Both dishes were amazing and so delicious. The laksa was seasoned to perfection and very tasty. As for the octopus salad, just wow. The dish was beautifully plated first of all and the combination of flavours, fresh ingredients and spices was just perfect.

I highly recommend Hà to anyone looking for a great Asian meal with a bit of a twist, either for lunch or dinner. Hà is a great spot to try with friends, family or with your partner.
