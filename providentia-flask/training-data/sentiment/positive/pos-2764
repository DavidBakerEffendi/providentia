Tranquilo is definitely a tranquil, peaceful and trendy spot inside The Clarendon Hotel. With a favorable happy hour menu until 7pm that serves up $2 grilled shrimp tacos and $5 margaritas you are in for a fun inexpensive time. Friendly, attentive, quick service are pleasing factors when dining out and this spot offers it all while maintaining its chic trendy vibes. I would definitely want to go back to try more of their delicious artfully crafted street tacos like the shredded beef deshebrada marinated in Mexican coke, chili rojo, garlic and chipotle crema. Muy delicioso!
