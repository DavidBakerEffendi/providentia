Atmosphere:  Cute, cozy & relaxed, this is a great place for meat eaters and vegans to dine together in perfect harmony.  My second time there, we happened to arrive just as Wednesday Trivia Night was starting, and although we didn't get a single answer right (it was a Parks & Rec theme), it was very entertaining and the trivia host was a total character. 

Food:  All vegan and gluten free options on the menu are clearly noted, and there are several to choose from, including a gluten free beer.  I've had both the phish & chips and the fried buffalo tofu sandwich with garlic aioli (both vegan & gf) and I enjoyed them both...the sammie was my fav and I'll be going back for more very soon. Mmmmmm.....that gf bun slayed me. 

Service:  always friendly, prompt, and they know the menu inside & out

Value:  As mentioned by other reviewers, the prices for the sandwiches are a little high considering that they don't come with anything, but for someone with so many dietary restrictions, it's worth it just to be able to eat with friends like a normal human being. 

Since it's right at the bottom of Roncesvalles, it's the perfect spot to start the afternoon with lunch, then spend the rest of the day wandering around the neighbourhoods checking out all the vintage/antique shops, cafes and various quirky Roncie/Queen West stuff.
