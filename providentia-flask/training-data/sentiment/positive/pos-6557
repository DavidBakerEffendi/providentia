4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. (and I rarely round up!)
I am a HUGE fan of Pan Asian, and an even bigger fan of owner David Wong and his wife, Lisa, the chef! They are awesome people serving tasty, fresh food- hence the reason I round up. 

My first encounter was during lunch with my toddler daughter. We started with the Chicken Gyoza- and I could barely get a bite because my daughter practically ate the entire plate herself.  I also ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu- and it was probably the best I have ever had. And I have eaten A LOT of Pad See Ew.  

Came back for lunch yesterday, and as much as I wanted to order the Pad See Ew again, I thought I should try something new. I ordered the Massaman Curry that other yelpers have been raving about.  It was my first time trying this dish and I am sad that I hadn't tried it sooner.  The potatoes and carrots were perfect and the avocado, bell peppers, and peanuts gave it a nice texture. 

My husband ordered the Thai style "Pho" and the broth was BURSTING with flavor.  I am a huge fan of Vietnamese Pho and have very high standards, but I have found a new love in this Thai version. Even after my husband added spice to it, it only enhanced the flavor and made it even better.  This is one dish that I can't stop thinking about.  I can't wait to go back and have a bowl all to myself. 

My toddler daughter was being a tad bratty and wouldn't sit still to eat her meal, so David came to my rescue and bribed her with some ice cream (with my permission of course).  Well, she sat like a perfect angel and ate her lunch.  We also ordered the fried bananas, and like Paolo D., I prefer the Filipino version with jackfruit- but I must say that the coconut and sesame seeds in this dish was a nice surprise, and my daughter's vanilla ice cream was the perfect accompaniment.
