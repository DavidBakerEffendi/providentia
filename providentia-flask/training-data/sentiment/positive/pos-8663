Stopped in here for lunch, and it has been awhile. With the restaurant just opening around 10:30 am, one can get in and out soon. Surprisingly, this store must have a lot of fans since the lobby was pretty busy and there were other patrons that desired Wendy's as much as we did.

With the expansion of their 4 for 4 meal we decided to try the Jr Bacon and chicken sandwich too. Everything was fresh and made to our liking not the "way" it comes. And they got our food order right the first time. Such success!
The staff was very attentive to their guests needs and were cleaning as needed tables for guests. Thanks Wendy's on Arville for having fabulous staff.
