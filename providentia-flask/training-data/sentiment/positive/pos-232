When it comes to the world of sliders, Roots Farm Food does it right. Man were their sliders tasty. I tried the 14 hour beef brisket slider and the pork belly slider. Both just made to perfection. My friends had the falafal and they had they same response as I did. Clearly Roots takes pride in their food.
