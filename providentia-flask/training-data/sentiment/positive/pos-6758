We ate dinner there today and we loved everything about it.  The food was *delicious* (my husband had the broiled cod entree and I had the roasted spinach salad.  His came with seasoned home fries & steamed broccoli and mine included eggplant, quinoa & mozzarella cheese.  The vinaigrette dressing was particularly good, too).  The prices were *very* reasonable, the portions were generous, our server was super-friendly, the manager was very pleasant (I complimented him afterwards), we liked the interior and the restrooms were very clean.  A great experience in every way!
