Fabulous ambiance! Superb service by Felicity! The food was fantastic. My husband says that the hash browns were the best in the valley. Steak was perfectly cooked. Eggs were perfectly poached. Coffee was great as well. It's our first time here. We will be back!!!! My husband also went to the back to compliment the cooks...
