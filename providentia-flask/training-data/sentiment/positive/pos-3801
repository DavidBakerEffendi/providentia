We found this charming little Italian bistro in North Scottsdale adjacent to a Safeway. We decided to stop and have dinner there. It was fabulous.
Old fashion Italian food like they do it back east. Everything fresh and delicious. Finally a place that puts bread on the table as soon as you're seated. Service is warm and friendly. We ordered Mussels,Caesar salad,mozzarella, and best Chicken Parm with a side of Pasta. 
The Owner was very welcoming. It's our new weekly dinner plan!
