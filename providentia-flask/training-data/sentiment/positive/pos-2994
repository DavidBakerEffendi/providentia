I came here for lunch with my friend on Sunday. It was such a nice day that we chose to sit out on the patio(plus, there were puppies out there!).  If I wasn't planning on walking around the mall to do some shopping, I totally would have brought my dog.  

The service was great. Our friendly waitress would refill our glasses before they even got empty and she gladly split our check.  My friend and I both checked in on Yelp and got free Cajun fries. I had a roasted turkey club with a side of cucumber salad and it was all delicious.   Definitely a great place to have lunch.
