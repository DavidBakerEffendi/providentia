BLD = Bo Loves ...... ummm Bo Loves Dis-Place :)

I really do love this place. I first heard of it thru Yelp, but never had the chance to visit since it's far from the land of Scottsdale where I dwell.  Finally made it and boy was I thrilled!  I sat at the bar where Aaron was a great host and kept my drinks full.  I ordered "The Goat Burger" -- Yummy!  Oh serve me a sweet bite: goat cheese, bacon, roma tomatoes, and arugula.  Oh how it pleased my palates. The burger was sweet and the scent of the arugula traveled thru my nostrils with delight.  This was one good burger and I must recommend it!

The place is like a lounge and with an awesome wine rack in the back.  I totally dig the designs and the communal table in the middle.  I recommend sitting at the end of the bar where the table curves around where you can chat with your friends and of course, Aaron, which showed and offered up some of his favorite wines -- Thanks man! - Enjoy!
