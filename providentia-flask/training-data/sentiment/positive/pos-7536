After a few nights in Vegas with nothing but disappointments (thanks alot Bellagio!) Roy's was a much needed positive to our trip.

We made a reservation for 8:45 PM this past Sunday - but of course the Bellagio burned us  (not the first time!) Roy's posted closing time is 9:00 PM but we called and they offered to stay open for us until 9:15 PM!!! Outstanding! Who does that?! Anyways, we arrive at 9:15 PM exactly and they gave us a table.

The service was top notch. Very friendly, and the waiter was even happy to stay open for us! That is not common of most places after closing time!

I ordered the Thai Chicken. It was excellent! The meat slipped right off the bone.  Not sure what the sauce was it came with but DANG! It was great.  My better half ordered the salmon.  It came out looking like something out of a magazine! Spectacular!

All around this was one of the most positive facilities we visited during our 4 day stay in Vegas.
