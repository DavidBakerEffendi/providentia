I love this place. I've tried everything on the menu and the lamb wrap is my favorite. They fill your grilled wrap to the brim with flavorful, tender meat and they usually put mango chutney and edamame in it. Service is really quick and the staff is super friendly. I can easily grab a wrap on my way home or dine in as there is plenty of seating.
