Hot Bread served with Pesto is a new thing for them since I was there last year.  I'm actually from Chicago.  The great food and excellent customer service is why I keep going back.

I love their calamari, best I've had yet.  We had steak which is pricey but was excellent!

They don't have rootbeer and I am still sad after all these years.  But this year they had me try some ice teas which I didn't like at all.  After a few different trial drinks the waiter surprised me with root beer that he got from another restaurant just for me!

Blake made our night and we had a wonderful time celebrating my friend's birthday!
