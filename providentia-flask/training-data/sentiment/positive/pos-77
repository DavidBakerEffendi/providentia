Bombay bhel is my favourite non-buffet Indian restaurant.  I have been coming to this restaurant ever since I was a little kid. They still have the same amazing taste for years. I always grab the chicken thai because it gives you a variety of things to eat. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious bite to eat.
