I love love love this place.

I can't get enough of the grape & arugula flat bread.

The tuna tartare could use a bit more tuna but it's still amazing! 

The crispy Gnocchi is delicious 

If you love mushrooms- get the portobello fries. Lightly breaded portobello fries!

The chicken skewers are perfectly seasoned and juicy!

The blackened fish tacos are my current fave. Spicy salsa. so yummy.

The whole place is beautiful and the staff is so friendly and happy!
