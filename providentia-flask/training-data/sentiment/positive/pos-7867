Found my new spot for fresh authentic sushi!  5+ stars are in order!!! Yes, it's downtown where parking isn't wonderful, but it's definitely worth the parking!!!  A MUST try because you will never go anywhere else for sushi, seriously!

Not only is the food amazing, but the time to get your rolls are crazy! I've never seen such great sushi chefs!  Wow wow wow!!!
