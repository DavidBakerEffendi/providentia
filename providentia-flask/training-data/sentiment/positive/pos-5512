Great lunch specials at $10 or less and a massive amount of food. I alternate between the Sakana Lunch and the Chicken Matsuri. Today I had the Chicken Matsuri lunch. It came with two big peices of sliced up chicken cutlets with this teriyaki like sauce (almost like katsu), salad with shrimp tempura, california rolls and a side of rice. One plate is enough to feed two and only $8.99 during lunch. 

I also came here with some coworkers one night last week. They have customer appreciation (happy hour) on sun-thurs til 9:30pm! Buy a beer and get an appetizer for 50 cents. Also a decent list of rolls for under $5. To sum it up, good food and nicely priced.
