I was referred by a friend. Probably the best recommendation I've gotten for Vegas.

The place is awesome. It's all booths. All the staff is constantly moving. 

The food is beyond delicious. I got the biscuits and gravy. The best I've ever had. I couldn't stop eating.  I didn't need to add anything to it. Flavor was perfect. The biscuits were perfectly soft

The staff came back many times even though they were super busy. I will definitely be coming back on this trip and every trip in the future.


The wait wasn't bad, 15 minutes, honestly I'd wait as long as it took. Worth the wait for sure. They have slots and a lounge that you can hang out in until they call you.
