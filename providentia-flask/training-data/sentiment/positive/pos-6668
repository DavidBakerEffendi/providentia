What a great place for breakfast! The hostess immediately greeted me at the door. She was so cute and polite! I was sat at a comfy booth and promptly greeted by a server. I ordered the breakfast burrito which was absolutely delicious. Our food was quickly prepared and it seemed like a matter of seconds before it arrived at our table. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. I will definitely recommend this place to family and friends.
