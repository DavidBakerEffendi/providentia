Amazing Thai restaurant in Las Vegas! If you know Jitlada Thai Restaurant in Los Angeles then you have to try this place out. Joe and his staff were great and attentive. Their food was amazing 5 star quality and fresh. We tried this Tom Yum Soup, Coconut salad, pork ribs and pineapple fried rice. Definitely coming back again to order some more
