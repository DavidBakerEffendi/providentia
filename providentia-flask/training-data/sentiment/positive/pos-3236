One more excellent review for Raza in Yelp. The food is absolutely delicious and innovative. We had 7 course surprise menu that we managed to pair very well with the wine we brought thanks to the recommendations of our host. A must try restaurant and I'm definitely going back for more magic culinary surprises :)
