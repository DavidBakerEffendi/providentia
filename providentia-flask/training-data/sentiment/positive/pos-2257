I stopped in today for lunch with my mom. We both had the combination platter with jade red chicken, machaca, chicken fried rice, and black beans and devoured all of it. I was originally apprehensive about trying Chinese-Mexican fusion, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I will definitely be back with my husband so he can try it.
