Job well done to the cast and crew! I was going to leave a 4 star because there was some confusion with the bills and took forever to pay...but a 5 was more fitting because the entire experience was above average.

The biggest difference I noticed from previous visits...is that the staff have been trained to provide exceptional customer service. Their sense of urgency to correct issues, the servers checking to ensure food and drinks were perfect...and if not...they would fix immediately. I definitely felt they went out of the way to ensure we have an exceptional experience. Whether we needed more food, more sauce, or drinks....they were prepared to do whatever it took.

Additionally, the show was great and well organized with appropriate breaks and entertainment.  

I'll be back for sure!
