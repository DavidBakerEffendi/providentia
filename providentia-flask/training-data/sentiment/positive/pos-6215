(Lyrics - Aerosmith - Janie's Got A Gun)

Yum, Yum, Yum, Tommy what have you done?
Yum, Yum, Yum, it's the Stack I want
Yum, Yum, Yum, Tommy what have you done?
Yum, Yum, Yum, It's for Yelp....

Tommy's got a thumb
Tommy's got a thumb
The Yelp world's gonna come
Yelping from the valley of the sun
Spice meat rubbing too!
Cinnamon bun rolling through!
They said when Bo Bites was a coming they asked him write a song with some fun!
But man, a car wash a comin'
Now that Tom's Thumb gotta Stack, I'm never gonna eat the same.....!

I've always came here for a Yelp event, but finally got my chance for lunch one fine day!  Who'd ever guess there would be good food at a car wash....yeah a car wash! 

I had to order the Tom's Thumb Stack; made to order only!  Definitely a recommend from this happy patron!  The stack comes with a bed of crispy hash browns, topped with a beef brisket, over easy egg, and drizzled with a chipotle mayo aioli.  I love the crunch of the hash browns while the smokiness of the brisket provides a welcoming aroma!  Also, what doesn't go well with an over easy egg a topped!?  I usually add the habanero bbq sauce to give this awesome dish and extra kick to finish my meal!  

In the end, Tom's Thumb is a must visit, whether for a car wash, good eats, or just checking out it's knicks and knacks they have displayed.  They also have a fine bakery, which they make fresh cinnamon rolls every morning!  I guess you can say it's like an all in one stop shop for your belly! - Enjoy!
