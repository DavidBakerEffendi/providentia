Really a fantastic place to get introduced to or just enjoy some Indian style food. I first came here during the first week or so that it opened never having Indian cuisine in my life.  After getting a nice explanation from the overly friendly staff and doing my best to determine what I would like, I indulged in the chicken with rice bowl along with the naan bread and the tikka masala.  All of it was absolutely fantastic.  I don't get a chance to come here as much as I'd like, but the food is always consistently great and the service friendly.  Just wish they had some level of spicy beyond what's currently offered!
