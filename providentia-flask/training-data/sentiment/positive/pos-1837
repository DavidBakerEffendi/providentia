Whether you're a tourist or a local, the Fountains of Bellagio should be on your list to visit. Located in front of the Bellagio hotel, this show sets water fountain choreography to music every 15 minutes. Sometimes you'll have to move around a bit to find a good spot to watch the show, but it is worth it. Sometimes we'd stay to watch several shows in a row, with each one a different song.
