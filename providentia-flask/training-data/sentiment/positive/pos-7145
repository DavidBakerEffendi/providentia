I've eaten at both here and their previous location across the drive--much better venue now.  The place is hip with ample room, the staff is friendly and well informed, and the food--albeit a little pricey--is stellar.  Fabulous, actually.   

They stay true to their vegan roots with handcrafted offerings assembled with uber-fresh food.  Some may think serving vegan food is simply frying up a pile of tofu and saying, "enjoy"!  Not here.  Lots of outta the box thinking which proves (to me at least) that quality, wholesomeness, and value are intertwined.  And there is room for the menu to grow, too.

Yes, one can order a Big Mac value meal for half the price, but it may also get you to the morgue in half the time, too.  I heartily recommend Luna's as a solid restaurant in Charlotte's culinary scene.
