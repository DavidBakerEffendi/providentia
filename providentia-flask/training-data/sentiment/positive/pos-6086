I cannot believe this Chafa Thai has so few reviews, it is a really great restaurant! I had been meaning to come here since it opened and finally came here for dinner with friends.

The restaurant is small, it probably seats only 40 people. Which is nice, it gives it an intimate vibe. Usually when I go to Thai places I choose a curry of some sort but decided to venture out and try something different. We started with the lettuce wraps, which are not the basic lettuce wraps you can get anywhere else. These are so good with a tamarind dipping sauce. For my entree I chose the prawns with spice lemongrass salad. My friends ordered the sea bass and the basil and lemongrass tilapia. The dish is the whole fish, and they de-bone it at the table. I tried it, it was very tasty, it had a strong lemongrass taste. I didn't try the salmon but my friend said it was very good. My prawns were excellent, excellent, excellent. I opted for a glass of Riesling to go with my meal. For dessert I ordered a scoop of coconut ice cream, which I really enjoyed since it was not too sweet and it had shaved coconut on top that gave it a crunchy texture. Everything was super fresh and tasted wonderful. The service is very, very attentive. Two different waiters attended to us and they were both very nice.

I think some people may have disliked the portion sizes. Most casual Thai places in town serve huge portions of food. The portions here are smaller, but it is fine dining after all. I left feeling happy and satisfied, but not over the top full.

All in all, it's a great local restaurant that needs more love from the community. Check it out!
