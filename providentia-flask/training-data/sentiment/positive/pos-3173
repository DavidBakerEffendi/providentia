Sunsational Coffee is awesome! It's exciting to finally get a coffee shop in Surprise that offers quality coffee...unlike Starbucks! I really enjoy their convenient drive-thru, especially just before heading into work. The other day I took my Lab with me and she got a dog treat from the drive-thru! The staff is super friendly. I would recommend trying their Carmel Latte and their Strawberry Italian Cream Soda (I'm hooked on this one!). Great coffee joint to get some work done or to socialize over coffee. I really hope they stay open!
