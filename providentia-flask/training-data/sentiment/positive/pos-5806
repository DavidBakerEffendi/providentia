Been coming here since they opened and it's outstanding. It's sushi and tapas with a Hawaiian twist. I always order the sliders, 808 Special and the Ali'i roll (formerly the Chef Yoshi roll). I also suggest the pork belly Skewers and both deserts. But my absolute favorite dish is the Spicy Tuna Crackers.
