I love watching the water show during winter. They play the most magical spiritual Christmas songs.  It just puts me into a trance.  There is no worries to be found, all is floated along the long pavement of water.  All you have is the water dancing along the path with bright lights highlighting the movements.  Wow... it is a view to see.  If you are ever feeling down and out, I am sure this will do the trick.  The water fountain show is breath taking.  The music that they play is loud and you can hear it from two blocks away.  Bellagio did a wonderful job with this show.  And.. and... it's free!  No matter where you stand you will still get a good view.  It's really that big.  The show plays every half an hour.  This is great for those that are on a budget.  A free budget that is. haha Enjoy kids!  I like to watch it in the evening when it's dark.  The effect is much better.  (=
