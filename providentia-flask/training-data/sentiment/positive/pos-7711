YEEEEEEESSSSS. Finally, some awesome soup dumplings in Phoenix!!! Not some chewy-skinned dried up semblance of one, which I have found at other Chinese restaurants. 

The moment we sat down, we ordered some xiaolongbao while we perused the menu. Our main goal was to eat soup dumplings, so we just ordered a beef/vegetable noodle entree as a complementary dish. The noodles were fine, nothing special. 

As we awaited our first order of xiaolongbao, we enjoyed watching one of the ladies hand make the dumplings at the counter. It only increased our anticipation. When the dumplings finally came out with vinegar + ginger, I was so happy! You can be certain no other place I tried in Phoenix automatically brought this sauce out--I  would have to ask for vinegar separately!

They tasted great. Is it the best xiaolongbao I've ever had? No, but they were damn good regardless and certainly the best I've had in Phoenix. The broth in the dumpling was very savory, the skin wasn't too thick or dry and the filling was delicious.

Their entrees are reasonably priced too. We'll be back :) Thank you Chou's Kitchen!
