My first visit to Tumi's Peruvian Cuisine was such a delight.  The service was beyond spectacular, the food was exceptional, and the drinks were reasonably price and delicious.  It was so good I wanted to go back the very next day.  I can't say enough about this restaurant!  Thank you to the owners of the restaurant for giving the East Valley a taste of Peru!
