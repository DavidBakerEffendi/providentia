This is definitely a new favorite in the Madison beer scene. Every month they have a tap take over where they offer all offer several different tabs from one brewery. So far we've been a couple of times and have gotten the pleasure to try the different rotating taps. The food is unbelievably good, I highly recommend the shishito peppers. The staff is always extremely friendly and attentive. The best part is the patio. The Robina courtyard patio is gorgeous and offers a unique experience in Madison. I'd argue to say it is one of the best patios in town. Another thing we like about Madison top is the variety of games they offer. So it's a great place to hang out with some friends on an afternoon in the summer. They are also very dog friendly so we love bringing our pup there.
