I don't care what you say, I'll never get tired The Bellagio Fountains. Day or night I always have to stop and watch whenever I pass by. And this is coming from a 10-Year-Strong Local! 

Its one of those places in Vegas that is touristy but also a must-see. Great for photo-ops even during the daytime but especially at night. Lo-Fi!! Lol! #fivelikes
