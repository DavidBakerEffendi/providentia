I went on a Tuesday night. The service was very good and the food came out quickly. I got the veggie enchiladas. They were very good! The queso dip and chips are also excellent. I didn't get a drink but they have a nice looking bar. The prices are in the low/mid range for dinner $10.00-15.00 for an entree. I will definitely be going back.
