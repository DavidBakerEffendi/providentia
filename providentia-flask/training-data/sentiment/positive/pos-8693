We are locals and had some family in town. We took them to Battista's and our guests haven't stopped talking about it. The food was AMAZING!!!! The chef personally came out to go over the menu and even checked on us afterwards. The staff was friendly and so helpful! Definitely made a lasting impression on us. Amazing!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!
