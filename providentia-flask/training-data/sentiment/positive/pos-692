This place is amazing! I been twice so far and the food is always good. I have been a fan raisin cains for over 15 years when they started in Baton Rouge La. and they are really good still, but I think I now like  PDQ more. The chicken fingers are always hot, juicy, and fresh. They have an abundance of dipping sauces that you can have as many of as you would like. They also serve cheer wine! The price is decent. The staff is always nice and knowledgeable. The restaurant is never too crowded, and stays clean. I would definitely recommend PDQ.
