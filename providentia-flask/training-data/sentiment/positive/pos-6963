My review may be a bit biased just like what Learnee L. also stated.  So my review is mainly on service and ambiance.  Service was impeccable!  We felt welcomed and well taken care of.  
The ambience was just right, not too dark and not too light.  It was quiet enough to carry a conversation coz once you walk out of that place, you're back to the noise of Caesar's Palace.  

Food was really great!  I don't remember how many courses we had but wow.  It was one of the best meals I've had.  
Afterthought drink was refreshing and yum! Great recommendation by our server.  
The food was complimentary but I would definitely pay for it, so worth it.
