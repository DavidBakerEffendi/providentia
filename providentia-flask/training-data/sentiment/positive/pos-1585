We had a 50 anniverasy here for my grandparents. They accomdated us very well. We had a private room with all our close family and friends. We were able to drop the  cake off early and they stored it for us. Wine was on the tables and food was delish. We had a couple options to choose from. It was perfect for my grandparents as they are fans when coming to Las Vegas from california!!
