Ordered a cheesesteak and fries, and the sandwich was huge and really good. Fries were a touch too salty for me but I honestly cared more about the sandwich. Definitely will be back to try out other stuff as well. They were very fast filling the order, doing it online it was ready in less than 15 minutes for pickup.
