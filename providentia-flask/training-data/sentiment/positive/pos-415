By Far one of the best Gaming Bars and Family Restaurants in Las Vegas! The Bar is separated from the Restaurant for the convenience of Family's and Non smokers! Also one of the best Happy Hours in town. Between 3pm-6pm and 11-3am, Ellis Island Micro Brew Drafts are $2.50, Well and Call drinks are half off, and Amazing Appetizers are 1/2 off as well.
The Bartender Danny is super awesome, He is so hospitable, he definitely gives the best service in town ;) 
The Restaurant side is great as well, I usually sit in the restaurant for breakfast on the weekends, The Steak and Eggs and Bloody Marys are amazing! 
As far as food, Ive ordered from both the Bar and restaurant, Everything has always came out great, The Fish N Chips, the Meatball Sliders, the Ribs, Its all good here I have not a single complaint about this place!
