Little delayed in reviewing my most recent visit to  Wong's. The reason.........I have been trying to find a way to trick Yelp in to allowing me to give Wong's ten stars. LOVE WONG'S AND THEIR STAFF!!!!! So much so that I want it served at my funeral....yep, WONG'S for everyone on my special day. Just hope the family remembers to cremate some of the grub with me. :) 

Oh, I had the teriyaki chicken with noodles on my most recent visit and it was great as usual. No joke, best ever. The sauce was amazing. Who can make a teriyaki sauce stand apart from others? Wong's can!!!!! Also enjoyed some amazing potstickers. 

A place with great staff and great food needs to be applauded and I will always applaud Wong's.
