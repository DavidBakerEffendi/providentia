PHONTASTIC!
Best PHO in Scottsdale.. Hands down. I've come here a few times with my dad for lunch and we are absolutely obsessed! I love the family style customer service and the food and pho are so fresh. The owner remembers us every time we stop in (about once a week) and always makes sure we are happy with our order. Of course we are happy when our tummy is filled with yummy Vietnamese goodness! 
This place gets packed for lunch but once you try it you will always come back.
