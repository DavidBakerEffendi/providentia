We go to this location often. At least 2-3 a month. The manager is fantastic and the staff in the morning is great!! The food is always hot and fresh! We love the chicken gourmet tacos. Yummy! I Highly recommend this Rubios!! 
P.s.We don't know anyone personally here, we just have had great food and service!
