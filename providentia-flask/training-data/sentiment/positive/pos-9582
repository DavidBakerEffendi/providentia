I've always heard of this restaurant, but never went. Tonight I decided my wife and I would change that. They do take reservations if you have 6 or more people, but if you don't, usually a reservation isn't needed. 

When you walk in, the ambience is beautiful. There's a tree in the middle of the restaurant and it really adds a nice feel. My wife and I asked for a booth and it was extremely intimate. 

As far as the food, we ordered the beer battered pickles and those were really tasty. For entrees I had the ahi tuna steak and it was cooked to perfection. There was nothing left on my plate. My wife ordered the pan seared Scottish salmon and she loved it. The couscous that it came with was delicious as well. For dessert it was recommended we tried the chocolate mouse pecan torte and holy moly was it tasty. We finished it in let than 2 minutes. 

Overall, this place is great for a date night or fun for a group. I highly recommend!
