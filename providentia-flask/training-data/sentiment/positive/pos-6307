This is sometimes my go to place for lazy Sundays. I haven't been here in a few months and I do not know why; I missed it. 

I would suggest you avoid happy hour on Sundays which is 11 a.m.-12 p.m. Because the line is out of the door but the food is great (big portions) and the prices are reasonable. They serve pickles before your meal and it's something I often look forward to. 

I always order their challah french toast and an omelet, I'm happy to say I've never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and efficient; I just love it here.
