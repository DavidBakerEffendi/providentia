A broad menu executed wonderfully 
with a sophisticated flair.   The modest dining room is well done as well...very pleasant place to site...albeit intimate.  No language barriers and service was on point.  But the food...best Thai meal I think I have had in this town....everything excellent.  It felt a step above Lotus of Siam at half the price.
