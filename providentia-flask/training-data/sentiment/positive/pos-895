Upon my arrival, the server Courtnee certainly exceeded my expections, ensuring all my plates were cooked to high standards while managing to check me out in a timely manner. I can tell the manager at this location certainly puts in the time to develop his employees, ensuring that each customer is provided with phenomenal standards & great tasting food.
