We made a last minute decision one morning to head to Cleveland for the night. We also wanted something fancier than what we normally have back home so we decided on Hyde Park.
I called and made a reservation for 5:00pm on a Saturday evening minutes before they were open. Score! We arrived on time and were seated promptly and politely. The only thing that we had a problem with was we waited well over ten minutes for a server to where I finally got up and asked what I think was the manager who apologized and got us someone.
I ordered lamb chops, brussel sprouts and a wedge salad. The wedge salad was amazing! I recommend it. My chops were a little overcooked but still very tasty. The brussel sprouts had hazelnuts in them, which was such a simple add in but it made all the difference in a new taste.
The boy got your regular chicken fingers and fries.
The spouse got calamari, which I may or may not have ate half of. It was hot and spicy and still very crispy. She also got the wedge salad and then a random side of mashed potatoes.
The manager was kind enough to get our son a little chocolate sundae on the house.
We loved our experience!
