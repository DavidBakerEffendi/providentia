Sunday brunch buffet with bottomless bloody mary, mimosas, champagne, soft drinks and coffee & tea was inexpensive and the food authentic Mexican kitchen.  I started with menudo then had cheese enchiladas, chile verde, rice, beans, guacamole, and the best ceviche.  Ended meal with delicious flan.  Very popular place so I would get there early.  Theresa and Joe are excellent owners who do not hesitate to pitch in to make sure everything is satisfactory to customers requests.  I plan to return often.  Had a jumbo strawberry margarita and 2 mimosas (excellent brand of champagne) with buffet so siesta time before I go to work.  I'm from Chicago and miss the neighborhood bar scene but this is a great place to drink, eat and hang out for great conversation with some of the regulars.
