First time here and it was amazingly good. So much to choose from with a full house. I came here for brunch and waited to be seated, the lady asked if I wanted a table or booth. It didn't really matter to me, so I politely told her witch ever comes first. I waited maby 10 mins before being seating, I thought there menus were really unique because it's made out of real newspapers giving it a different kind of style to it. Looking over the menu I order a organic spinach and feta cheese omelette with fruit and a blue bagel. Everything about this place so awesome, it didn't take long to get my food and the customer service was exquisite. I'm here for Long Jevity
