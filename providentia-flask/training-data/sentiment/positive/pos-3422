I do love Greenland.  I love the concessions on the outside.  Getting lunch before going in. Coming out of the grocery store to pick up a boba drink before going home.  Korean skin care and Japanese soft and moist pastries.  Purchasing already made dinner items and their bonchon items, except for kimchee.  My husband always wants to get the super oversized bottle but I have learned that lesson several years ago. Or marinated meats so my husband can grill.

Its just a great place to shop.  Wish it were closer to my home because I'd shop there all the time.

5-stars for this establishment and their fresh produce.
