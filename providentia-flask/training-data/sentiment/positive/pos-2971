I've had several items from the menu and it's all been good. This is a local run business. The stuffed pizzas are very good and what I'd recommend most here. They have individual pizzas ans larger ones and if you are ordering an appetizer then try the meatball sliders they are really good and the garlic knots they use for them are made fresh to order. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. Check the website or ask your server for a monthly calendar to see what specials are going on it's something different each day. inside there is a good sized dining area with tables, booths and there is a bar also. There is a door for the restaurant and for pick up orders but you can go in either one depending on what side of the building you park. If you do order garlic knots keep in mind they are best eaten fresh from the oven at the restaurant because the couple of times I ordered them to go they didn't taste the same when I got home. The pizza on the other hand tastes good even left over for lunch the next day.
