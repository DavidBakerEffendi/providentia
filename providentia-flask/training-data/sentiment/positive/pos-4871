Went here with a group of people for husbands birthday. Had never played cornhole before and it was so much fun. Lots of variety of games. Place gets really packed. Live band outside, Dj inside. Even have ice skating. Free games, free entry, but drinks are typical prices. Kind of disappointed they dont sell buckets since mostly groups go here. Just for 3 beers each for husband and i its almost $20 and whats 2 beers going to do. Staff here wasnt very friendly though. But overall great exp overall. Even have 24 hr grill and the food is good and its cheap. Would def. Recommend but only to people who like to have fun
