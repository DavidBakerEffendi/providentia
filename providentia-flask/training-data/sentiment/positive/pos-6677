One of the best fast food spots in town! Service is lightning speed and food comes out minutes after ordering. Food is always fresh and piping hot. I usually get the 5 piece tender meal w/ creamy garlic dipping sauce. Mmmmm, so good! 

You can order your chicken crispy or grilled, and they also have chicken sandwiches and salads. Get the new Greek salad! It's better than most Greek restaurants! Just sad they no longer sell their blueberry cole slaw!!
