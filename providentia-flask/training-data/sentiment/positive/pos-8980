Perhaps the best damn beer store in Lakewood! 

It is a deli only by name - this store is primarily beer and a little bit of wine (which has 0 impact on this review). This is by far the best and most expansive beer selection in Lakewood, there's well over 500 beers here, and about 100 available as singles: very important to me as someone who loves toz sample them. Most of them, but not all, are organized by type (with devoted sections to kombuchas and sours, natch) and it's about 50/50 of what's refrigerated and not refrigerated. Their selection is a little titled towards IPAs - not my cup of tea, but understandable, it's the long trend in the American beer scene. Their selection also goes into shabby ones like Mickey's, Hamm's, and Old Style..  

There's also dozen or 2 Belgian breweries... my only nit is that west coast USA items could be a bit more inclusive and their Belgian selection isn't as good as over the Lizardtown store. 

They also have growler and small jars (16oz) available as well to fill up one of their 6-7 choices on draft. You can even sample them 25 cents each. The fact that Rozi's has kegs and places to sit is their only advantage to Ross Deli. 

The younger gentleman answered my questions and wasn't obtrusive. Prices are extremely fair; I walked out with a dozen single beers under $40; and you certainly can spend triple that on the same quantity of beer. 

Carry on, my wayward son. I'll be back. I doubt that it's worth checking out Simone's or Cap n Corks again after visiting here.
