I thought the reviews were too good to be true but it lived up to its expectations! It's almost like boiling crab but the sauce is slightly different and the menu has more items here. 

It wasn't busy at all on a Sunday lunch and I honestly hope it's doesn't get busy like boiling crab. 

They have combos here to choose from and it's pretty reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I decided to do al la crate because I can literally eat 3 lbs of crawfish to myself and the combo didn't let you pick two of the same seafood. 

I ordered 3 lbs of crawfish and a Dungeness! We got the level spicy and It's honestly not THAT spicy if you can take heat. Im going to get smokin next time. The crawfish was pretty good frozen and they cooked my boyfriends crab perfect! When you cracked the shell, the meat still kept its shape! 

The sauce is really rich and buttery too! It's less oily than boiling crab which is a plus for me. Oh and the side of rice is pretty big. So I suggest you share it between two people. 

We also ordered calamari and it was okay. It was a little too salty for me and the meat was little. 

Other than that, I love this place! A great new addition to Vegas.
