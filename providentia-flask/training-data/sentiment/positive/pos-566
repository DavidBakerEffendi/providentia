So delicious! Their pho is traditional and tasty! Comes with all the goodies you would need to assemble your very own pho! 

The outside looks a little questionable but the inside is very clean and cute!

My order was ready right away and nice n hot. It was made exactly how I wanted it.

I will definitely be back to this place! The other menu items look promising! 

Yay!
