9/13/17 10:07 am. Wait 14 minutes. Wednesday. The slut was good but not phenomenal. There was problem with the cash register they had to Reboot it. No problem! I stood facing the manage and the cash register for 8 minutes, he never once raised his eyes to say: sorry, hello or good morning. I was invisible. Staff cashier was very nice but customer service ought to trickle down not up. Customer Service was promoted as a key value to their concept?
9/14/17 10:27 am. Wait 24 minutes Thursday A very friendly reception, I had the a Fairfax with bacon to go, bought a drink at Walgreens for $1.67. It was a five star experience and phenomenal. Review adjusted.
