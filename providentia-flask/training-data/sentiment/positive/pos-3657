So, I've been to Cibo three times and it's gotten better every time I went. 
My first time, I had the bruschetta, lamb meatballs, pear pizza and gelato - all delicious. It was November though and they seated us right beside a window, so it was a little cold for my taste. 
My second time going was on a double date. We each had a past entree and were not disappointed. At first, the portions looked way too small, but each one was filling and full of flavour. 
My last time going was just recently for my little sister's 18th birthday and we had a blast. We ordered the bruschetta, eggplant and buffalo mozzarella. The first two were amazing, but I found the mozzarella a bit lacking in flavour. As mains we had the pear and sun dried tomato pizza as well as an order of the gnocchi. The pizzas were crisp and light, and the gnocchi was crunchy with a bit of zesty tang! The waitstaff were amazing in wishing my sister well and they even brought us an extra birthday shot. Even when my mom returned a drink, they politely brought another drink to her without a question. 
I love Cibo, and I love being able to book a reservation on the OpenTable app and I will certainly be returning.
