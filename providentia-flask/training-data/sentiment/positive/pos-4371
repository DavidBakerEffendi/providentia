I brought my son to this restaurant with our dog and had an amazing experience with the wonderful & sweet waitress named Carol.  She was great with making and giving some great recommendations as well as treating the dog and my son very well.  She even let me know and I've been here several times but they have dog food for the dogs!! I never realized they have food for the dogs.  The dish I had was absolutely stupendous not to mention delicious & flavorful and  wow, healthy it was called charred lemon chicken and my son had the bison burger and it was excellent as well.  Thank you Carol and Lazy Dog Team.
