AWESOME!  

We came with a large party that unfortunately, the organizer of the event neglected to confirm a reservation.  So, when we all started entering, needless to say, the staff was a bit overwhelmed and at a loss as to what to do.  BUT, they immediately set up space for 25-30 people and called in reinforcements to provide quality service. 

I can't ask for more from a small business and I only hoped my large tipping told the staff exactly my appreciation!
