Not quick, but freshly cooked food. Great fish and chips and fried sides like the deep fried mushrooms and zucchini.

There's a little bit of outdoor seating available and no indoor seating. This is a mostly "to go" kind of place, and with gas prices as they are, you probably won't want to sit around in the drive thru waiting for your food with the car running.

Friendly employees, good food, and decent prices. It's no wonder this is a Phoenix area institution.

Be sure to bring cash. They don't accept credit cards and they don't accept checks.
