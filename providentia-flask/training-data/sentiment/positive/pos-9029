I used to work for Intelligentsia Coffee Shop part time when I lived in Chicago, and of course they have the best coffee in the world.  Sometimes I will order it from their website, but that can end up costing like 30 bucks or more per bag!  Ya know ... It is a major treat; maybe once or twice a year.

Welp, Yelp ... I don't have to worry about that anymore.  This place sells Intelligentsia by the cup or by the bag!  WOW! SCORE!  It is right on Roosevelt Row directly across from the 5th Street strip.  I was simply unable to leave the shop without trying a pastry (you'll see what I mean). The blackberry bran muffin was *absolute heaven*.  There goes the diet! (Thankfully they only had one left ... I hope they hide them tomorrow.)

Also wanted to mention that the gal working behind the counter was super bubbly and friendly even though she had been there since sunrise.  Chatting with her while waiting on my coffee to brew was kinda the icing on the cake ... hehe.  Thank you Tammy Coe Cakes - you have a new fan in the neighborhood.
