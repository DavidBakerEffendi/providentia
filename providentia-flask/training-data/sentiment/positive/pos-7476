I've been helped by Anna, Rowan, Tatum and Jack at this rustic coffee shop. Have never had a bad experience. They change out their beer taps frequently and have amazing coffee. The food is delicious too. All the staff is friendly and relaxed and always have tasteful music playing. 
THIS IS A MUST TRY DESTINATION!
