I know my coffee and Coffee Tree Roasters gets a 2 snaps and hands held high. I can't believe it took me so long to sample and fall in love with their coffee. 

I love Starbucks for their tea but Coffee Tree has a wide variety of freshly roasted beans and I've never had a bad cup here. Quite frankly, each new flavor of the day I try tends to get better and better. Some of my faves have been the Papua New Guinea, Sumatra and Vienna Roast. These are the medium roast varieties which serve my purpose of waking up well. I love how you can take in these flavors and easily differentiate the the variance in balance and strength.  The coffee is never bitter and tastes fresh regardless of when I visit. I also love the fact that they have the little stickers that cover the coffee lid hole---so cute and fun. 

It must be said that this place prides itself on freshly roasted beans.  If you want to brew your own at home, they have a huge menu for you to select from. There also are teas, coffees, chocolates and a gift section near the check out area.  It's a very cozy space and would be nice to catch up with a friend or two.  Keep in mind that the seating is limited here so you may need to wait for a table if you plan on enjoying their goodies in house. 

Be forewarned that their baked treats are to die for and they tempt you with samples on the counter. If you try a sample be prepared to have thoughts of sugarplums dancing in your head throughout the day along with wondering why you just didn't buy a whole piece of whatever you tasted.  

The service here is fast, efficient and friendly. Heck, I've been in a line back to the door with 1 worker at the counter who managed to serve everyone quickly.
