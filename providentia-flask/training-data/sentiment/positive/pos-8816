Really fantastic place. They're serving traditional American cuisine, nothing too crazy, but they're just executing it very, very well.  I had the B'L'T'A, probably the simplest thing on the menu, but it was great. And the sweet potato fries are noteworthy. Solid service. Clean, modern dining environment. Happy customer.
