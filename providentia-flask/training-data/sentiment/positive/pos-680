I personally love the style here ... Fun beachy and laid back. Quality food, I got the fried cod burger. Soooo good!! Perfectly done with a delicious bun, just the right amount of tartar sauce, lettuce and tomato. The sun kissed ice tea is also super yummy and unique to this restaurant I believe. The waitress is so nice and seems to know everyone here personally ... Which provides a very nice atmosphere. It feels like a small town in here ... Which can be nice. 
This is my first time and I will 100% be back. I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu!
