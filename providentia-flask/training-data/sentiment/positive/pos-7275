Delighted to have this Postino's in the neighborhood!! I know that when we go to any Postino's it's going to be a fun, relaxed, delicious wine kinda time.  And that's exactly what the Kierland location delivered!! 

I feel as though it had good energy & good vibes!
from the moment we walked in the hostess was warm & friendly.  As soon as we were seated a server named Monika came over and was more than happy to help me pick a glass of wine.  

I was able to Sample a few that she recommended
Couroulu  $11
Syrah-Merlot | 2012 | France 

Alba  $10
Cabernet Sauvignon | 2013 | Chile

Biutiful  $10
Sparkling Rose | NV | Spain
I HAD TO TRY THIS JUST BECAUSE OF THE NAME.  And I'm glad I did ! It was so delicious 

I ended up picking the Alba Cabernet very smooth and paired well with my meal which was the Butchers block. 

Butcher's Block  $14.50
An assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with asparagus, hummus, olives, nuts and crosti

Their food is constantly good ! Never had a bad experience at any of the locations. Kierland was no exception.  Everything was top notch!! 

Their artisan meats & cheeses are of high quality 
 and so is the customer service.  

Ryan & Monica were fantastic.  They made sure our glasses were not running low & our food was to our liking.  

The lighting is very dim to set a nice tone and the music was light & hip.

Very reasonable prices on all items ranging from $6.75 -$14.50.    kids meals are only $5 !! 

Happy hour $5 glasses and pitchers of beer from open till 5pm

We will most definitely be back & we wish them the best !!  

Cheers & enjoy !!
