My bf and I have been looking for a good breakfast place and I think we found it. This place was quick, and delicious. I knew that if it was the same management as egg and I it was going to be 5 stars and it held up to that expectation. The prices were reasonable and the plates were fairly big in portion. I am not a fan of banana nut muffins but the ones here are sooo good and warm! My only complaint is some of the workers aren't very friendly. The ladies at checkout clearly hate their job. However our server was fabulous. We will be back!
