Easy, quick, inexpensive bite to eat when in a hurry to your next JMSB class (or the metro).  It's in a very convenient location with an entrance directly inside the  JMSB building and the staff are friendly and helpful. It's modernized Armenian fare of the flat bread "pizzas" or lahmajoun.   They have veggie, halal and meat options and a modest list of additional topics toppings you can add. It's quite light and fresh, good for not falling asleep during class. Toppings include items such as olives, eggplant puree, tomatoes, lettuce, pickled turnips, and onions.  Don't expect to be stuffed by one "pizza" or you'll be disappointed, but consider it a better/healthier snack option than downing fries, doughnut or pastry.  Their dining area is clean and spacious even though their counter gives off more of a fast food vibe than caf√©.  They also have a little prepared snacks open fridge that you can pick up additional snacks to complement the food. Overall, one of the healthier quick bites around Concordia metro.
