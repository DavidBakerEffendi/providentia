Pickle Bills is my go to spot whenever I'm craving fresh seafood and a unique outdoor dining experience that makes me feel like I'm not in Ohio. The stuffed shrimp and muscles are both amazing. My boyfriend loves the seafood platter because it allows him to try a variety of foods in one meal. The key lime pie for dessert (if you have room in your tummy after the meal) is also a must!
