I love chicken, and this place knows how to make it! I came in with a friend in the middle of the day so it wasn't crowded and upon entering you see a register and the kitchen with the menu above. The cashier was friendly and helpful we ordered the lunch special (3 wings fries and a drink) under 9 dollars and a Cheesy Chicken Sandwhich which came with lettuce tomato blue Ribbon sauce and pickled cucumbers. The food was hot and fresh and tasted so good. The chicken has a fair amount of seasoning  and it's super crispy! I loved that sauce , and the ones they had on the table. Try dipping your chicken into the wasabi honey or chipotle honey those were my two favorites! I also prefer the smoked Mac and Cheese as a side and it was really good! I felt like the smoked flavor was bacon but that might just be me.The dining area is really bright and it reminds me of a farmhouse. Definitley stop by this place you will not be dissapointed.
