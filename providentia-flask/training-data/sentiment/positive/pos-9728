Started with escargot - in mushroom caps - dip the bread into the butter and garlic - my fav appetizer of all time! We had the Alaskan king crab legs with rice and vegis - which has to be one if the best meals money can buy. The expert waiter cracks the crab to perfection- leaving you to dip the very large and incredibly sweet crab meat into the melted butter - and experience a true feast! San Rimo shrimp dish is also excellent - both in appetizer or pasta dinner. Owner Richard Huie chatted with us and thanked us for coming on our way out. A wonderful experience that is always consistently excellent every time we dine at the Salt Cellar.  5 star all the way.
