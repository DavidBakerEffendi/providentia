Let's start with the extraordinary Bacon Bloody Mary I just had, it was perfect! The gluten free fried chicken was off the chain, moist with a crisp finish and packed with flavor...the bite of waffle I stole melted in my mouth. It's an adorable little spot with attentive and friendly staff. I am hooked!
