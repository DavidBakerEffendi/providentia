Didn't know this place existed until just recently, and I'm super glad a friend introduced it to me. The restaurant had its grand opening just a couple of days prior, so despite it being fairly busy, we were seated right away. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was great, and our food arrived quick. I ordered the mussels with potatoes in their recommended Captain's Boil sauce, which came in a big bag we ate out of with a bib and some gloves. It was absolutely delicious and the experience was extremely enjoyable! Although it was a bit pricey, I highly recommend giving this place a try! I've already made plans to go back again.
