I dig this place!  We had dinner somewhere else then decided to check-out Pint Central for after dinner beers and dessert.  The churro dessert was delicious and not too filling (In other words, it didn't make me feel bad about myself).  The bartender was friendly and knowledgable.  We can't wait to go back for dinner and trivia!
