Tonight, we went to 87 West for their 5 course food/wine pairing and it was amazingly delicious along with being a great deal.

The 5 courses were as follows:

1. Ahi Tuna with eel sauce and scallions on crispy chip paired with a sparkling riesling.

This was delicious. If it had been a snack on a party platter, I would've finished the whole platter by myself! The raw tuna tasted very fresh with the scallions and the eel sauce gave it sweetness that went great with the crispiness of the chip. 

2. Butternut squash bisque with granny smith apple paired with a chardonnay.

My favorite dish of the night. It was sweet with a slight nutmeg taste to it and it just tasted delicious. I enjoyed every bite of savory goodness.

3. Porchetta and potatoes with gorgonzola cheese paired with a combo red.

The fatty meat with the crispy skin was delicious, although more toward the center, the meat was dry. The potatoes were also awesome especially with the melt in your mouth cheese.

4. Stuffed shells with a meat sauce and spinach paired with a cabernet savignon.

This is was probably my least favorite dish of the night but it was still tasty. The red meat sauce had some spiciness to it that made it all the better, but compared to the other dishes, I felt it needed work.

5. Chocolate tart with black pepper (Yes! black pepper!) ice cream paired with a port.

This dessert was something different and in a good way. The chocolate tart had a dark chocolate cream/ganache on top with a crunchy chocolate cookie on the bottom. The black pepper ice cream was pretty much regular vanilla with pepper/salt sprinked over it which actually went over quite well.

All of this came for $35 a person! I know this isn't the normal menu, but I asked the server if this chef was the regular and he told me it was, so if that is the case, I would DEFINITELY come back to try what else he has to offer. Wonderful dinner and quite the deal too.
