I fell in love with their Panang Curry!  There's just something about the different spices that marry each other.  I've tried other Panang Curries in Vegas and by far Aranya is on point with the flavor and texture.

Today we ordered shrimp Pad Thai, beef Kung Pow, beef Garlic Sauce, and beef Panang Curry.  All were great dishes! Filled us up quick.  For dessert we had sticky rice with mango, one of my favorite Thai desserts on the menu.

The restaurant looks clean and well kept.  Service is fast and friendly.
