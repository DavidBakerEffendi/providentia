Love, love, love Paco's Tacos & Tequila. We always start off with the awesome guacamole, which they make at table side. I always get the combo so I can sample all the taco. Fish, shrimp, chicken and brisket tacos are spectacular.

The customary chips and salsa are a perfect mix of mild heat and saltiness and we have never had bad service. The waitstaff is very friendly and informative. Be sure to try the bar-b-que corn (have to ask for it). Its mouthwatering.

Big fan of Paco's and recommend it to everyone.
