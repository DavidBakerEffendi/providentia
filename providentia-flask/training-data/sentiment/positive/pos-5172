I met my friend here for a late lunch.  We got there just as the kitchen was closing for lunch, but they accommodated us.  

The service was really friendly and was just attentive enough to allow my friend and I some time to catch up without making us feel rushed.  We had asked for a white wine recommendation, and took the server's suggestion.  I wish I could remember what it was because she described her recommendation as a glass of sunshine, and it really did taste like one!  

My friend and I shared the pear salad to start.  It was delicious!  The presentation was beautiful, and we loved the sweet delicious balls of pear.  My friend had the clam linguine for her main.  I'm not a fan of clams, but she said it was very tasty, and it looked like there were lots of clams.  I had the buratta pizza.  It was the perfect size.  I loved that the buratta was added after, so it was a nice mix of cold and warm in my mouth.  The pizza dough was cooked perfectly (not soggy on the bottom like some wood fired pizza can be) and it was not over sauced!
