I see reviews ranging from 1-5 stars on this place from very credible sources, but I can only tell you about my personal experiences here. I am never disappointed when I come here.  I am so happy with the food here that I can just close my eyes, put my finger down on the menu and be happy with whatever I get.  

This review is for the downstairs lunch.

For starters we had the Lobster Bisque.  Nice and silky with lots of Lobster bits.

The Chef was offering the Negi Roll that day so we got that and a surf and turf.  Some people I know are not fans of the beef in the roll but I personally love the Tempura'd Beef.

For an entree I tried the Lobster Roll.  A nice Lobster Salad stuffed into a Bread roll.  

All washed down with a couple of bottles of Monchof Riesling.

We ended with the Ice Cream Name Game.  Never a disappointment.  We always try mixing different flavor combination afterward.

The staff super knowledgeable and super friendly, the restaurant is clean and the food leaves you satisfied with a clear conscience.  I'll be back later this week.
