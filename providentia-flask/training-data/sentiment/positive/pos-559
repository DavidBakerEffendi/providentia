I have been to this restaurant many times and always get the Iskender "must try" kabob. It is so delicious. They also have really great hummus and other appetizers. Beautiful ambience inside. Service is good, too. French fries (that my daughter gets) are good but used to be better and had a garlic and herb seasoning.
