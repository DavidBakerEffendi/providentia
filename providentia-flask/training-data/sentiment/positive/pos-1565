Russo's Pizza Kitchen!   Just recently they replaced their signage out front as Russo bought the place out.   Everything is still the same though!  I love the employees here.  It's got this small family feel that remembers who you are and genuinly want to take care of your pizza needs. 

I've come in here on a bad day not wanting to cook and he gave me half off the pizza just to brighten my day and cause i'm such a regular and have brought them business before.  The only thing i think they could do better is get all their stuff together as far as web address and online advertisement but often when i come in here their store is pretty full now.  So i'm REALLY happy to hear they're geting a steady flow of business. Anyway The pizza's great as everyones said and the i've had some pasta of theirs as well.  Love this place!
