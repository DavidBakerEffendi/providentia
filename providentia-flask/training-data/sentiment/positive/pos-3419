Came on a quiet weekday morning for breakfast, ordered the Fat Pasha with 2 fried eggs and was in a chill happy place full of deliciousness for the next hour. The room has lovely lamps and crazy old beloved diner vibe and good art. The waitress was friendly and calm and kind. The music was excellent. Most importantly the food was excellent. The Fat Pasha is creamy homemade hummus, pine nuts, and piles of sweet and spicy and crispy brussels sprouts and with toast and sunny side up eggs it was the perfect veggie breakfast. Heaven.
