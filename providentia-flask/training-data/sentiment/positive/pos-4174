RARE, SOLID 5/5 across the board. Pickering is unbelievably lucky to have Hibachi Grill. I would drive way out of the way to eat here. Sat in on a weekday evening with a friend. Ordered 1 app and 2 mains: the deep fried scallops, the hibachi grilled short ribs, and the hibachi steak, spicy chicken, and shrimp.

First of all the owner/server is the kindest, sweetest woman I have come across in my entire foodie career. Treats all customers with highest level of respect and service. Ask her for her recommendation if you are in between choices, she will happily help you out.

Secondly, the food was awesome. You are served a your protein of choice, grilled to perfection and seasoned just right. The short ribs had the signature Korean taste to them. The grilled steak was medium well done, in a savory sauce with grilled mushrooms. The spicy chicken... wow. No words. And the shrimp was my favorite! Had an amazing flavor, grilled to perfection. I could especially tell that the rice was fresh, and flavored with a delicious sauce.

But that's not all. They have amazeballs sauces and they are ALL good. The hot sauce is delicious and definitely has a kick! Not sure what the Yumyum sauce is made up of but it lives up to its name. All taste good on its own... but I dare you to try it mixed.

This place is such a gem! Within its restaurant category and considering the location, there is no other place like Hibachi Grill.
