RM Seafood at the Mandalay Bay is simply one of the finest seafood restaurants on the strip. Everything from the decor to the service to the food screams amazing! Below is a run down of what I tried/ordered and my opinion:

Apps:
Moondoogies: Essentially it's a corn dog but with shrimp and about 7x the price. From what I heard, these were created during an episode of TopChef. They were tasty and just right with the sauce served. 

Soup:
Green Garlic Soup with Dungeoness Crab: The garlic was not to powerful as to dominate the taste of the soup, but just right. Unfortunately, the taste of crab seemed to be lost. 

Entree: 
Fish&Chips: Yes.... I went to a high end seafood restaurant and ordered fish and chips.... Sue me. However, there is reason behind my madness. Generally I judge a restaurants food by the quality of their fish and chips. Now take a moment to think about it. If they take the time to prepare fish and chips properly (which normally most restaurants do not), the rest of the food should be superb. 

Needless to say, our fish and chips was nothing short of fantastic! It was by far the best fish and chips I have had at a high end dining establishment. From what my friends said, their meals were nothing short of amazing also.

Thanks Rick Moonen for an awesome meal! Until next time my friend.
