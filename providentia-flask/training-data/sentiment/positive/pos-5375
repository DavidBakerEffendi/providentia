My husband and I tried Everly last night - and we were impressed! We ordered the muscles and artichoke toast to start... both were fantastic. For dinner we ordered the salmon and butternut squash bowl and again... everything was delicious! The portions were generous, we were basically rolling out of the restaurant after licking every plate clean. The service was top-notch, we were there on one of their first nights open to the public, and our (very friendly!)server was extremely knowledgeable about the beer, wine and food. As former San Diegans, this California-style restaurant reminded us of our warmer days on the west coast. We will be back!!!
