the server totally gave us the happy hour prices on our first round even though we rolled in at like 19:01 which instantly wins my vote.  my wife was very pleased with how well lit and clean the whole place was, and the food was a cut above what you'd expect for a sports bar.  definitely going to try here again because the lunch specials look great!
