This is my first time having authentic Indian food and I was amazed at how the food tasted! I loved the fact that they were so adjusting to our different needs; i dont do spice very well and I was recommended the Butter Orange chicken (i dont remember if that is what its actually called) it was fantastic, the curry was not spicy but it had the spice flavourings yet it was sweet with an orange flavour. The Naan is definitely a worth it add-on to eat with the butter chicken. It was made fresh, and made by hand in store. The place is a little small, and for fine dinning, the service was wonderful- very pleasant server, we had great conversations with him through the meal. I hear the place gets pretty busy, but my friends and I had gone on a rainy day so it was a very quiet and intimate dinner we had. 
They had a very spacious washroom ( its is wheelchair accessible) it is a single men and women washroom rather than stalls.

Overall the restaurant gave had left me with a full stomach and a love for Indian food. Will definitely go back. 
(Sorry didnt take any pictures, we were starving and the food looked really yummy!)
