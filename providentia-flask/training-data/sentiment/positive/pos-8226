After a morning workout I was starving and did a search on best Breakfast Burrito in Chandler: Yoli's came in near the top and I had never heard of it.

I stopped in and met Yoli who walked me through the menu.  when I was indecisive between he carne asada or chorizio, she recommended a combo.  One word: AMAZING!  Fresh pico with jalapenos, light cheese, and marinated beef/sausage were a perfect combination.

The spot is well hidden (which may hurt in the long run), but the place is spotlessly clean and charmingly cute.  Asian chairs, black counter tops, and a warm feeling make this place my new breakfast place!
