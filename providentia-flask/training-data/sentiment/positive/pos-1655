Best Chinese food in the Valley!  I love their beef pies and usually get those first. I also think their beef in chili oil is delicious.   Another great one is Cumin Beef. Owner is extremely nice and always welcoming. Ive never been to China but Ive been told this is authentic northern Chinese food.
