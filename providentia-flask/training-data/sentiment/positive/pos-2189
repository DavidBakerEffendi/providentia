I'm not sure the exact reason why I'm craving to go back right now. Maybe it was the burger to bun ratio? Maybe it was the make your own burger concept with the toppings? Maybe it was those delicious perfectly cooked Cajun fries? Or maybe it was the peanuts.  I do know I will be back because I missed out on a shake!  In any case for a burger joint it gets my five stars for flavor, freshness and fast service.  Perfect for a cheat day or cure a hangover!
