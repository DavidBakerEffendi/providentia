I love CPK and Im not afraid to admit it. Favorite dish is the chopped salad..its tossed in dressing when it gets to you..and the perfect amount as it should be! None of this dressing on the side crap which I hate. They never give you enough and its impossible to mix it evenly.UGH.. pet peeve. Anyway, back to CPK..great variety of pizzas if you're into foo foo pizzas like Ham & swiss, scampi, BLT, etc.. Ive never been disappointed.
