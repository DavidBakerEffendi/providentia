This may be the best gelato place I've ever been to! The owner is always there welcoming us into the store, offering us to try his newest flavors. And let's talk about his gelato flavors; amazing concoctions that you don't see everyday that change every time we're in! The last time I was there I had sweet potato and caramel gelato and a chocolate gelato that had a lovely heat from a pepper. So amazing! If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out!
