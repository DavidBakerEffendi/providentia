Absolutely amazing chinese food! There has been nothing on the menu that I have not been in love with. For a real treat, order your take out at the bar (or eat in) and have Connie make you a drink! Highly recommend her mai tais, or if you aren't flying solo, the volcano. Have a DD if you plan on having more than I drink!

I would recommend: General Tso's chicken, pork fried rice, egg foo young, wonton soup, and crab rangoon!

Service is fast, friendly, and they make you feel like a valued customer. I keep venturing out to other places, and come right back! King Wah is my home base for delicious chinese food! Highly recommend!
