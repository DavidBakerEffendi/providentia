I brought my girlfriend to Fred's Not Here for the first time after the Jays' game. Located just across the street from the TIFF Bell Lightbox, and only a 10 minute walk from the Rogers Centre.

Our waiter, Andrew, was friendly and sociable not only with us but with everyone he served. Definitely a likeable personality.

Food was served timely and prepared well. We started with a delightful crab and lobster soup with baked puff pastry served over top. For our mains we ordered the New York strip loin (considering that they are a steak house, we had to try) and the halibut. The steak was great and the fries were full of flavoured goodness. The halibut was beautifully plated and the blend of flavours was delicious and memorable.

We were quite full afterwards so sadly we passed on the dessert :(

Overall we enjoyed our experience. We would definitely consider returning if we're in the area again.
