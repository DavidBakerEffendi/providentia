I find myself going here a lot, and for good reason. 

Car Wash 
 I used to think that getting a car wash in the metro Phoenix area required up selling and buying detailing services or getting your wind shield repaired, etc. At Tom's they just ask you what service you want. What a novel concept, no commissioned sales people.  They have comfortable sitting areas both inside and outside. The dudes drying and spiffing up the car are diligent and do a great job. 

Gas
What else can be said. The gas is about 10 cents cheaper than the surrounding gas stations.

Store
This place has everything that a convenience store would have and more (sorry if that sounded like a TV Pitchman). They have a lot of gourmet type items, dog food, magazines, beer, ice cream, chips, car accessories, etc. You get the idea, something for everyone. The restrooms are always clean.

Bistro
You're not going to believe this, but they have a bistro that always seems to be packed during the lunch and dinner hours. I have had their BBQ, and I definitely can say it's the best in Scottsdale. They have a pretty diverse menu such as tacos, soup, bbq pork sandwich, cubano sandwich, breakfast stuff, etc.

Summary
Don't take my word for it. Try this place out for yourself and you'll realize that I have just scratched the surface with this review of all that Tom's Thumb has to offer.
