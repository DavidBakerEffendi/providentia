I typically get pulled pork Burritos wherever I go and this is simply the best I've had, and I've been to Burrito Boyz and Fat Bastard and all those other joints.  My wife had the Kung Pao Chicken special Burrito (yep, you read that right) and said "I won't be able to eat Burritos anywhere else now".

The price is more than fair and the Burrito was massive.  Definitely try the noodles over the rice, it works really well.  Lots of flavour and just the right kick, which they let you choose.  Get ready to get messy though, definitely a juicy Burrito.

We ate in but usually you're going to want to do take-out, it's a small place with only two seats.  Don't be fooled by the lack of physical line up when you go, lots of people call their orders in ahead.  We waited about 15 mins for our order due to all the pick-ups.  

$22 for two very big, creative and yummy Burritos and two Blood Orange San Pellegrino's. 

Definitely will be back.
