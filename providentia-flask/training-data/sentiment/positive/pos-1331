Lunch price is pretty fair during the week. $25.99 for a pretty great buffet. 

The standard salad bar is provided, but not as many toppings offered here than other buffets. 

They have the usual pizza, about 3 different choices. They have 3 different pastas, and a ton of bread and butter. 

Glad to see a sushi section. Only rolls for lunch, they later bring salmon and tuna sashimi for dinner (3:30 pm). There is also miso soup, shrimp cocktail and pre-made salads. 

Pesto mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, and finally the crab arrives for dinner!

The best part... Dessert. Almost everything was excellent... Except the chocolate domes and carrot cake. 

I just wish there was a little more variety here. The quality is very good for a buffet, but not excellent. I would come back hands down!
