Went to Chef Bens tonight for the first time. Wanted to get some sushi and some appetizers to go and this is close to my house so I gave it a try. When you walk into this place it reminds you of a typical Asian food express restaurant, but the sushi is what sets them apart. They have an extensive sushi menu and you will not be disappointed. I ordered the salmon sashimi, some nigiri, the big four roll, a salmon roll and crab puffs. The lady that took my order was very patient with me and helpful. She pointed out that one of the rolls I ordered and the crab puffs were on a happy hour special that came with a soup or salad. I placed my order and waited maybe 6 minutes before they were calling my name and handing me my food! The lady who handed me my order let me know they even gave me a free order of egg rolls! When I got home my husband and I started eating and we were so excited because everything was delicious! The salmon was fresh and the sushi rice was perfect. We will definitely be back again!
