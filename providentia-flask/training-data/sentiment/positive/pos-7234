This was excellent; we had a tip to give the chef an amount of money per person and any no-nos; three of us did so and had a lovely meal with beer for 70 dollars each; more than enough food-you could of done 50 and been satisfied.  Best value for the $ in all the places I went to.  Nice service again and the chef was bang on to our whats (and nots).   Highly recommended; i give few 5 stars.
