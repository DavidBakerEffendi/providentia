We have been here three times now. I always get the ribs (dry rub) with barbecue on the side. The people who work here are encouraged to make their customers feel special. Last time green tea shots and this time rum bread pudding and ice cream with berries for dessert. It is always great service! Thank you Elizabeth for making us feel comfortable and special! You have a warm smile and grace in what you do! 3rd time pleased!
