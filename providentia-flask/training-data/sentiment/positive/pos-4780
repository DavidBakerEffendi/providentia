I've only stayed here once and I have to admit it was after driving 10 hours to get here so my review of the room/bed should be understood that I would have sleep on a bed full of glass and would have been just as comfortable but that being said it was a very peaceful nights rest and my father and I awoke full of energy and ready to haul my belongings up three floors to my Apartment.  (**the beds and sheets were very clean and comfortable) 

The check in process was painless, they recognized two weary travelers and didn't try to sell us on the features of the hotel or the events going on that day and it was most appreciated.  The checkout process was just as easy with a simple signature.  

We were a little more enthusiastic in the morning and we toured the gaming floor and were amazed at how large the Bass pro shop was; We've been to two others and didn't expect to see a full retail store attached to a casino like this.  I remember looking at my father and saying, its going to be real nice living this close to a bass pro shop.  

I've yet shop in the store but I have returned to the Casino on a number of occasions for festivals etc.  I have always had a great time here and have yet to find anything negative to say about my time here.  If you are a local looking for a nice break from the strip this is a great place to stay!
