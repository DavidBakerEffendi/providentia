When it comes to fast Greek food I'm not sure you can find any better.    When you combine the "express" restaurant with the feel of a local dive bar (and an actual small bar to boot) you have a winning combination .

I've eaten at My Greek twice in the past 3 days.    The gyro platter is a ton of food for the money.   I also had the garlic hummus.   It was excellent!   The pita bread is tasty and toasted perfectly.    Finally, I had a gyro meat sandwich the other night (forgot the name) that was spectacular.   It was between toasted bread and had a couple slices of bacon included.   Just fantastic. 

I highly recommend giving this establishment a try.
