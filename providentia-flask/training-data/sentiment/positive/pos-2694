I had the basil chicken level 5 and chicken lettuce wraps.  Next time I'll go down a spice on the basil chicken.  Excellent spices and very fresh ingredients.  Nobody does the chicken lettuce cups like Pan Asian.  Even though this was a to go order, the presentation is always beautiful- thank you Mr Wong and family!
