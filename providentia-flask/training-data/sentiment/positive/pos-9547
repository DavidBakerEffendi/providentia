The pinnacle of my Madison Pizza experience. Once my wife and I discovered Salvatore's that became our go to Pizza joint until we moved to Santa Cruz, CA. 

Typical pick-up order experience. Place order, head over early, order a beer to drink at the bar wait for the pizza to finish. Hang out for a bit. Front staff is super friendly and chill. Helpful & courteous. Choose a 6 pack to-go (not sure if they are still doing this, but they were when I was there), grab the Za and go!  

My wife and I dined in a couple times, quaint dining area. Enjoyable. When it is nice outside they will get the tables going out on the sidewalk. 

The gluten free crust is amazing, don't let this crust pass you by, topped with the works, deluxe style, always. Their sausage, pepperoni, veggies, are all extremely high quality. The pizza is enough for two to share. 

Morel mushroom pizza is, well, the best pizza I've ever had in my life. I will miss that pizza, a lot.

Thanks for the great memories. :)
