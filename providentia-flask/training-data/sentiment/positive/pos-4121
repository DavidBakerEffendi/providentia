Honestly, I don't get the 3.5 star rating on this place. This place is literally right up the street from where I live and I've been meaning to try this place forever!

In fact, I've only tried these type of pizza places twice before and been wildly unimpressed both times. We tried Novicento on Eastern years back (it has since closed) and 800 Degrees in the SLS Casino. Meh on both.

This place is different though. At PizzaRev..

a) they were friendly
b) they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings
c) they had one of those awesome Coke machines with all the flavors (I fucking love those things!)
d) they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings

Did I mention that they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings?? This was awesome and the result was a filling, tasty, and satisfying pie! 

I simply added pineapple and grilled chicken to my pie while my friend added sausage, ham, pepperoni, and feta cheese to his. We were both impressed with both the fresh flavor of the toppings in addition to the generous amounts added. 

Not only that, but unlimited toppings is just $7.99 a pie! Sweet! I can go for that!

I really like this place and I will DEFINITELY be back for more!

5 stars.

Fuck yea!
