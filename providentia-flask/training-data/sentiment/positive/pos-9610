6 of us went on a Friday night at 8pm.  We were the only 6 people in there.  It's too bad the locations doesn't bring in enough people.  Our bill was $70 for my wife and myself.  The service was good and quick.  Combined we had beef, chicken, pork, shrimp and scallops.  They are really good about letting split up your choices of meats.  The also let us split our choices in mushrooms with 2 different ones while charging us just for 1 side.  Unlimited veggies, rice and noodles.  The are 3 different dipping sauces.  Alone they are great.  Even better when combined (sesame peanut mixed with the spicy was awesome).

I don't write many reviews but felt compelled to because this place deserves a lot more business.  The restaurant was clean and I have nothing to complain about.  We also had a beer, green tea and ice cream in our $70 bill.

This was also my first time trying Shabu Shabu style dining.  I strongly recommend giving this a try.  The way the dining experience is setup, it is a great place to socialize to have a fun date night out.

Thanks.
