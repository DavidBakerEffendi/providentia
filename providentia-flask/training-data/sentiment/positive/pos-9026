This is without a doubt my fave new izakaya place! The flavour of everything we had was amazing and the spices added great zest to all the dishes! They have nice seating options of either a wrap around wooden bench or various tables. They offer drinks specials where they have sake and option for liter beer draughts which pair nicely with each meal. The sashimi are amazing! service was very fast and friendly. Definitely will return soon
