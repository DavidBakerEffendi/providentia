I adore this place. The service is excellent, sooo friendly every time! The food has me stuffed, and yet I find myself placing one order to go before I leave... Just in case I'm hungry later... Extra guacamole please. I've tried the fish tacos and all of their sides. The refried beans are the best I've had, I'm fairly certain I could eat a plate of only refried beans here. I also ordered (and regret not taking a picture) the daily special, which was chipotle meatballs and sides. It was awesome. If you're unsure what to order ask the staff- I haven't been steered wrong.
