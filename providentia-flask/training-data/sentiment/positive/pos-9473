Awesome pizza! Stopped by yesterday after reading such great reviews and was definitely impressed. I ordered a small pepperoni supreme and it was delicious. The ingredients proved their authenticity from the first bite. One of the best pizzas I have had in Charlotte. 

The only thing keeping Pure Pizza from being one of my regular lunch spots is the price. My small 10" pizza was $11.95; with a can of Coke my total came out to a little over $14. Worth the money, just not on a weekly basis for me.
