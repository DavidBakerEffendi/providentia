This is my  all time favorite pizza restaurant.  The food is so good and the servings are huge.  There is a large variety of pizza toppings - something for everyone.  If you don't want the pizzas on the menu, they will custom make one for you.  The service is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable.  Also, the wedge salad is the best you will find any place and it is only $4.50.  Great for kids - my granddaughters insist on going here when they come to visit.  I highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen.
