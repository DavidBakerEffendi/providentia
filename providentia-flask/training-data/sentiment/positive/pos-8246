I'm going to New Orleans next month and as I drove by their location I instantly made a beeline for it. I wasn't disappointed. I had a fried shrimp po'boy. Soft bread, perfectly cooked shrimp and a tasty sauce are a deadly combination. Initially, I was going to stop there, until a plate of fresh beignets passed by my table. I impulsively ordered my own batch. They are large, fresh and generously sprinkled with powdered sugar. So, so, SO GOOD! I even had one with my coffee the next morning. It was still delicious. Good service, a friendly atmosphere and delicious food makes me returning a matter of when, not if.
