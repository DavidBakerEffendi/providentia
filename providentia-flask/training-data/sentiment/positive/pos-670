Ate here twice for Sunday brunch. The food is excellent. The portion size is right for the price and the presentation is colorful and fresh! The atmosphere is simple and clean and very pleasant. The menu consist of a variety of salads, sandwiches, pastas and grilled cheeses! It truly represents it's name because pears are in a lot of the dishes and offers what a classical bistro would sell. To top everything all off they brew there own speciality iced teas....oh ya and the service is excellent as well!
