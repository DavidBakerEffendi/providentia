Everytime my mom visits (celiac disease) this is priority #1 to go eat at. I've been there probably 6 times, a few with my mom and few with just my boyfriend. I love that the ENTIRE kitchen is gluten free so you don't have to worry about cross contamination. I always get the grilled cheese which you could never guess was gluten free and some french fries (OMG so good). 

My mom orders the waffles there because their syrup is literally the best syrup I have ever tasted. It's a buttermilk syrup that is very sweet so you don't need to use a ton of it. My boyfriend springs for the chicken and waffles which has the buttermilk syrup but also fried chicken on top. You will never miss "glutened" fried chicken again! 

The wait staff when we went has always been on top of it (we come at off hours, never at exactly noon). Their hours recently changed, as noted by a sign on their door, so I will call ahead if I plan to come very early or very late in case things change or special events go on. It's definitely worth it to come and visit and especially if you have celiac disease, you will be in HEAVEN! The price also is extremely affordable, I might even say cheap. For two people for lunch we only spent about $20 (no drinks, just entrees but free water). I think that's a great value and there's also a bakery to order cupcakes and brownies.... yummmm!
