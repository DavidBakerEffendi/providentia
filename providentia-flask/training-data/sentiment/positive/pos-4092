The food was delicious here and the service was great. I ordered the potatoes and eggplant dish and it was sweet and tasted great! We also had the stir fry pork intestine (their special) and it was sooooo good. I would recommend these two dishes. We also ordered the cold jelly salad dish and did not really like it though.
