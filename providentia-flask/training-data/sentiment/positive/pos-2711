The wife and I tried this buffet for the first time. We are locals (20% discount). This is a great seafood buffet. It has an amazing assortment of seafood and fish, that you will not find anywhere else. Crabs legs were succulent, shrimp and mussels tasted very fresh. But my favorites were the cooked lobster tails and tiger shrimp, the NE clam chowder, the shrimp and grits. All very tasty. Even their dessert assortment was very delicious with blueberry cheesecake ice cream and eclairs that really tasted chocolatey. They also have $3-$4 drink specials. I do not agree with some of the so-so reviews about this place. You are NOT going to get all you can eat lobster tails like in an expensive restaurant ad pay only $40. Even the ambiance of this buffet was very enjoyable with low ceilings to make it cozier. This is definitely my new favorite buffet and my goto when I crave crab legs or seafood.
