I've dined here probably 15-20 times since my coworkers love this place, it's close to work, and they have good lunch specials. I'm happy with everything I've ordered except the fresh spring rolls with Chinese sausage. I would not order that again.

Their lunch specials all come with their soup of the day, a fried spring roll, and a fried wonton. I've finished their lunch specials except for their Pad Thai. It's a huge serving, enough for two or three people. I like to eat Pad Thai with jalape√±os for an extra spicy kick. Spicy basil with ground beef or fried tofu is another favorite of mine.

Their non-lunch choices- Pad Prik King, Rad Nar, Panang curry, red curry are wonderful choices too.

Tip-They are closed on Tuesdays which I thought was a weird day to be closed.
