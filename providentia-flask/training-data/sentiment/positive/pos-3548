When booking a hotel for one night in Vegas I used name your own price on priceline.  I was really hoping to get The Venetian but never thought I would.  Too my surprise we actually got it!!!  We only paid $109 for the night and that is WELL worth it.  My husband and kiddos had never seen it before and loved the architecture/decor.  The gondola ride is fun but expensive.  The rooms are nice and the size is great.  The staff was great about helping us to navigate where we were going, and were very helpful when I wanted a Dr Pepper even telling me where to go outside the hotel to get it cheaper.  We also loved that they had a little treasure hunt for the kids where at the end they get a cup of gelato.  This place is great and we highly recommend it.
