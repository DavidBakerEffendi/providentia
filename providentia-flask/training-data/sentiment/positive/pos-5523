What can I say about one of the few places on the strip that has KING CRAB LEGS FRIDAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY! It's the best buffet as far as I'm concerned and there's a bar that's do conveniently right next to the buffet for mixed drinks or anything your hearts desire price is so reasonable and the wait was minimal
