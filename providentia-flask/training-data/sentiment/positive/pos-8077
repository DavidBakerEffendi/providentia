The owner is a client of mine, otherwise I never would have tried it. I was impressed with him the day he went in, tried all the yogurt and threw out a whole batch for being too runny, and it would have passed my quality test. They are obsessed with quality and outdoing the competition, I will always go here before the other g-spoon or serve yourself yogurt places and recommend them whole heartedly. People dig on the red velvet cake, but that's not me, I prefer the pomegranate with fresh blueberries over the top. Where do they get those fresh fruits year round?
