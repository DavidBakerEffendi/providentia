Never thought I'd write a gushing review for a cafe inside a furniture store, which is inside a mall, but hey, that's why Yelp has the "firsts" category :)

The place is a great little gem, with a good variety of food (great tasting food - tried a few different things), attentive service, and a very cozy atmosphere. 

The portions are very generous, and the coffee tastes great - I know I'll be coming back, a lot.
