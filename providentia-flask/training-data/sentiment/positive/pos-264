Had the rose (which was $5! What the world?) and the chicken and dumplings which were phenomenal! I've never had chicken and dumplings with so much Rich non-overwhelming flavor before!  Can't wait to go back! My friend got a salad and it smelled so fresh! Great spot! Wonderful environment and fabulous service
