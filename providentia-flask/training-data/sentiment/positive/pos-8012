AMAZING! Came here at 8:30 on a Wednesday night for my birthday dinner in Vegas. I wish I remembered our serves name but he was excellent. Super informative on the menu. I ordered a dirty martini and my friend their cucumber cocktail. My martini was perfect but my friends cucumber cocktail was delicious!! Due to going out after dinner that night I didn't want to stuff myself so I ordered only the Yamato roll and an order of salmon sashimi. I was between the El Topo roll and the Yamato, my server suggested the Yamato even though their El Topo is a trademarked roll that has a great following. The Yamato roll consists of tuna, foie gras, caviar and gold leaf...it was DELICIOUS. Best sushi roll I've ever had and further more one of the best things I've had to eat. My friend had another roll I can't recall the name of (consisted of crab and shrimp) but she loved hers as well..and that is coming from someone who's only had a veggie sushi roll one other time and was very skeptical ordering it. For dessert they brought me out a mango ice cream cake pop looking dessert with a candle lit up, on the house!!! So nice of them to do that for my birthday. The manager came over to us and every table to check to see how everything was. Without a doubt I will be back here for the great service, AMAZING food and perfect atmosphere of trendy but not stuffy. Thanks for making my birthday dinner great Sushisamba!!!
