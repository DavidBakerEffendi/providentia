Hands down the best soup in Toronto.

I've brought numerous people here with different palettes and every single person has absolutely fallen in love. The wraps are crispy on the outside and super flavorful and savory on the inside. The soups are all bursting with flavor right until the last spoonful.

Fav soups: Ravistew, Shrimp bisque, Butternut squash

Fav wraps: Flank Steak, Free Range Chicken, Vegetable

Highly recommended! Go! Go now!

...just do it ;)
