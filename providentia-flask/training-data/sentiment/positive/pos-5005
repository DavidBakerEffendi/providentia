I guess this is what they mean when they say 'diamond in the rough'

Who would have thought that the Palms would have one of the best steakhouses in town. Tucked way in the back corner, N9NE is a trendy chic spot that alot of people I bet over look. The place doesn't look anything like a traditional steak house, instead its dark, accented by stainless steel to give a sleek modern feel to it. They have a DJ on occasion and the restaurant really exudes a hip chic feel that most other steakhouses are devoid of. 

I've been to N9NE a couple times over the years and never have I been disappointed. I stand by the place when I can say it has the best filet in town. It is always grilled to exact specifications. If you ask for medium rare, you get medium rare, which unfortunately isn't something I can say about many of the other places in town. The Bearnaise that accompanied it is outstanding as well.  

Also worth checking out is the fire chicken. It succulent, juicy and cooked to perfection. The spicy glaze and jalapenos really add a great kick to it as well. Finish it off with a slice of NY cheesecake or the banana cream pie.
