Out with one of my good friends - wondering where to go & thankfully our wandering took us here. I hadn't been to CF for awhile & had only gotten take out,  so ran in & out at lunchtime. Thankfully we got to go in, relax, enjoy the beautiful atmosphere & delicious food. We were greeted & promptly seated. The chairs comfortable, something I don't normally notice, cause most restaurant chairs aren't anything to write home about, but that was the start to a great experience. Comfort. Attentive service with a smile & knowledgeable staff. And I hadn't even eaten yet! We order the avocado fries (really!) with a wonderful dipping sauce, those disappeared quickly then we got our meals.  My friend got asada tacos & I got the Cuban inspired sandwich. My friend really liked her tacos, but was feeling the rice & beans were lacking. Can't please everyone & honestly we're pretty hard core about our mexican food. However my plate was absolutely delicious!  Cuban inspired, taken upwards. The bread was soft &perfect. Towering with meat & served with a side of tostones. What I loved is that this wasn't fluffed with fillers i.e., lettuce tomatoes,etc. And there no french fries. On the side because they're in the sandwich... Wonderful! My photo does it no justice. Everyone should try this & plan on taking some home for a late night snack, it's a lot of food. My waiter was awesome because he got a Dr Pepper for me (it wasn't on the menu) above & beyond service! I'm a fan.  We will be back with a crowd because I love taking people to wonderful places I've been so they can experience it too. Bonus, easy parking & its free.
