Pack up your stuff & come get your food!

The food is amazing. The staff is amazing. I love this place. I think I found a new regular food spot.

It's basically the stir-fry version of Chipotle. You get to pick a number and start ordering. They offer five different noodle options including zoodles (super great for a healthier/vegetarian option). You travel through the process of picking veggies, protein, and sauce. I would list everything I opted-in for...but I pretty much jam packed my dish with every keto-friendly option I could get.

The cooking process was very quick and efficient. Everyone I had the chance to interact with was extremely pleasant and welcoming. That's not something you see every day and I definitely appreciate it. The staff even checked on us multiple times while we were eating (it's more of a grab and go place so that stood out a lot). 

There are great options aside from stir fry like garlic edamame, pot stickers, even sriracha fries! YUM. 

The great food, clean dining area, and amazing staff surely make StirFry Republic a 5-star experience.
