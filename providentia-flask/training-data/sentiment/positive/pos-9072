Poutine: thick and rich peppery gravy , crisp french fries and appropriate cheese. The poutine vegetarienne is excellent also, but the traditional poutine will do just fine. 

This is the best poutine in Montreal, right ahead of Poutine Lafleur in Verdun. Born and raised in Quebec, whenever I visit this is the ONE poutine that I want to go to again. And always do. Darn it, now I want one and I'm 600 miles away. Please christmas break, come faster.
