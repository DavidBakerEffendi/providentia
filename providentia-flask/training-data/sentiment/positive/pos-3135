I've been to Ginger Monkey about 5 times since their soft opening. The wait is hit or miss. Sometimes it's really crowded (avoid coming on days Hamilton High school has football games) and about a 45 minute wait and sometimes it's pretty slow.
 I love the location and it has a lot to offer to the south chandler area because there is not a restaurant/bar anything like this place. There are several TVs to watch sports games. There is a nice big relaxing patio. There is an area on the patio that is dog friendly. There is a pool table and other games available. They have a big bar if you want to lounge around and grab some drinks. This place is adult and kid friendly.
A few people I know have had negative comments about the wait or how slow the waiters are with bringing food. I only bring this up to warn you not to walk in here hangry. 
This place has only been open a couple months and I give big props to the owners Jackson and Doug. They are very involved at the restaurant. Every time I've been there I see them helping and running around. Always very friendly and welcoming too. 
As for the food, gotta try their wings! My favorite is the Jack'd flavor. It sounds like it's spicy but it is actually more sweet. It is made with Jack Daniel's. The mac and cheese is good too. It's pretty spicy though. 
I will definitely be back.
