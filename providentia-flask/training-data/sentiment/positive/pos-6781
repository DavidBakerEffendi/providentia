This place is really packed in the mornings so we ended up getting a late brunch and were seated right away. They have a huge menu that'll satisfy just about any craving you may have. I got their Sundance Omelette, which was very well prepared with just enough of everything. It had artichokes, spinach, mushrooms, chicken, tomatoes and cheese! And all tasted delicious! Girlfriend got an eggs Benny as usual and enjoyed it, nothing crazy special, but it tasted good. Overall good experience
