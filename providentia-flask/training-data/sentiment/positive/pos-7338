This is the first time i've ever been to this place,and it sure as hell wont be the last :).They have everything you could want here from ramen,to chilli paste,drinks,frozen foods,and ofcouse SNACKS!!! They have the nicest erray here besides nakata japan.And the people in there are actually nice unlike some of the other supermarkets in china town.But back to the snacks,I could be in those 2 isles for a half an hour just looking at them :) I got a few things wich i will post later,so far everything is good! I'd defently recommend this to friends.
