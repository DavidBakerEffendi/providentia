This is fusion cuisine at its finest! We loved everything we ate. Our server was wonderful at helping us decide and telling us what each dish/drink was about. Their cocktails are phenomenal. If you are looking for traditional sushi/sashimi, this is definitely not the place to go, however if you are willing to try some new and innovative cuisine, this is great! The ambiance is dark, in a romantic way. However, I was disappointed when I asked to sit by the bar. My favorite reason to sit by the bar in sushi joints is to watch the sushi chefs at work. However, the way it is set up, there is a barrier, and there's not much to see. That was the only disappointing part of it.
