Why is a decent salad so hard to find in Las Vegas? Perhaps salad is to Vegas as kryptonite is to Superman; I can not tell you how many nights I am driving around thinking: "Man, I would love a good salad." (This is not an invitation for salad jokes. I am serious.)

Following some research, my first trip to the Peppermill was actually in search of a good salad, but every subsequent trip has been for the rather special ambiance. The salads are impressive: huge, fresh, and creative for a diner-type joint. Plus, in my experience, they grill up the most perfect chicken breast. Still, even if the salads were iceberg blah, I would have to make the occasional Peppermill journey to savor the fabulous interior complete with artificial cherry tree grove. Yes, it is best described as a grove. From the booths to the blossoms, you definitely feel as if you are experiencing something best described as Vintage Vegas as the place opened in 1972. The friendly servers in their equally vintage uniforms complete the experience nicely.

In addition to salads, the Peppermill does dessert and dessert-inspired cocktails well. They have an oatmeal cookie drink that tastes 100% like an oatmeal cookie. Even if you are not hungry, who can pass up that concoction? Even better, you can sip on your cookie in The Fireside Lounge located in the back of the restaurant. It features, and I quote, a "romantic flaming pool", and hot pink is the design scheme. Might as well call it "heaven".

Insiders tell me that around 5am is when the best people watching occurs, but if you can't find an excuse to go at 5am, you should still find an excuse to go sometime.
