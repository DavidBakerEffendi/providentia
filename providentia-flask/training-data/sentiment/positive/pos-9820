My 100th review!

In N Out is consistently amazing. I was craving In N Out on my 9 hour trip from San Francisco and they didn't disappoint. I arrived and one of the most satisfying meals ever. Double Double with animal fries... oh yes. Amazing.

Now that I'm back on the east coast I will continue with my In N Out withdrawls.
