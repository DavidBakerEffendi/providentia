Visited on a whim while looking for Polish Boys. I'm glad we found this instead. Each order is a slip where you can choose unique and delicious toppings for a burger or quarter pound hot dog. What's incredible is that all hit dogs are $6, regardless of topping quantity.

I got a dog with pimento mac n cheese, marinated cremini mushrooms, cheddar cheese, top secret fry sauce, bourbon pork-n-beans and bacon-spiked southern-style greens. Basically a hot dog topped with a soul food kitchen. Every ingredient was savory and delicious. Easily top of the list in my hot dog eating experiences.

Ye olde girlfriend got a dog with spaghetti-os and cole slaw. The cole slaw had a bit of kick to it and the spaghetti-os gave a unique richness to the dish.

We also got a side of tots with BBQ dust and 3 dipping sauces. The homemade ketchup tastes like it was sweetened with applesauce, a welcome change from the common ketchups. This was my favorite. The top secret fry sauce and porter honey mustard were good too.

As a bonus, I was able to score a cream ale for $2. Bottom line: if you swing by Cleveland, don't miss this place.
