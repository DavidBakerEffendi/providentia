Love this place! Can't say enough great things about it. My friends and I had excellent service, drinks, food, and fun! The decor is gorgeous. Can't wait to come back and enjoy their happy hour. The bar looks like a great place to relax and converse with friends. 

I highly recommend the emerald drink. Yum!
