Chilaca, Campechano, shrimp, fish, chorizo, pastor I've tried it all and it's just simply great! Big bang for the buck. What all the tourists don't know is that this is where it's at, not sure why people are flocking to Seven Lives. 

The tacos are stuffed to brim so prepare for a bit of a messy experience but so worth it at $15 bucks for 3 tacos, which can easily feed 2 leaving you satisfied but not too stuffed. I love that they come with hot sauces with varying degrees of spice (beware of overloading) and if you're lucky at the right time, you may score extra roasted peppers/veggies, lime on the side counter to add in yourself or even a seat to sit at the back. They do open a back patio in the warmer months making it easier to get a spot. Don't expect it to be a place you would want to bring a large group to hang though, it's more in and out. 

Chilaca is their signature dish, a taco with stuffed cheesey pepper, your choice of meat, a crowd fav and a must try if it's your first time. Campechano a decent choice with a mix of meats and cheese. I definitely like the $5 tacos better with a mix of veggies and meat (fish is my fav). If you want an even cheaper way to fill yourself up, multiples of chorizo or pastor tacos are a bargain. Shrimp was probably the least favourite of them all given it was a bit blander than the rest in terms of flavour. 

This is located inside a shared shop along with other food counters all with Latin American flavours. Cheap way to split the rent and keep the prices low.
