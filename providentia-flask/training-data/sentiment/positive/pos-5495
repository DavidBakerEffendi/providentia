This is my first time finding this place. After reading few reviews on yelp, I decided to try it. Glad i did. Its the best burger made the way i remember a burger should be. You have to wait a while, but its worth it. All the toppings are fresh. I had the 6oz burger and fries and pop, just under 10 dollars, you would pay the at Mcdonalds and get less or cold. I am definitely coming back and telling everyone about this place, its good to find a Mom and Pop restaurant , instead of a chain.
