I googled "BBQ pork bun" hoping to find some out here. We took a trip to San Fran in April and I have been wanting them ever since! They are amazing here! Perfectly sweet without being too much. I do wish they had more pork in them but they were still really good. I also had the cream cheese bun and it was amazing as well. Their bread is so good! We will be frequent visitors here!

My boyfriend's co-worker gets his breakfast burritos here every morning!
