They sell endive, dandelion and other super healthy and super good greens for you and very affordable :) however other stuff in there is a little more expensive comparing to other stores in china town ... I'll always have to swing by to buy my green leaves for my smoothies ^_^
They also have a variety of Natto which i like also kelp noodles are a must here very affordable  and good for you if you vegan
