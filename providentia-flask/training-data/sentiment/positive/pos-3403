Pullman is a place you have to choose to go. It's not on the way to anywhere, and it's not close to anything else particularly. Consequently, It took me a long time to get round to going. But I loved it.

The decor is chic and comfortable, but not pretentious in any way. It attracts an eclectic clientele, with a wide range of ages. The music is present, and reasonably loud, but not so you have to shout, or even pay much attention to it (I really can't remember what was playing). It's the sort of place you can dress up to go, but at the same time, you won't feel under-dressed in jeans. (I wouldn't go in sports clothes though.) My only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side, which makes it difficult to read the tiny-printed menu when you're over 40... 

The tapas-style food offerings are top quality. I tried the gravlax, the beet and feta salad, (served together), the charcuterie platter, and the beans in truffle oil, (also served together, which made for great marriages). There was plenty for two.

I had a yen for pinot noir, but was struggling with the very long wine list. The servers are billed as sommeliers, and definitely seem to know their wines. Ours suggested one I'd been hesitating over, but it turned out to be unavailable. She offered an excellent substitute at an even better price, so we ended up having two bottles! :-)

I don't know why it took me so long to get here. I think I feared it would be pretentious and disappointing, but honestly I found it exactly the sort of place I've been looking for for a while.
