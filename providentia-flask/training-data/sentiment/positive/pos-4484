Wowwww!! Just went there for lunch today and it's legit!! Loco moco and meat jun was good!!! They use good meat for the meat jun too, it's not tough or chewy like some places. The hamburger for the loco moco was tasty too! They also have the good kine kim chee. It's hard to find good local hawaii food that actually taste like it does back home. But they def kept the hawaii taste and service. My new fav spot
