The Root Cafe is an interesting place. My Fiance recently started working here as a Barista - hopefully this does not skew my review. Root is a Cafe - but its nothing like you're used to.

Food:
    I hope you're not a carnivore... else you'll be wondering: "Where's the beef!?" Root only serves Vegetarian options. Don't worry, though! I am not a Vegetarian and I LOVE Root's food. These are not your bland 'tastes like grass' type Vegetarian options. Each and every entree that I have thoroughly enjoyed at Root is both delicious and nutritious. They have Gluten Free options that are available in most cases for no additional up-charge (i think they're all free, just not 100% on that). They also have specials almost every day! I really enjoyed the Reuben that used mushrooms instead of Tempeh. That was fantastic.

-Tempeh Reuben: My (current) favorite sandwiches. On rye, this sandwich is better than any other reuben I have had. If you're a reuben fan - just try it!
-Culture: My fiances favorite sandwich. I am not really a fan of Pesto but this unique sandwich is quite delicious.
-Hoffman Bicycle Pizza: Kind of like a culture pizza. Delicious, unique, filling.
-String Theory (calzone): SO. Much. CHEESE.
-Sweet potatoe fries w/ aoili: These are fantastic. The sauce really makes them!
-Burruto: Fantastic! Very filling...

Drinks:
    Fantastic coffee choices. I believe all are fair-trade and local. They do carry Rising Star - Cleveland's premier roaster. Right now I am enjoying some of the Costa Rica coffee. Their Barista's know how to properly pull espresso. Don't try to compare Root to *Bux and their burnt beans.

Atmosphere:
    There are so many regular customers that if you, too, are a regular you can really feel like you are family. At times it can be difficult to find a seat. Most customers are kind and will share their table with you. They have paper signs by the espresso machine that you can put out to signify to other customers that they don't mind if you share the table. There are multiple power outlets for laptops and they provide free wifi. They play music loud enough that it doesnt feel creepy but soft enough that you can still have a conversation with your friends.

Tuesday: Open Mic Night
Thursday: Raw Food Night (5-9pm)

Cons:
-Sometimes it is hard to find a seat. Ask the employee's for help, though. They can usually get you a seat.
-Food can take a while to make - but its fresh and made to order so... this really isnt a con? Just relax and wait for your food!
-They run out of Kombucha quite regularly. You're probably not going to Root just for a Kombucha, though.
-Drinking their coffee will make it difficult to go to the big name coffee places that just dont have comparable quality.
