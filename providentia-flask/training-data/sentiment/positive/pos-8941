Great atmosphere, great service. Had the baked langostinos (outstanding!) and sex on the beach roll, sans cream cheese (whoo! That tuna is spicy!). Happy hour was definitely happy. Amazed at how little rice they use, even without asking! Very carb-friendly. 

I will be back for sure, probably within the week.
