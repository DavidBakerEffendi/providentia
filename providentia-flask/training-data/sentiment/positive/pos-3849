Sushi was very good, fresh and menu has a lot to choose from.  All u can eat was reasonable and selection great.

We came here for our friends birthday and the owner came out spoke with us.  Very nice and inviting.  She even gave my friend a present and gave us a chef's special dish. 

We will come back here again, if just for the excellent service.
