This place is amazing. Some of the best food in the area and the owners really know the meaning of service. Falafel is crisp and light,  the lentil soup is extraordinary, the made to order hummus is creamy and delicious, and the pita bread is baked freshly every day. They even make an awesome homemade lemonade. 

Everything I've had so far has been wonderful and is also very healthy. On top of all that, Ab gave me spices from his kitchen one afternoon for a head cold tea!

What an awesome place. We've started eating there several times a week.
