Lunch at SushiSamba is the best!  We were promptly seated at a round table with a good view of the whole restaurant.  The restaurant energy is vibrant, full of energy and colorful.  We ordered 2 orders of the 3 kinds of seaweed 'cos we love seaweed!  I love the crunchy pink seaweed, the light green is the common one and the black seaweed was a little coarser.  All were good!  The Salt and Pepper Squid arrived - succulent and tender.   Next came the Huancaina Fries - Peru potatoes with queso fresco - delicious!  Oh yes!  Our favorites were up next:  Hamachi Kama - Yellowtail fish collar - 2 beautiful pieces charred with a squeeze of key lime and a side of su shohyu sauce - fresh and so tasty!  Each one got one Hamachi Kama - and that's a lot of fish!  

Suddenly there was break and no food arrived.  We were wondering what happened... then appeared the manager with 2 plates - one dish of Peruvian Bay Scallops (there were 4 in total)  with on one dish and the other a taco with waygu beef for my mum 'cos she's lactose-intolerant.  I was wondering why the waiter had asked us if we had any seashell allergies or any allergies at about 1/3 of the way into our lunch.  Now, I know why!!  :o).  The manager explained that he wanted to give us these free appetizers 'cos we were repeat customers!  How generous!  

We also ordered 2 more rolls - Samba Strip - Maine Lobster - need I say more!  And the Lima roll - shrimp and crab.  Yummy rolls and the best I've ever had!! 

Service was fantastic and we will come back again!
