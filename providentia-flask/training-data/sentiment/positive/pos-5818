I have never heard of a ramen not using pork in their broth. This is always a down for me since I'm intolerant to pork. I can finally eat ramen from a restaurant thanks to Hashi. I was a bit worried when we came in considering prom makes the flavor in a ramen dish. Once my food came, it was on! I realized afterwards that they have a chicken version of tonkatsu. We are definitely coming back. Thanks again for not putting pork!
