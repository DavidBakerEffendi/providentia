I have never had a better cup of coffee. I went in with my boyfriend expecting to maybe get a cold drink or some tea, then there on on the menu "ALMOND MOCHA". I was like, eh why not try something new. It was amazing. SO GOOD. I would highly recommend getting your coffee from this place and try the Almond Mocha. It will not disappoint you!!
