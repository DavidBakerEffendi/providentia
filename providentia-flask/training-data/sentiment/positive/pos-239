love the sushi!

 my co-worker recommended this place and the ambiance is nice, 
the names of the sushi are funny and awesome! 

appetizer: screaming o: delicious and has a bit of spicyness to it. 
                        tuna collar: delicious and my fav so far!! 

dinner: udon soup was fabulous, full of flavor and different meats and veggies.

great customer service!!!
