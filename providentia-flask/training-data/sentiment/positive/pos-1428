This place is the BOMB.com!!! My favorite is the wasabi poke, spicy avocado, limo poke, and shoyu poke. I guess I like it all!  The sauces is very tasty and the counter crew is super friendly. My favorite day is POI day!!!!  One day out of the week they bring in fresh poi, but I'm not telling you when. ;)
