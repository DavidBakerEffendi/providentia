Roti & Red Stripe!  This place is legit!  When I lived in Antigua, the main staples of our diet involved rotis & Red Stripe so when we sat down at Caribbean Hut & saw the menu, I immediately thought omg this place is gonna be good

And I was so right - offering something for meat-eaters, veggies & vegans alike our group spanned the range & they delivered

Oxtail plates, veggie rotis, lamb rotis & chicken curry were the orders & the dishes were huge, filling & delish.  Not a group who usually takes away leftovers we could not resist - too much scrumptiousness to leave anything behind
