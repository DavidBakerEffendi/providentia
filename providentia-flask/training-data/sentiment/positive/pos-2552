Wow!   This dining experience transported me to a different land.  I left Charlotte and went straight to Ethiopia!  After reading the glowing YELP Reviews, this place became a priority for me.  So much to review.  First the menu and food - extremely different than American fare, based on presentation and FLAVORS.  I had the vegetable plate which was a sampling of many kinds of vegetables.  It was served with a basket of rolled up spongy bread.  Because there are no utensils, the bread is unrolled and used to scoop up the food.  This takes practice and getting used to.  The experience was fascinating, but probably not good for someone trying to avoid bread!  I feel confident that utensils would have been available upon request, however my recommendation is to experience Ethiopian food the way that the natives eat it!   The iced tea had strong hints of Cinnamon and ginger and was simply delicious.  The entire meal woke up every taste bud in my mouth.  Atmosphere - very warm colors and artwork that added to the feeling of being in Ethiopia.  There was only one other table of people dining for lunch today and when they left, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves.  It was a pleasant and comfortable space.   Service - impeccable.  The waiter was as hospitable as it gets.  Explained all the menu options and helped us understand the technique for eating the food. His native accent also added to the feeling of being outside of Charlotte.  So, in summation, I loved the experience and so glad that Charlotte has another dining option that is not a boring chain restaurant.  For those reading this review, GO CHECK OUT THIS PLACE!  Three thumbs up!
