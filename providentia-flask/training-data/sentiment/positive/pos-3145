This place is now called Hashi Izakaya!

Finally, an izakaya that I can walk to from home! The ambiance is dim and usually not too busy or loud. When you walk in and leave the restaurant, you are greeted in Japanese. Staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Food is very flavourful and great portions. The pricing is about the same as any other izakaya, but the portions make is more worth it to come here! It's about $25-$30 per person (without drinks), and we were both very full afterwards.

Only thing is that their rolls were drenched in mayo, so if you're not into that sort of thing, try to avoid ordering the special rolls.

I've been here twice for dinner. I've ordered the Eel with rice, dynamite roll, grilled octopus, sashimi, yakiudon, sashimi salad, ebi mayo (shrimp) and they were all very tasty. I will be coming here again this weekend and I can't wait!
