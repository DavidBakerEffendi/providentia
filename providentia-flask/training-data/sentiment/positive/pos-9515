Been looking for a good Mexican place outside of downtown Toronto and I think I've found my place. 

Came here for lunch and was greeted by the owner who was super friendly and told us about his menu. We decided to try the tacos (3 for 10.99) and tortas and ordered some chips with guac. 

Everything was super delicious. The chips were nice and very crispy. I ordered the chorizo, chicken, and carnita tacos. All were garnished and flavoured very well. The carnita torta was quite large but it was so good we were able to finish it all. 

The only regret I have is not trying the fish tacos. But that means ill be going back for them next time!
