I've been at the Durango location multiple times, and this location does not disappoint either. This new location has a bigger menu, which I will enjoy exploring from. So far, all the original ramen taste exactly like the original ones from the Durango store. The mapo ramen taste great, and I would definitely recommend as one of the new items. Their gyoza and garlic fried rice taste great, too! Overall, I'm very happy with this new location.
