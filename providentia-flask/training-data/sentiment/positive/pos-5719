Let me be clear:  Best Burger in Arizona! 

Lenny's is a 50s style dinner that serves the most delicious burger in Phoenix that I have yet to experience. The counter and barstools perfect the theme of the place and allow for customers to watch the cooks prepare the burgers or dogs.  The fries are delicious, too.  And it is one of the cheapest places to eat in downtown Phoenix.  And often times, Lenny himself is there taking your order.

I HIGHLY recommend Lenny's to any burger lover.  It will not disappoint.  And they just recently doubled the size of the place!
