This place is really cool!  Just from looking at the entrance you feel like you're walking into a really fun place. I was here for the Cocktail Muse event. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The decor of this place is really fun, they totally rolled with the bowling theme. We didn't get a chance to bowl but there's going lanes downstairs and upstairs. I will be back!!
