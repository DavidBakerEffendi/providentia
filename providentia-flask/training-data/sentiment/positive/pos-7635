My classmate and I usually share when we eat out and ordered the 6 wings combo, which included coleslaw and fries, a Nutella shake, and lemonade. Everything, even the various sauces, go so perfect together. The staff provided exceptional customer service and the place was clean. One thing we didn't like were the bathrooms...it needed some cleaning done. Other than that, we'll be back soon! :)
