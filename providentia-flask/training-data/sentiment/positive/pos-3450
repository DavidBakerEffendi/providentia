I LOVE their crispy chicken tacos....it's the only thing I order when I go there. I just have one little comment...I wish they would cover up the glaring florescent light in the back of the original section of the restaurant (the side on the way to the restrooms). Hanging a couple of Mexican-style blankets from the ceiling would help - I cringe when I see the hostess heading that way to seat us specifically because of the harsh light there.
