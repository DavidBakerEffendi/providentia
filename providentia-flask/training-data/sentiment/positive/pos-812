One of favourite sushi places in town for both lunch and dinner! There is a great selection of lunch specials for both bento boxes and korean dishes. The bento boxes come with soup and salad and my favourite boxes to get are the sushi box and the sashimi box for $8.99. I think this is one of the cheapest bento lunch specials around- the sashimi is very fresh and well portioned. 

The dinner options are equally as delicious, I would recommend getting a Chan combo (60 pcs, sashimi, sushi and rolls - $62.99) if you are dining with a couple other people. 

The service is very quick and the place is busy all the time. If you order take out, remember to bring enough cash to get 10% off! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good a la carte Japanese restaurant that is decently priced.
