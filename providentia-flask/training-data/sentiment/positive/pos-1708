This is a regular Quickstop place for me to grab healthy take-out meal for the night. I rarely eat in however they have ample seating and a nice clean dining area. Their food is very fresh it seems extremely healthy. Everything is made fresh to order. Service was quick and efficient and they're always very kind and helpful in explaining menu items. The price per order is quite fair and this portions are very large. I fed two adults and two children for under $40.And we had leftovers for the next day.
