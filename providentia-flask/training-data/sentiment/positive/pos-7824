Tasty food and great service!! Overall an excellent experience! 

Walked in with a group of co-workers (a total of 7 people). The manager saw us coming in from outside so he opened the door and held it open for us....how nice!! He was energetic and super nice...he cracked a few jokes and was very welcoming! Then the hostess set up a table for us right away. 

Our server came within 2 minutes of sitting down and took drink orders. He wasn't as enthusiastic but still nice and efficient. He answered questions about the menu and just went straight to it! The food took about 20 minutes to arrive BUT there were 7 of us so it's understandable. Everyone's food came at the same time and everything was hot and fresh! And presentation of the food was spot on!

I ordered the almond crusted chicken fingers. It came with 5 big pieces and a mountain of fries! Portion was good! The chicken was hot, juicy and perfectly crusted with the right amount. I'm a huge French fry fan and these fries were soooo good! Thinly cut and super crispy! Their U.S.E. sauce is like a chipotle sauce, someone else at the table thought it was spicy but I didn't think so. 

The rest of their menu looks really good so I'll have to come back and try something else!
