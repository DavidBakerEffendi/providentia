First time here with my kids on a Saturday afternoon, and we had a freeking blast!!!!!
This will take the place of our get out of the heat bowling Saturday. My 10 year old had the time of his life!  It's a bit pricey.....$35 an hour from Noon-5.......but it's priceless to see my kids have a blast with their dad doing something sporty and outside when its 105 degrees.
We didn't have much to eat, just some fries and I grabbed a Goose Island IPA.
The service and staff was a perfect 10! Everyone took the time to explain how the games work and everything else. I will 100% be back hopefully with some adults next time!!!!!
