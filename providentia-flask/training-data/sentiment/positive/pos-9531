This place is a hidden gem! Just as a lot of other reviewers have said. I always passed this place frequently until one day I read some reviews. I went in for happy hour an OH MY was the sushi delicious! The prices are reasonable even without happy hour the quality of sushi is some of the best I have ever had for the price point. I have now been to mizu at least 6 times. Try the Parma roll!
