Please, please, PLEASE, whatever you do, do not order the mini vegetarian tostadas they have as a special addition to the menu. They were no bueno. I was expecting the same spicy vegetable mixture as the tacos and it was really bland and boring. And the "chipotle" aoli squirted on top was really gross and just tasted like mayonnaise. It fell apart as I was trying to eat it and I ended up not finishing it. On top of all that, they were $9 with no side!!! What a travesty! I had to spend extra money to get my beloved black beans. 

However, the latin lover drink was delicious. And I even had a second one. I don't know if there was less alcohol than usual or I am just becoming more tolerant to alcohol because I have never had more than one drink at a time in my life. But the second drink was only $3. Which was nice.
