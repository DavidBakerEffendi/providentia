Oregano's has upbeat and attentive young servers - servers who actually seem happy to be there!  This always is a plus in dining out.

Our delicious thin crust pizza with sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, mushrooms, (your choice of toppings) was one of the best I've had in the valley.  I loved the chicken Caesar salad which was superior to most -  it was topped with pulled chicken, shaved parmesan slices and a tangy Caesar dressing.

Oregano's is a comfy upbeat restaurant with great service and great food - an excellent time was had by all!
