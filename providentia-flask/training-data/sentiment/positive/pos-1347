My husband and I came here on Saturday for a date night. The first thing I noticed was how gorgeous it was inside! The space is well designed and super appealing.

We sat down and immediately decided on the Treatment. $55 per person and $5 goes to charity. They bring out a sampling of things on the menu. Additionally, we decided on a bottle of wine. We found out that the wine we selected was out of stock but the waitress handled it well by suggesting something comparable and bringing us a tasting of it. 

Side note: I thought they handled my husbands oyster allergy (yes, just oysters...it's odd) really well and were super conscience of it. 

As for the food.....absolutely delish. It just kept coming and coming. Here is what was brought out for The Treatment:
-Oysters- For me. I got two and I loved being able to compare the flavor profile
-Bahn Mi Shrimp- Nice sized and flavorful
-Salmon and Tuna poke bowl- The rice had a great texture and the tuna was so good
-Mussels- The sauce was insanely good. They even brought out extra bread for us to soak up the amazing sauce. 
-Fried Calamari- This was the only miss for me for the whole night. I felt like the breading was just a bit too thick so all you tasted was fried-ness
-Scallops- The latke underneath was a nice touch. So flavorful and perfectly cooked
-NC Trout- Probably my favorite of the evening. Squid ink pasta....need I say more. 
-Tilefish- The saffron aioli was so tasty. This was another winner!
-Cheesecake- So light and fluffy
-Brownie- The cherry filling was not too overpowering which made this perfect combo of flavor and texture. 

I cant wait to come back just to try the Lobster and Truffles!

I think my only complaint was that the portions were huge. For The Treatment, I wished they served a bit smaller size since we were getting so many. However, now that I am typing this, I feel like I sound ridiculous!! 

Service was absolutely flawless. I truly haven't been so happy after a meal in a long time. This place is the real deal.
