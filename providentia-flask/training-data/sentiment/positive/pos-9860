I have always wanted to try this restaurant, and i have finally made it 3 years later. South end charlotte has been booming, the once sleepy mill is now alive, edgy and hip.

Herbs as "flower" that adorns each table. They use this home made lemon spritz as cleanser, very biodegradable. 

My only complaint is the waiter (dark straight hair, fair skin) was not super friendly. But with that aside. This restaurant is everything it promises. Sustainable, support local organic farmers. Clean vegan eating. 

The purple rain juice i ordered was vey refreshing. My mom ordered the pho and portion wise it was kind of small. They pour the broth in after they put the entree on the table. The broth has good flavor. 

They give you a glass jar with filtered(?) water on each table. 

Bathrooms have not been remodeled. The paintings that adorn the wall are pretty cool!
