We found out about this place and decided to check it out since we live 5 mins away from it ! The staff were very welcoming and the food was AMAZING ! It's probably the best breakfast place I've ever had. Better than 5 star hotel breakfasts that I've tried ! Will be coming back here very soon :)

My new go-to breakfast place !!
