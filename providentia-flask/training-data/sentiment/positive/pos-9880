I've had pizza from Avanti a few times now. Both the thin crust and deep-dish are very good. Tonight, I decided to try some wings as well with my order from Bite Squad. I'm very picky about wings. I asked for them extra crispy and extra hot. I got them and they were fantastic. I'm from the east coast and one of my biggest issues with Vegas is that it's hard to find good wings, and even when I get good wings somewhere, they're inconsistent (I'll go again and they won't be as good). I can happily say, these were some of the best wings I've had in a long time. The sauce had a bit more of a hint of sweetness than tanginess, which was different but certainly not in a bad way, but they had a definite punch to them in terms of heat, the chicken was good quality, you could tell thye were cooked in clean oil, they were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, not "watery", the bones were white not purple/black when you got to them, also a sign of a good quality wing that was cooked properly and the sauce was thick and clung to the wings so you got the taste of it the whole way through. Outstanding. If they are this good every time I order them, you've a got a fan of your pizza AND wings for life.
