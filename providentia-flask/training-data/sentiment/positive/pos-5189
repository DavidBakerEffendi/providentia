I finally got to stop by after working in NLV. After reading reviews I wanted to try! This place does chicken tenders, chicken sandwiches and salads. I got the Cali chicken club. I know that I was hungry, but it was one of the best chicken sandwiches I ever had! Bacon lettuce tomato avocado , but the brioche bun made it! I also tried the blueberry coleslaw , so good!! They at first gave me apples and toffee dip by mistake, I went to take it back, and they let me try it. It was delicious . Great place, service and staff . Go try it! Now I hear there's one on the west side.  And of course there is a coke freestyle
