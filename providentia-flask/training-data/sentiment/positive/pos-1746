I've really enjoyed Lake Las Vegas the couple of times I've been there.  It is beautifully designed, and has a bit of a village feel. It is modeled after Tuscany's building-bridge design.  The view of the bridge/building over the water- and the view from the building onto the water- is very pretty.  Night concerts by the water are fun and relaxing, and the little shops are fun to visit and lit prettily at night. This place is on my list of sites to bring my friends to. What a peaceful, beautiful place!
