Love the food the churros waffle topping it's really good!!! My daughter and husbands likes it... The drinks is good not to sweet not to strong.. I love the place it's small it's a chill place the smell of the place is really good... The red velvet waffle I ordered is really good with chocolate chips and chocolate syrup with whip cream and extra strawberry on the side is really good I'll be back for sure... The ladies that work there are really nice too... Oh  download the epoxy app it's a reward apps!!!  Don't forget hihi....
