The wife and I stopped in to Hyde Park for Happy Hour and we were the only ones in the joint.  Sweet!  We had the entire restaurant to ourselves, but we sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender, who was friendly.  We started off with some cocktails followed by dinner.  The cocktails were delicious.  I had two martinis and my wife had two mixed drinks.

We ordered a veggie flatbread, some shrimp, and sliders.  The food was excellent!  The flatbread had thin crust and the tomatoes, cheese, and other toppings were fresh and absolutely delicious!  The sliders were perfectly cooked and just awesome. The shrimp was just okay.  It was served on a tortilla chip and didn't have much flavor, which I found odd.  

The atmosphere was very nice and I would like to return for a non-happy-hour dinner some day.  The food and service were excellent!  What a great happy hour!
