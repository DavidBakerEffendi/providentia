First things first, this place is cash and Interac ONLY

Now onto more important things: the cocktails are amazing and they are always switching them up. For a veggisaurus like me, there are a TON of choices and I have never left here less than absolutely, freaking stuffed and happy. They switch up their mussel recipe fairly often which is good, but their curry mussels are to die for, everyone at the table was pretty much stabbing one another to soak up what was left. Everything on the menu is tasty, fresh and delicious and the staff completely rule. Cozy spot and you can always get a table if you're patient, well worth the wait if they make you wait.
