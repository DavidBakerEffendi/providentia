theres something very neighbourly about having a restaurant dressed as a diner but filled with the pervasive smells and tastes of good food.  ive been here for very romantic dinners for which you might not expect it to be the setting, but its a wonder what dim lighting and a few candles can do for the swelled heart.  

the pleasure of course didnt stop there, as the secondary purpose of romance is the swelling of the belly.  now i dont think this is anywhere close to the first thing id imagine if you said picture some food item named "angels on horseback", but the bacon wrapped oysters are awesome.  (id have to figure that whipped cream was involved or something light and fluffy...maybe a little quail atop a carrot?).

another goody is the smoked trout stack which has "johnny cakes with chives creme fraiche and caviar".  what else can you say but "ooh la la".  (and youll have to say that only when you see it because while youre eating it you wont be able to do much more than drool and breathe.).

finally (instead of ice cream?) you may want to get the braised beef short ribs which melt off the bone into your mouth like a basket flows down a river.

holy moses, batman.
