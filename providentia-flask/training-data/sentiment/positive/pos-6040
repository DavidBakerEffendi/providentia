This place was fantastic!! Great service and the food was amazing .

We took a trip out to the Hoover Dam and looked the Big Horn Sheep in BC and on our way out stopped here to eat . 

We started with a Bloody Mary and two beers . My son ordered the Bacon Cheese burger with Curly Fries and I ordered the Green Chili ( Hatch ) burger with Curly Fries and we split them !! Both were great and cooked to perfection! 

As an appetizer we order the hot Fried Pickles and they were incredible!! 

It's a very small hole in the wall with around 10 tables and a counter to sit at . The restroom is located outside at the back of the building and was very clean . 

The service was awesome. Both young ladies checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed . I would definitely go back ... Thank you for the great Experience!!
