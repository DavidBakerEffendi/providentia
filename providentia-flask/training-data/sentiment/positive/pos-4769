Was told by the owner they don't take shortcuts on their food.  And it shows.  I've been several times trying something new every time I visit. And they have never let me down.  The food has so much flavor and is just the right amount of spice.  I always get an extra spring roll because it's delicious.  The restaurant is small and private but a bit dark. Which is nice for a quiet meal.  Lunch portions are a good size.
