Came here on a date and i have to say, it was amazing! Get the tacos! I ordered three. The paco taco, the Chicken fried chicken, and chicken Melensia. Omg so so good! These tacos are pretty large. I couldn't finish three but it's a better deal to get three instead of 2. We also had the bartenders special margarita that night. It wasn't much different from a regular margarita except it has an orange slice. The service was excellent. The atmosphere is awesome and the price is good. I'm a new fan and will be returning FOR SURE! 

Also, make a reservation.
