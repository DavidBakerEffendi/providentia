Taqueria El Buen Pastor is one, if not, THE BEST place in the Vegas valley for GOOD Mexican food. I'm a regular at the food truck location on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Bonanza, especially when I used to live nearby. I never took the time to review that location because, well, they don't need it! But since this is the grand opening of the Henderson location, I thought I'd let people in the Henderson area know what's up since all they have to compare to is Chipotle, Cafe Rio, Roberto's and Faustos (although Faustos is pretty good too and WAY better than Robertos). 
Anyways, Taqueria has the BEST tacos, no fake sh*t!!! The tortas and quesadillas are pretty bomb too. The tacos and horchata is what I mainly go for though! First of all, the horchata is FRESH and made there EVERY DAY!!! Nothing like good fresh horchata. Most places get that bs fountain drink kind horchata and it tastes so watered down and not really good. This horchata could keep me coming back even if the food wasn't good (I'm kidding, just trying to explain how good the horchata is lol) 
I am so excited with this location too because not only is it closer, but there are so much more options and we can sit here! I'm used to the truck so you have to stand there or take it to-go. BUT, with that, I was able to try the shrimp burrito today and it was very yummy and filling! I was full halfway but made myself finish it. It was so worth it though. 
To end this review, 10/10 would recommend. Try the tacos and horchata man.
