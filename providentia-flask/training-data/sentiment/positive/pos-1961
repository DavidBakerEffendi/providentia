Garlic sauce is so bomb!  They have more choices of vegetables than other places and everything but the pickles and jalape√±os looked and tasted fresh. 

The Friday lunch line was decent sized at 1pm with most tables full. The ordering and assembling line is a quick system and with 5 people in front of me I sat down within 5 minutes to eat.

The servers are friendly for a counter service place and a few looked up and smiled while people were waiting in line. Tables,  counters and floors were clean. 
Overall a very good quick stop lunch place! Worth $7
