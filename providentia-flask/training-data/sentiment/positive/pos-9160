Must have Ravi roasted red pepper bisque and the grilled veggie wrap.  The soup is always good no question about it.  The wrap was a perfect blend of fresh spinach with grilled warm veggies and grilled perfectly.  I wish we had a Ravi's in Oakville or Mississauga.  I would eat there every night!!!

The space is small but it has this gorgeous wooden table that is so long and wide that it works well for twosomes to sit side by side and still enjoy some privacy.
