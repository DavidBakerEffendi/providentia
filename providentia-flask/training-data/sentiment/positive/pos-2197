I was not disappointed again. This was my third time eating at rm seafood but the first time eating upstairs off the pricier menu. Everything was amazing and the service was wonderful. All the add-ons were expensive and we weren't told of the price- perhaps that would be tacky to ask?- so we were a little surprised when the bill came but worth every penny. 
Chef Rick adheres to the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch guide and it is so nice to be able to order anything off the menu and not have to worry about whether or not is is sustainable. I have dreams of this food and currently salivating over the pasta with black truffle oil. 

If only I lived closer and Las Vegas was cheaper....
