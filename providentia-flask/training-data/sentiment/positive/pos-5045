New fave spot in the East End! Saw a post by the owner on the local neighbourhood Facebook group, decided to give it a try and was not let down. The wine selection is great (though didn't indulge in any) and our cocktails were some of the best in the city - including ones we've paid much more in bars and hotel lobbies downtown. The appetizers were particularly good, I will be back for the grilled octopus and scallops. The mains were not as notable but still seriously good. I would love to come back in the winter as it's just a cozy spot with friendly service. Everything you want in a restaurant - well priced, delicious food, yummy drinks - and all without the pretentious flair of your regular Toronto dining experience. I am thrilled to have this in the hood, I wish I could keep it a secret :)
