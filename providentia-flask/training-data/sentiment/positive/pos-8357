Ok Misty Y, I blame you for this. My new favorite place in Las Vegas for fresh, All types of asian food, in Las Vegas. Lisa, the chef behind this resturant has a real gift for making tasty, fresh, wonderful food.
We began with the gyoza, fresh, made to order and tasty.
Then onto the best Malaysian Roti I have had ever..her own twist with a great flavor and again oh so fresh.
We also ordered the chicken Wrap, which comes served in a lettuce wrap sort of deal, again, not to be missed!
The massaman Curry was so nice, we thought we would be brining it home, but it never made it there, we ate it all.
We also learned that most of the fresh herbs being used are organic, grown in her mothers yard nearby..so local too!
I loved the real plates and silverware, very liittle waste.
Get yourself here before the crowds find this place, there are only four tables! 
They informed us that they will deliver, look them up on roadrunnerfood.com
I can't wait to come back, my favorite place in Las Vegas! Damm you Misty! Xoxoxox
