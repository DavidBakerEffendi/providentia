My wife and I went last night after our show in town (we are on tour with our band).   Love the whole underground tavern vibe about this place.   The food was really good.  The oysters were huge and tasty.  All the dishes were very good but the oysters and the chowder took the cake.   The server was very nice and attentive without being too much.  Surprised it's not a 4 or 5 star rating as our experience was great and we will definitely go back when we are in town again.
