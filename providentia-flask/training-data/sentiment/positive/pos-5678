I have been dreaming about Mirchi's gulab jamon for a month now, so when my honey suggested we go have lunch I automatically chirped "Mirchi Please! Mirchi Please".

Today was an extra ordinary day and I have to update my review because I am still seeing stars in my eyes.  We shared the delicious chicken curry and a vegetable with spinach dish at 6.00 dollars each, we also ordered basmati rice which came in a huge bowl and naan on the side (again a very big portion).  

 All in all including pop and gulab jamon for dessert it came to just below $22!  This was a huge meal for the amount of money we spent, and we didn't even finish the chicken curry.

Yelpers I insist that if you want a delicious mouth watering Indian meal for fewer than 8 dollars come here! Every item is savoury and superb, and the owner is so delightful and so gracious.  It is such a nice relaxed place to eat an extremely authentic Indian meal.
