Tiny adorable cafe on 32nd at and Indian school!!

I choose here to have breakfast with a friend.  I did a drive by because this place is tucked away on the north west corner next to a Pilates studio.

When we went in a lady was scooping cookie dough! Homemade food wins my heart.  

We ordered the turkey egg white sandwich and the turkey jalapeño sandwich.  Both were yummy with fresh roasted turkey!  Yum.  The only thing I would change is more jalapeño because I could not taste it at all. 

Super reasonably priced!  We sat in the patio but maybe would sit inside next time because we did get asked for money while sitting there.
