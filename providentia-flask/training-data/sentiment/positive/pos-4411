After church mom and I went to Libretto for lunch. I bought a living social deal for this place. We have the 18 inch Margherita and it was very yummy. I love the basil on the pizza. We also have the garlic knots, and that was good too. Mom really enjoyed the pizza and the house salad there. The house salad was fresh. Our server was very nice and thoughtful. We had a good experience there. My friend who works at uptown also recommended me the Libretto at the Epic Center. She told me it was very good also. I am tempting to buy another living social deal for uptown location.
