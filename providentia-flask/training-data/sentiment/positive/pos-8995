Our server suggested to us that we simply trust him and he would put together a three course meal for us. We were on the fence as while he stated he could keep it to $50pp we were just looking for a good and inexpensive sushi dinner. Well, thank god we trusted him! When the food came out the price seemed like a bargain. Every course was about 3-5 things to share. The sea bass and the gyoza were stand outs but literally everything was amazing. The cocktails were top notch. I paid the same price here for an amazing drink complete with a sugar cane and a banana leaf for the same price as a well drink most places on the strip. I would highly recommend this!
