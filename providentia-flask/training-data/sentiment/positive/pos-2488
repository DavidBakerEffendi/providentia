This place was really really good! You get a ton of food here! The drink prices are really reasonable, and if you go on a Tuesday you can get a 2 item combination plate for $10.95. My boyfriend and I got to the restaurant an hour before they closed and the place was packed, and now I know why. I will definitely be going back!
