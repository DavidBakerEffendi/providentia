To celebrate my getting a huge promotion at work, my husband Rick took me out to dinner.  He decided to surprise me and while we were still on Carson Street, he told me to close my eyes.  As I felt the car go uphill and take some twists and turns, I assumed we were on Sycamore Street.  I was going nuts.  Was he taking me to some of the restaurants by the Duquesne Incline?  If so, why didn't he simply take the McCardle Roadway up?  Imagine my surprise when he told me I could open my eyes.  He remembered that I like this little cafe.

We began our meal with my favorite, Carmela's Antipasto (Italian lunch meats, roasted red peppers, and cheeses).  We then moved on to the tomato salad.  Since Rick said I could order what I wanted, the steak sounded tempting, but I was in the mood for some good Italian.  My Chicken Cacciatore was absolutely delicious.  My husband however did avail himself of ye olde red meat and ordered the 8oz New York Strip Steak.  

And let's face it folks, no Italian meal is complete without some good cannoli or tiramisu.  But which to get?  Aha, order both and share!
