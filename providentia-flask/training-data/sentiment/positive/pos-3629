Yes it is in the Sinclair Gas Station... the friendly service won us over!!! Ben R was extremely accommodating and charming!! First time my hubby and I went for dinner.   It was extremely sweet of Ben to bring our food plus a candle to make the dinning experience romantic!  Tacos  are delicious and the Al Pastor Nachos were Wonderful!   Ben R suggestion to add the "Mexican Crack"
