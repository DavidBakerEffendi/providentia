Location: On Notre-Dame Ouest. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and from there, it's less than a 10-minute walk. Street parking is available [metered].

The place: Discovering Flash was a really pleasant surprise. I LOVE the space - high ceilings, big windows, wood floors and minimal decor. It's got an old-school meets contemporary feel to it. All they need is a hammock for me to nap in when I visit, and we'll be all set. They play great tunes too, and have vintage cameras + photo books lying around. Definitely my kind of place.  They also offer photography classes and workshops and that's way cool. 

The goods: I only had tea so can't really comment on anything else. They carry Camellia Sinensis, which I like and they have a few sweet treats on hand and of course, coffee. 

Service: Great. The person who served me at the counter was very nice. But Sarla, one of the owners (I think) was superb - I LOVE her. She came over to clear our table as we were leaving, and we got into this great conversation with her about a variety of things. She's incredibly friendly and warm! Neither owner makes you feel like you've outstayed your welcome so you can cozy up with your coffee and your book, or check out the photo books they've got on hand - sit back and enjoy the music. 

Price point:: The tea was a little expensive at $4 a pop.
