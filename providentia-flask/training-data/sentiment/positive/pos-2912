I was really worried that my second visit wasn't going to be as good as the first (because the first was some of the best hot dogs I've ever had). I wasn't disappointed, got the 'Southern all the way' sub mustard for BBQ sauce, with Cole slaw and cheese. And a bratwurst with red onions, homemade Mango Chipotle BBQ Sauce, and shredded cheese.

This guy is the real deal. And this street food stand is a must-visit for anyone in CLT. Go see for yourself.
