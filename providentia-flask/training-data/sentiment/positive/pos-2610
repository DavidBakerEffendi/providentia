Tom's has a very broad (and brand new!) menu to offer which was awesome for a group of five. We all ordered something different and shared - the portions are a really good size. Our favorites were: Huevos Benedictos, BBQ chicken sliders, Lemon Blueberry poppyseed pancakes and the Tree Hugger Benedict. Everything was awesome - and those pancakes were the kicker! If you love lemon you will love these. Service was really good - everyone was nice and accommodating and the manager actually visited our table a couple of times. They even gave us some bottomless mimosas to go! I am definitely coming back here before I leave Vegas!!!

Came back a few days later and has Tina helping us this time. She was so awesome!! This time we ordered the breakfast BLT, Urban breakfast and an omelet with poblano peppers which was amazing. This place is honestly the real deal...I will be coming here every time I am in Vegas from now on!! Happy eating :)
