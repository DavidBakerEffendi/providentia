Great place! Perfect lunch sizes and fair priced, service is wonderful. I haven't had the chance to bring my dog with me over here since its a pet friendly place ( outdoors of course) but I will,  one of these days. I love the shrimp tacos, but they have a wide range of favorites to choose from on their menu. Aaah! Beautiful bar and a perfect place just to chill with friends after work or just a quick bite to eat for lunch. Try the happy hour too, which I believe starts around 3 pm. Not only good for chow but excellent to watch and catch up with some games ( sports ) while eating. I will certainly come back here . And I do recommend this place :)
