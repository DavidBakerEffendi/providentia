Second time in three months and this place again earns 5 stars. It's a nice restaurant, very good service, delicious food and plenty of it, dang reasonable prices! So much shrimp on the Po Boy that I had to take some off to eat it. Great onion rings, too. My wife's chicken strips were plump, juicy and huge. Not stingy on their pours either. A great go-to restaurant/bar for a great time and good eats.
