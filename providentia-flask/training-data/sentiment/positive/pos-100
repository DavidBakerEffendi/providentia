Great beer and BBQ!  

Came in on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30.  The house has 6 beers that they make.  I had their IPA and loved it.  

We were just coming from a big lunch, so eating again wasn't a priority, but damn the place smelled good!  And we had it on good advice their pulled pork and brisket was excellent.  So we tried the sampler platter.

Enough pulled pork for a meal, and it was fantastic.  Long strings of pork nicely seasoned without any type of sauce.  I need to figure out how to make the same in my smoker.  Although mine is pretty good, this was excellent!  And the beef brisket was good, too.  Nice smoke ring around the edge, great flavor.  There were 3 rib bones.  I don't think these were babybacks, but the meat was good and fell off the bone.  Wasn't impressed, however, with the BBQ sauce.  Too much like Open Pit to me.  Lastly, there were 2 chicken wings.  These were full wings, including both the wing and drumette.  We got the spicy garlic BBQ sauce.  They were excellent.  You could really taste the chargrilled flavor in the wing.  Only disappointment was the wing sauce was ladled on the wings, they weren't tossed in it so some of the wing was left uncoated.  Got mixed feelings on that, as I'm a big fan of sloppy wings, but you wouldn't have tasted the chicken as well.

We also tried the pig tails...beef brisket and cheese in a deep fried tortilla.  Almost tasted like a flauta.  It was good, but served with the same Open Pit style BBQ sauce.  Although, I liked the sauce on the pig tail better than the ribs.

Lastly, as we were leaving, a guy sitting down next to us at the bar got the Saturday prime rib special.  OMG, this thing was HUGE!  Look at the picture, had to be 2+" thick!  Apparently, this is a Saturday after 5:00 special...and a lot of people know about it.  When we arrived around 3:30, there were only a few people there.  By 5:30, there were people waiting.
