If you have never been to Wongs.. get into your car and go asap!! 

Positives:
I have nothing BUT positives to say about this place.  We live in Goodyear but gladly drive a few minutes to eat at Wongs.  The atmosphere is relaxing, we enjoy it. The staff is extremely kind and friendly. We always have fun when we go! They always seem to brighten our day and we leave with a smile. Very personable staff!!! 

Now, on to the food. We absolutely LOVE their food!!!! We have been several times and always order something new and are never let down!  Here are a few of my suggestions to try:

Orange Chicken
Beef Chow Fun
Sesame Chicken
Sweet and Sour Chicken
Emperor's Chicken (a little spicy)
Moo Shu Pork
Lo Mein Noodles
Dumpling Soup

Each one is delicious and packed with flavor. I have to say..  TRY the dumpling soup as a starter!!!!!!!! Even if you aren't a big soup fan, these flavors will baffle you with how good and unique they are.  Every single dish we got was perfect and wonderful. The Lo Mein noodles go great with every entree.

 My 11 year old daughter picked Wongs for her birthday dinner (smart girl) and they gave us two orders of Crab Puffs (not sure if this is what they call them there) for FREE! We had a large group and we were so very happy with this gracious dish. Yum! They snuck out and brought my daughter some ice cream with a candle and sang her Happy Birthday with pure joy in their hearts
