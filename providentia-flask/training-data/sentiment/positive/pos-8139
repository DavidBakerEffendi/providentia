I dream of baba ganooj! I recently went to the west side market to make a little picnic with a friend and she kept checking out the hummus and other dips in the market. I insisted that we walk over to Nate's Deli for their baba and hummus. It's just the best! The beef shawarma and pickled vegetables are also amazing. I'm never disappointed. It's just a great spot to get great food!
