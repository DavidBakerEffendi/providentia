New spot that I have been chomping at the bit to try!

I absolutely love Bragg's, so it's no surprise that I am already in love with The Coronado.  Liam and Emily have done it again, folks!  

Super cute decor, lots of little spots to sit in and outside.  They have locally roasted coffee from Xanadu (which I'm currently sipping on and loving), tasty house-made pastries (I got a vegan cherry chocolate scone...and then I got one more for the road, sooooo good!), breakfast and lunch items, beer and rootbeer on tap, house cocktails, etc.

This place has something for everyone and I cannot wait to go back and try it all!!
