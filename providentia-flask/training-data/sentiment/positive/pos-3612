A great little restaurant on Villeray street. Same owners as the famous Tapeo restaurant and a couple of blocks down from it. Therefore you can expect top-notch service, ambiance, wine list and food. The cocas (flatbread pizzas) are an excellent starter and you can choose from several options. The grilled octopus is infused with piri-piri and has a little kick to it.

My favorite main meals are the fish dishes and the steak and fries (can you tell I go there often). The fries are topped with saut√©d beef bone marrow and when I put them in my mouth, Angels sing!

They also have a brunch option on weekends. Try the chili with blood sausage. Another celestial experience!
