The first time I discovered this restaurant I was impressed. I have been a long time Sushi eater. And coming from the northwest the sushi I eat is pretty high standard. When we ordered the sushi we noticed that the rice was purple. That's because they use black rice. Which I was pretty impressed about. I have had almost every sushi roll that they have. And I am impressed by every single one. I love their edamame and seaweed salad as appetizers. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.
