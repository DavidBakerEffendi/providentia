We used Better than Yia Yia's for catering for our rehearsal dinner at a downtown Toronto party room before our wedding day, and couldn't have been happier.  After shopping around a bit I found their prices very competitive, and the quality was terrific--all 55 people absolutely loved the food. Their servings were very generous and we ended up with lots of leftovers too--which is great, because the food is delicious! Deanna was a pleasure to work with and had excellent communication. Definitely recommend Better than Yia Yia's!
