The cleaniest freshest fast food place ever! The bathrooms are amazing! Our food was great! The crispy chicken has a perfect crunch thats freshly fried! I love the zucchini fries..ommg and the sweet siracha sauce is great! I love how legendary their customer service is as well! We literally ordered our food, used the restroom came out and our food was ready! Everything from sandwiches, fries, salads and drinks=impressive!  Thank you PDQ for a great family lunch date!
