I took my sister here when we went to Vegas because she had been eyeing it on Instagram for a long time. We arrived about 15 minutes before their closing time, there was no line at all and the place was pretty much empty. Just 2 other tables.

We just had a late lunch so I didn't order anything because I was still full, but my sister ordered the Bacon Egg & Cheese. She took a few bites and looked mesmerized.. then she told me that I seriously MUST take a bite. I'm not a big burger eater and not a big fan of bacon as I always find them to be too greasy. So I wasn't feeling too excited when she offered me a bite, but when I did take a bite.. man, I almost died. TOO GOOD, TOO GOOD. Still can't believe how good it was and this comes from someone who doesn't normally like burgers or bacon. Still haunted by the perfect marriage of the juicy bacon and the melting egg yolk and melting cheese, oh my God.

Our Vegas trip was short but I'll come back here the next time I'm in town.
