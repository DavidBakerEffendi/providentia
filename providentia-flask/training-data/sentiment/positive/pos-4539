Cool place! I'm not much of a fan of run-of-the-mill American-style Chinese food, and for a couple years now, the only Chinese place I've regularly gone to has been a great Szechuan place in south Tempe. Chou's is a rather different style of Chinese food (mainly from northern China, I believe), but I liked it just as much and have added it to my list of go-to places. One big plus for me is that you can get several relatively small, inexpensive dishes and eat family-style, trying lots of different things. The pancakes and dumplings are great. I got a spicy chicken entree, which was also delicious. So many more things on the menu I still want to try...
