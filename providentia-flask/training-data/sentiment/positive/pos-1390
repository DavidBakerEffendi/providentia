I have eaten her before, but last night I had a exceptional meal. I started with the white sangria which is not only beautiful and delicious but has one of the nicest fragrances. For a appetizer I had the the eggplant and the stuffed zucchini flowers. The zucchini flowers are deep fried but surprisingly light. I was trying to keep my carbs to a minimum so I ordered the steak with extra peppers. It was fantastic !!!! I had asked for steak sauce but did not need it because it was perfectly seasoned. I am already planning on returning in the next week or so to order my complete order again !!
