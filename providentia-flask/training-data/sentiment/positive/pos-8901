Wow! I loved Bistro 19 last night. We have lived in the are for a long time and have never stopped in until now. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation in advance. It was very busy on a Friday night, so I recommend having a reservation. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating the entire evening. The drink and cocktail menu was lengthy and I decided to go with the prosecco, it was delicious. They give you bread to start with and the best butter ever, haha. Yum!For dinner, I couldn't decide between the Black Tiger Shrimp or the Crabcakes. I'm glad that I went with the Black Tiger Shrimp because it was honestly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. It was stuffed and topped with a rich cream sauce and had spinach and risotto on the side. My boyfriend ordered the Pork and he also didn't have anything left on his place once he was done. We got the Chocolate Cake for dessert which was also very good. The only thing was that my ice cream came out already melted, but the woman did apologize for that. Staff was very nice. It is an upscale dining and pricy meal, but a night out once in a while made it worth it for the nice evening we were able to have. We will be back in the future for sure!
