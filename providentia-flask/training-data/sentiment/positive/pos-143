OMG.  I am a foodie - just moved to Waxhaw, and was so lucky to have my first meal at Heritage last night.  This chef, Paul- is truly a top chef.  Every single item we shared, from the Beet salad- to the dessert and dessert wine ( I had the Cloze 2013) was so 10 stars.  The Chef has a American/farm-to table theme, with twists of gastronomy and serious plating skill.  Most everything on menu is sourced locally.  Truly whom ever visits me will be going to Heritage.  Service was impeccable and since I live in walking distance I can't wait to go again.
