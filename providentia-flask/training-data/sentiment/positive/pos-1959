O. M. G. !!! If you haven't tried this place yet, what's the matter with you???? Get over there and eat! Unbelievable flavor, value, amount of food. I couldn't say enough. I'm a hell of a cook myself, I must say. But, when I don't have the time and I'm craving some curry and quick, this IS the place to go. Crazy good!! Friendly service. Friendly people. Nice place for take out or eat in. You owe it to yourself to try it. Weather you like Indian food or you think you don't. If you don't, then you haven't tried Biryani and Bites!! Try it, you like it very very much!
