I continue to explore all the brunch spots in the city and this is at the top of my list.  The atmosphere is like a small town diner with an intimate, warm feel.  The food quality is exceptional and consistent with ingredients that are perfectly matched to compliment each other.  The Huevos Rancheros, as an example, is layered with a perfect blend of fresh flavors and different textures.  Amazing - the best I have had.

The smoked fish is exceptional as is the coffee.  An unreserved 5 stars!
