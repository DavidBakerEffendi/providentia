$7.05 (tax-in) for a small chicken shawarma platter that comes with your choice of soup or drink? I'm in!

Fresh food, chicken shawarma was well seasoned and cut right off the spit! Their housemade white garlic sauce is to die for! Their lentil soup is simple and light. Very tasty and heart warming. I love how the salad is comprised of mixed greens rather than generic iceberg lettuce at most shawarma spots. Service is friendly and they even bring your meal to you! 

2 big screen TV's playing CP24 so you can watch the news during lunch/dinner. Lol.

If this place does not offer you bang for your buck, I don't know what does.
