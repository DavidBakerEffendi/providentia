Friendly service with good prices for breakfast and lunch and hot drinks. I appreciate the warm welcome considering this cafe is located in an area where there are line ups of irritated people waiting  for the drive test centre and visa application centre. Props to the guy for his great service. The pumpkin spice chai latte is excellent and they do have almond milk which is awesome. My boyfriend had a spicy breakfast omelette sandwich which was good. There is seating area in this cafe as well and there's a lot of artwork by local artists. They also have healthy alternatives for snacks.
