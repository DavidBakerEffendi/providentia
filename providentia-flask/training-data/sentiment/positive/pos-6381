Zeera is pretty new and something of a hidden gem. They offer an excellent lunch buffet for $9 that has a good deal of variety, and the food is just phenomenal. On top of that they make some of the most amazing naan bread I have ever tasted. Both times I have been there the young man who runs the place has been extremely friendly and welcoming, and the food speaks for itself. They offer a full dinner menu that I will be trying out soon, for now it's my favourite lunch spot when I'm going out. Definitely worth a try.
