Smoky Jon's has been around a long time, I grew up in this neighborhood and can remember them being located in the side of the Eagle foods building , now Jungs garden center. Barbeque sauce flavor is a personal preference, the ribs were tender and fall off the bone and I did like the flavor! We stopped by on a busy Saturday night and ordered takeout, five minutes later it was ready! Excellent job Smoky Jon's!!
