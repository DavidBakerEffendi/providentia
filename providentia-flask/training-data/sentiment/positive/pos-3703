I have been away from this area for a while and haven't had the pleasure of pho nam. The food is fresh and delicious. The owner is so nice! My son and I had pho and the chicken curry chef's special tonight and it was wonderful. We got take out and I was so happy all of the traditional accoutrements were included with pho. The chicken with lemongrass and vermicelli is also a dish not to miss! This is authentic Vietnamese cuisine.
