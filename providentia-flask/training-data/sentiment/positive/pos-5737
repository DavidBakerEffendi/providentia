I am very glad I do not live in the Dilworth area because I would be in Cantina 1511 nearly every afternoon. It is common knowledge amongst my closest friends and family that I hold a dear place in my heart for Mexican cuisine. I feel it is often underrated and under appreciated so I am a bit biased but I truly believe Cantina 1511 is one of the most delicious restaurants I have ever been. 

Whether going for a birthday dinner or after a long day at work, Cantina hits the spot. They have delicious drinks, my favorite is the mojito, at great prices. The appetizers are amazing. I prefer the queso with jalapeno bacon. The menu suits all tastes and is divided into "authentic" and "tex-mex".  Literally everything on the menu is delicious but I would suggest sticking to the "authentic" side for something a little different. My only word of caution is to either make a reservation or go prepared to wait because there is ALWAYS a wait!
