We returned to AofF on the first day we returned to Vegas.  How could we not?  It was the hit of the previous trip.

Desyree is still inventing and exploring.  I love that she can go any direction.  She'll do fig with balsamic vinegar, but then do Froot Loops.

I can't believe anyone couldn't come here and find a flavor to love.
