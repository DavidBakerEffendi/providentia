WOW!WOW!WOW!
this review is for the wings(i will never order anything else). This was my first time and was recommended by a coworker to get the Jalapeno Wings and the Shrimp Fried Rice combo. Yes it was $9 but totally worth it. Trust me i've had the claimed "best" chinese wings in both San Francisco and New York, but this place just knocks them out of the ballpark. The wings are amazingly tasty, spicy and addicting. Yes they are greasy but thats whats so good. this is not you every day food maybe not even your weekly, and maybe not even once a month meal. Im sure it packs calories, way too many. But its just comforting to eat this. Its a huge portion of both wings and rice, so you will have leftovers. The rice was quite good, probably in contention for the best fried rice i have ever had. 
The only thing i didnt like was the .50 cent charge for hot sauce. good thing i have my own at work and didnt have to buy some.
P.S - dont be scared of the place. its totally worth it.
