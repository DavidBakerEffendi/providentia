The boyfriend and I used to frequent this hole in the wall a few years ago before they closed as it was near to his house and it was just a great place to grab a few pints. He moved to a different part of town and we never got the memo they reopened, oops. 

Thankfully an invite from a friend and we know it's back in action. 

The new menu is great! I had the vegan quinoa burger with fries. It's awesome, that's all I can really say. The tomato compote is perfect - I needed no other condiment. My meat-eating man enjoyed the Jamaican Jerk Nachos. They were presented nicely and according to him tasty . There are several other vegan sides and miscellaneous items that I plan on trying. 

The bartender was attentive even on a busy night and my glass was never empty too long. $4 for a 20oz Stella most nights - I'm in. 

I'm so glad this little hole in the wall is back in action and better than before.
