The single best attraction in Lost Wages -- and you don't have to spend a cent to watch it.

The Bellagio has an 8 acre lake just for the fountain show, and it is breathtaking (like the whole Bellagio property, really). Every 15-30 minutes (depending on the time) the fountains will erupt into a spectacle that is both breathtaking and creative. And, believe it or not, it is eco-friendly: they use recycled water for their fountain show.

Thanks to Amit P., here is the schedule for the fountain show:
Monday - Friday
3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.
show every 1/2 hour
7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.
show every 15 minutes
Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays
12:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.
show every 1/2 hour
7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.
show every 15 minutes

If you don't stop by here for a fountain show, you're missing out.
