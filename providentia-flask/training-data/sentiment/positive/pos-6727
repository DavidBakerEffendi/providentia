My mom really wanted to try this place bc we been to jaburritos and it was poppin. I've reviewed   Jaburritos too so go read it and compliment it LOL. Anyways i liked this place, i liked the service bc they were really nice and asked us if it was our first time and alla dat. I was going to give 4 stars because there was no pokestop here lol jk i didnt check but really tho i was going to give 4 stars bc i didnt like my burrito that much but i made my own burrito.. Like i chose everything that went inside and it was kinda dry so i think that was my own fault LOL! But I liked it enough that im willing to come back and try their other stuff! My moms burrito was pretty good and she got twin dragon. Im just glad that sushi burritos are becoming more popular like yass i love dat cultural diversity.
