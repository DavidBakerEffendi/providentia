UPDATE!  IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!!  Not only does 32 Shea have THE best beverages in town (my new fave is a slow, gravity dripped iced coffee toddy) and killer pastries & food....they now have a liquor license and serve alcohol; a true bistro!  The outside patio is complete and looks amazing!  These guys are really hitting their stride!  Check 'em out!
