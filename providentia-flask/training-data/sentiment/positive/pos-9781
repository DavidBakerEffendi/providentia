I would highly recommend anyone here who is looking for authentic Brasilian food!  My grandfather lives in Brasil and I have been there many times.  The food here reminded me exactly of being back in Salvador.  

The Coxinha was delicious and it's the first time I've found it in the United States.  It's hard to explain what it is.  It's a deep fried potato with breading and chicken in the middle. While my description doesn't do it justice, it is a must try! 

The menu had many options and was at a very reasonable price.  The service was beyond suburb and it was refreshing to see native Brasilians working there.  I forgot his name, but he was very attentive and friendly.  

I highly recommend giving this place a try!  It's nothing like the recently popular churrascaria.  So please don't go to the restaurant thinking of Texas de Brazil or Viva Brasil.  This is authentic street and home food that the majority of Brasilians eat.
