Our first visit and wont be our last!  Stopped after work for dinner and brought our appetites.  My husband enjoyed his fish and chips plate and I loved my 3-grilled cheese and fries!  Leah, our server could not have been any nicer!  She was not only attentive but very pleasant and fun to chat with--and it was obvious that she takes pride in her work and making customers happy!   They have a lot of great menu selections and serve breakfast all day so anything on the menu is served at any time during the day.  Missing diners from the Northeast, its nice to see diners out west which are rare!  So glad we gave Metro Diner a try!
