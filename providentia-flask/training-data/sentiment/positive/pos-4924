Pleasant visit to the Stroll Inn last night!   The inside of the dining area looks recently renovated and probably still in the renovating stages.. nothing on any of the walls in the dining are   Excellent service from a waitress who was taking care of several tables was on it like a bonnet!    

I didn't really smell any smoke and the restaurant was clean.  Everyone knows that Stroll Inn has one of the best pizzas around but I was in the mood for a sandwich. I ordered the steak hoagie and its served on mancinis hoagie roll.    This hoagie was one of the best I have ever had.   All the ingredients were fresh and with every bite I didn't want this meal to end!!!   The prices are pretty awesome too.. nice variety of items on their menu. Definitely looking forward to going back.
