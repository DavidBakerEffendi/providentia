Seriously, how am I supposed to get lunch anywhere else now?  I just started working downtown and after finding The Bluebird Kitchen I don't think anywhere else will compare.  

First time I went (yesterday) I ordered the Croque Monsieur, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it was an out of body experience.  The brioche bread was amazing, then add the ham and gruyere, and you have an unreal sandwich.  

Today when I went back I ordered the Cuban, and again was thrilled.  I topped it off with a chocolate chip cookie which was delicious as well.  

The only draw back is their lack of seating, but I'll happily take my lunch anywhere I can if it tastes like this.  

If you are downtown for lunch, don't go anywhere else, I don't think I'll be able to...ever.
