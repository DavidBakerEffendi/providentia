I absolutely love this place. 
The service is SUPERB. They have attention to detail, really cater to you, and they're super nice. It's only one waitress doing everything so it's pretty impressive too. Oh, and they people working are from Japan, so they know what they're doing.
The food is amazing! I usually get the Queen special (for dinner). The shrimp is a must-try. Chicken, pork, and beef, SO GOOD. The vegetables are really fresh. If you can, go on a Monday during their happy hour special and try the Kobe beef. It's marbled-goodness!!! 

I recommend it to everyone, especially during the cold nights of Vegas. :)
