My new favorite fastfood joint.

I dropped by here with a friend that wanted some good poutine and decided to trust the yelp reviews.

I was BLOWN AWAY. 9$ for that huge ass delicious poutine?! Dear god. That was the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life. It was cooked to perfection and the fries were also incredibly good. The gravy seemed spicy but not nearly enough to create discomfort. (to yelpers reading this, I normally can't take spicy.)

My friend couldn't even finish her poutine and I was filled for the whole day (rare feat for a 215lbs 6'2 guys).

ABSOLUTE.MUST.TRY. 

They don't have much selection food-wise though but the taste and price make it up by far. Incredible selection of Portuguese drinks and well-priced deserts as well.
The only bad thing is that there is no place to sit.  The tables and chairs are practically all squeezed in and it is kind of uncomfortable especially if you're taller.

GO HERE.

Edit: Still freaking out at how good the damn chicken is. If I wouldn't be 400lbs by the end of the month, I'd eat here everyday. 
P.S. Everything else on the menu is also well worth it like the half-chicken.
