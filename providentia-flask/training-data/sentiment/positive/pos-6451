I freaking love Bloom.  Their menu is classical American with innovative Italian, Asian and French accents and flavors thrown in.  The decor is upscale and the service is fabulous. 

I love, love, love the raviolis, so I highly recommend them. And the peanut crusted prawns are awesome too.  Bloom is one of my favorite places to have dinner, check it out!

PS- they have amazing martinis...be sure to order one, or two!
