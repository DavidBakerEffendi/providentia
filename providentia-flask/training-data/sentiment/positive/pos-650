Beerbistro is one of the few American restaurants in Toronto where I can keep going back again and again and never get tired of it. The atmosphere is quite unique too, not just your typical upscale restaurant - it has a hint of a laid back feeling, like you'd want to be in your sweats in front of a fire pit while enjoying the food and beer.


Their mussels are just amazing. Must try! 

I've tried quite a bit of their dinner menu dishes, and my top picks are the bistro salad (if you're a beet lover), the hot wild flat bread, and the pork belly. Great portions and they don't cheap out on the amount of sauce/toppings/flavours they include in your food. 

There's also beer recommendations beside each food so you know what drinks will compliment what you eat.
