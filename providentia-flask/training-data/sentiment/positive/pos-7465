I was taken here for my birthday and it was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've ever had. 

Upon driving into the establishment the decor (tiki flames, spacing available for valet etc) was absolutely gorgeous and well thought out. 

Everyone from the busser, waiter, to the hostess was warm inviting and so charming. The waitress, was honestly one of the best waitresses I've ever had. She was so genuine and kindly welcoming. Everything she did from the beginning to end was absolutely flawless. 

This was all before we even began to eat, and we were already impressed. We were listed specialities and suggestions and from those I chose the trio fish plate. Which practically melted in my mouth. 

Roy's has definitely perfected the art of creating the an experience for the guest. If they know it's your birthday - all the wait staff that pass by will say happy birthday to you. They gave us free dessert and a framed picture that came as a surprise. 

On a separate occasion, I took my father here as well for his birthday and the experience was paralleled. I highly highly recommend Roy's for the upscale fine dining experience!
