By 5-stars I mean as good as it gets for bar food.  They really do an excellent job here.  Since my last review we've been back a couple of times and continue to have outstanding service and have tried the kobe dog and the grinder.  Everything was great except for one item.  The only complaint I have is they need to get better hot dog buns.  They used the same bun for the dog and for the grinder and it was dried out and way too big for the dog.  It reminded me of those cheap school lunch buns that taste like sugar and stick to the roof of your mouth.  We were able to pick out the innards though and really enjoyed that.  Forget the bun.  It would be much better with fresh bread like Jimmy John's or Flancer's uses.
