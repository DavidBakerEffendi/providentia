I wanted to treat my boyfriend to a nice dinner for our two-year anniversary. I came across this steak house online and found their menu to be mouth-watering. We arrived to a cozy, low-lit atmosphere with extremely friendly staff. Our reservation time was immediately accommodated and we were promptly seated in a quiet corner (when you call to make your reservation, they ask if it's for a special occasion and what it is) Our server was pleasantly chatty and treated us as though I'd imagine she would if she were waiting on family members. We shared drinks, an appetizer, and steaks - all of which were mouthwatering from start to finish.  My steak was large enough that I had leftovers that were perfectly boxed up and enjoyed the next day. A complimentary dessert was brought out in honor of our special day as well. Every part of our visit was phenomenal and worth every dollar spent. We will certainly be back to visit this exquisite Westlake dining treasure.
