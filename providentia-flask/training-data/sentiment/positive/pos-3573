A ramen place where everything tastes fresh and made daily? YUM! Well, for the most part. The noodles taste so delicious! The broth was very light, and tastes fairly healthy. I mean, for it being ramen. The bamboo wasn't as tender as I'm used to. The pork, however, WAS AMAZING. Charred to perfection! 

I had the shio added extra bamboo, which made me sad bc I didn't like their bamboo too much, and the garlic paste, which usually is free at most ramen places. And my boyfriend had the shio, with extra noodles. I like how they give you extra (and fresh) noodles when you're ready for it.

The cook was very friendly! He explained everything to us and kept a nice conversation going!

Overall, 4.5, just wish their bamboo was a little more tender and just a tad more flavor in their broth.. and free garlic paste . With as many ramen spots as there are in Vegas, this place sets itself aside by their daily made products. You can really taste the difference!
