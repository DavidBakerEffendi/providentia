Great tasting cold brew coffee and a nice, convenient location.  I have been getting hazelnut cold brew coffees from here since I moved to the area a few weeks ago.  I wanted to be able to make them at home so I purchased some of their cold brew ground coffee.  The hazelnut flavor is what really makes the drink so Chloe behind the counter said hey, we can sell you the same hazelnut we use in the drinks you love. She also gave me one of their little scoops they use so I could measure out the hazelnut powder into my drink (above and beyond service). Awesome!  She was very friendly and helped facilitate me getting the materials to make my own drinks at home.  Every time I have come in the staff has been friendly, the store has been clean and the coffee has tasted good.  No reason to not give them five stars.
