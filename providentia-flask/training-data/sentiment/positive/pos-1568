Ok, so I love Ramen. And it's been hard to find a place that has a pretty tasty broth with their noodles. But this place, was so good ya'll.

So to start, you're sitting at a counter facing the wonderful gentleman that prepare your freshly made-in-house ramen noodles. You have the cutest little menu with an easy system: check off what you'd like in your bowl; from broth type, to the extra toppings that you can use to enhance your flavor. I did Shoyu, added seaweed, and extra noodles. I added black garlic oil but they were all out and happily replaced it with regular garlic.

What I liked was that they also place little canisters at your place setting with chili sauce, chili oil, seasoning, and ginger. Adding those truly made the flavor pop. 

They also leave a little carafe of water at your setting so you can serve yourself. 

Service was fast, friendly, and yummy. They pay attention to their guests, and check on you to make sure that you were taken care of. And good news, prices weren't too bad. 

Be back next week!
