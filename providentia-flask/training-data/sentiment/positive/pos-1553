After the CN Tower climb, i wanted to treat myself to khao san Road... it had been a long wait and a long walk and an even longer wait to get back down the tower.... It was 9:30 already and i thought for sure KSR would have seats.... wrong! with about 15 people still lining up, I was heartbroken that I didn't choose to try Smoke's instead.

I saw that Ravi soups was next door and my coworkers rave about it so we walked in there instead. The place was empty but they said they were still serving food.

I opted for the chicken wrap and a mushroom soup - because it claimed ti have truffle oil... yum truffles...and S got the same wrap but with a butternut apple soup.

We parked our butts on the beautiful long tree trunk of a table and waited patiently as our meal came on its separate swivelling susan. The wrap was beautifully wrapped and grilled, looking like a pocket ready to explode in my mouth! At first bite, I was really in love with all the flavours, all the ingredients and all the SAUCE! It was hearty, but not heavy, filling but not overload, and tasty without the grease. it was packed with goodness and I did not want it to end.

The mushroom soup was good, but i have to say the butternut was better - it was just more flavourful and had a surprising kick every once in a while. I didn't taste any truffle in the mushroom soup but I did like the fact it was not creamy heavy, but more stock and mushroom. Also being a really chilly day, I wished that the soup was hotter.

The staff was cleaning and never rushed us out even though it was getting late. I kept eyeing the banana bread on the counter as I was walking out... maybe I'll have to get a slice the next time I come back.

For simple good comfort food .... you really can't get much better than this.
