Juan's is my favorite sit down restaurant I come here every sunday for a bowl of pozole or my next go to steak enchiladas en tomatillo! yum!!! all the food I have tried is delicious...the staff is amazing !!!! every single person! food comes out fast, drinks are never empty, chips and dips at your table as soon as you sit! needless to say this place has me as a customer forever!!!!!
