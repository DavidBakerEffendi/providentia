Sushi Samba is one of me and my bf's favorite restaurants! We go there every time we are in Vegas. 

My BF and I visited the Restaraunt last night w/ some old friends last night and a manager named Jeremy made his way to the table to introduce himself. Jeremy was very nice and pleasant and told us that if we needed anything to let him know. 
I told Jeremy that we were here celebrating my BF moving to Europe temporarily to work on a fashion project and that Sushi Samba was our favorite Restaraunt and we were here to celebrate ! 

Jeremy came back with an appetizer on the house for us ! This was such a nice gesture letting me know that establishments like sushi samba takes good care of there regulars guest which will keep me going to this Restaraunt every single time I am in Vegas ! 

Our server was awesome and very patient ! I forgot his name but he was very nice and had a great smile ! 

Good job customer service sushi samba ! I'll be back :)
