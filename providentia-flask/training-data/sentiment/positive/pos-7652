BBQ is probably my favorite food.  Given that it's usually pricey, usually takes a while to make/purchase, and is hard to find REALLY REALLY good, I never imagined I would ever eat BBQ more than once or twice a month.

Enter That BBQ Joint.  My cousin, a fellow BBQ expert, went and told me immediately the following day.  I went, and was so blown away, I went back the very next day for more.  Come to find out my cousin also went back two days in a row.

What's good:  The ribs, the rib tips, the brisket, the pulled pork, the chicken wings, the smoked chicken salad.  Any of the meat that is smoked.  Because that is what it tastes like:  SMOKE.  The dry rub is good, and the sauce does not distract or detract, but the real show here is the quality of the meat itself and the manner in which it is smoked.  That's really the whole show.

I typically get the fried corn on the cob and fried macaroni & cheese as sides.  They come a la cart.  I've tried many of the other sides, and none of them were bad, but none of them were memorable.

I have a friend who cant wait to try TBBQJ's meat with Papa Bear's BBQ sauce, since Papa Bear's has arguably the best sauce in Madison.  I'm scared to do it myself.
