Beautiful weather. Clear blue skies. Sunny and warm out about 70 degrees with a cool breeze. Wonderful courtyard setting with fountains and well manicured grounds. Terrific food and service. Sounds like a romantic scene out of a movie? Too good to be true?

I would have thought that too, except I actually experienced it. Definitely not any typical museum cafe. The menu is limited but what they offer is an eclectic selection of gourmet type sandwiches, appetizers, and cocktails.

On the day we visited it was a stunningly clear sunny day. Before heading into the Heard Museum we decided to grab some lunch here. Perfect choice! Started with the prickly pear lemonade. Only $3.50 for a large glass and our waiter brought over a carafe of it for our table. We ordered two of the most delicious sandwiches. Turkey, brie, and sliced granny smith apples on toasted walnut cranberry bread. Panko crusted chicken sandwich with fresh mozzarella, tomato, and pesto sauce on ciabatta bread. Both were quite big and filling for only $13 each. They came with a side garden salad or quinoa salad. The waiter told us the quinoa salad made with with black beans was a favorite and we could see why - it was mighty tasty. 

This was like Heaven. If there were only some hammocks or recliners on the grounds to take a nap after our meal would have made it even better. It was so nice out we really did not want to leave but we had to give ourselves enough time to view the museum.
