I just love this place!! 

It's about 20 min out of the way for me, but worth it! It's run / owned by authentic New Yorkers and OMG do they have the best bagels. They all work as a team and get it done. Even if you see a line, which is very possible. It's totally worth it!! 


My order:
Egg bagel toasted open face with butter and Munster melted on top

My friend likes the Lox. If you don't want pickles, remember to ask for no pickles.
