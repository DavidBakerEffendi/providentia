I can honestly say that I think this restaurant is consistently the best value in Toronto. Service is impeccable. I remember a year ago when I had a birthday here with friends and one of them commented on their steak, a server overheard this from quite some distance away and immediately brought them a new steak. 
This place sets the standard for how a chain should be run.
