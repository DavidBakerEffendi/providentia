So many delicious vegan options! Everything was outrageously good. We got the sampler appetizer, and Jasmine's favorite rice dish. Off the charts good. High ingredients. Very fresh. Our server was knowledgeable and very helpful. Can't wait to go back. The hummus was indescribably yummy and the falafel was to die for. Also, probably best hot sauce we've had ever. If you're looking for a greasy, fattening meal, go somewhere else. If you want to eat interesting flavors and feel good after, give it a try. It's even BYOB!
