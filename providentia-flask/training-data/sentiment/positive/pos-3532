AMAZING! Our experience last night for our bachelorette dinner was nothing short of awesome. Couple tips:

-this place is kind of a tapas style menu, definitely order a few things to share amount your group
-make a reservation. Whether it's for lunch or dinner
-they have happy hour!! 4-7, 11-close everyday except for Saturday
-if you have a big group, definitely do an "omakase style" dining, basically, you tell your server your likes and dislikes, and you tell him the price you want to stay at per person. 

We had a group of ten girls, they so kindly brought out a cocktail tree for our bride, which contained different cocktails, and we got sooo much food. I am a girl who never leaves food uneaten and we had so much left over, we stayed $40 per person. Special shout out to Carmine for being a great server, and jade and Rannah for taking care of the girls. 

Atmosphere- fun, lively, good for date nights or group dinners.
