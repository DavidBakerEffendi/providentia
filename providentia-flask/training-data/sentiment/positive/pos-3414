If you're not looking for Lang Van, I can't imagine why you'd be in this neighborhood... It's worth venturing off the beaten path to get there though! I love their iced coffee and swear I can feel the sugar and caffeine literally coursing through my veins as I drink the sweet, thick, ice-cold concoction. 

The menu is super overwhelming and I often have a hard time deciding. (That is, when my heart isn't set on #19, of course.) If you can't decide, just ask the owner... I've told her so many times, "I love fresh veggies and am in the mood for something spicy with lots of herbs, maybe some chicken..." She'll listen for a second or two, grin and exclaim, "I fix good for you!" I've even been before and ordered something only to be told, "No. You don't want that. You want #XYZ instead." Without fail, she's ALWAYS right. I don't know how she does it, but her recommendation is always exactly what I'm craving and hits the spot every time. 

Lang Van's food is fresh and flavorful! Trust me... set your GPS to take you to Shamrock Road, ask the nice lady the seats you for her recommendation and get ready to enjoy! Oh, and don't forget that iced coffee.
