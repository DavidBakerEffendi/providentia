Seriously great food! It's changed hands recently and it only got better!!

They only serve white meat chicken in every dish! Never any grizzle / chewy pieces, you can taste the love they put in to make sure their food stands out from the normal Chinese/Asian restaurants. By far my favorite spot in the valley and it's just been bumped up to 6 stars with the change in ownership. 

The orange chicken (remember no grizzle) isn't like your typical breaded fluff with a tiny piece of dark meat chicken inside, this is all white meat with a light batter, amazing.  

The Happy Family has a little of everything beef, chicken, red pork, and shrimp...big juicy shrimp. 

Lastly, the Chicken Chow Fun is superb, the orange chicken used to be my wife's favorite till I brought home all three of the above, and now she craves the chow fun. 

I'll say this, as I think it should be said, I can't get my wife to eat Chinese style food anywhere, she only eats at wongs. She doesn't like the grizzly bits that every other place uses to cut corners and increase their margins. 

The staff is awesome, super friendly and will make you feel like you're truly a guest.  

Do yourself a favor and add this to your list of family run restaurants to visit, you won't be disappointed...this place is SO awesome that I'm currently sitting in another higher end Chinese Restaurant updating my review for wongs cause I wish I was there!
