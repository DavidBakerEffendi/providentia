This place has the same owner as the gelato store across the street. 

I come here from North York just to have a meal here followed up by a gelato from across the street. 

I come here for:

Great food
Great service
Stylish yet not obnoxious 
Has a small patio area
Lunch specials- $15 for a pizza, house wine and salad

The pizzas are delicious!
