My family and I decided to stop in here last Sunday for breakfast before church . When we walked in the hostess greeted us and sat us pretty quickly for how busy they were. Our waitresses name was Meg and she was an amazing server. After we received our food the manager Saul came over to ask us how our meal was and to see if we needed a refill on our coffee. I loved the fact that even though they were very busy he still took the time to go up to everyone's table and make sure everything was okay. Will definitely be back!!!
