I am giving this 5 stars based on Happy Hour alone. Apparently, they pioneered the concept of the reverse happy hour, so kudos to them. That's not why I am writing. Get there for the happy hour and you couldn't be happier. $2.50 well drinks poured with some oomph, and killer appetizers deals. Get the mussels! Yes, sometimes they are better than others, but always good. I recommend also the escargot and the shrimp bread. wowza!
