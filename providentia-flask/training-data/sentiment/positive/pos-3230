Hello fellow foodies after looking at all the 5 star reviews on this place and it only being a 5 minute drive from my place I decided to drop by and see what all the great review's were all about myself.
I normally review a restaurant mostly based on customer service and quality of food not so much what the restaurant looks like unless it's not clean etc ...
So keep this in mind this place is located in a middle of an industrial park in between two auto shops and it's by no means a nice looking place a small unit with few tables very industrial interior I wouldn't even call it a restaurant as far as atmosphere is concerned,  however please dont let this sway you from stopping in at this small husband and wife run place the food was just incredible.
Let's start with the amazing customer service you get personally from the owners who serve you, they are so nice and go out of there way to make sure your happy with there freshly made food super nice people.
The food was fresh , nan was made right in front of me while I waited doesn't get any fresher then that , the butter chicken I ordered for take out was creamy , chicken was tender and just full of flavor,  not overly spicey but just perfect and a large portion more then one person can eat , the garlic nan was just amazingly tasty garlicky fresh perfectly cooked its was the greatest combo with my butter chicken ...this place deserves a full 5 star rating for there food quality and taste and amazing customer service I recieved. Go out and try this place out you wont regret it.
