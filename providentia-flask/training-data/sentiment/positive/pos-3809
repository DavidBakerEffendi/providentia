Oh yes, it is true, I have found a new favorite Thai place. And yes I will drive back to the complete other side of town for this spice again, and again, and again. 
I was dining solo, and on Durango so I figured  would take my fellow Elite yelper Shawn's recommendation for Thai. I walked into Pan Asian and was greeted and told to sit anywhere. As I went over the menu, I couldn't help but hear the table of 6 across from me talk about this place and "their spice level". One guy said how he won't go over a level 5. 
If you know me, and spicy, I was instantly intrigued! I ordered some pot stickers (some of the best I have ever had) and the order of garlic and black pepper chicken, level 8. The boss/server guy looked at me and said "here, level 8 is very spicy, not like other Thai" I simply looked back, smiled, and said "GOOD."
When my plate arrived I could see the spicy. I started to get a bit nervous but then brushed it off. I was there alone, and I just told the boss I can handle it, can't wimp out now! 
It was perfection! Yes I may have ordered a 2nd Thai iced tea, and my eyes may have been a bit watery at times. But did I finish it? YES. Will I order it again? HELL YES. 
I love being the white girl who impresses the old Thai people. When my guy came to check on me he asked if it was too spicy, I told him it indeed was spicy, but perfectly spicy. 
It's about time there is a place I can brag about to my friends when they want a real heat level. Good quality Thai food, and great service. I can't wait to return and try something else!!
