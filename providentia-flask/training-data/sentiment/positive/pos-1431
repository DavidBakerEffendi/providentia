I love pita jungle! Healthy but delicious! My favorite thing is the chicken hummus trio with the extra special and fluffy pita bread and some siracha. Make sure to ask for the special fluffy pita bread! A healthy alternative to this dish would be no pita bread  and just extra cucumbers... It's just as good in case your watching the carbs!
