An absolutely amazing place to be with friends and family playing some weirdly different board games that you probably never knew existed or even some
Of you favourites when you were younger. 

The staff is friendly and will show you how to play if you can't figure it. The food is reasonably priced and the cover charge of $8 does not hurt. 

With a large group from work as a fun event, we had a blast. The crowd was mainly millennials when we went and had some great time with them as well. 

Would go again for sure!
