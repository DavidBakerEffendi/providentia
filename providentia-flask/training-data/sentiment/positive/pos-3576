Consistently Killing it !! The extra shot in my latte makes a golden brown residue that clings to the walls of my cup all the way to the bottom until the very last sip. Bunch of professionals pulling shots here. I watch people go to $tarbuck$ across the street and often wonder what the hell they are thinking ?!??! They are steps away from delicious goodness and choose middle of the road........turn around and go to analog people !! They also carry Sidewalk Citizen baked goods and thats the Icing on the cake.
