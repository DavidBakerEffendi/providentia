Fantastic little eatery beside the decaying Dominos pizza joint on hwy7 and Main Street.  Portions are gigantic and the attention to detail is fantastic.  The 5 of us came aren't exact lightweights in the art of devouring but Ye Olde Village Bistro almost knocked us out with their portions.

We ordered just about one of each type of omelette as it was said to come with pancakes. Big mistake, it was delicious but we had to claw and scratch to finish the food.
