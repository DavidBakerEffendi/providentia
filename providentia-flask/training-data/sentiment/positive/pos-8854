HOLY HELL! NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL A MOTHERF***ING SAMMICH!

I had been hearing from my best bud, that there's this place in Tucson called Jimmy John's that has awesome sammiches.  We'll lo and behold they opened one here in Tempe and by the way my friend kept describing the subs I decided to finally go and get one for lunch. I got a Turkey Tom and wow, that freaking sammich was awesome! The subs are long and soft, and they're full of yumminess. The bread is tasty and it tastes like bread. Turkey tasted like Meat. It was like there was a party in mouth and everyone came! I would definitely recommend it.
