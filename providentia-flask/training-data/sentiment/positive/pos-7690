My new breakfast spot!!!  The veggie breakfast skillet is my favorite.
Lots of veggies and seasoned potatoes. I asked them to go easy on the cheese and they did it perfectly.  My hubby tried the sweet potato/apple skillet and really enjoyed it. It's always fun to try something different. 
Love this place!
