This is my favorite breakfast spot in the Phoenix area! I used to live right by Tempe Town lake, and one of my favorite things to do on the weekends was to hike up A mountain and then grab brunch at Ncounter.  I always ordered either an omelet or the chopped salad. Delicious! And you can sit outside on the patio with your dog!
