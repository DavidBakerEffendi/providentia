This was one of the most wonderful places to go to!
Especially for birthdays!
Everything tasted like wine, the food was beyond great.
The stuffed mushrooms ruled the earth!
The seafood diablo was the shit!!
The chocolate mouse tasted like a shot of booze!

I loved the atmosphere and the classiness. The twinkly white lights, it was so Liberace chic. 
Every room was beautiful, and so was the bar. This was one of the last great las Vegas gems to fade out.

Every time I drive by I get sad.
I was 16 when i had my "nice" birthday dinner there. 
I wish this place would just come back!!!!!
