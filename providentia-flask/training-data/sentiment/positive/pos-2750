Their ingredients were VERY fresh and the meat is properly prepared for Shabu Shabu. I brought my 6 y/o with me and she loved how great the shrimp tasted. The server was very nice and explained everything in detail since it was our first time. She had so much patience with my daughter and would ask for her opinion and brought out utensils and chopstick holders for her. 
The dessert is delicious and the esthetic of the restaurant is modern yet comfortable.
