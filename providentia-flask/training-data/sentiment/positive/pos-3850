First time at Da Valley Grill today. Arrived for lunch at noon and it was empty. Plenty of customers by the time we left tho. 

We ordered a Chicken Katsu plate with potato salad and drink and I got a Bento Box (three item plate) with Chicken Katsu, Spam Musabi and Kailua Pork, along with cole slaw and a drink. Both plates came with rice. 

The rice was good, if a bit dry. The slaw had a good flavor, was fresh and crunchy. Spam was also good but cut a bit thinner than I expected. The Katsu and the Pork were the highlight of the meal. The Katsu was crunchy but still light, juicy and flavorful. The accompanying sweet sauce was on the side, as I prefer. It was sweet, with hints of garlic, ginger and soy. The hoisin flavor was pronounced. The pork was very juicy with good smoke flavor. 

I recommend the Bento Box, as well as Da Valley Grill for a fast, very tasty lunch.
