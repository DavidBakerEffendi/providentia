Usually my go to pho place in Brampton when I have a cold or the weather warrants hot soup, but I have had a few concerns/observations as of late.  1st the only server they have is a brooding teenager with headphones on...only one earbud in.  I know u can hear me bro cuz when I ask for a tea while I'm waiting you always comply.  When someone says thank you, normal people usually say your welcome!  This dude usually just looks into space with a blank look on his face...ok maybe your parents force you to work at the family business, but, shit, get a personality, I mean, your in the service industry! At least fake some semblance of a smirk or smile!  The broth and noodles are very good, but that's pretty much it...u only get three small slices of beef!  You might as well call it noodle pho! Not enough beef to warrant calling it beef pho.  I'll still go here when I'm sick, but only on Tuesday's cuz it's 20% off and I'll call my order in to avoid feeling bad for making the server do something! Maybe he wanted to do something great or pursue his passions,and hence, he hates his parents and customers from preventing him to do so.  How dare they! Make him work and help put food on the family table smh.  One star for each slice of beef!  The service at this place is not a reason to avoid, the best pho in b-town hands down, if u want friendly courteous service tho'...although he's getting much better. My moms tone is similar to his moms lol (Asian) it could drive one to wear headphones and long for greener pastures sometimes, so being in similar shoes. Understandable
