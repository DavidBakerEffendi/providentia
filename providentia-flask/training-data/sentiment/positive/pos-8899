Excellent cookies.  The banana white chocolate was amazing. 

They have the cookies displayed in neat tableware, vases, jars, etc.  The baker came out to chat, and really made the whole experience great.

The chocolate chip were excellent.  You can't go wrong.  Get at least one of whatever they have.  You won't be disappointed!
