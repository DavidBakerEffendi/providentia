This place is bombskies.  We got the combo plate (meat jun, kalbi, and BBQ chicken) and the kalbi plate to go.  I'll admit that the $17 kalbi plate with 4 slices of kalbi was a little more pricey than it should have been.  However, that was probably the only setback we had with this restaurant.  Even though we were only getting take-out, the service was awesome.  Employees were smiling, friendly to customers, and really turned "just picking up some food" to an experience which makes me want to try this place again (and wouldn't mind dine in).

This really is an island style Korean BBQ kinda place.  The plates even came with kimchee and mac salad.  Definitely worth going back for!
