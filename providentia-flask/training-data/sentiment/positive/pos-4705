This place is great! Friendly people, great food and some of the best house coffee I've had since I visited Seattle. Go on the weekend and they have a great variety of music playing. The sandwiches are really well done and made with fresh ingredients and I've sampled most of them and not been disappointed. As I said, the coffee is spot-on wonderful. 

Perfect place to enjoy a weekend with good friends. Oh, and it's haunted--does it get any better than that! Cheers !
