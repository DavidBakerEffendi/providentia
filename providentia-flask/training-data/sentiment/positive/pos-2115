Loved everything about this place! It's very cute inside, service was really good and food tasted great. I had the turkey club sandwhich w/a side of fries. My boyfriend had their black bear burger w/a side of fries. Both of us were completely satisfied. Cannot wait to go again and try more of what's on their menu.
