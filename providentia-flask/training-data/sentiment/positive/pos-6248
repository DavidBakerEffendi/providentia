Drove from Scottsdale to eat here on my lunch today for their amazing wraps. I ordered the same one I always get (Parmesan Chicken Salad) and it wasn't quite the same as it normally is. 

I let them know and there was no hesitation. They remade it and brought it out to me promptly. I am pretty particular, but they were very accommodating during their busy lunch hour. 

The service and food quality here are always on point. Definitely my favorite Brunch place in Tempe.
