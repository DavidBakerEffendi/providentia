I'm surprised to see all the reviews mentioning slow/bad service. I've always had great service here, even when the place was fairly busy. I don't often go on NFL Sundays or for real big sporting events, so maybe that's the tough time. 

Food is mostly good in my opinion. Nothing incredibly special, but I have always gotten what I expected! I will continue to visit fairly regularly.
