After a visit to San Francisco Chinatown to eat Ramen noodles, I had a huge craving for real ramen noodles.  A friend of mine recommended Musashi as an authentic Japanese restaurant, so I decided to give it a try.

I ordered the udon noodle soup and it was almost what I remember eating in San Francisco.  I also ordered a small roll just to try the sushi.   Both were excellent.  

It's great that we can get authentic Japanese food in Charlotte.  I just wish it wasn't such a drive for me.
