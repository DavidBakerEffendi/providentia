Came here during a rush on a Saturday afternoon, and hey were amazing. During the rush, none of the employees just frustrated or overwhelmed which can easily happen. You know how sometimes restaurants get in a rush and fall behind on prepping the food so they skim orders? Kyklos does NOT do that. The order was large enough to share and seriously tasted amazing. Maybe it's because I've never had Greek Food before, but my taste buds were crazy (which may have caused me to super stuff myself and roll out of the mall). Their food is a must try, AND they give free samples of the meat which super hooked me because I knew I needed it the moment I tasted their Gyro meat. Which by the way, holy crap so good! I ordered the gyro fries and it was definitely a treat. So good to see real food in a mall food court.
