My favorite pizza hands down, so delicious you can't stop eating it, until the heartburn kicks in...The original crust, sauce and cheese is always consistent. For years and years since I was a kid and grew up eating Peter Piper it has been the same great taste, and kinda reminds me a little bit of home and childhood. I do feel weird coming here just because I always imagine this place more for kids but during lunch there are nothing but adults here, I imagine because their buffet is such a great deal. This location is also huge and always clean, friendly staff, I can never get tired of their food, so good!!
