Lovely night!!! 
Perfect weather outside now, and you have the option of inside the cafe or outside in their lovely patio!! 
We picked the patio area, open aired, and not noisy at all, being that it's close to the street. Great customer service!! A++
_ Delicious food, we ordered the Mango Shrimp!! Oh soo delightful with well proportioned mango squares, avocado, cilantro and lime!!! YUM!! 
** Oh and we also went with the Tuesday special, which was Bruschetta and your pick of Wine, for the Bruschetta, you can pick three and we chose, the Fresh Mozzarella + Basil + Tomato, also the Brie + Apples + Honey and the famous Prosciutto + Mascarpone + Figs + Honey!!! OH SOO YUM!! An explosion of full flavors inside your mouth, everything from sweet to sour!!!  :) 
What a Great Combo, as for wine, we went with their ever soo fruity New Age, Torrentes!! Which was indeed a great pick!!! 
Fully satisfied!!! :)
