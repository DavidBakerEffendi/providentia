OK, so I'm just going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars.

Of all the "boutique" burger joints who've infiltrated beef-lovin' Toronto in the past couple of years, W Burger Bar's burgers, and onion rings, have risen above all the rest.

Burger options are endless and most additional toppings are free (awesome!), and we're not just talking fancy sauces. Definitely try their panko-crusted onion rings, which are huge, delicious, and enough to share between three people. 

Service is average - they look to be university girls making extra beer money, so who really cares - but if you get a chance to talk to the owner (?), a jolly older man, he's the kinda guy that loves to hear what you think about the place. The space is comfortable and dressed up, though there are signs of it's past life in the scratched up walls, and there are flat screen TVs broadcasting sports 'round the clock.

But all those things aside, let me reiterate that the burgers are delicious.

Next on my list to try? Their spiked milkshakes..... mmm..., and maybe a splurge on their $20 Kobe beef burger.
