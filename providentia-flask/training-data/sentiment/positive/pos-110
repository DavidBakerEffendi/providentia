The sauce of the week was made by some local grown NC chili peppers. Vic tossed some on my third dog for a try. It is pretty warm and flavorful but nothing so hot that requires you to be a professional fire eater.

Vic does take credit cards!!
Well actually he is using square up so if you have the wallet app on your phone your good to go.

Great place for a great hot dog.

(Update) After talking to Vic, The F-Bomb sauce may or may not be too hot for you. You can ask for a taste first.
