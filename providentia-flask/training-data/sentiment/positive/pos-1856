Have stopped at another TRH previously in Mesa. Experience was not enjoyable. Service was poor and the food did not live up to the reputation promoted by this chain. 
We have a new Roadhouse that opened in Chandler a year ago and decided to give it a try. 
We decided to sit at the bar in order to watch the NBA finals. We were greeted shortly after siting down and got our drinks in very short order. I decided to try there before 6 PM special, a 6 oz. sirloin steak. Ordered the sweet potato and veggies. Within about 15 minutes our meals arrived and they looked great. After the first bite I was astounded in the quality and the taste of my steak. It looked like a filet and further tastes like one. It was outstanding. The sweet potato and the veggies were also very good. The wife had the chicken fried steak. It also was huge and well presented. 

Overall, we were impressed with the service, the food and the venue. This really changes my impression of the TRH. Not sure if this restaurant is unique or if the chain has improved their product. I will return to his location to try again. The warlike bird specials are an excellent value. You can't eat like this at a fast food restaurant For this price .
