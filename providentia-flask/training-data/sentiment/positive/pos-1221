My husband and I go here for pho when we are in the area and its well worth the trip. The pho is always delicious and boith is so flavorful! We have never got any other entree other than pho, but tempted after seeing the pictures on yelp. For drinks, try the coconut drink or lemon soda, both very good! Be careful, it's not free refills, but I usually drink about two. For appetizers, the shrimp eggs rolls and spring rolls are very good choices.
