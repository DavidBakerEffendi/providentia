Peppermill is by far my favorite diner in the world!! Maybe it's because it was featured in both my favorite movies.showgirls and casino.  But I love it here. The breakfast is amazing. Best hash brown ever!!! The food is so tasty, the price is great. The service is wonderful!  The decorations is just vintage vegas. I love every Lil thing about this place. From the clown sugar to the blue uniforms the waitress wear. I pray to God this place never closes. It's the real deal vintage vegas.
