Excellent Greek Food.  I have been hooked on the Chicken Greek Salad for years.  They cook their chicken fresh with all kinds of herbs & fresh lemons.  The flavor is out of this world!!! Everyone is always so friendly and nice offering good service & a sample of the meat.  I highly suggest trying this spot.  I go to the mall just to get their food to go and take back to work.
