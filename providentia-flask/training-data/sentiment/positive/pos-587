I really enjoyed this place. The service was actually very good & friendly. I did not enter the bar section, but decided to stay in the restaurant area. The staff working there did not keep bothering me every 10 seconds, like most places, and that deserves an A+. The food was superb & well priced. Also, it was nice to eat out as a family (of 3) for under $30 and know that it's on the healthier side. 
For the second time now, this place has been a good night out. I like the vibe and the promptness of the kitchen. You'll definitely see me again!
