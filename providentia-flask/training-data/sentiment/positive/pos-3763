I discovered this place from yelp and I'm glad I did.  Though this is called a bakery, I see this more of a nice local restaurant than an actual bakery.  It has a small part for bakery (just a table), deli (one refridgerated counter), a decent size area for sitting in, a cafe for real espresso, and a pretty big area for hot table and PIZZA!

I tried 3 items from here over 2 visits and this place will have me coming back for real Italian comfort foods.  I got a 'fresh from the oven' veggie slice pizza.  This is not your trendy Neopolitan style pizza that is all the rage in downtown TO.  This is the old school Sicilian fluffy substantial interior but crunchy exterior.  Great  flavourful crust and it's covered in fresh tasty toppings.  I haven't seen this many toppings in a long time.  My veggie pizza was loaded with mushrooms, peppers, broccoli, onions, and cheese.  It was so good.  I also had their basa filet on Friday and it was perfectly cooked.  Moist interior with a nice drizzle of olive oil on top and seasoned with herbs.  I got 2 sides with it and they were so big for the price!  I couldn't finish everything.  I got roasted vegetables and potatoes.  Potatoes had that great crispy crust with a tender insides and roasted vegetable had a phenomenal herb mixture on top.  

I also love the service.  This place is so personable even if you're new to it.  Happy, smiling, ready to serve, and ready to answer any questions.  I think this place is a requirement on everyone's list should they need a great simple and quick Italian meal.  For Italian hot table and simple comforting pizza, this is as good as it gets.  The food isn't fussy, elaborate, or life changing but the service pushes it from 4 star to a 5 star for me.
