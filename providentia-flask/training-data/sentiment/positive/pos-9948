It has to be a tie between this location and the one in Vaughan. They are equally amazing.

I love celebrating special occasions at the Keg. They make you feel special and welcomed. The complimentary dessert and cute card is also appreciated. 

Steak here is always delicious, the one time I tried the Teriyaki Steak and didn't love it they made me a good ol' plain steak for me! The bread at the start is amazing, and they have an extensive wine list. And don't even get me started on the garlic mash potatoes... OUT OF THIS WORLD. 

My only complaint is that not all wines are available by the glass. But everything else is A+
