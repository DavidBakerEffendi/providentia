Saw a bag of Ruffles fall out of a crackheads dress when she picked her wedgie at this bar. Lots of great beer, real good vegan/veg/meat food.  Always some sort of entertainment/food/unique event/retarded party/idiot local causing a scene at this bar.... always a good time. VIP section for the regulars, great outdoor patios. Can Bar out back.... so you don't have to listen to the band and you can smoke your cigs if ya need to.
