Loved everything. My favorite was the pork buns. The fried brussel sprouts -OMG you think you hate brussels? Try these babies, you won't regret it. Had the miso Ramen and green tea ice cream. Both equally amazing and bursting with flavor. The only downside was that it's difficult to see/find. Would be good to have more signage if possible. But I am not going to rate lower because of that because the food was so good!
