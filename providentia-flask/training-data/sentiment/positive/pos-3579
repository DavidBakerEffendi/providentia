Meat packed tortillas and great customer service put this food truck on the fast track to success! This was my first experience with Tacos Rick-o, but definitely will not be my last...

I had heard very good things about TR prior to my visit and it all made sense. A nice fancy flat screen greets you at the window filled with all their delicious menu items. The prices are spot-on and leave plenty of room to explore several different options.

I settled on a couple street tacos (carne asada, carnitas) and some chips and queso. Even as busy as things were between Kit's Trackside Crafts and Pintville they managed to crank out the orders in pretty good time. Both street tacos did not lack ingredients or flavor! The tortilla chips were delicious as well as the cheese sauce - but there could definitely be more cheese, maybe even drizzled over the top! The 'dillas also were popular that night and looked very delicious! 

Now, it makes sense why they voted "Best of Charlotte!" Follow them on the social channels and track them down to get your Mexican grub on!
