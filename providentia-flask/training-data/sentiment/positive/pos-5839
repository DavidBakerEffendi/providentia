Can't get much better than this.  A great variety of toppings and homemade sauces and his special grilled cheese.  Sounds clich√©, but the hardest part of going here is deciding what to get.  My top two are the frito pie dog and the traffic light but I add one of his special sauces (like siracha ginger).

Get there early, there's often a line.  If you search him on Facebook, he often has "special" dogs for just that day, too.
