Based off the food alone I'm giving this place five stars! My first time here but I'm sure it won't be my last, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Came in for brunch and bottomless mimosas and I couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the food. I had a breakfast bowl and the home fries were amazing, but the whole dish was excellent. My sister and her friend both got the chicken wings and waffles and the chicken was amazingly well seasoned. I didn't really have high expectations as I've never been to this place before, but the quality of food and the taste was so good I just wasn't expecting it.
