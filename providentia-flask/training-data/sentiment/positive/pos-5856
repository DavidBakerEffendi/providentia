The Chapli Kebab was amazing. Freshly cooked and stuffed warm goat cheese, the minced meat texture was smooth and satisfying. This was the highlight of the meal.

The rice comes in very large portions. We ordered two mains, the platter of bread/na'an, a rice and the kebabs and this was far too much for two people (noted for next time!). I would still go for the kebabs next time, so in my opinion I'd do rice and 1 main + kebabs.

I had the Khurchan Chicken Curry. It was very good, but the medium was much spicier than I'm used to (though this was expected). I wish there was a spiciness level between medium (which is actually hot) and mild (which is not).

Service was great. The staff are very patient and willing to explain to you anything you want and also offer recommendations.
