My husband and I went in here with our toddler for dinner and it was delicious. We shared the shrimp tacos and the longaniza burger. Everything was very fresh. I loved the sauce on the tacos. With the burger, none of the flavors were overpowering and all blended together really well. The burger was cooked at a perfect medium. There wasn't much that we could give to the toddler, but I wouldn't hold that against anyone and they were really accommodating on finding something that he would eat, which ended being toast lol. The server was very friendly and attentive and even the chef came out to ask how it was. We would most definitely go again.
