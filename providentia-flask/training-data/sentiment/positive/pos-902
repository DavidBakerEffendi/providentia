What can I say about In-N-Out burger that people don't already know? I think they've mastered the art of the drive-through burger joint. 

Double Double, protein style, with onions. Animal fries. Optional strawberry shake. It always comes out the same way (delicious), it's always fresh, the staff is always polite and helpful. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at an In-N-Out in my whole life. 

Top marks for consistency and deliciousness.
