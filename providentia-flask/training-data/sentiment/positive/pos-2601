With Chiasso gone from the area (the landlord terminated their lease--funny that it is correctly marked as closed on Yelp but not on Chiasso's own website), there was a need for a great coffee shop in the area (some might say Caffe Beano, but I'm not a fan of their service).  We went in yesterday afternoon and ordered a vanilla latte and a caramel latte.  Although mine (caramel) was a bit too sweet, it was one of the best lattes I've ever had.  The cashier / barista was very nice, too.

You might be able to find parking depending what time you go, but this is a very busy area.

I'll definitely be back to Analog.
