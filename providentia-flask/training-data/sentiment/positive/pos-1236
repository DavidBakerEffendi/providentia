Please eat here so that it doesn't go out of business!! I can't understand how this gem of a Japanese restaurant has gone so long without proper recognition. Last time I went on a Saturday night, there was only one other table. This makes me sad. 

I found out about this restaurant from a Japanese friend. I think part of the reason it's so quiet is because of the somewhat awkward location... West of Christie, it's just outside of Koreatown and it's East of Ossington before the Bloor strip gets busier. The area around RIkishi consists of mostly Ethiopian and Eritrean restaurants, video rentals, and convenience stores. 

Anyways, the FOOD!! It's amazing and you can find a lot of authentic Japanese dishes that you won't get elsewhere -- e.g. natto (if that's your thing), pressed sushi (comes in these cool cube shapes). We opted to order a bunch of small dishes to share, like tapas. It's more expensive to order this way (instead of the sets or bentos), but great for variety. We had black cod terikyaki, mushrooms foilyaki (buttery goodness...), eggplant with ginger and bonito flakes, tempura soba, Rikishi udon, grilled saba with miso sauce, gyoza, lotus root croquettes and some maki rolls... Everything was beautifully presented, fresh, and oishii (delicious!!).

Also, there is a separate vegetarian menu with a lot of choices. 

The space is pretty plain, with some posters of Japanese art. We got the private tatami room which was cozy. Service was attentive and polite. Our waitress made sure our tea cups never went empty! 

We paid $95 (incl. tax but not tip, didn't order any alcohol) for 4 people, which I thought was extremely reasonable for dinner and for such great food. The portions for the appetizers/sharing dishes are very small though, so I would recommend ordering a few to start and keeping a menu at the table in case you want to add more. 

Excellent, authentic Japanese dining experience!! Please see for yourself!
