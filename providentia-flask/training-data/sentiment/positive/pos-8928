Oh my gosh. This is the best place in Madison. I'm from out of town and I got excited when my friend told me about it. 

I'm a breakfast gal and they serve breakfast ALL DAY here! I was so happy! 

I got the Saturday Special. Biscuits and Fire-Roasted pepper gravy with two eggs over medium, a side of bacon and potatoes. 

Amazing. Every bite was mouth watering. See pictures. My friends and I split a banana cream pie and it was also sooooo good. Every bite. I wish I got my own slice. Haha. 

I wanted to try everything on the menu. Vegan friendly. Kid friendly. Milk shakes. Breakfast, great music. Outdoor seating. Countertop. What more could you ask for with this diner? 

Service was also EXCELLENT. 

Enjoy!
