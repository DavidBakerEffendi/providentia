Darling (foodie) teenage son found this place on BlogTo and since we were in the area, we decided to try it for lunch. Some lunch specials at $5.99 are a great deal and oh-so delicious too. We ordered the Beef Kofta with rice and salad and the Chicken Kebabs with rice and salad. We could have chosen pasta too. Everything was delicious and well-seasoned.

We've got Somali friends so we were not too surprised by the Italian-style items on the menu. What DID surprise us was the high quality of the coffees and desserts! We tried their in-house Graffes (donuts filled with cream, Nutella or strawberry jam) and Pineapple Upside Down Cake. So much flavour but not overly sweet. Winners!

Looking forward to our next visit. I want to try the lamb shank...
