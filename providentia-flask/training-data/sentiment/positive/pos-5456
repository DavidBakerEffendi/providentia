Excellent sandwiches; never disappointed. I have tried much of the menu and while everything is quite good, I always end up ordering my tried and true favorite: the symphony--just thinking of it, I want to sing out its praises...get my musical pun there?? :P love the fact that Sacks offers sprouts--this is not commonly found in sandwich joints! Good prices, hit-the-spot sandwiches and quality ingredients.
