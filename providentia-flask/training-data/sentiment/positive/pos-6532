The Peppermill is my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. Diner style seating and neon lights almost feels like you're at a strip club while I'm killing the biscuits & gravy. Whether it's up early because I'm at a work conference in Vegas or because I just got done on the strip, I love me some Peppermill!
