I haven't been to the Caledonian since January (my one and only time) and I was welcomed like it had been just last week since I'd been there.

We sat at the bar and Beth took good care of us.  We ordered the mac and cheese and a Scottish egg and they were good.

There were Scottish dancers which were very entertaining.

What a nice place ... I'm going to make it a point of getting there more often.
