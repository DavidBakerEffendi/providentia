This place has been here for years and I recently decided to go there after work with my sister. The menu is extremely extensive, so many dishes to pick from. My sister got the bimbimbap and she liked it. I ordered the salmon sashimi bento box at a really good price. The fish tasted great and the quality of the tempura was just as delicious. I will for sure come back here again!!
