Of all the local pubs the PT's family is my favorite. This place is no exception. Half off breakfast everyday from 6am to 10 am! The wings are fantastic. Great service. As a hidden gem, they have meeting/event space upstairs. Make sure to get the Beer and Bites card to earn points and get free food! I say stop in and enjoy the great food and drinks!
