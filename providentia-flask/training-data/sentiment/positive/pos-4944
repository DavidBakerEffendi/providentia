Yelp does it again! Me and the P were looking for a new spot and located this one on Yelp during a Saturday holiday shopping day.  I'm not the biggest fan of Hawaiian BBQ but this was unbelievable.  Had the Kahlua pork with two scoops of rice, outstanding coleslaw, and a very generous portion of meat.  It was absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to go back. The P had the same only with potato salad which was equally tasty, homemade, and great flavors.  The staff was outstanding, very pleasant and made us feel at home.  Place is spotless and adequately priced, highly recommend!
