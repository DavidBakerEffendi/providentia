Okay, I've been going here for ten years or maybe more so now it's time for a review. And I probably can't add much to whatever has already been said about this place. But damn they make a great chicken! And I don't feel that the quality has changed over the years - even after a fire and major upgrade in capacity. You still can't beat the price of a half-chicken dinner. We had one each last week, which we took to the park. We are not tiny eaters and we only finished half of our respective dinners. We ate the second part as a fully satisfying lunch on the train back to Toronto and still had extra fries which made it into an omelette at breakfast the next day! Fries are plentiful but also top notch. The only drawback over the years has been with increasing popularity the line-up has grown. Sometimes this has us holding back, but it is always worth the wait. Or call ahead and get in the pick up line like a pro (which we never do).
