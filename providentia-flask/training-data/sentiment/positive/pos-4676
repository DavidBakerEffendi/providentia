This place is absolutely incredible. The chicken is out of this world, I highly recommend the chicken tacos and the shredded beef with red sauce gordita. 

Everything I've had so far has been amazing, it's all so flavorful. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the outside picnic tables. 

This is a place I crave almost weekly, definitely check it out.
