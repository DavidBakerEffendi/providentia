Met a good friend here for lunch at her suggestion -- we try to go places we have not been and this was her pick and I am glad she did.  Cute old house converted to a restaurant in the historic Coronado district with inside and outside seating with misters. You order at the bar and pick out where you want to sit.  Menu is small but great offerings - cheap prices for what you get. Had cauliflower tacos & street corn which was more than enough and very tasty.  Ordered a drink - the Edgemont -- nice light and tasty.  We sat and talked for 2 hours and no one bothered us other than to remove or dishes and ask if there was anything we needed.  Great little vegan place that will definitely be going on the monthly rotation!
