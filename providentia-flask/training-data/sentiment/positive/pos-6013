Hmm! Our waitress this time didn't seem to be knowledgeable of Beerbistro's beers.... she said some very general things about the beer we should pair our food with, like "Well, the menu here says you should order Bold beers so... I'd go with any bold beer."

Other than that, the bold beers we RANDOMLY picked turned out amazing! My friend had the St. Peter's English Ale, a little bitter but very smooth. I had the Brewdog Punk IPA which comes in the cutest bright blue can (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/O-uIEuv7JLUHajkemx_sVw?select=DFvZCPdfmuOpf5cCEg0zWQ#DFvZCPdfmuOpf5cCEg0zWQ), and it was quite fruity. I liked it.

The rabbit pasta I ordered last time isn't on the menu anymore.... We ordered the  New England Style mussel bowl $18.50 (beer bacon, leeks, potatoes, cheddar, parsley, de koninck & a touch of cream). Very tiny mussels, creamy broth, and delicious! But boo tiny mussels...

We also had the Belgian Frites $6, that was super yummy. I was eating and talking with my mouth full with these!

We stayed way way over our dinner time, Friday night. London Olympics opening encore 7:30, but NOPE wasn't busy so we sat and talked and talked and talked until we left on our own without being bothered.
