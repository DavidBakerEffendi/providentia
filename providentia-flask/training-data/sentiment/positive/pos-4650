This is my favorite place for hand pulled noodles just on a side street near Eaton Centre.

This place is quite small with 4 rows of tables (in 2, 4 or 6 configurations per row) and spots at the 2 bars (one facing the kitchen, one facing the window to the street). It gets very busy during dinner time and there's often a line outside of the restaurant. Often times, a waiter will collect your order when you are in line so it is ready for you when a seat is available. The turnaround time  is quick.

There are not a whole lot of options to choose from. Either noodles in soup or dry minced meat noodles. You can choose different thickness of noodles, but the soup base is the same.

My favourite is the pork sauce noodle. It is almost like spaghetti with thick flat noodles and a salty meat sauce (not tomatoey). There is a decent amount of bokchoy on the side. To eat it, you just simply mix it all up and start "slurping" the noodles.

The soup noodle has decent amounts of sliced beef with lots of fresh herbs ontop. The level of spice in the soup is up to you to decide. You add additional chili oil for an extra spicy kick. The soup is not too salty and is not filled with MSG.
