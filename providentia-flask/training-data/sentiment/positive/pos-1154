Stopped in here with a friend for a duo birthday lunch.  What a nice gift to us!  The red duck curry was savory and meaty (not at all like the greasy, skinny roast duck you get at places in Chinatown).  Chowed down on the calamari.  Drunken noodles did not disappoint.  We listened to the server about the spice levels, but next time will amp it up a notch.  Can't wait to go back again to sample more of the chef's creations.  This restaurant lived up to its great reviews and am proud to slap another set of 5 stars on it!
