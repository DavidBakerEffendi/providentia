First time trying the location in Henderson and went on a Saturday morning with my husband. The wait was only 5 minutes and the service was great! Maria was our waitress she was super friendly, efficient and quick! I ordered the waffle with banger sausage and my husband got the same with eggs. The food was super quick to come out and was delicious. I love their syrup it's very hot and they put a cinnamon stick in it which makes it even more flavorful! The coffee was also very good & hot! I will definitely return and I am so glad they finally have a location on my side of town :)
