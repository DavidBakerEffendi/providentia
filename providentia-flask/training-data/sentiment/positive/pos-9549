Super cute cafe. There's an upper level with comfy upholstered arm chairs where I sat. It's such a chill place. Some of the food items on the menu were korean but I didn't get to try it today. I just had a lunch combo of sandwich & soup for under $8 wow. Great service, wonderful place, really friendly people. I love the cozy atmosphere and couldn't get enough of the quaintness of Newmarket. Can't wait to come back and snuggle into my seat again.
