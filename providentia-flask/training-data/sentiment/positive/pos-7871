A neighborhood favorite for sure. Food is awesome. A little annoyed over the newly added "corkage fees," and, I would think they'd be waived of you also ordered a drink from them. (They are one of the few places to carry Jarritos!) Anyway,  the chocolate beef tacos are my favorite. Also the avocado fries. 

They allow dogs outside (for now,) which we love,  even though one of the servers made some very stereotypical and ignorant comments about our very docile pitbull once when we were eating there on the patio. Not the best for customer service. Another server ended up bringing us a water bowl. But whatever, small potatoes compared to the food.

Still, I have yet to taste a bad thing on the menu.
