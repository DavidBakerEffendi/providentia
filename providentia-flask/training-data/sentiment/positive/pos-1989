Small selection in food options but glad we shared our plates as one rice cake plate was a bit too heavy for one person. Definitely loved the shaved ice the most with the soy powder and red bean paste! If you end up getting the popcorn chicken, the sauce for $1 extra was worth it. Service was attentive and they let us overstay without any hassle. Cute decor and cutlery and was very clean
