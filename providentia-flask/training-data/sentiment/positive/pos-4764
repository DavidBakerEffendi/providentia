I love this place. I had forgotten about it but had some time to kill in the neighborhood so dropped in. Coffee is good, not great, but I am a coffee snob so if i say its good then its pretty above average. I have never actually eaten the food, but it looks really good and on the cheap. 

Really what I like is the location and vibe. The Tower Press building is an amazing building. It is worth just walking around and checking out. There is always cool, interesting artwork on the walls and interesting people to talk to. If I lived closer I would hang out more, but I am glad to visit here and there.
