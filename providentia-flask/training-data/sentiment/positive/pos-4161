Woah. I slept on this place for the longest time.

I've been living around the corner from Pho Jade for over two years and I never paid a visit until today. When walking by I could never gauge what was going on in there, but happened to stumble in and check out the menu. Lots of promising choices.

Place looks pretty good. I'd dine in for sure. Woman serving me was great as well.

I ordered some kind of udon noodle dish with chicken. It was pretty good. Also got some shrimp tempura roll with avocado, which was really delicious -- filling with a touch of sweetness. Enjoyed my selections very much.

Really happy I decided to finally check this place out. Looking forward to exploring their menu some more! 

Oh, and they have a water fountain and big screen TV. 

Boom.
