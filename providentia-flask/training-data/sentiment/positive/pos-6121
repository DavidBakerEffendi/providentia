Nice little place tucked away in a shopping center.  A real hidden Oasis.  The patio is surrounded with greenery and masters which help hide the shopping center.

As for the coke.... $1.25 for a can of coke is a little pricey.  I was expecting unlimited refills on my soda, thinking it was a fountain soda.  Lesson learned.

Ice Chai tea had the perfect blend of ingredients. Definitely not completely homemade but delicious, nevertheless. 

The feta, olive, tomato, & pepperoni night bruschetta was pretty good but a little on the dry side.  We asked for a little olive oil to drizzle over it to give it that little extra pop.  Outstanding.

Salami, pesto, tomato bruschetta was a little odd.  Large slices of meat and tomatoes, like one would put on a sandwich.   Still tasted yummy but everything slide all over the place.  Would get it again. ;)

Service was outstanding.   I liked that the waiter gave suggestions and variations to the menu.  Couldn't have had a better experience.   :)
