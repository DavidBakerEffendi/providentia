My boyfriend is a huuuge fan of fried chicken and the only place that serves "decent" tasting chicken is Popeyes..This place is very close to our home and we drive by it everyday so today we decided to give it a try. I went in there with no expectation of whether it'd be good or bad..sat down for no more than 5-7 mins and our special ($3.99 for 2 piece + fries and we added a Pepsi in) was ready. The fries were DELICIOUS - very crispy and fresh.. Each bite was filled with potato flavour (hard to describe).. it wasn't too salty but had just enough taste. The chicken was amazing! Fresh, perfect taste (we ordered spicy but it didn't taste spicy at all..i think it'd be better if it was slightly more spicy). And I couldn't believe how JUICY the chicken was. Seriously - it's 10x better than what you get at popeyes or kfc or any other fried chicken place. Location not the greatest though - for better business I think it's best to have it in a more populated area and also the colour inside (yellow and orange) doesn't give the right feel - way too colourful.
