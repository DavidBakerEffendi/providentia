I have visited this place and it was pretty good. Waiters are very nice and do know menu card. I wasn't really sure what I wanted to get and I asked our waiter. He explained me each option. I really enjoyed atmosphere there and tables for 6+ people are comfortable. Really clean place but that have to change their washroom signs because I was confused and went to women washroom. Other than that no complains. Enjoy!
