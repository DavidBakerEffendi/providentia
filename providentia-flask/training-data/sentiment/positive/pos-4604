Another amazing time at sparklings!!! Sunday was my surprise bridal shower put on by my mother, future mother in law and bridesmaids along with the fabulous staff here. I cannot thank them enough for being unbelievably accommodating, attentive, and helping my loved ones put on a great shower for me. Everyone who was there raved about the food and beautiful setting. I couldn't have possibly pictured a more beautiful shower with delicious food throughout our stay there Sunday! Thank you sparklings for being so accommodating for our event and one of my favorite spots in town for ANY event from casual drinks at the bar to delicious dinners to special events!!
