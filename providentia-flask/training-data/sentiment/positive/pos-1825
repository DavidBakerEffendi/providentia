These days I dream about two things food wise: A Sprinkles red velvet cupcake [which I swear have some habit forming delishushness] and the Salami, Goat Cheese, Pesto sandwich from Bertha's [cue singing angels]. Ge.Ni. Us. Fresh delicious ciabatta roll, yummy stack of salami with goat cheese and pesto, topped with mixed baby greens. An unusual and AMAZING combination. Crazy good. 

Nice menu, freshy fresh ingredients and in my work 'hood. Am devoted.
