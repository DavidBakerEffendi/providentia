This was my second time coming to 7th district. Both times superb service, food, and atmosphere. Very grown and sexy. The prices are super affordable and the food is definitely some of the best ive had in Charlotte. Servers Lisa and Ricky are the bomb! Very attentive. Top it all off with a DJ playing R&B at 10pm on Sat and hookahs... winning situation!!!
