Met a friend for lunch here today, and I'll definately return! We arrived a few minutes before they open at 11:00AM, but the hostess saw us and opened the door right away. I hadn't seen my old military buddy for a while, and the server was very patient with our taking time to order because we were sitting there jaw-jacking. Iced tea came out quick.
Once we did order - I had a steak burrito with all the fixings, it was hot, fresh, bigger'n heck and tasted great. My buddy ordered a chicken something something, and he enjoyed his lunch as well. Terrific food!
The service was friendly, efficient and thorougj. The food was really, really good. The restaurant was clean, well maintained, and it's easy to see why all the tables were busy in no time flat. 
Great place to stop in the Strip...I'll definately be back!
