Sorry, but anyone who doesn't like the felafel at Maha's doesn't know good felafel.  It's hands down the best felafel I've ever eaten.  Perfect flavor, perfect consistency, crunchy outside.... AMAZING felafel.  Some places grind their ingredients too finely.  Maha doesn't.  It's what makes it SO good.

The baba is excellent.  Smoky and flavorful.  The grape-leaves are some of my favorites.  Great flavor and perfect consistency.

Sam, Maha and the gang are always friendly.  The place is clean and service is great.  

It's one of my favorite lunchtime eateries.  

For a change try the felafel quesadilla!
