So I've come here quite a few times since my discovery. That says a lot considering I live in the SW so making this drive is a huge effort on my end. From what I understand is this place has been around for quite awhile. 
I've been searching for a good bagel place since I got here and I'm so glad I can finally abandon that mission. This place gets packed on the weekends but for good reason. Expect at least a 20 min wait after 10am. 
They have at least a dozen style bagels fresh and ready at any given time with a healthy selection of shmears. On top of that, lox, cod and more. And on top of THAT(yes, there's more), is a sweets display. Chinese almond cookies, tiramisu, cinnamon rolls, cakes, so on and so forth. This doesn't include the restaurant which has excellent fresh squeezed oj, pancakes, sandwiches, chicken fried steak, omelettes and a plethora of other dishes. Do I really need to say more? Prices are great. Breakfast never exceeds $40 for two with plenty to take home. Service is fast and friendly. Only thing that sucks is parking is cramped. Literally, every spot is compact car size parking so if you have an SUV, prepare for a tight squeeze.
