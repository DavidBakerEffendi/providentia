Loved it.  Had the best brat ever.  Thought it was a great deal also.  No need to order a side of fries since theres a huge portion on top of the Clevelander along with creamy coleslaw and hot sauce.  All for the whopping price of $5.  Had the applie pie bacon shake and I thought there is no way I can finish all this.  FYI I'm a pretty big guy also...250lbs.  But don't look a pound over 240.  Anywoo, I even asked for a to go cup for the half shake that was left.  However, I got a second wind and was able to finish the shake while paying the check, waiting for change and pretending like I was paying attention to the college football game that on.  This was around 2:30/late lunch.  Had some fruits and veggies around dinner time and I was all set.  Slept like a baby too.
