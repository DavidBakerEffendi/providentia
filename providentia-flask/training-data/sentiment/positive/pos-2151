We stopped in with friends for dinner this past weekend, and I was just amazed. My wife ordered the Pho (minus the Thai basil) which was really good. I ordered the braised pork clay pot, and let me tell you, that is as good as it gets. The pot came out with the pork and broth just sizzling. Warning, be careful...this baby could do serious damage if handled wrong. It comes with a side of white rice, which I promptly dumped into the pot to soak up that lovely liquid. The pork was pull apart tender and absolutely delicious. I didn't think to see if they had brown rice instead, but that would have been even better. This is our third time in, and every time, the owner has greeted us. The place is immaculate, well designed, and the service is top notch. Not much more to say...get here and enjoy!
