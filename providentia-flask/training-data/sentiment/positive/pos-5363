Came here on a Friday night with family. The place is very small but has a very cozy atmosphere, which was lovely.
Service was very good... we were seated immediately and our waitress was very attentive.
The menu is quite small and varies from time to time so there isn's a lot of choice. However, the food is homemade and the ingredients are very fresh so it ensures great quality!
I ordered the haddock vegetables and potatoes. it was absolutely amazing and the broth was to die for.
My brother ordered the steak frites which was a very large portion size, but was also very tasty.
Overall, I thought this place was very nice and had great, fresh tasting food. Will be back!
