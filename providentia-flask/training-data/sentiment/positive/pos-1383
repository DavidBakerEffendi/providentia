No idea why this place has such low reviews. This is one of the main dessert places we go to everytime we go to Toronto! The service here are sometimes abysmal, but the desserts and food more than make up for it. I highly recommed the Glutinous Rice Balls topped with Peanut and Sugar and Rice Cake with Oyster Sauce and Peanut Butter. There's also plenty of parking, so no worries about that!
