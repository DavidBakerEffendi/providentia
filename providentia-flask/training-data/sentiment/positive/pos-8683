My friends and was at Korean town for grocery and noticed this place, cold and hungry on a whim we decided to go. Mr Lee from Lees liquor was there lol. Anyways the restaurant is very clean and professional. Their menu consist of korean bbq, shabu shabu, and traditional korean foods. I ordered the shabu shabu which is 15$ but you must have 2 orders so it's pretty much 30$. The food was very fresh filled with vegetables, tofu, and mushrooms. Along with the meat of course. The waiter/waitress will Volunteer to help you cook the food if you are unfamiliar. The hotpot at first seems like it won't fill you, but in the end shared with two ppl is more than enough. After you've finished your hotpot they will actually prepare a fried rice like dish with two eggs, seasonings, and purple rice(which seems to be their standard rice). I definitely come back if this cold weather ever gets to me again. Also seeing Lee popping wines while entertaining his guest was a bonus.
