After a terrible take out experience at another restaurant just days before, it was an absolute breath of fresh air to get take out at Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina last night! 

You know the food is good when the restaurant is super busy on only a Tuesday night, jam packed with at least 30 people waiting for a table. While I've eaten at Juan's for lunch before, this was my first time at the restaurant at dinner time and getting takeout. 

Elizabeth provided great, friendly service at the hostess stand and happily accommodated the special requests in my order. And amazingly, my take out order came out accurately with the special requests, it came out with everything as I ordered and paid for and it came out in 10 minutes - 10 minutes faster than the originally quoted 20 minutes and while they were extremely busy!

And on top of awesome service, the food was delicious (especially love the salsa) and so much food with ordering just two entrees! With people still waiting for a table while I left with food already, you might as well just order take out, save lots of time and eat in the comfort of your own home!
