My wife and I had been wanting to try this place and since we were at Ikea we knew what we had to do. We called our order in and the guy on the other end of the phone listened intently and repeated our order back and everything checked out. When I arrived we had a brief conversation about the Raiders coming to vegas (I was wearing my Raider gear) as he rung me up. He gave me my receipt as well as my food and I was on my way. It was weird, it was like I went to a friends place and picked up some food. The atmosphere was welcoming, the place was clean & I will definitely be back.
