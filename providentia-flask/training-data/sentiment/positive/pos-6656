The food was outstanding!  Although not real large portions, the quality of the food was superb?  The filet was like eating butter....so moist and tender.  And the desserts.....I died and went to heaven!  The wine list is great too.  The atmosphere is Old World and can be quite noisy.  The staff is very attentive and friendly.  I had such a great time here.  I highly recommend the Naked Grape!
