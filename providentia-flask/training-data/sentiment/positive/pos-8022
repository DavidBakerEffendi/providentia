I don't even know why I am addicted to this place but I am. I unequivocably love Sweet Tomatoes. This buffet is great for fresh food and the ability to dine healthy if you want. I also love that our 2 year old can eat healthy for free. For salads, you can choose from pre-made salads or create your own. There is also a food theme depending on the time of the month which determines the specialty salads, soups, pasta, etc. There are usually 4-5 types of soups, baked potato, sweet potatoes, 2 types of pasta, muffins, breads, baked desserts, fruits, and ice cream. My favorites are the homemade chicken noodle soup, their foccacia style sliced bread (so wonderfully garlicky) and their freaking lava cake. Their lava cake is always the end of me even when I try to eat reasonably. What is also great for you sweet-tooth people, are the servers bringing around freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Ah, sweet heaven...or should I say, sweet tomatoes...
