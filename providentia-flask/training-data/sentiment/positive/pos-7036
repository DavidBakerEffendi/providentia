Have driven by Zoes so many times and we finally stopped in yesterday for lunch. I got the quinoa salad and added chicken. The salad was so tasty and the chicken was moist and flavorful and their dressing is to die for!! My husband got the red pepper hummus and chicken orzo soup and both were delish!! I am so glad we decided to try it. We will definitely be back often!  Glad to know they cater too. May have to use them for my next party!
