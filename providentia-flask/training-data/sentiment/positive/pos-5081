I was shopping up a storm one day and I needed to wet my whistle but I didn't want a soda so I came to Salsita's for a fresca pina colada.  I'm so addicted to these drinks now.  I will drive 15 miles out of my way to get one.  I've tried to get my fix at other Salsita's but this place must have a secret recipe because I'm telling you kids, its freaking delicious!  I've actually never eaten here so I can't vouch for the food - just that pina colada.
