My waitress is Amy.  She is so pleasant & helpful. Had a great breakfast today!  This is my favorite breakfast stop when in Las Vegas. Highly recommend Egg Works as a great restaurant!

My waitress is Sandra.  Came back again today.  Wonderful experience all over again. This is my favorite breakfast eatery in Las Vegas!
