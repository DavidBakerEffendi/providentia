The staff was so incredible! Very attentive and so helpful! I never had to wait for anything! The food and drinks were delicious! I came for happy hour and left very happy! The steak was so fresh and had great flavor! I will be back a lot more, one of my new favorite Mexican place! They brought out chips, salsa, and the best bean dip I've had in a while with saut√©ed peppers and onions... Right when I sat down! Can't wait to go back!
