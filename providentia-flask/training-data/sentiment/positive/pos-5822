I'm not sure why people wrote below that it was closing.  It wasn't closed when we went.  We came here with a group of 8.  The wait staff was good and attentive.  I ordered the ribeye which came with potatoes and it was good but I tried my co-workers bison and it was definitely the BEST!  sooooooooooooo good!

They also had a burger + half bottle of Cab Sauv deal which a guy we were with said is a good wine.  It looked good.  But next time I would definitely get the Bison

Last but not least, they gave us butterscotch pudding and while we were all going to another place for dessert we ate it and it was delicious!  Everyone devoured it.  highly recommended
