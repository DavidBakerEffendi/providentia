I love their Fairfax sandwich. It's filled with so much goodness: eggs, sriracha mayo, chives, and caramelized onions. So delicious!! I wish Eggslut were open later so I could go there for a late night snack or dinner. I guess the only bad part is that the food falls out of the sandwich. But, it falls out because there are so many good ingredients in the sandwich - so the con definitely outweighs the pro for me!

Affordable prices. Sometimes, there's a long line. I only waited 5 minutes to get served. The service has always been very friendly.  There are tables to sit at or you can take it to go. I wish I could make an egg sandwich like this! I can't wait to go back and eat another Fairfax.
