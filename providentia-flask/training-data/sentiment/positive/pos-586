I go to del taco mainly for the heavenly caramel cheesecake bites and steak street tacos! That's it. Lol. This is the location I go to most of the time since it's the closest to my house. 

Drive thru customer service is always good. That being said, it's a hi-order-pay-bye service. Not so much interaction at the drive thru, and I don't mind! As long as they don't mess up my taco and my cheesecake bites, im good! =P
