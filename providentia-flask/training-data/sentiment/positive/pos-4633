Sitting in here right now enjoying my meal (they got rid of one of my favorite items so i was sad), when i jear an unhappy customer saying a coupon was explained to her wrong. What looked like a manager and an employee both discussed the situation with the customer, deescalated the situation, then offered her a free pastry as an apology. I am very big on customer service and that speaks volumes to me. The employees were all smiles and the customer laughed about it and every one was happy. Customer service at its best and should be rewarded as such. Will definately return with coworkers often. BIG UPS TO KAT!
