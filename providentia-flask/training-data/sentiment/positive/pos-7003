This restaurant was a huge surprise. A friend recommended it and I'm so glad we went. The storefront looks unassuming but inside are cute string lights and a very warm ambience.

Their appetizers has the usuals, tons of cheese options and calamari. We ordered the antipasto platter and it was huge, we were really surprised because it wasn't expensive. It had meats, cheeses, grilled vegetables, and small sides like pesto sauce and marinated jalape√±os. The pasta were all fresh and delicious. It definitely has the homemade taste of newly made sauce. Portions were pretty decent, and I took half of the pasta to go since I had the antipasto already.

The service was good and they gave us water whenever we ran out and packed our boxes to take leftovers. I'd say it was just the right level of service without them watching you or ignoring you.

Overall the bill came to less than $25 for a pasta and half the antipasto platter. So all that plus the great price makes it 5/5. Go to this place if you're ever uncertain of what to have for dinner.
