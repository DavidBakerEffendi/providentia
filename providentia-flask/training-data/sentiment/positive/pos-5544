Mar Y Tierra is a mom and pop Mexican restaurant that is worth the stop. My husband gets their carne asada and it is the best. I have ordered every type of shrimp and enjoyed every plate. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. Their salsa and chips are really good and the service is consistently good.
