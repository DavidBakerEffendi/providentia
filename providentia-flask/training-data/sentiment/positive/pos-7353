You know you've stepped into a good bar when at the moment you walk in and you get that feeling, that mood that you're in a different place, different time and you feel that deep down in your gut. Well, Odd Seoul is one of those rare bars that I knew I'd love right away. Absent are the large screen TV's playing at every empty wall space, autographed photographs of pseudo-famous people, tacky wall ornaments, and anything that would take away from that rainy, downtown Seoul feel from an 80's movie. The music fit the mood and even though it set up in a small lot, you're not shoving people out of the way for space, and it's packed in here too.

The night I went with my cousins, we had a few beers and a few items off their food list (kimchi sliders and a few other things) and honestly, I found them all to be really good.

We got in right in time because a group of three were just leaving so we took their spots but a steady stream of couples came in and they were told the wait would be anywhere from 65-90 mins long for a table, and it was 10:30pm.

Service was good, not exactly the talkative types but that's what you'd expect from a place like this. There's only a few things that adorn this place and they seemed to have been carefully, thoughtfully chosen and placed understanding presentation and the brand was just as important as what they served. They were selling it all. Both the experience and the good eats.

If you're in town, stop on by here.
