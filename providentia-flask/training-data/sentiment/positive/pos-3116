I've been to 808 Tapas many times now but owe it to them to add a review finally.  I first tried this place (not knowing it was the same guys as 808 Sushi) after finding a groupon.  Where to start?

Happy Hours every day that they're open, check for specific times but half price sushi rolls is all you have to know.  Consistently fresh food, tons of options for every palette, you'll have to go a couple times just to try everything that looks good!  See if the Super White sashimi is available.

Hot and cold items, sushi rolls and sake.  Friendly service, never had to ask for my drink to be filled, servers are very attentive and on point.  Sushi chefs very helpful and easy to talk to, everyone in the place seemed to be having a great time.

Check out this hidden gem, you won't be dissapointed!
