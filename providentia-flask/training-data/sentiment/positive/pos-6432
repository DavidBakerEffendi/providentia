Ono Grinds and Hawaiian hospitality from Russell and his wife (didn't get her name). 

I love the food booth in Greenland but haven't made the stop to the OG location. What better than to go with the Yelp crew and have some Yelpalicious Dishes. Everything people ordered looked good. 

I got a pork cutlet so I can try out some of their gravy. It's all about the gravy and a weak gravy makes for a okay dish. The gravy here was good on my katsu.  I was eyeing Misti Y.'s soup since she looked like she was enjoying it. Then like as if Russell reads minds, he brought us over a kimchee soup to try- that was pretty good and I gotta order that sometime when I'm feeling like soupy. The peanuts and banchans they served were also fresh and definitely tasted homemade. 

They have more dishes here offered than their food booth so I will definitely stop by to try those dishes. Mahalo!
