I've ate here only twice and they were both from delivery. They both came right on time and for the first order, we got a large poutine and surprisingly, it was a very LARGE portion, bigger than my hand. It was totally worth it. Good price for a good amount, I do recommend it. 

For the second order, we got honey garlic chicken wings but my friends said that it was too sweet for them. I personally liked it and ate a lot of it. Wedges are also very good!
