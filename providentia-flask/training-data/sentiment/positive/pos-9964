Another great meal at Wolf Creek. Never disappointed no matter what I order. Tonight it was the Butternut Squash Ravioli with hazel nuts, peas and mascarpone. So good. The only thing I would change is crushed nuts instead of halved so they don't compete with the other diced components. Loved the creaminess the peas added. Tiramisu for dessert! A great end to a nice evening.
