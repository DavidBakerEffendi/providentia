The awesome thing about Songbird coffee is that they make your coffee right in front of you.  It is always fresh and it is never make the morning like some other coffee shops in town.  

I really like coming to Songbird because it is a cute little place you can go to and hang out with friends.  Also it is right off of Roosevelt street next to MonOrchid. 

If you are looking for a place to go to for coffee after dinner or after having some Melt ice cream.  You should head over to Songbird.
