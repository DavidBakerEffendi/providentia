An old school italian eatery.  It was a true pleasure to eat here.  It reminds me of the little neighborhood places when i was in New York.  You can taste the love this place puts into their food.  Now we actually came in for the bakery section, not for dinner, but hey, it was worth it. And a must have when you dine in is the icecream.  Make sure you give that a try.  So the food is great and the price is right but i dont think its possible to get out of this place without a box full of little goodies from their bakery.  I know, I've been trying for about a decade now and still cant leave without some tasty treats for later.
