The month before last was Bradley Ogden's last at Caesars. Todd Williams has enamored me with his food for the better half of the last decade from my frequent trips to Vegas and for all of the culinary standouts along the strip, I'm saddest to see Bradley Ogden go.

There was never a dull day in this Michelin Star monster of a Vegas restaurant. Caesars always had my nod, but it was Bradley Ogden that had attention. The food was excellent, incredible by some standards but nothing less than outstanding by any means. The same bodes for the rest of the establishment, easily among the strip's finest.

It didn't matter if you were a first time patron or a high status player, the service made sure everyone was well taken care of from the beginning to the end of their experience. The restaurant wasn't large, but it was beautiful in its own way - contemporary, sophisticated, and elegant up from the chic decor to the personalized table sets.

Like any high end restaurant, the menu was a seasonal hodgepodge of various creative edible outputs; the kind of food that is beyond anything typical, with little to nothing to reference for folks with novice palates. It's hard to pick a favorite meal when every plate had its own unique twist on it. Everything from a blue cheese souffle to their legendary burger to a seared foie gras with a scallop and potato puree had me dying for more. There wasn't anything that didn't tickle my tastebuds in a way where it didn't leave anything less than a stellar impression.

R.I.P. Bradley Ogden.
