Have a reservation the place is hopping! 
Not too noisy and the blues in the background is nice. The ambiance and decor seem fresh and modern- not a stuffy old steak place. 

Service was excellent.
We had 8oz filet that was perfect! Had some seasoning as well that was a bit salty to us. 

Potato fingerling hash has no potato. But was excellent. The crispy potatoes were excellent and the grilled asparagus was ok.

Caesar salads were average.

Wine list was reasonable. 
As usual we passed on desert.

Worth a visit
