My absolute favorite "chicago" style pizza. The best thin crust pizza....... ever! I love the super crispy edges of this amazing pizza. This place is usually pretty busy and parking well.. sucks. Definitely plan on being here a little longer than most restaurants you visit. We always order the pizza cookie, formerly known as the pizzookie. It is the absolute best thing in the world. Makes even the most horrible restaurant experience ever, into an epic treat! I will be back again and again.
