Just so you know, I don't come here for the Malibu. I've been a regular since October 2007 when they opened their doors. And their house margarita is THE absolute best I've ever had. I can't get enough of them!!

Food is awesome and if you get the chips and salsa, be prepared to eat five basketfuls. They are just that darn good. 

I've also had happy hour parties and a birthday party upstairs. Great place to hang out!!!! Go there... or suffer from crappy margaritas elsewhere :)
