LOVE the breakfast here. Best deal in town. Taste and quality, spot on. Service is a little sketchy / hit or miss. Recently went for the wings in the evening. Awesome service, awesome deal ( as good as the breakfast deal) Great quality and flavor. Will definitely be back for the wings!  Super divey but totally worth it!!
