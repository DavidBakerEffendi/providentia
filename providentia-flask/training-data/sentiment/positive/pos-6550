WHY DID THEY HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN?! I'm guessing they had bad management because this is seriously one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at. The food. Just. No words. So I love Chicken Panang Curry. This is the only restaurant to ever get it right. The chicken was all breast (meaning no fatty pieces at all), they actually included the lime keffir leaves and the bell peppers are always fresh. Everywhere else I go, there is always stuff missing or too much weird stuff added that changes the flavor. It's a damn shame. They sure had a cult following. The staff saw me so much for pick-ups and deliveries that they remembered my address so when I called in and got my panang (I must've been the only one that ordered it) they always knew. I'm crying for you M&K.
