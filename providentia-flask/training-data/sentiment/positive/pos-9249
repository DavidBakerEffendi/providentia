I ordered delivery from here per a recommendation from a co-worker.

I have ordered from them twice and needless to say I am obsessed.

The first time I got their Egg sandwich with pasta salad on the side and a maple cookie to finish. Everything about the meal was amazing. The flavors were great and really had a lot of taste! I am not even a huge pasta salad fan but you HAVE to try their homemade one! It's to die for. Their cookies are made fresh and really soft.

The 2nd time I ordered breakfast and got a sausage burrito. I think I ate the whole thing in 3 bites.

Delivery has always been fast, around 20-25 minutes even when they quote you 45 minutes. 

I will definitely continue to order from here. Yum!!
