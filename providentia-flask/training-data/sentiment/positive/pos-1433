Ordered:
Banh mi hot dog
Carne asada fries
Mac n cheese hot dog (not pictured)
Bulgogi hot dog (not pictured)

This place is located right next to Chicago Brewery in Fort Apache. I ordered take out and the food was ready within 30 minutes. 

The banh mi hot dog was really good. It was topped with large chunks of bacon, pickled daikon/carrots, and Sriracha aioli. It was slightly salty for me (most likely from the bacon) but was balanced out by the pickled daikon/carrots and bun. 

The carne asada fries was topped with beef bulgogi, caramelized onions, pico de Gallo, 4 cheese, jalapeños, chipotle aioli and avocado aioli. It was really good. It did not lack flavor at all. The bulgogi gave the dish a slight sweetness/saltiness to it and the jalapeños gave it the perfect amount of little heat. 

My husband ordered Mac n cheese hot dog with pork belly on top. Unfortunately when we got home, the pork belly was no where to be found. He left a yelp review in regards to it and I received the call (I ordered the food via yelp) from the owner/manager within minutes of him posting it. They resolved the issue right away. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! 

My friend ordered the bulgogi hot dog and she loved it. She usually eats like a bird and she ended up devouring the hot dog. Lol. 

Definitely recommend this place especially if you want to try something different!
