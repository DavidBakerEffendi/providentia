Stop looking and eat here! Great food with a down home feel. 

The bacon Bleu burger was amazing! The bun was super soft but toasted, the meat was cooked very nicely, bacon nice and crispy and they did not skip on the bleu cheese! The homemade curly fries were sooo tasty! 

On top of that the staff and the owner Lee were very very sweet and helpful, very quick service, can't say a bad word about them.
