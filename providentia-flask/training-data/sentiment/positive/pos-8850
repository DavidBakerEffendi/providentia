I love the Venue!  I had a great time seeing Authority Zero and several reggae-punk bands here.  The drinks were pretty normal as far as Scottsdale pricing goes, but my friends and I stupidly decided to rock the special - which happened to be $3 Sparks black cans.  Cracked out on energy drinks and plenty of pre-party booze, we proceeded to wander around the massive interior which is modeled after a mardi-gras street (I am a sucker for that stuff!) and eventually head into the mosh pit.  I felt like I wanted to die the next day, but there is no other way I would've rather felt!
