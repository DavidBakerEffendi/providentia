I don't hand out 5 stars lightly, but this place earned it.  It's a pricey joint, make no mistake, but the food is amazing.  The wine list is HUGE, most bottles in the $34-$40 range surprisingly.  Beautiful ambiance in a renovated church (there is now a bar where the alter once stood).  Great romantic date spot, or serious business spot.  I had the lobster tail and it was essentially a 12 ounce "lobster steak".  The most dense bites of lobster meat I've ever had.  I will give a restaurant a bad Yelp review if the waiter looks at me the wrong way, but this place was (I kid you not) 5 stars fabulous.  Been here before, and will def go back (once the monthly direct deposit kicks in).
