Came to Barrio after hearing great reviews of this place. Located right near the Q and Progressive Field, it's a popular place to hit up before games so it can get crowded. When we came not during a game day, we were seated within 5 minutes. They have plenty of seating and a really nice open bar space for happy hour. Loved that you can customize your tacos with whatever ingredients that you want. We tried their house margarita which tasted strong and delicious! I was expecting small tacos so I ordered three however, I was surprised at how big the tacos were! I was full after my first one (after eating a bunch of complimentary chips and dip) that I had to take two of them home. Will definitely have to try their happy hour sometime!
