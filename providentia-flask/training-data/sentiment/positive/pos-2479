I love, love, love this quaint, bustling sandwich shop, which is located in the strip mall with the Starbucks off Hardy and University. The sandwiches have artsy names such as the Mona, Jazz , Picasso, Van Gogh or Art Deco.

 I've tried several of the sandwiches but the best is the Sack's Symphony (Turkey breast, bacon, avocado, tomato, alfalfa  sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on 12 grain bread). Every sandwich comes in a cute, boxed lunch with a cookie.
