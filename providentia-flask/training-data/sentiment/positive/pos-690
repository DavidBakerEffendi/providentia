YUMMM...This place has delicious food and good service.  My favs are the Curry Lakhsa, Mee Goreng, and Tom Yum soup.  It's gotten to the point where my addiction is obvious.  I literally eat here once a week now and if I don't they get worried about me.  The other great thing is that if you want to change up your order (like add more veggies to the sesame tofu, also delicious) no problem!
