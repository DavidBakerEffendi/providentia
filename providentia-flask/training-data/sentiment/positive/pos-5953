The servers were fantastic, excellent customer service.  They checked on us frequently and came to clear our plates.  

They had really large portions and the food was great.  We stayed late and they didn't say anything.  The server even offered us free drinks because he felt that he didn't check up on us enough.  We declined, but it was a very nice gesture nevertheless.
