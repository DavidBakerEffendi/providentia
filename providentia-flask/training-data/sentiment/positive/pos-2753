This is hands down my new favorite Sushi spot. Aside from it being literally down the street from my house, the ambiance is amazing. The "kick ass TJ Sushi was bomb as well as the shrimp fried rice. Also my Purple Haze Martini was superb...I only needed one which is shocking for me. I'm usually a two drink girl. A must return
