I love this place! I love their fajitas, the grilled onions and jalapenos, the bean dip, the chips and the soup that comes with the most amazing big, juicy shrimp and tender steak and chicken flaming fajitas! Super happy with Juan's from the day I stepped foot into this restaurant and Juan himself served us dinner until today! Keep up the great work :-)
