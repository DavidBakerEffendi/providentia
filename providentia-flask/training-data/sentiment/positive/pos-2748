Omg this place is so good!! Flavors are on point and so yummy! Located on the southeast corner of Spring Mt & Decatur in the Big SF Supermarket (on the right side of it), Carls Jr, & Chevron plaza. Inside is very spacious, nicely decorated and super clean. Plenty of seats so I've never had to wait a ridiculous amount of time like I would have at boiling crab or hot n juicy. Service is excellent! Servers are very nice and super attentive. 

URBAN MIX SAUCE is freaking AMAZEBALLS!! This place has a fighting chance against Boiling Crab n Hot & Juicy!! 
I think with a little more networking and advertisements this place could go a LONG WAY!! 

Crawfish - nice, big and juicy

Clams - good. Use the shell to slurp up that yummy flavorful sauce lol

Mussels - good

Shrimp - Big & juicy 

Blue Crabs - good but would rather get the snow or king crab if you want to get your crab fix on. Blue crab is more work less crab meat

Cajun fries - good would taste better a bit crispier

Sweet potato fries - yum! 

Alligator Basket with fries - Served like popcorn chicken in little fried popcorn nugget like pieces. Fried and seasoned nicely. Served with fries

Oysters on a half shell - very fresh. Yum! Come for happy hour m-th 12pm-5pm for $1 oysters n $2 beers

This is my new go to Crawfish place!! The flavors here are amazing. The menu selection and prices are great too!! Been here 2 times in 1 week so far and am excited to go back again soon to try everything else they have to offer on their menu. Can't wait! There is also a Lobster Claw catch game by the restrooms $2 per play which is fun n cool! Note to owner: if you could move that anywhere else in the restaurant towards the front where it would be more visible it will probably be more profitable bc it it looks like a fun game to play while we wait. I mean who doesn't want to try to catch a lobster and have the restaurant cook it up for you!?! Lol
