They have now expanded the place. WOW. There is SO much room!

The staff nicer than I last remembered, welcomed us and sat us at the new section. It hasn't fully constructed but a few tables/chairs is al you really require when all you want to do is play some board games. 

My buddy & I played 'Apples on Apples' & ' Pictureuka! ' 
really cute thing I noted. They had zoo animals on each table (only at the new section). I must say, tis a unique way of table organization. 
We had the ass. ( as in Donkey). Go figure.
