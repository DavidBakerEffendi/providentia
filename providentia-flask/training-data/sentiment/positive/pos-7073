Be prepared for a gorging! This place has everything and plentiful amounts of it. I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I must say that the lunch is the best deal! It seems like a hefty amount to pay for a lunch, but it is well worth it. The food doesn't taste like it came from a cafeteria like other buffets and the types of food are incredible as well - sushi, sea bass, crab, steak, etc... I can just picture Homer Simpson now...
