Never Disappoints

The Arrogant Butcher was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Arrogant Butcher is  trendy and has a relaxing vibe.

As we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who made us feel genuinely welcome. Then a few minutes later our server, added to that feeling. All our questions were answered about the menu, and our server made suggestions based on our perferences.

We started our dining expeirence with appetizers, which were delicious.  I highly recommend the freshly made pretzel balls served with provolone cheese fondue. The pretzels are so fresh and fluffy, our server told us the pretzels are made on site every day. On this visit we also sampled the roasted peppers toast, smoked salmon toast, and the prosciutto deviled eggs.  All which I would order again.  

For dinner I had the sea bass with creamy barley.  My entree  was absolutely delicious.  My dinner companions had the crab stuffed chicken which he said was the best he ever had. The portions were the perfect size and cooked to perfection. 

As good as the entrees were, they were matched by the dessert selections.  We split the salted caramel pudding (my favorite), the peanut butter cup, and the pumpkin cheesecake, you couldn't go wrong with any of those. The desert were fantastic.

The service was perfect and our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again.
