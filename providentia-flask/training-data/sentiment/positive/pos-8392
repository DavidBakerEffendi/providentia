Have you ever been blown away by a broth-based foodstuff? I almost walked past the narrow storefront, but you can't miss the lunch-hour line-up snaking out the door. For $11 bucks you get soup 'n' a wrap; perhaps a comfort to those not sated by soup alone. 

While most people do takeout, we snagged a spot on the back patio (which is bigger than the entire restaurant). My meal came out on a lazy susan (for some reason) and I dove in with vehemence.  The lamb curry wrap was an amazing blend of flavours, and a corn chowder literally made me weep (not literally). It was amazing. Go there, eat soup.  Do not delay.

Obligatory Title Pun: These soups are RAVI-shing.

Menu Readability: Where to start? Everywhere you look are menu items manically brushed in Gerald Scarfe-ian printing.  (Think "Fear and Loathing" less the bats.) 

Need to mention: A communal table divides the restaurant that appears to be a cross-section slab of an enormous tree.

What this place teaches me about myself: It took everything in me not to sing the "Soup Crimp" while in here.
