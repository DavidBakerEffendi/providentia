My Husband and I stopped into the restaurant for lunch on a January afternoon.  We were greeted by our server Ashley who was very friendly.  I started with a Habanero Margarita and it was great and I also had an organic margarita which was also good and not too sweet.  The Camarones A La Diabla  and the Taco Al Pastor were both great choices.  My husband and I also had a flight of Tequila and our server put it together for us with the most popular, server favorite and bartender favorite.  They were very good choices.  There is 100 tequila selections ranging in price and it was nice to have a server that seemed to be knowledgeable on tequilas.
