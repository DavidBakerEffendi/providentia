I've seen mixed reviews for Pho Phuong, many about the service. When I go for Pho, I'm usually prepared for service ranging from over enthusiastic to just sheer apathy so I try not to get too bothered about such things. In any case, I was more laser focused on judging the quality of their food. 

In short, even though this is a bit far from my pad, I will make the drive as this is my new go to place. For starters my friend and I shared some fresh rolls with shrimp as well as the fresh rolls with grilled pork. Then I had the vermicelli with a mix of different beef rolls. The one roll in particular that really sealed the deal for me was the beef wrapped in a green leaf - it was totally succulent and tasty! In fact I'm getting hungry just thinking about it right now....

Give this place a try. You won't regret it and if you do, I will buy your next Pho :)
