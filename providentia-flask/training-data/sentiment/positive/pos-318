I think this is the best place I ever been for breakfast. It was a bit wait but it's worth it. People who work there are so fast, professional and kind. We order two classic Benedict's it came with pork bacon.I don't eat pork but I don't like to throw food so I had to eat it. Btw it was too thick and it's not classic thin bacon. Yikes....Beside that everything was good, hollandaise sauce was best of the best!!! I got free muffin as a yelper which was really good add to my coffee haha. 
I have only one tip for this place: please guys add to your menu lox (salmon) Benedict. You have all type egg Benedict's even with turkey but my favorite is only lox.
