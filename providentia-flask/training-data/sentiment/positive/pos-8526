Paula and Mason gave us great service. On top of the food it was a great place to try out.We we accidentally left our leftovers on the table and they were thrown away. The manager kindly came over and apologized and he brought us back a whole new dish to go. Meanwhile we were waiting for a food to take 5 servers came and asked us if we needed anything. I let the manager know that he has a great team and I felt very cared for while I was waiting. Coming back forsure with some friends.
