I first found out about the Peppermill in Las Vegas when a friend took me there late at night for a snack.  I knew from the minute I walked in the door that I liked this place!  Funky decor, neon lighting, big fake trees throughout the restaurant, and the wonderful Fireside Lounge.  This has got to be the best diner in Las Vegas, and the setting is unforgettable.

In the lounge, the video poker machines at the bar are fun, but the seats around the water feature and fire are the best!  Last time I was in, I saw Brooke (Punkin) from Charm School.  She was having fun with some guys and kept getting approached by fans.  We left her alone.

The food is very good, as far as fried stuff and diner food is concerned.  Don't expect a healthy meal here.  The service is quick and friendly and the price is fair.  If you like the Peppermill in Vegas, the good news is that they have an entire casino and resort in Reno under the same name that takes the crazy design to a completely different level.
