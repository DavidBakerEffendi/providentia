Our favorite hibachi place in the whole area.  Excellent service with attention to details. Food is spectacular- and cooked fresh in front of you. "The show" is different each time you go. Highly recommend the teriyaki steak- one of the cheaper items, but full of great flavor and awesomeness. Never a complaint, even in busy days like Mother's Day and Christmas Eve.
