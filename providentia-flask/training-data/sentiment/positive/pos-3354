Ok. so I have tried many AYCE Korean bbq joints out here, and this place has a place right at the top of my HELL-TO-THE-YES list. Great for big hungry group of friends and family to sit and grill up some yummy food and enjoying their company. 

My first time here...that was memorable. haha. My mom, brother, dad and I walked into this place and very quickly the rush of Kalbi, Garlic and Kimchi swished through the nostrils and it was over with. All while the rest of us were getting our rice and side dishes, you hear my dad muttering to himself (outloud) "We da hawaiians and we HUNGRY!" -ya a bit restructured from The Klumps, however our family is pretty big...so you get the picture? lol. That grill was going with kalbi, pork belly, beef tongue, gochujang chicken, bulgogi...oh the list goes on. 

Now my personal faves here in the beef tongue, pork belly, kimchi, the fruits and the japchae(stir fry glass noodles). If you are in the mood for a drink, pair up your BBQ with some Soju. 

The staff is attentive most of the time but sometimes you have to get their attention for some drink re-fills. However they were on their game when it came time to switch out the grill. 

Overall it was a great first time experience and frequent here with family and friends when i get the chance.
