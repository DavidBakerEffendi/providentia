I could eat here every day!

So what's not to love?  I've tried the competitor and it was just missing something...probably that unique Chipotle flavor.  

I've been doing my taxes lately and so I've been reviewing all of my receipts for quick meals.  When I see that I've spent more money on a fast-food meal than I did on a very satisfying Chipotle meal, I want to kick myself for ever having strayed!  

Consistent, delicious, filling, healthy (if done right) and CHEAP!  What's not to love...right?
