always good eats.  Grab a sheet, select your stuff and place your order.  Not confident in your ability to mix and match your own ingredients?  Shame on you first of all, but go with one of the Barrio pre-fab taco ideas. Whatever you do, get the White Widow taco shell to start. And don't forget the queso appetizer with elote.  Darn good food, bustling atmosphere, and a good time will be had by all.
