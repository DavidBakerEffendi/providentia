This is my 2nd time here. The bar tender during the day time always has the best recommendations and it always honest about what's not the best item on the menu. Hos recommendations are always on point.  Last time I had the Rueben triple combo. A TON OF FOOD!  This time the chicken tacos and a side Caesar.  My day is set
