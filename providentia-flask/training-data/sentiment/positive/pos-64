One of the best places for a quick, healthy lunch downtown. It's no-frills and hard to miss from the outside if you're not paying attention, but seek it out! 

Ravi has a good selection of soups and wraps, but my go-to is the Ravi Stew. A hearty tomato-based broth full of shredded chicken, sweet potato, veggies and topped with fried shallots and edamame, it's a huge, healthy bowl of goodness for $10.  Plus, it comes with one of their to DIE for cheddar biscuits - rich, flaky and perfectly matched to the spicy mango chutney served on the side. Everything here is on the spicy side, but it never overpowers the flavors.

In my opinion, Ravi represents the best that Toronto has to offer:  tiny hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop restaurants winning acclaim for good, healthy, home-cooked food. There are never more than two people working in the whole restaurant, and everything is cooked to order in front of you. I'll miss this place!
