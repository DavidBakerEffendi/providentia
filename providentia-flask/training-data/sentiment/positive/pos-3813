As of Oct 20, 2012 for weekends and long weekends, the Cheesecake Company puts on a very lovely Brunch Buffet.  It starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 2 p.m.  It costs $23.99/adult and $19.99/senior.  The buffet includes tea, coffee and juice.  The long buffet table has platters of fresh cut fruit, vege and dip, desserts galore, banana loaf, rolls, a green salad, caesar salad, different salad dressings, breakfast items like scrambled eggs, bacon, nice fat juicy sausages, eggs benny with ham, chunky potatoes, brunch potatoes with cheddar, waffles and pancakes, salmon with lemon and dill, butter chicken and basmati rice, roast beef at the carving table and made-to-order omellettes.  

So much food for a good price.  I especially like the butter chicken and basmati rice, the salmon was really good, roast beef, the wonderful cheesecake and those little coloured-chocolate cups with custard in the middle. 

The Managers/Owners are Nita and Matal (forgive me if I spelt their names wrong).  They are very welcoming and kept coming by to ask how we liked the food and buffet.  The wait staff was very attentive and provided very good service.  I also notice that the chefs would come out and make sure the buffet was always filled with food.  They make small batches of food so that it's always fresh out of the kitchen.  I like the ethnic touch as well!  

The restaurant was getting to be quite full at about 10:30 a.m.  I would think that reservations should be made in order to avoid disappointment if you can't get in.
