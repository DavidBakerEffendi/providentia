My boo and I finally checked this place out after being in the neighborhood for awhile. It's located in a quaint little strip mall across from Boca Park.

We decided to share the turkey meatballs for an app. I really liked the sauce, it had a very homemade taste. For an entree I had the caramelized sea scallops, so good! They were cooked so perfectly and were so delicious. My boo had the chicken breast which looked very good too. He let me steal some mac n cheese which was very rich & tasty. For a dessert we shared the brookie. I literally would come here everyday only for the brookie. That thing was to die for! 

I would definitely come back here again! I think next time I'll check out the lunch or brunch.
