Basil box is definitely one of the healthier asian food take away options in the city and its sooo tasty!

You build your own stir fry so you know exactly what's going into your meal. I ordered brown rice for the base, sweet potatoes and bell peppers as the vegetables, half shrimp and chicken for protein, poured over the Penang curry sauce (which might i add, is HOT HOT HOT), and finished it off with countless toppings. The flavours and large portion size is definitely worth more than the $9.95 price tag. 

The only thing I didn't really like was that the rice was a bit dry, but overall, it's definitely a place to check out!
