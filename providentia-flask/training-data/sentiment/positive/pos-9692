Such a rare find in Madison! And to think that it was totally by chance that my friend and I even discovered this little gem on the East side.

We were in the neighborhood because we wanted to try Sophia's bakery for brunch. Unfortunately, Sophia's was closed for the day, so we begrudgingly headed back to the only open restaurant/cafe within walking distance: JPH. As soon as we caught a whiff of the freshly brewed coffee and took a glance at the menu, our frowns turned upside down. It was instantaneous. Magical even. 

I got a flat white latte and a sunday breakfast sandwich (egg, cheese, ham, & a touch of maple syrup)... who would have thought that combination could taste so good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I also love how they brew each cup of coffee to order. The baristas have truly mastered the art of coffee making! 

They take a while to prepare the food, but it is definitely worth the wait. There's also plenty of interesting art/furniture around the cafe to keep you busy as you wait. (:

Patrons of JPH are very low key, and the establishment has a hippy-esque/laid-back feel (sans homeless people) that makes me nostalgic for the Berkeley coffee shops (yay cafe Med/Milano/Strada) that I used to frequent. 

If I go missing on a Sunday morning....I'm probably holed up at JPH with my laptop and a steaming cup of coffee!
