We loved this place. We went just the two of us and were blown away. We initially were going to go to the little burger joint across the way but decided we wanted something a little more special. 
We split a dinner for an easy 12 bucks (but the serving is perfect for one.. we wanted to assure room for dessert!) We were walked over to the food area and everything was described to us. I don't eat meat, but tasted a little of the prime rib that my fiancee chose and it was fantastic. The Orozo was unlike anything I have tasted and the asparagus was fantastic. The owner took time to enlighten us with the history of mediterranian culinary culture. This may have seemed excessive at times, but we both decided that it only added to the authenticity of the establishment. All in all, great food, great vibe, exactly what I would want from such a place ;)
