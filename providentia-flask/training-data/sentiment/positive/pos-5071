So, I had to go here for a date. Well, he has been asking me for a date a while and I finally found time. And good time it was spend. I spend a lot of sushi on his credit card, and it was so worth it! The sushi not the date :)

It was SO freaking delicous, fresh unbelieavable for sure! The staff is very attentative.
But, its rather expensive, so make sure you have a date with a lot of money :)
