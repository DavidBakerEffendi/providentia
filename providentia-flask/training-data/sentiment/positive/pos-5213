Twice. Twice I've been lured in by the amazing food, impeccable service and lovely atmosphere of Gaetano's. This little gem is located off Eastern between 5 Guys and Buffalo Wild Wings. 

Nick has been our server both times and he's very knowledgable about the food, wine, and culture of Italy - because he's been there. 

Look, the food is amazing, the wine list complete and affordable, and it's family owned which satisfies this girl's need to support the independent business. 

Get to Gaetano's!! Why are you still reading this review? GO!
