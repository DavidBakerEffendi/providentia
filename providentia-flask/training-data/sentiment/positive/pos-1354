I'm not sure why all the negative reviews but we had great food AND service here. It was 1 sweet lady running the place on a slow Sunday after lunch so maybe we beat the crowds? I ordered the stuffed hashbrowns, my fiance got the sunset scramble and my son had their biscuits and gravy that also came with eggs and sausage. All made from scratch and so delicious! After we were done I decided to get a smoothie and she gave us 1 for free. We'll be returning for sure to try other items on their menu. The inside is so cute with an island theme going on.
