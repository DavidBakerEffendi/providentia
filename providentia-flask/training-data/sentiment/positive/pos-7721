I had gone too long without a Pan Asian visit! Stopped in for lunch today and kicked myself for all the days of delicious eats I have missed by not going here. We tried something different: linguine. Yes, I know you are doubtful that an Asian place has a worthy linguine dish, but the stir fried linguine has the ideal wok flavor. I will order it again. David and Lisa are still fun and friendly, and she let us sample some of her chicken wings. Perfectly crisp and moist. I hope they hit the menu soon!
