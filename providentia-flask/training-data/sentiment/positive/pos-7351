After two trips to Herb 'n Flavors I can confidently say it is my favorite place to eat in Tempe. Here's why:

The first dish I experienced was the taco platter. It was recommended by my waiter Emily. Grass fed beef topped with some special salsa and shredded cabbage, all on a soft taco served in quantities of three with a side of chilly so I didn't go home hungry. 

The second dish I tried was the GLT (gyro, lettuces, and tomato?). This was the most amazing sandwich! I have had traditional gyros before but not like this. This best part is the spinach dip that is put in the sandwich and on the side (ask for an extra pita to polish off what you don't finish with the sandwich). 

Some observations:
The dishes come with a healthy serving size (maybe a little too healthy). I didn't want to leave anything uneaten but I didn't have a hard time finishing it off either. The food is good and they know it, I think they are just making sure that you get your fill.

The waiters are very friendly and Brad, the manager, always checked in the make sure the food was five star quality. I had the pleasure of talking with the owner Sabeur Rouin a boisterous fellow who is also well know for his hummus company; Doctor Hummus. 

You see the kitchen right when you walk in the front door. I personally like this because you get to see all the action, including head chef Demani, who is superb at all things food. But if you choose to, you can be seated in the main dining area where the kitchen is out of sight and instead you see the beautiful murals and interior color palette painted by one Ashley Campbell. 

The atmosphere inside is very inviting, and for only opening one week ago I think that Herb 'n Flavors is already a fine addition to the Tempe dining scene.
Cheers!
