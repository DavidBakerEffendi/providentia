Great place for Vegans!  The chicken and waffles is absolutely to die for.  Ask for the vegan butter as well.  Didn't like the French toast nearly as much, but the chicken and waffles was so good it may have skewed my opinion.  Looking forward to trying some other vegan dishes here.  Be careful of the birds when sitting outside.
