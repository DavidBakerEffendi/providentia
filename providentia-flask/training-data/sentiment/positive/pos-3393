Went here tonight for dinner and YUM!!!  We wound up ordering one of everything on the happy hour menu.  We weren't sure about the bacon wrapped dates but our lovely waitress Mariah raved about them so we rolled with her suggestion.  THEY WERE AWESOME!  Everything was very good but our fav thing by a nose were the sliders so got a second order of them . The hummus too was very good and actually had enough veggies etc to use all of it!!  Drinks were very good and well worth the price...one mai ti tai was plenty!!  We will definitely be back!!!
