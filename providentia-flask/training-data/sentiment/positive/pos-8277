My buffalo chicken salad was prepared just as I asked (no onions) and was delicious.  The buffalo sauce was spicy, but not over-powering.  The chicken tenders were cooked perfectly.  The mixed greens are what a salad should be made of (not your typical iceberg mix from a bag).  My favorite part was the fresh mozzarella balls. 

Chris and his staff truly want their customers to have a good dining experience and it shows in the quality food.  Bad days happen to everyone and that is how I would classify my first visit.  Today's experience was wonderful and they have earned a repeat customer!
