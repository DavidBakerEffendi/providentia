It's really nice to see something hip and downtown in the east of the city and it's a refreshing change to have a restaurant like this in the Danforth area. The place is consistently packed to the gills so come early or come late late. 

VIBE 
I love love love the large windows at the front of the space where both patrons and paserby traffic can look at each other. I've only dealt with bar staff as I've taken out and they're quite lovely (shout out to Angus). 

It's casual and a bit loud but good too. Now on to food...

I EAT 
New items have been added that you can't get at Ossington. I still go for my favourites: the Margarita and the Prosciutto arugula. Both hit the spot! 
I need to try those meatballs though...

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
Mamma Mia! Good to see Rocco Agostino in my hood for a change! I hope this sticks around for a while and it seems to be doing quite well for itself already. Congrats Libretto!  Now we just need to get Grant Van Gameran on this side of the city....
