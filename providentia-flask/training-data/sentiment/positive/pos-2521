What's not to love about a locally owned restaurant with a great menu!? They always feature new lunch and dinner specials and a great happy hour (2-6)! 
The list of beers may be overwhelming, try the "Beer of the Month". only $3! Be sure to catch the "Drunk of the Moment", or become a wine of the month member (it's free!). 
Say what you will about parking you Phoenicians, but have you been to San Diego, San Francisco..? Ok then moving on; There's a few spots in the front and a lot on Pierson that's always open. 
Also one of the only spots along Central with Beer and Wine To-Go!
