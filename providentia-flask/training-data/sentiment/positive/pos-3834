We came before a play for dinner and were in a bit of a rush. They sat us right away and the whole staff was very friendly. Our server, Sid, was accommodating to us being in a hurry and very knowledgable about the menu. 

The food was amazing. I had their onion cheese pasta dish and it was superb. My friends shared the duck and it was wonderful as were their salads. 

This place is perfect for a casual dinner or fancy dinning, although it is appropriately pricey.
