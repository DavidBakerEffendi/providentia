This is such a fabulous neighborhood bar!! I love that fact that families come here,from wee ones to grandparents...all to either have a Friday Night Fish Fry together or to watch a Badger game, either way, it has a lovely family atmosphere here! But BEST of all?! The STAFF! Ohmigosh!!! I've NEVER been to a bar/restaurant/what-have-you that has NICER staff who are always SMILING and loving life!! This, alone, has me coming back here! My first visit here, I was chatting with a "regular" while trying to decide what to order, and was ethusiastically steered into the direction of the nachos! Score! I ordered the beef nachos and they were STELLAR! Flavorful and plentiful in toppings!! My dinner companion ordered the Walnut Burger (how can you not?? This is raved about in the reviews!)...SCORE!!! Again, flavorful and filling without the heaviness of a beef burger! I, also, tried a cup of soup, Italian Meatball...wow. Just the right amount of seasoning, thick and delish!! Lastly...$4.50 draft pints! Hellloooo!!! Can't wait to stop back in for their well-reviewed pizzas!!
