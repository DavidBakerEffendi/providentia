Last night was Ethnic Dinner night with my friend. We decided to try out this restaurant after I checked out the reviews on Yelp. Usually I'm a little wary of any restaurants with 3-stars or less. This time, I'm thrilled that we went here in spite of the 3-star average as it was fabulous!

The decor is cute... fishing nets with Christmas decorations, etc. It reminded me of a little dive bar in Rocky Point that I visit whenever I'm down there. 

Our waiter was excellent, knowledgeable and patient as we asked loads of questions about different things on the menu. In the end, I couldn't decide between the crayfish po-boy and the alligator po-boy as I haven't had either meat before last night. I told the waiter to pick for me and he suggested alligator so alligator it was!

The alligator was amazing. I'm not sure if I can say it was cooked properly or not because I'm not sure how it is supposed to be cooked, but I can say the flavor of the meat was enhanced by the delicious seasoning it was cooked in. I only had one chewy/tough piece, but the rest was melt-in-my-mouth tender. The fries that came with the sandwich were also deliciously seasoned.

My friend got a grilled chicken salad with a side cup of the gumbo which the waiter highly recommended. Based on the fact that nothing was left on the plate or in the bowl, I'm going to say it was really tasty. 

I'm looking forward to going back and trying the crayfish po-boy, the gumbo, the jambalaya, on and on. Their menu looks fantastic and I can't wait to try out more exotic items.
