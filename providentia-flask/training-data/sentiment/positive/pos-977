This place did not disappoint! After going on the cruise, I'd do anything just to sit by the waters. This was the perfect place for me as I got the waters and I was celebrating my first year wedding anniversary. I'm kind of glad I chose this place as the atmosphere was perfect and you get to overlook the lake.

The restaurant is located on the patio, so no matter where you sit, you will see the lake. Well, unless you decide to sit way far back. I booked the table right by the edge so we had the perfect view. There were multiple umbrellas opened as the day we went was scorching. There's also an area where it was covered in a tent, so it was cooler to be in there. I figured I should make the best of this and choose a table with the best view.

We ordered our drinks andy wife was completely blown away by how strong or how much booze they put in her cocktail. I mean, you get your money's worth! We started with the brussel sprouts and I kid you not I would go vegetarian for this. It was made to a crisp and had the right seasoning to it. This one is a must try, even if you're a brussel sprout hater. She had the seafood linguini and I had the beef and lamb burger. The burger was so juicy and mouth watering, even my wife ate a few bites. She usually doesn't eat burgers but not this time..
Her pasta was good, but I thought the tang from the tomatos overpowered the rest of the pairing ingredients.

5/5 so far as the service was perfect and food delicious. We will definitely be coming back.
