Looking for a nice friendly neighborhood butcher...well, this is the place. Weather was nice so I thought I'd break out the bbq. The owner recommend the pork belly and gave me some instructions as to how he would bbq it. Although it didn't turn out as well as I hoped (my kids still loved it) I was impressed with the friendliness of this establishment. Cost is even less than my local korean grocery and much closer and quality much better. Can't wait for summer to try out some more meat! !!!
