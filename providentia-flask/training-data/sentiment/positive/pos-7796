I come to Vegas a lot. I've been here now 3 or 4 times. 

Don't hesitate....Come here and experience this for yourself. A fusion of flavors colors. The best of the best   
The food is prepared with such love and high quality. 
The beverages are crafted creatively and have been perfected, no matter which one you order there is a delightful twist. 
The ambiance is festive, fun, and comfortable.
 
But by far my personal favorite and most lasting impression of this place is the people. We were lucky enough to be in Oscars section tonight and had thee most delicious meal and amazing service. It launched us into a beautiful conversation. Oscar and his team are what make going out for dinner delightful and keep you coming back.
