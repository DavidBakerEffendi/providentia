I went here when I was in town for Thanksgiving, but have been going to an Aladdin's for YEARS. There used to be one in Chicago down the street from where I lived, but sadly they closed, so I must come back to Cle for an Aladdin's fix. 

My favorites: Aladdin's salad, Veggie combo appetizer (hummus, baba gannouj, tabouli, falafel and dawali) and the spicy kafta rolled pita. 

The hummus really is delicious - they give you plenty of pita bread with it. Also, try their hot sauce! I used it on salad, falafel, basically anything. 

Love this restaurant!
