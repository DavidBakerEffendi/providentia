Thanks to the recommendation from a friend, I'm finally trying the joint.

The server at the bar immediately assisted by taking our order. My desire to want the Mahi Mahi burger prompted her to suggest a burger not on the (quote unquote) regular menu...The Salmon Burger. Fresh dill. House tartar. Fresh spinach. Steak tomatoes. And I substituted the wheat bun for a wheat pita. The parental ordered the Pesto Pizza while the juvenile ordered a Steak Philly. 

While waiting for our order, I inquired about wine choices. No Moscato, but the server politely suggested their house Sangria and provided a generous portion for my sampling pleasure. Needless to say, I ordered a glass while we waited (my glass was filled to the rim). Very tasty and recommended. 

Additionally, the server was nice enough to throw in some fresh tomatoes and sliced cucumbers. Crisp and refreshing. Everyone enjoyed their meals. We even shared the cucumbers with the barker, which he thoroughly enjoyed as well.

While I can only speak to the service at the Gilbert location, I'd definitely return and recommend Pita Jungle. This place was clean and the servers were very friendly.

Thanks Benerific for the suggestion!
