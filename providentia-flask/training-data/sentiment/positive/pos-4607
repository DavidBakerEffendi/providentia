I work on 11th Ave and needed something quick, so I ran over to Mirchi. I wanted the vegetable curry but all that was left was the Daal. I came in right before 10pm after my shift so that's to be expected. I was Leary as iv never tried it before but he suggested I give it a go. I ended up getting the Daal with Rice and Naan.... Omg it was so good. Thanks for helping me venture out from my usual. It was delicious. The staff was extra friendly as well... Also sorry for coming in right before close. Much love.
