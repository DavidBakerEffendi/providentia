I ordered what I order at every Jimmy John's location: beach club, no tomato, add the peppers, and cut it in half. It's so much easier to eat when they cut it in half, and the peppers add so much flavor! I got exactly what I ordered, and I got it freaky fast! The store was clean, and the service was fast, what else do you need?
