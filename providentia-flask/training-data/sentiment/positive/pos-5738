Man!  Every visit to Arizona, I have to visit this place for a breakfast burrito.  Oh Humberto, how I miss you!!  the hot sauce has not flavor to interfer with the fabulous burrito, but it sure brings the heat, and brings out the flavor of the meal itself.  This truly is a most excellent hole-in-the-wall.

Highly recommend Sausage Egg and Cheese burrito, with three doses of hot sauce.  yummmm
