In love with this bakery especially the fudge brownies. The flax bread while quite good has oat flour. Unfortunately I have a sensitivity to oats so I will not be buying it again, but I will certainly be back for the brownies!!

If you get the loaf of bread call ahead and ask them to slice it for you. Bread is $8 and brownies are $4.
