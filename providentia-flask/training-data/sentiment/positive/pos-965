The wife and I tried this place a couple months ago and are hooked - we've been back 3 times.  Everything is made to order so expect a little wait - but it's worth it.  The food bursts with flavor and is obviously crafted from fresh ingredients.  The only suggestion we have is to please add a sample platter to the menu so that people can try several dishes at once.  We suggested one sample platter with poultry and the other vegetable.  If you already know what you like you're in for a treat.
