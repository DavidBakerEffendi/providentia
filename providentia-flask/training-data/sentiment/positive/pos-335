We've been coming to dine here for years, the food is great and the service is fantastic!
Marlon is our server and he makes us feel so welcomed! His service is exceptional, it's what keeps us coming back! 
Although the it's a bar/pub the dining area is cozy and kid friendly. It's nice and dark to provide a very relaxing atmosphere. This is our go-to local restaurant.
