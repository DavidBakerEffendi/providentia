Pizzeria Libretto has ruined pizza for me, and I mean that in the most positive way.

I went for the first time in the dead of winter and the warm steamy interior was oh-so welcoming, thick with the smell of dough, sauce, and goodness. I had a cocktail (can't remember the name) but it was a smoked rosemary sort of cocktail which was really nice, strong (which you don't get at a lot of restaurants anymore) and complimented the meal well. My friend, being a vegetarian, had a white sauce pizza  with mushrooms, if I remember correctly. Whatever it was, it was totally yummy, but it didn't stand a chance next to my Nduja sausage pizza. Seeing it come to the table, I was worried I wouldn't finish it due to the sheer size of the thing, but I devoured it, and my friend hers. It was just pizza heaven...I haven't been able to get it out of my mind since that time, and other pizzas just aren't doing it for me anymore. The sausage was magical, the sauce was tasty and just spicy enough, and the crust was not too dense nor too thin and flimsy. We ended the meal with a chocolate gelato with some sort of crumb or crunch topping. It was marvelous and really capped the meal off right. We raved and raved all the way home and afterwards. I can't wait to go back. Haven't been to the Ossington location but would love to try it out.

I guess my only criticism would be of the service and the price. The service was okay; slow throughout the night but our waitress was nice enough. It's also a little bit more than I usually want to spend on a typical dinner, but the food was just...ecstasy. 

I've been pizza-ruined. Thanks a lot, PL.
