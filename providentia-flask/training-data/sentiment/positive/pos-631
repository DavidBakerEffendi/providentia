Loved this place when they first opened in Tempe. Went there all the time with my girlfriends. But we moved to QC so the drive was just too far. But I has so happy to see they opened one closer to me. We went to check it out and it is just as good as Tempe. They have a few more non sushi menu items which made the husband happy. Their spicy ramen was tasty as well as the sushi. I love going here because I don't have to spend $10 a roll that I might not finish. This is a good place to take someone to introduce them to sushi too. Gives them an opportunity to try little bit of everything.
