This is my local hidden gem of a restaurant.  I've been several times (only once attached to bowling) and been happy each time.  It's especially good for groups and it's a great backup if the Lizard or Oak Barrel has a line because it has a modern Ohio City like atmosphere but there are always tables open.  
I really like their artichoke dip-it's a little thin but has a really unique taste and tastes good with their specialty chips.  
I've ordered sandwiches, pasta and pizza. All was good and a good size.
