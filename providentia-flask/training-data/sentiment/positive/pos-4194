I left my first visit to MaryBe very impressed. The owners took a shabby old pizza joint and turned it into a bright, airy and refreshing space. The vibe is perfectly in line with the food & drink offerings that are both healthy and delicious. 

My colleague and I started off our lunch with fresh lemonade which was the perfect balance of sweet & tart. So refreshing!

We shared the roasted sweet potatoes, masala cauliflower, kale & red cabbage caesar and roasted beets as well as the red lentil dahl. Everything was very fresh, hearty and so well composed. My favourites were the cauliflower and the caesar.

The best part was that we left feeling full but not gross as everything is so fresh & healthy. I'm looking forward to going back to try some of the other dishes!
