my filet medium-rare was cooked perfectly, my husband  had filet with  oscar style crab asparagus and Bearnaise sauce.  I thought he was going to lick the plate. Caesar salad and clam chowder to start. probably one of the best experiences and food that I've ever had, absolutely nothing to complain about. our 5 year wedding anniversary was acknowledged several times by the waiter and the floor manager who came around and knew us by name, how awesome for a first-time experience! they also give you dessert which was a molten lava chocolate cake with fresh whipped cream and berries with little vanilla wafers. I almost cried that's how good it tasted. they give you a little box of chocolate truffles that I have yet to try and $25 off your next visit, worth every Penny of. our $250 Bill.
a must-try for your special occasion!
