As a resident of the neighbourhood, I am always excited when a new restaurant opens - although the competition is stiff on this stretch of Mount Pleasant, as there are several outstanding food options in the area.

With that in mind, Tavolino certainly lives up to its' neighbours. The food here is simply excellent. The owner, Vince, recommended the special 'Pork Cheek Caesar Salad' and allowed us to order it, even though it was part of a prix fixe menu that we did not partake in. The reco was spot on, as it was the best Caesar salad I have ever enjoyed.

Although the salad was a tough act to follow, the mains certainly held up. My wife and I enjoyed the gorgonzolla gnocchi and orecchiette bolognese. Both were outstanding. The flavours were brilliant and the sauces not too heavy. Perfectly balanced meals.

We took home a brunch menu, which also looks very intriguing. We will be sampling this at our first opportunity.
