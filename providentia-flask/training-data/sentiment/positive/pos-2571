We have been enjoying Sushi Tomo for at least the past seven years and the quality of the sushi has been consistent. The waitstaff is ridiculously attentive and welcoming. Our favorite rolls include the Tomo Roll (shrimp tempura with eel sauce and avocado) , the Volcano Roll (shrimp tempura with spicy mayo and spicy salmon) and the spicy salmon or tuna hand roll. The spicy tako salad (octopus in a spicy mayo sauce) is a MUST! It is our favorite sushi in Pittsburgh!
