I've eaten at Le Chalet Crec probably about 4 or 5 times over the years. Whenever I'm in Saint-Sauveur with my Canadian relatives we always eat here. It's BYOB, so definitely bring your own wine. 

The service is friendly, the portions are very generous, and the food is extremely delicious. We always start with tzatziki and taramasalata. For entrees in the past I've ordered the sole, the dore, and the mixed grill. 

My visits have spanned over quite a few years so I don't remember the earliest visits as well, but most recently I was there in August and it was as good as I remembered. If you're in Saint-Sauveur, look no further than Le Chalet Grec for a tasty meal and great service.
