I have to update my review - imagine my surprise, when after seeing a magic show with the kids at the Riviera, we passed the Peppermill. Wait a minute - I swear I have been here before. Maybe it's sad when you have to consult Yelp to figure out what you did about 3 years ago, but I did.

This time, we were here with the kids, and we had a fantastic night - maybe the best night of our whole trip, because after feeding Thing 1 and Thing 2 a massive burger / pancake / french toast / whatever the hell they ate they insisted on having a dessert. 

" Too much food " we said " you'll never finish it "

"OH YES WE WILL"

"Wanna bet?" Oh yeah baby.

The largest banana splits I have ever seen in my life arrived - they must have had 5lbs of ice cream and four bananas apiece on them, there was no way the boys are going to finish them. They approached their task with grim determination. After a few minutes it was clear they were not enjoying themselves - this was work.

" you're not allowed to stop - you have to finish them "

" what sort of parents are you guys that you are making us eat this -this is force feeding, this is torture - you guys are completely irresponsible"

Jesus, I laughed so much. It was fantastic. Great service, great food, great value - and they had a Fog Cutter on the menu - it was a bit sweet, but it was decent enough.
