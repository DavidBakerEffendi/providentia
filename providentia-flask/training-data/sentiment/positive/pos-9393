We like New Mexican food.  This along with Blue Adobe on Country Club are the best in the valley so far.  We like spicy but not extreme.  Both restaurants can make you cry if not careful.  But taste needs to be most important.  Their food is always tasty.  Today a family presented their staff with a screaming challange.  The staff remained calm and polite.  I would not have been able to keep my cool with that family (even if sedated).  When the family walked out we were all relieved and thanked the staff.  

We drive 25 miles just to eat here will continue that practice.
