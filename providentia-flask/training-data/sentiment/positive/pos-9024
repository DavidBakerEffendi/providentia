I usually have a lot (too much, actually) to say about my Chinese food. I'll just leave my usual wordiness out and say that this is delicious. And although we got everything to go, I would love to dine in. It's rare to find an actual Chinese restaurant as opposed to just a tiny takeout joint. It was cute inside and reminded me of the old Chinese restaurants on Avenue U in Brooklyn. Old-fashioned, but with really nice service.

Food was great. They have brown rice as an option. Egg rolls are the bomb. Need I say more?
