I have been to Vegas lots of times but really haven't had the opportunity to see the fountains in all its glory, during the summer there are usually people 20 deep (or so it seems) on the sidewalk so getting a good view is hard. I also don't love crowds when people are standing so close you could share one pair of shorts. It was my birthday so my gorgeous wife decided to take me to the Eiffel tower restaurant after the show and we had plenty of time to see 8 or so shows during our meal. It is without a doubt one of the best shows in Vegas. Now I can say I have nearly seen it all. Superb especially from an elevation.
