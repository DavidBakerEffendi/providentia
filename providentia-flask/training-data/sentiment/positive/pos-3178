I don't usually go for corporate food; however, Fleming's is an exception. On my last visit I had a New York Strip, rare and ordered a host of sides for the table including sautéed mushrooms, sautéed spinach and mash potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of coolness in the middle. The sides were delicious and the service superb. Never felt rushed the entire evening. By Phoenix standards, Fleming's is a little expensive, but well worth the money.
