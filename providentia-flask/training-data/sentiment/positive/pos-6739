I had the fried chicken bowl with curry. It was simple but I really enjoyed it. Chicken was very fresh and crispy without feeling greasy or too heavy. The veggies were steamed crisp. I think the people who are disappointed are expecting something different. The food is simple but sometimes that's not so bad if the quality is there. I will return for the Chicken with Curry for sure. 
Very friendly positive vibe. Generous with the sauces and sides.
