So I've been back twice since the first visit and I'm still happy! The first visit I had the soup special, I was really craving some soup in the cold weather. It was a vegetable quinoa soup and it was definitely big enough to fully satisfy me. It comes with a bread roll and had some lemon slices, yum! I loved the citrus in the soup and loved the quinoa!

Second visit was Fish Friday. It looks like they have fish specials every Friday so that's what I'm calling it now haha. I try not to eat fried foods so I asked if I could get a salad with it instead, to which the staff were very accommodating. Just look at the picture, I got a hearty side salad and a big filet. The salad was nice and fresh and love that it had kalamata olives and not the yucky black ones. The onion, tomato and mango pico de gallo on top of the fish was delicious! I couldn't get enough of it. The fish was cooked well also. I was so stuffed I had to take some of the salad home.

As always the staff were friendly and welcoming. Definitely going to keep coming here when I have lunch out.
