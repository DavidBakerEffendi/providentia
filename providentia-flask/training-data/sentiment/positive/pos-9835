My first time here found this place by accident decided to give it a try we tried the shrimp ceviche and the siete mares soup and a shrimp taco everything was delicious the soup was to die for did get packed really quick so we went in perfect timing will definitely return only thing I didn't really like was random people coming in trying get you to buy stuff besides that cool little spot
