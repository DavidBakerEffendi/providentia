MOST EXCELLENT Korean restaurant.. probably the best one I've tried in Vegas. I've ordered a myriad of things in the 2 visits and they've all been damn good. My favorite has been their yukgaejang (spicy beef soup), which is almost on par with my mom's. Oh, their spicy pork and squid stir fry is REAAALLY good. As in my mom, who doesn't like pork, likes it, and my husband, who doesn't like squid, has no problem plucking out the pork. Their Korean-Chinese dishes are also very very good.. their jjajjangmyun is second only to Young King's version in Los Angeles. Oh, and their loco moco tasted almost as good as the version I last had on the Big Island.

As a testament to how good this place is, my folks moved out to Vegas about a month ago, and this place was the first Korean place they checked out on their own, based on the to-go order I brought back for them the day of their move. My mom likes their soon dooboo, and said their kimchi is also really good. 

Pay no heed to the neighborhood nor the strip mall location of this place, as their food is on par with some of the Korean restaurants in K-town Los Angeles. Yep, that good.
