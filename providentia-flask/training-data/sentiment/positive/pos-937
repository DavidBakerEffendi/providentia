Absolutely absolutely incredible dining experience here. You are treated just as if you are family. Frequent customers are remembered and don't even need to place an order, the Lang Van staff already know what you want. The food is incredible, the staff and personal table services are far beyond excellent, what else can I say?, this place is a hidden gem. From appetizer to dessert, this restaurant's cuisine and dining experience is one that I would highly recommend.
