If I could define my life in terms of food, it would be defined with "Cacio e Pepe." Minimalistic and open to interpretation.  Cacio e Pepe sounds easy enough to prepare. Black peper, Pecorino, parmesan, olive oil, butter, salt to taste and pasta. Once complete, this is a symphony of flavors that makes even an amateur chef look like Mozart.  

From the look of East Side Pizza, you think "typical pizza joint." And for the majority, you are right. But when it comes to pasta, man, even Scarpetta can take lessons from this typical joint. $24 for spaghetti with tomato and basil by Scott Conant ?? How about $6 for Cacio e Pepe of equal calibre by mysterious chef at East Side Pizza. AND it comes with a house salad!! Or Tortellini with chicken cooked to perfection! 

Let's just say the pasta dishes are so good, I forgot this place serves pizza. I hope this is not a fluke but I will be dining here quite frequently for lunch and dinner.
