I meet up with one of my friends from college about once per month, and we go out to eat somewhere on his work lunch break.  One of our recent lunches took us to Sonoma Grille.  It's probably one of my favorite places we have ever gone.

The wait staff here is exceptionally friendly, and they want to help you find the perfect meal.  If you don't like chatty servers, this isn't your place.  However, our waiter was super helpful, and it was just his first day!  They must have some pretty fierce training.

I ordered the crabcake BLT.  Crabcake, sunny side up egg, tomato, coleslaw, and bacon on a sandwich.  YES, please!  It was delicious, though a bit messy.  So if you're trying to look graceful.... Who cares?  This sandwich is worth it!

I really loved the ambiance here as well.  Table cloths and cloth napkins for the win.  They also had a huge wine list if you don't have to go to work after your meal.  When I've gone past at night, this place gets crowded, especially after shows at the Benedum.  You might want to consider a reservation if possible.

I can't wait to return and test out more of this menu!
