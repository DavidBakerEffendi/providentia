Amazing! I'm not a golfer, but I ended up loving it. I went with my family who loves golf and we planned on staying an hour since I don't golf. Over 6 hours later and we left only because we had a far drive. This place has it all down right. The food is amazing. I didn't expect it to be so good. The brisket tacos and chorizo sliders are my favorite.  Good quality food and so many unique items. I highly recommend this place for people of all ages. My teens loved it. The bays are nice and roomy.  There was 7 of us and each bay can have up to 10 people. You must try it. We will be back again soon.
