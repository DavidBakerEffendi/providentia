First time eating there last week, was a littled worried because a few other reviews said music too loud... I thought atmosphere was mellow, music consistent level for a burger joint and not offensive. The burgers are thinner than your typical burger but I think that's what makes them delicious! No bloating heavy feeling after. The cashier suggested we get just 1 fry instead of the 3 we planned which was wonderful! Fries are huge! An employee sweeping floors went out of way to bring me a highchair which was very appreciated and surprising. Food all freshly made and can see employees preparing it. Will be back to try milkshakes for sure. Thank you for a nice dinner.
