Well Pure Pizza is another place that falls in the category of "I finally had to buy a living social to try".  Apparently, I need the motivation of an expiring coupon to help me eat some pizza that I know is going to be great.

As per usual, I am all over a wild mushroom pie like a dog in heat.  I chose the sprouted crust and let me tell you, it was the perfect combo with the earthy goodness of the shrooms. Others at the table had margherita and another pie that I can't recall at the moment. Both the other ones were on regular crust, which was also delicious, but I can't get over the sprouted crust.  I look forward to many a return visit.

Oh they also have local craft beer which is always a plus in my book.
