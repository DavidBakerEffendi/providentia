I don't care what other yelpers say. I love Oregano's!
This chain was started by Mark Russel, a former flight attendant for America West Airlines. I heard recently that he sold the business for 2.5 million, so the chain could expand outside Arizona. Good for him! 
I've been to  3 other locations, but this place is the one that my friends and I meet up all the time. Sometimes we just end up sitting at a bar if we don't want to wait. 
Parking is a joke here, but who cares! We come here for the food! 
I've had the Pablo Piccaso Salad and the Julius Ceasar. Both are huge! 3 people can share this. Boom Dip is also awesome and most definitely the Bollo Pasta. 

Portion sizes:  Perfect! This is the reason why we keep coming back. 

Execution:  Also perfect.  If I were to find something (anything) to criticize, it might be just the parking. 

Service:  Excellent. Waitstaff are very attentive and they give you  small samples of the blended bellini. (If you ask)  Totally squisito!

There's more to say, but you get the point.
