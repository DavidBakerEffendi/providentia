You'll feel like you're eating in a Havana Bistro with a Cuba Libre on the side and expect a hand rolled cuban cigar to follow your meal under palm trees.  

Which leaves one massive mystery: I've never seen a cuban cooking, serving, waiting the bar, or eating there.  I'm not sure a cuban has ever so much as walked by Saluds door.  Yet, magically, it tastes like everything was teleported over from Fidel Castro's personal chef right to your Pittsburgh plate.

Incredibly fresh dishes, high on flavor and quality.  The service was genuine and warm, and the bartender even offered us holiday cookies his wife made as a desert for free just to be friendly.  

The atmosphere is totally standard Lawrenceville/Pittsburgh bar, and has no hint of the cuban deliciousness that is conjured up in their kitchen.  They have a solid craft brew list with a large number of rotating bottles and drafts, and reasonable prices across the board.

I'd love to see the atmosphere match the excellent cuban food and strong service, but I'd gladly come back either way.  For great cuban food at great prices, Salud, I salute you!
