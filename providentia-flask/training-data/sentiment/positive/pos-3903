Just a quick update since I've been getting delivery from Pan Asian quite frequently from roadrunnerfood.com.  Hint:  It's listed on the website under David Wong's Pan Asian, not just Pan Asian.

The delivered food has been just as tasty as the items I've had in the restaurant.  And the food keeps really well.  Right now, I'm having some of the basil fried rice and grilled octopus salad for breakfast from the night before. :)

They may be running out of proper to go containers because occasionally I get rice in a strange container (making me think upon first inspection that they forgot the rice) or the liquidy curry in a standard foam hinged carryout wrapped in a plastic bag. They usually pack it in a soup container. But it's all good because the delivery folks are pretty careful with it.  More careful than I would be.  

Food is still great, but now there is delivery if you are willing to pay the delivery service charge for the third party delivery service.
