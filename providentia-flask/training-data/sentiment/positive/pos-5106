Made In Argentina  is just like eating at your favorite restaurant if you lived in Buenos Aires, but it's tucked away in an industrial area off Valley View. 

Fresh delicious empanadas, plus milanesas and traditional sandwiches like Lomitos, a delicious steak, ham, cheese and egg, on soft bread, sooooooo goooooood ! 

Also They have a great space for meetings or receptions on the side if Your having a get together or party.
