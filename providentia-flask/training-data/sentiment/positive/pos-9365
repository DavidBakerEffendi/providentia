This is a pretty good place to eat or drink or both. It has a nice bar area and connected to it is a good burger restaurant. I ordered the "big one" which is an little bigger than an average burger and very filling. I also had a side of the cheese poppers and they were soooo good. Love this place definitely coming back here.
