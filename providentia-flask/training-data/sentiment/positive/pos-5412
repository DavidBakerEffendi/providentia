My dad would eat here for lunch every day of his visit if he could.  We got him a Groupon as a present, and that makes two visits this trip, which is one less than the last visit.  There's a huge selection of sandwiches.  We like the Knuckle Sandwich best.  The sides are also good.   I'm sure I'll be back a few times once my dad returns for a visit.
