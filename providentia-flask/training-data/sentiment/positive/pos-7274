ZK grill is such a hidden gem! I love the food and the portions are great for about $10-$13 a plate. They are a little take out place with minimal seating but their food comes out fast so there doesn't ever seem to be a huge line. I really like the shrimp platter. It comes with some seasoned tiger shrimp, a large portion of saffron rice and a salad. Their salad dressing is ok, but everything else is amazing! The shrimp is fresh and cooked well to where it is bouncy but not tough. The rice has some flavor and if you add the spice at the table, there is a tart and salty flavor. Besides my usual dish, I have heard their gyros are great too!
This place is a friendlier and cheaper version of a place in Tucson called Alibaba. The baklava here is just as sweet and delightful. It is still missing something since I'm still looking for the perfect baklava, but they tried. I highly recommend the food here and signing up for their discount texts.
