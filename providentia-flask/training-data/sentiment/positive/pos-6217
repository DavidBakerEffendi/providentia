we were in the mood for some vegetarian fare and two of the places we wanted to try were closed, so we remembered pita jungle!!!

it was 3pm on a sunday so noone was there. we basically had the place to ourselves, but since there were so many takeout orders for superbowl sunday, the cook service was a bit slow. 

we each had one of the daily fish specials, one mahi mahi dish and one other tuna dish. the mahi mahi was ornately presented and tasted even better! with all the extra hummus, we both got quite full! each dish was about 10 bucks, so we felt well spent! good wait staff. we'll have to place pita jungle closer to the front of the memory bank!
