Food was so good! We got an omelette crepe (not sure what it's called on the menu behind the counter) and the lady that served us was really nice and patient. There was another couple there as well. I loved the frozen chocolate covered fruits (especially the mango!). I wish it was closer to us :( that's the only downside. Prices were very reasonable. The shop is small and there was another guy working there who was so helpful and kind with helping my daughter pick out frozen fruits to put in her cup.
