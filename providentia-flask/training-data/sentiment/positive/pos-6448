This is a super cute little place. The decor is simple yet nice and inviting. The owner is very sweet and welcoming. 

The menu is completely vegan. I've never had a completely vegan meal, on purpose. I tried the avocado toast and the detox juice. The juice is slightly sweet but has a great earthy taste. Exactly what I'm looking for in a beer based juice. The avocado taste well, that was simply amazing. 9 grain bread, lightly toasted and covered with fresh mashed avocado, cherry tomatoes, almond feta and walnuts. It is served with two slices of vegan bacon as well. 

This was an impromptu stop as I was driving by but I will definitely come back.
