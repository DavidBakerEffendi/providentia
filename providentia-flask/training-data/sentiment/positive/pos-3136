I had amazing service so I thought I would give her a five-star yelp the food was probably a 3 to 4 star but she made up for it and the fact that they didn't hassle my service animal I like them even more.  I had the club sandwich and my date had the French dip they were both mediocre but I will say the french fries in the onion rings were very tasty and they give you a huge portion next time we're splitting something.   Virginia was our server and we loved her
