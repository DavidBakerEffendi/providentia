My coworkers and I stopped in a few weeks ago after work on a Friday night.  The place was not very busy and we were greeted immediately by someone who seemed like a manager.  We were sort of a big group so they began putting a couple tables together for us on the patio where we asked to be sat.  Our server came over quickly to give us a run down on the beer list and make a few recommendations,  she even brought a sample of one of the draft beers we were curious about without us asking.  She was very knowledgeable and I really enjoyed the beer I landed on. There is also a nice selection od specialty cocktails and a full bar. We weren't super hungry but one of my coworkers ordered the short rib which we all snacked on. It was delicious!  Atmosphere was modern but casual with 90's movies playing on the surrounding TVs and some guests drinking the 32 oz bottles served in brown bags.  Overall I really enjoyed this place and can't wait till I come back to try more off the menu!
