Love this place.  When people say old school Vegas, this is the place they mean.  Tons of pictures of celebrities on the wall but I'm lucky if I can name 1 in 10 of them.

The menu is limited and posted on boards on the wall.  You pretty much just pick whatever item you want and it comes with soup or salad, beverage including house wine, and a cappucino thing after dinner.  Most meals are about $22 and include everything I just mentioned, so pricewise its a good deal.

I've always found the food to be good but I usually just stick to the pasta dishes.

If you're a high maintenance or trendy type of person this is not the place for you - you'll be unhappy as soon as you walk in the door.  If you're laid back and like things a little retro or different then you'll really appreciate this place.
