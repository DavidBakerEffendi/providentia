First time in today for lunch. Wow what a wonderful place. Our server was gracious and catered to our needs. The menu is extensive and has a lot of options for a wide variety of eaters. They have meals for vegetarians, vegans, gluten free and meat lovers. They also have a nice selection of desserts to satisfy your sweet tooth. Overall great fresh Mediterranean cuisine.
