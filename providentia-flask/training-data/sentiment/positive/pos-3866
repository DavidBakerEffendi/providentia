I walked into the place and thought it was closed!  I also thought it was a dining hall but it's a restaurant.  They have a limited menu as they only do a few things but there's nothing wrong with that.  

I ordered a chicken tikka masala roti to go and man was I annoyed that I was not given a wheelbarrow to take this thing home in.

The flavour was really good, it has great filling compared to some of the other places I've been for roti.  It wasn't just good filling but good flavour in the filling,  It was damn good, damn large and a decent price.  I'll be back to try the lamb.

I forgot to mention I ordered my roti medium hotness and it had serious kick to it!  This is not a North American hot scale it's the universal proper hot scale so adjust accordingly!
