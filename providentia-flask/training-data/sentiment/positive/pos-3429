The coffee is fabulous, the space warm and inviting, the sweet treats tasty as can be and the owner/operators and staff charming and welcoming. Hands down, no holds barred, a definite 5/5. 

But there is something more to this cool Cafe: the food - it's unique, its fresh and home made, and most importantly it tastes incredible. If only Yelp would let me, I'd give Replika a 10.
