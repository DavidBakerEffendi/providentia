Went with my wife.  Service was a wee bit slow, but the owner said that two of his staff had experienced a traffic accident on the way to work, so he was having to hold down the fort almost by himself with the assistance of one waitress.  Food was outstanding.  I have paid a great deal more for much worse food.  The pricing was excellent.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting REAL Greek food.
