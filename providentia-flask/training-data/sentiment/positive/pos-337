A very traditional back in the days diner that everyone should experience at least once. A lot of the furniture was well maintained including the individual jukeboxes at the booths. It's a small diner therefore amount of seating and hallway spaces were limited. We went on Father's Day and had to wait about 30-45 mins in the heat (minimal AC).

FOOD:
- Roasted beef + gravy was a delicious combination. They advertised on their logo that they have the best roasted beef and they did not lie. Never chewy, easy to bite into. The homemade coleslaw was very homemade as not a lot of flavour compared to the ones from the stores. 

- Home fries was seasoned well, you don't need ketchup at all. 

SERVICE:
- not as organized. When you see people lining up, you would have thought to leave a name on the list, but nope. They just let you stand and wait, when there's an open table, they asked how many in each party and if it fits the table then they will be served.
