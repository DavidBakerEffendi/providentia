My husband brought us here for dinner and all the hype was well worth it! We had tacos, pastor, barbacoa and pollo, very delicious! The tortillas were soft and fresh, they have a salsa bar with various toppings, we tried the guacamole and salsa Rojas, both were delicious. We will definitely be back!
