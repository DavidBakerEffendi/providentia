We ate here for a friends birthday and we showed up just before closing and they did not once ever push us to leave because they are closed.  Even our food came out perfect!  The server we had Lorenzo Garcia was nice, funny and always made sure we had everything we wanted!

I love Outback and we do eat here very often but this experience on this day was outstanding and something that should be told to all!

Thank you for a great birthday celebration!
