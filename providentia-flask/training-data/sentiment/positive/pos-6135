Finally! I can talk about how amazing this place is, too!

AH-MAZING! 

As Kat said, "same owners, same menu", only a few dollars cheaper!
AND, there's no huge line up. 
They even have seats you can sit at while you wait for your take out.

PLUS, when I was there last night around 7pm, the dining area had one lowly couple in it ...it was quiet and very very clean.

The 2 men (okay, more like one young dude, and an older dude)  who greeted us when we walked in, where very polite, and well dressed with matching white dress shirts (tucked in, which is a rare sight these days!) and black dress pants.  

They quickly and efficiently took my order.
And BAM! 10 minutes later, my order was all ready to go.

Our rotis were even HOT by the time we arrived back home. , And was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yummy. (i'm sure you get the point with all of those 'o's!)

I'm dying for more. 
Maybe even again tonight --
Make it a ROTI NIGHT, 'cause I said so!
