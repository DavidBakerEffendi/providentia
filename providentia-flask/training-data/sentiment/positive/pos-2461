Until the day I tasted their simple glazed donut, I had always thought, "A donut is a donut, what's not to like?" Yes, it was a fool-mouthed, careless, uneducated attitude towards the mighty donut, but when you are talking about fried dough covered in a sugary glaze, it seems like a reasonable attitude. 

This was the second stop on our Saturday donut crawl (highly recommended adventure), and when I entered two thoughts entered my head:
1. Why is everything behind bars?
2. Why does everything in that case look like a dream treat from Willy Wonka?

The answer to the first question: it is a slightly tough part of town, but not any different than where I lived in Atlanta for close to 5 years, so I wasn't running to my car in fear. I just took notice that they were prepared for potential theft. And, rightly so because if I were a thief, I would want to steal these donuts.

The answer to the second question: Because these are some frickin' fantastic donuts. Okay, granted, that I had half a glazed donut, but that has been my standard for tasting virtually every donut in town, and the second my teeth bit down into this doughy delight, something was different. The dough was soft and light and melted into my mouth like magic. The glaze appeared to be perfectly fused as my lap was not covered in pesky glaze chips. My husband described it as a "giant Kripy Kreme," which he considers the icon of doughnut perfection, as many do. Personally, I would take this jumbo sized version over those teeny little things any day.  

There are a couple of booths to sit down and enjoy your selections, and the place is incredibly clean despite being older. 

Their goods are a bit more expensive (.90 for one), but this isn't just any donut. This donut showed me that in the land of donuts some are truly kings.
