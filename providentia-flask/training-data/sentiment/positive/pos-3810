Came in for the first time... Disnt know what to expect after reading the reviews. I got the spicy burger was definitely not disappointed its got just the right amount of "spiciness" I likes it the fr√≠es jazzy fries were delicious! But what blew my mind was my sons burger. The original #1 OMG! so simple yet PACKED with flavor it was delicious and the parmesan fries are so delish!! We will def be back in thia spot ita delicious and worth the price. Hifghly recommend it!
