Nice casino that is on the outskirts of town but still within 10 minutes of the strip depending on traffic.  Silverton itself is a nice casino that has alot of events that happen here from food festivals to gun shows. You can find a hidden gem at Twin Creeks with a great happy hour and good food.  Definetly a good place to check out when your in town.
