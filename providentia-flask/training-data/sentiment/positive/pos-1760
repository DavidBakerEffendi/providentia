Village just keeps getting better! I love how they change their menu! Gives me a variety of new options to try every few months. As of right now the Beef Wellington Short Ribs are my favorite!!! So tender and wrapped in the most flaky delicious pastry! Ugh, to die for. Also loving the new addition to the martini list - the Himalayan. Just the right amount of sweet!
