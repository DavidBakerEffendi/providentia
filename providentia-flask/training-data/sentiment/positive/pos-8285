I love this place!  In fact I went a couple of times Once to their Happy Hour which is 3PM until 6PM (even on Saturdays) and then for lunch.  I love Fox restaurants but even though I've lived in Phoenix for 7 years had not tried this one. Just recently moved to downtown Phoenix and take the lite rail home. It's in a great location and I ordered the hummus which was outstanding. The people next to me ordered the pretzels and decided to order them next time. I also ordered the Rum drink and it was so good. A few days later, I was early for their Happy Hour but so hungry ordered lunch. I got the squash salad and it had an interesting ingredient...gingersnaps!! Delicious!  Also ordered the pretzels but there were so many, could not eat all of them so they were wrapped along with the cheese dip to take home. Service was outstanding and very nice atmosphere. I will definitely go to the Happy Hour again.   I was so impressed that I told a lot of my friends about this place too.
