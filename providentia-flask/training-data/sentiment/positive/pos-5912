Really cute caf√©. Great for dates or group hangouts. Came here on a Friday and played chess for a few hours (they close at 2am). The staff are knowledgeable with the games and can make good recommendations on what to play. I also highly recommend the salted caramel latte with almond milk! It was so yummy and not overly sweet. Also got the nutella latte but it was a bit too sweet for me.
