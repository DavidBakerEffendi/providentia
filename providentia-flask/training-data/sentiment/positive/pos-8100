First time at this place (we've always and only gone to Hash House A Go Go for weekend brunch) and were very impressed with the food and most especially the service that was rendered to us by Diana. She was very attentive and seemed to genuinely love what she does! It was a Sunday so the place was packed and didn't expect much from a server who's waiting on so many tables so we were pleasantly surprised. My husband enjoyed the 5-way Cincy and the Haole Loco was bomb! We will definitely be back to try their other offerings!
