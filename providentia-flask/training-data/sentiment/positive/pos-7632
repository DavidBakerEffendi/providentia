The owner is a really nice guy and he strives to give you the absolute best. He knows what he's doing! They make all sorts of their food in house - cheese curds, brioche, sauces etc...You are getting some serious TLC when you dine here. My fiance and I came later on a Friday night and had a nice, quiet patio all to ourselves. The music was wonderful (80s!!!)

I had an excellent Pinot Noir and my fiance enjoyed a beer from the rotating cask that had just been opened that day. We had fish and chips and a Prime Rib sandwich with poutine. I walked home in a food coma! It was incredible and I know I'll be back often. My poor wallet! But seriously, it's so nice to support a local place that clearly goes above and beyond.
