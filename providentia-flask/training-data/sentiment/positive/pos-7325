So, at this time, I work across the street at Rusconi's American Kitchen. The whole area around this Shea / Tatum plaza doesn't have too many "shining" favorites (in my opinion). However, I LOVE this spot!
On my lunch breaks, I go across the street and enjoy the Short Rib Dip, and the Charred Octopus. Both are excellent.
The overall decor of The Covenant is vibrant, blue, open, and overall comfortable. The blonde lady bartender is always so sweet. The younger day bartender (shorter guy, beard, maybe 20-25?) also very polite and always on top of service.

For dinner, I love their wine selection and prices. Usually a bottle of Clark & Telephone (maybe 70 dollars which is a steal) along with the Chile Relleno or Short Rib.

An excellent spot, that would absolutely KILL IT in a spot like the Quarter or near Fashion Square.
