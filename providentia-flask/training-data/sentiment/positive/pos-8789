Been there several times for lunch and the food has been consistently wonderful although their chips are a bit too salty for me.  The place is small but efficient, you see no waste of space.  Yes sometimes you get your own water and clean your own table- no big deal!  Outdoor seatings are great for Phoenix weather. Overall, It's cute and friendly.  Nothing luxurious but intimate space and modest establishment.   We need more places like this one here.
