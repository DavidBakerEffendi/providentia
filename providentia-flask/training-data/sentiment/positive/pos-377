Now didn't I tell you we'd be back?  Eight months is really too long though.  

We were down in the area a week ago and Yelped for local eats.  We saw the deal going on ($10 for $20 worth).  I immediately bought the deal knowing that we would have to venture back soon (we decided to try a new restaurant that day).  

We made our way back today and tagged a newbie along.  The place was empty but it was only 5pm on a Sunday.  The owners were great just like the last time.  David even remembered us from our one visit (8 months ago) and my initial review on the place.  *blush*  Anyway, this is what we had:

Crying Tigers (again) - still oh so good
Pad Sew-Yee (or something) with beef/spice level 4 - very good, will probably go up to spice level 6 next time
Malaysian Yellow Curry with chicken/spice level 4 - very good, thought about getting another to go for later cravings (I do live about 25-30 from this glorious place).
Tempura Cheesecake - *sigh* so bad for the body but so good for the mouth!

As you can see my dedication to delightful and unique foods will force me to drive...almost anywhere.  I wish I could visit more often.  And the prices are just right.  An average plate is $7-$9 (I tend to round up when I see $8.95, just so you know).

David, thanks for the wonderful service and please, give our compliments to the chef.  ;)
