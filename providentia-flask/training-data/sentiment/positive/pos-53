Nice place, plenty of space and clean.  Service was very quick and professional, drinks were kept filled.  Food was very fresh and tasty, came out fast and steaming hot.  Spice was good, but perhaps a little on the mild side when I ordered one dish at a "9", but I love spicy food.  We will definitely return.
