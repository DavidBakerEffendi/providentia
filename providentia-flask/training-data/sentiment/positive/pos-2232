As I write this I sit here enjoying one of their delicious dishes.  I was here for the first time several weeks ago and their chicken pizza and spanikopita were awesome.  The owner remembered me which is always a nice touch.  But what I like most is that he walks around and personally greets everyone to see how their experience is.  That's top notch! Having a new dish today which is incredibly tasty as well.  And the food is high quality, with fantastic tasting water.  So nice to not have to buy a bottle of water these days just to get a basic necessity of life!  And last but not least, the service is always great.
