I was walking to Qdoba when I passed Freshii and it caught my eye. I could tell that it looked like a healthy option for quick food. There were several bowl options and all looked delicious, I had a hard time choosing. Per the cashiers recommendation I got the teriyaki twist bowl with chicken. It was sooo good! Everything tasted fresh and the chicken was better quality than I've had at other quick food places (like chipotle). They also have a variety of fresh juices and smoothies to choose from. The only sad thing is they close at 5pm so be aware of that! I highly recommend!
