Gold Spike is definitely one of the best bars here in Las Vegas. It's legitimately a playground for adults with games and things to do throughout the whole place! Just grab a drink and either stay inside or outside! Both have so much for you to do, they give you no excuse to be bored. Plus the music is always crackin too. Whenever my friends wanna hit downtown Gold Spike is definitely always either the first bar we hit, or the bar we finish the night at. So much fun, and you don't have to be jammed up in a tiny space like many of the other bars, this place is HUGE!!
