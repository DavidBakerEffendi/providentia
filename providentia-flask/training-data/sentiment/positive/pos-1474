Best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Period. Nothing compares to their delicious cheese-crisp, fresh tortilla chips and yummy salsa. Oh, and their machaca beef enchiladas with a little extra cheese will have you turning your car around by the time you reach Bethany Home and uncontrollably driving back for round two.* 

Their service can be a little rough around the edges at times, but in the end it really doesn't matter. You didn't go to this place to bitch and moan about service; you went here to eat the best dinner you've had all week. 

My only last piece of advice... eat a lot early on in the game, their dessert leaves a lot to be desired. They could get some legit honey for the sopapillas (vs. Kraft packets), and the fried ice cream is so-so.
