I've been wanting to visit this restaurant for years and it was worth the wait.  The food was delicately prepared and arranged- beautiful presentations tend to make you savor and sample. And the butterfish!  It tastes exactly how it sounds. Our server was very versed, knowledgeable, and friendly. Small intimate setting. It is nice to know that Las Vegas has places like this that put a delicious and thought-out spin on what a typical meal consists  of.
