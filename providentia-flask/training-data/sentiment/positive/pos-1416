Happy to have this place.  A lot of things well organized and the place is clean-considering it's in an old commercial center building. The two employees I interacted with were nice.   A small kitchen/restaurant in the back of the store and a few tables for dining.  Sweets are available as well!  I like to get the variety pack of sweets; sold by the pound.  There are many jewelry, decorations, statuary and other imported items.
