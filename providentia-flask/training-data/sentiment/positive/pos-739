This is a fantastic dining place for any sized group. The menu is gigantic, the food quality is superb, the atmosphere is fun and fancy, the service is phenomenal, and the location is easy to find: South Park Mall. The interior is spacious, and there's a separate section where you can purchase cheesecakes to-go and other sauces/ingredients and even beanie babies (if I remember correctly).
