As a newbie to Mexican food this is a nice transition from taco bell.  The rice and beans are savory and the enchiladas are guaranteed to lull you to sleep soon afterwards.  Fresh salsa,  cheap drinks.  Friendly  and colorful environment.  They were  patient as I inquired about the variety and my general ignorance and misprouncation of the food.   I shall return!
