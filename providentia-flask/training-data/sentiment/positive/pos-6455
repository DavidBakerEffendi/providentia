Oh man! What a treat. Luckily this awesome little lunch spot is right by work. I listened to the Yelpers and took a late lunch this day. I went at about 2pm... lines were still long but went quickly. 

It's not the nicest place around and that's for sure. BUT these taco meats are loaded with mouth watering flavors. There is a burst of goodness in each bite. 

The lady at the counter was quick and new what she was talking about. I tried to order one thing and she told me it takes like 15 minutes. I immediately changed my order because I had to go back to work. It was much appreciated. 

This place could be my every Friday lunch, we will absolutely be back.
