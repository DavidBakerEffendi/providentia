Went here because of Montreal burger week to try their special burger for the occasion. It was a beef patty topped with avocado, a fried egg, jalape√±os, portobello mushroom etc. with great fries and a salad as sides. 
Such an amazing burger! Hard to eat because it's HUGE, but worth the battle.
Also the first place in Montreal that served a good bloody Caesar WITH olives and celery(All the other places so far don't, I mean not even the celery, seriously, celery is needed people)!

Worth the trip, and will be going here often.
