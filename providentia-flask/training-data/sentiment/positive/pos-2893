This is a fantastic restaurant! I have eaten at wonderful places all over the world and the meal my friends and I enjoyed at Sushi Samba competed with any other I have ever had. The restaurant is beautiful and the service was great. We had the pleasure of meeting Herb the Chef and he was amazing. I've considered making the 6 hour drive just to dine there again. I was in Vegas for a bachelor party and dinner at SS was by far the highlight of the weekend. We will be Back!

Thanks for a great time and great meal Herb and Staff!
