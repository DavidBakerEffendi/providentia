Steam whistle is life! When you have steam whistle for $5 on Sunday and serve steam whistle battered fish and chips.... Sold!!! I love this place. Food is really good and the service is on point. Truffle fries, fish and chips and almond crusted chicken fingers are a must try. Nice casual dinning experience with nice decor :)
