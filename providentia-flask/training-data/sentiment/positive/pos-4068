I ordered delivery over the weekend and it is possibly the best pizza in Pittsburgh!

I ordered a large pie, mozzarella sticks, fries, breadsticks, and an order of spaghetti and meatballs.  The only thing we weren't over the moon with were the mozzarella stick, but that's simply because we like it made a little differently.  The pizza and sauce was seriously so great.  I truly wish I tried them sooner.

They also delivered incredibly fast during the dinner hour which sort of shocked me.  I ordered through the Yelp app, so it was pretty easy!
