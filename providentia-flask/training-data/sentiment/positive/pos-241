Best bagels in LV! 
Omg. I didn't even know I liked bagels that much until I had 1 from here. My favorite is the spinach and feta bagel with light scallion smear. 
We always get a bowl of the chicken matzo ball soup because it comes with a bagel. The chicken matzo ball soup is also the best in town! It is packed with so much chicken and is perfectly seasoned and the broth is not oily. 
Service is nice and fast. I also like placing an order for take out at the counter and looking through the pastry selection... The Rugula is worth giving a try too! 

Hot Tip: Apparently, you can't call in an order of matzo ball soup for pick up... You HAVE to come in and order it at the counter....but it doesn't take that long anyways.
