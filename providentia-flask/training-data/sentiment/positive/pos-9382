Love it here. Always want to try other places when I'm out in the city, but often end up going here because I know it's delicious and reliable. The meatball panini is the perfect size with two meatballs, though you can go bigger if you're looking for leftovers! I love the mushroom gravy, personally. And the truffle fries--come on. Almost too good, and great to share. Last time I went, my mom and I split the hot fudge nut sundae with the vanilla ice cream balls and it literally was sitting in an inch of thick, hot fudge. It was beautiful. I'll be back next time I find myself in the city!
