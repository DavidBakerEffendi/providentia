Wife and I came back here because of a previously great experience here.

We were not disappionted. This place is a hidden gem. 

You enter from a pr√≠vate elevator and enter into a beautiful dining area. 

Perfect place for a romantic dinner. Clean, elegant, great wait staff and reasonable priced.

Don't miss out on this hidden gem when in Las Vegas.
