Has definitely one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! Super gooey, melty chocolate chunks, the cookie it self has a nice bit of crunch to it, but not overly hard. It's a great mixture of crunchy and soft and melty.

My personal favourite tho, is the ricotta pancake. The pancakes are probably some of my favourite since they aren't overly dense, and you don't feel like you're going to die by the end of the meal. These pancakes are soft and light-ish (you'll be definitely full but not on a death bed). The mixture of the syrup with the ricotta and blueberries goes to perfectly together. Just the right amount of sweetness. 

The benny's are also quiet amazing and delicious! The hollandaise sauce... just perfect~

Interior - gets super stuffy and hot. So if you decide to eat there, probably best to wear some light clothes or sit by the door... or both. It's almost overwhelmingly hot. But the food is definitely worth it.
