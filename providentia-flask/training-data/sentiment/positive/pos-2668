This place gets 5 stars because since I have left I have thought about how delicious their sushi is pretty much everyday! I cannot wait to go back and eat more sushi!

This review is based only on their sushi and nothing else as I did not try anything else. 

My date and I ordered 5 rolls: the Shrimp and Asparagus Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Unbelievable Roll, Blue Ginger Roll and the Sunday Roll. Let's start with the Unbelievable Roll- I can't explain the cream cheese but it is not the typical cream cheese used at other places. This cream cheese is soft and wonderfully paired with the sushi roll. The other great thing about this roll is the red snapper. You don't see very many places with red snapper on the menu let a lone in a sushi roll and boy oh boy was it fantastic!! The Blue Ginger roll is the most expensive because it has both filet and lobster but every bite is worth the splurge! The Sunday Roll was more like a dessert roll to me because it is topped with Mango with a mango sauce. It was not overwhelming and it was a great roll to split up the flavors of the other rolls we ordered.

This is a sushi place worth checking out! The prices are right and the flavors are powerful and every bite is delicious!
