Soooo GOOD!  The noodles have the perfect chew and texture.  They are thin which is so nice.  Broth is outstanding.  It's savory, rich and not over salted.  They are not hiding the flavor with salt.  Service was very friendly.  They explained everything, placed a nice, hot bowl of noodles in front of you and then just left you alone to drool and hoover it up.  :D. It's just so satisfying.  We'll be back!
