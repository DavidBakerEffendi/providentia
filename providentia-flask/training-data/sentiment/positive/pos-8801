Just finished dining at this amazing restaurant! Let me tell you, it was the most juicy and flavourful kabob I've had in Toronto! Gosh, I can't even believe I just found out about this place. I'm extremely satisfied! 

I ordered the Soltani dish for $22.00, which included a skewer of the steak kabob called barg, and a skewer of ground beef kabob called koobideh, served over a large portion of saffron Persian rice. 
The koobideh was extremely juicey! It had such a beautiful colour to it, with a moist and extremely flavourful taste. The barg was also very juicey and tender, and was cooked to perfection  (A nice medium). 

My boyfriend ordered the Vaziri, which was $20.00, and included a skewer of saffron marinated-chicken breast, and a skewer of the juicey koobideh  (ground beef).

The waiters were polite, and prompt with our food. The place was very busy and popular! The portions were perfect.

Overall, the experience was perfect. I cannot wait to re-visit this place!
