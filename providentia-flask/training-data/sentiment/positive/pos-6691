Definitely a once in a lifetime experience in Toronto! It truly is pitch black in there, and I thought it would be scary but it's actually okay. I also want to reiterate what so many people have said before: Dave is awesome! He's attentive and kind and full of good humour! We had the three course meal and everything was pretty good! 
For appetizers, we both agreed that the octopus was better than the calamari because the pieces are larger with more flavour
My steak was delicious, and the shrimp with rice was so good, even though the rice was a bit undercooked. Desserts we went with a surprise! And it was a delicious berry cheesecake. Empty plates back to the kitchen!
It is definitely a unique experience, and the first taste of every part of the meal just bursts with flavour. Would go again  for another special occasion :-)
