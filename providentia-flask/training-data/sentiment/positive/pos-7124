This is an amazing burger place !!! Double stack with Lett, Tomm pickles and onions with the house sauce was so good and cooked to perfection ... Tater tots were a lil greasy but awesome as well... I enjoyed it and cannot wait to go back ! Staff was also very friendly and helpful !! It's CYOB style! All burgers are cooked med-well unless other wise specified !
