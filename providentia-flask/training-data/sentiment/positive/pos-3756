I've passed by this place so many times and for the longest time I thought it was an aquarium store....it's not lol. First off, this is a family owned and operated joint, my kind of place. Nothing fancy or a chain restaurant, just a very cozy hole in the wall place. Like all sushi places, they have their own speciality rolls, but this place has other options besides just sushi. Me and my friend decided to order a bunch of different things and just eat off each other's plate. I highly reccommend the tacos. We had four different options of fish to choose from, so we went with the ahi and yellowtail. The ahi has a pomegranate sauce that isn't that sweet and doesn't over power the fish. The yellowtail has a wasabi aioli that definitely makes the dish. For the sushi rolls you gotta try the Cinco de Mayo. A bit of warning though, it is pretty spicy. It's an ahi roll with a fresh jalepeno and lime sauce. There are so many levels of flavor in this roll that it completely caught me off gaurd, but in a good way, and then you have the jalepeno to finish it off with some heat. My friend and I ordered so much that by the end of the meal I felt like a gullutonous piece of dung lol. I couldn't stop eating, IT WAS SO GOOD, and fresh too! We didn't realize that they closed at 9pm and we were still eating at 9:30, but never once did they try to hurry us up and kept a smile on their faces the whole time. The food is amazing, the service is amazing, and over all the experience was nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend.
