Oh Michael Symon, you god amongst gods...
This is the burger place that no one else has made yet???? How is that possible. It's just a burger place, but somehow, so much more.
If you're only going once:  order the Lola burger, porky fries and the apple pie-bacon milkshake.  These you will not taste anywhere else.
Lola burger has the thick and crunchy bacon, cheese and over easy egg on top.  (the egg is meant to break open and coat the burger)
Porky fries are pulled pork and cheese whiz.. Better than it sounds.. Over fries.  And then the shake.  Just try it!
The pickle bar adds to it all.  And then the sauces:  Lola ketchup, coffee BBQ, etc.
If I had to get picky, I'd say that the bottom of the fries or sandwiches can get too wet from all of the toppings and juices, but that's what makes them special in the first place.
