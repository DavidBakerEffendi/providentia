I forgot how delicious Pan Asian was until I came back to try their Mango Shrimp Salad! It has slivers of mango slices piled on top. I'm glad that the mangos were a little on the sour side. I don't like overly ripe mango. It had little pieces of purple onion with greens and grilled shrimp. The tartness of the mango balanced out the bitterness of the charred parts of the shrimp. The dressing is nice and spicy it is so good! This salad would  even taste good without the shrimp!
