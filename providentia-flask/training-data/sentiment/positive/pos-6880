I love Fillibertos as much as the next guy, but Rudy's is a great alternative. Totally unique flavors and great portion sizes. You won't leave hungry. The place is very clean with nice decor. Rudy the owner is also very nice. The green salsa is one of my favorites valleywide! Give this place a try!!!!
