Excellent for large groups but book in advance! Also mention which console you would like to have. I wish we chose the wii u but we got the PS4 and the xbox. Not too many competitive games for either of them. Expect large crowds. I ordered a hummus platter which was awesome. Our server even replenished the hummus. They also have nights where there's dancing.
