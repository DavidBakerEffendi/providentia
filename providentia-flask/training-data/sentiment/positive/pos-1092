Postinos, all locations, are in my top 5 favorites in the Valley. I generally go here for Happy Hour, as they have $5 wines until 5pm, but tonight for dinner was just as perfect. We ordered the Mixed greens salad with organic chicken added $13 and bruschetta- seasonal (mushroom with marscapone and basil), apple and Brie, tomato with mozzarella and burrata with bacon and tomato $14. All were incredible and would order again. Always sit outside!
