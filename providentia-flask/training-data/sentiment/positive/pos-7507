My good friend Steve took me to Armadillo grill today for lunch It was my first time and it won't be my last The food is excellently prepared and tasty The service is outstanding I also had the fortunate pleasure of meeting the lovely owner Brenda The prices are good and definitely jusify the food Sports bar with OTB betting neighborhood feel so take my advice and make sure the Armadillo Grill becomes your local and foodie stop
