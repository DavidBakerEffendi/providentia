They are not just a wine bar, but a winery.  They make their own wine.  I happened to be invited into the back room by Frank, the owner after chatting about Napa and Sonoma counties.  Frank let our small group sample some of the wines he is about to bottle and even some that needed to age more before he would bottle them.  It was a tutorial for my pallet.  I could perceive here better than my Napa Valley wine tours, that different elements in play, Tannins, residual sugar, think I too can now tell when wine is too young.   It was a lot of run

For happy hour food, there are (sliders), which were large enough I didn't order anything more.    

After a while a couple of guitarists started setting up to play music.  We order another round to see if they were any good.   But, "Wow!!  right out of the gate their first song was a Gypsy Kings favorite of mine, "Moorea!!!"  We stayed for their whole first set.  These guys were great!  They reminded me of the flamenco shows that were  at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch a few years back.  

Great winery with live music on the weekends!
