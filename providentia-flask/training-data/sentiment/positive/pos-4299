I went there with hesitation due to the reviews of others, I'm glad I listened to my husband and not those who are never happy about anything, those who just like to always complain, and those who shouldn't go out to eat!!!!!!! This restaurant has absolutely DELICIOUS food! We ordered tofu pad thai, red curry, broccoli and beef, and chicken w/mushrooms. Which by way the mushrooms were huge and fresh! This is a small restaurant, 5 tables maybe, most of the "guests" coming in were there for to go orders. The restaurant is doing something right even if most of the business is to go orders. Service? She was good! Refilled our beverages when it was low. The food came out when it was done cooking. If you want 5 diamond service then go to that restaurant, I'm sure the owner rather you go there then come back to their restaurant and nit pick anyways! 
   If anyone is a Andrew Zimmern fan, then you know where he goes to for fabulous food, you don't see him at a steak house, you see him in a hole in the wall restaurant. 
  So to those who like to nit pick everything, perhaps just negative. Keep it to yourself, let the rest of us enjoy the food at Jasmine tai Gourmet
