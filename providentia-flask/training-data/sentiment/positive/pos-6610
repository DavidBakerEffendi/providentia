Holy &@$#....!!!! I just had the smoothest Mocha in my life at Analog! Perfect temperature too! For just under $5 for a 12oz it really was the least they could do. 

It's a very trendy atmosphere inside. Bob Dylan is playing in the back ground surprisingly loud while the 17 avenites talk about life, love and liberty. 

Two long benches straddle the entrance face large windows offering couplets and singles plenty of sunlight. 6 seats per bench. There are approximately 5 small tables inside which probably means you are getting yours to go because its mad packed. 

The line up was very analog, as in slow. So whip out your Yelp app and start posting pictures or start your review.

Thanks Analog for a great mocha-gasm!
