One of my local favorites.  Avocado rolls are delicious and the selection of micro-brews should satisfy any beer aficionado's taste.  

Love the atmosphere and the service is generally top notch.  (We had one experience where a waitress in the bar/booth section could have used a little more training is customer service and attentiveness)

Food selection and quality/taste was superb.  If you time it during their lunch specials and/or happy hours you can save some money.
