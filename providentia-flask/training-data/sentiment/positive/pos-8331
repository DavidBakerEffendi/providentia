I honestly can't believe I have never reviewed Bonfyre. This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Madison, for the diverse food menu, awesome wine and cocktail list, and high quality service. 

It is in a really cool space off the beltline. I love that the bar is right in the middle of the restaurant with a view to the open kitchen. They do a lot of wood-fired entrees and you get all those amazing smells throughout the restaurant just taunting you while you wait for your food. 

As far as the menu goes, some favorites are: 

Mort's Pot Roast
Chicken Parm
Ribs & Chicken Combo
any of their steaks
Seabass (when it is on the menu)

They also do a killer side Caesar Salad. They serve the romaine hearts after they have been put on the grill for a bit, so you get a wonderful smoky flavor complimenting the dressing and lettuce. Literally to die for. 

They do amazing flatbreads, the Thai Chicken is a must try. 

I also have hosted a few business events here, and my wife and I had our rehearsal dinner here last year. Their events staff is top notch and I have had nothing but great experiences working with everyone on the events side. 

This is a place we keep coming back to at least once a month, and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.
