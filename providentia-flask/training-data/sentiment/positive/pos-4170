Hey everyone, want a free show?

Look at the fountains of Bellagio, where waters fly high, soar high every 15-30 minutes :D Yes. It happens even in the day, so if you're passing by, you will be able to see it on Las Vegas Blvd. Like music? Want it synced with the fountains? You'll definitely find it here.

It's one of those family/pre-21 places, but it's still nice to stop by and look at it.

And at night, you get to see it with light. Perfect place to take pictures (:
