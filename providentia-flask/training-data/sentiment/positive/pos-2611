Very unusual and fun. Skip it if new experiences frighten you! The atmosphere, with handcrafted furniture and artistic wooden plates, is like someone's attic: not dirty, just kind of crazy. Tables at all different heights, including cushions on the floor.

I'm no tea expert, but as for the food: best falafel sandwich I've had!
