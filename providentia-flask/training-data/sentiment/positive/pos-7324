Snakes and Lattes! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. As an American (from Texas) I find this place original and basically brilliant. This is the type of place I would go, easily, once a week if I lived near the city. It fulfilled in me something so specific -- it makes me so happy to be single and to not have kids.

Okay, so the snacks and coffee were just okay! Maybe I will try something other than mac and cheese if I can get back. I also think my experience would have been superior if we had more than just two players at our table, but again, I was just a tourist.

My partner and I played what was recommended to us, but I can only remember the name of the first: Concept. We spent a long time enjoying that one with lots of laughs. My dream is to come back, perhaps with a bigger group, and play Ticket to Ride and Cards Against Humanity.

God! I wish there were more places like these around. Thank you for existing!
