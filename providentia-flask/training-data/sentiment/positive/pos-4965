- What I have tried
     + Special Lanzhou noodles (4.5/5): I got size 3 for noodles thickness and mild spicy (basically just additional of chilly oil). I recommend get the non-spicy one because they provide chilli oil on each table so u can adjust your spiciness, I found the soup was too spicy. The noodles was chewy and i thought size 3 was perfect. The soup was good but without chilli oil it would be a bit bland, I wish it was sweeter so I don't need to add chilli oil. One more thing is they gave too little of meat and each slice of meat was extremely thin. But overall, the bowl was good, I thought it was much better than the dry noodles.
      + Noodles with homemade pork sauce (3/5): this is dry noodles with pork sauce and different types of veggies, comes with a small bowl of soup (the soup was bland). I got flat noodles for this bowl. Again the noodles texture was pretty good, but the pork sauce was too salty for my taste. On the other hand, my bf loved the pork sauce but he also agreed that he still preferred Lanzhou noodles over this bowl. Pork sauce noodles came in one size which was large and we couldn't finish it. 
- Portion: Small bowl here is similar to medium or large bowl in pho store, good for one person. 
- Price: $7.99 for a small Lanzhou noodles and $10.99 for large pork sauce noodles. This is a pretty good deal for a big bowl of noodles that you can find in downtown. 
- Customer service was good and fast, their accents are not strong at all (as compared to other Chinese restaurants).
- Place is small, we came around 8:20pm and did lineup for about 10 mins for a table of 2.
