Great place! It's still decorated in that "old Vegas" style with neon and mirrors everywhere. Very cool looking place! The food is outstanding and they serve a full menu 24 hours a day. The portions are large and very filling. It's a decent value considering how much food you get here. I would definitely recommend not missing out on The Peppermill whenever you are in town!
