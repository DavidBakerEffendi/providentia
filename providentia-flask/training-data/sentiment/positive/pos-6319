Eggslut is just as good as it looks! I've seen a ton of people tag this spot in their Instagram stories over the past few months and knew I had to try it for myself. You may have had a breakfast sandwich before, but not like this. After one bite, you'll understand why the line goes around the corner of the store.

When I finished my breakfast Bacon, Egg, & Cheese I really wanted another one and regretted not ordering two from the start. The "warm brioche bun" was actually the star of the sandwich! I don't think I've ever noticed the bun on a breakfast sandwich before, but I definitely noticed this one. It was so soft and flavorful! Can I go back to Vegas just for this sandwich?

As a midwesterner, I wish they served milk with their meals. But I guess you can't have everything. 5-Stars for the sandwich, seriously, it's that good!
