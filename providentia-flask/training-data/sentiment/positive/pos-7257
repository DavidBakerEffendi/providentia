Great food, inexpensive, great service, and atmosphere. Had the CRAB CURRY- delicious! FRESH SPRING ROLLS were tasty, also had the PORK BELLY which was really, really, good! 

I read a lot of reviews that said this place was better than other local spots like Archis or Lotus of Siam and while it was definitely a great eat, it IS NOT BETTER THAN ARCHIS or LOTUS, no way! Mainly, the proportions were smaller, sadly my bowl of curry was lacking, it didn't make sense for them to provide a side of rice noodles and bowl of rice w/a small bowl of curry. I noticed this in other plates that were served. 

I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place tho, very elegant , and relaxing, not cramped or loud. My server was knowledgable about the menu and helped me and friends w/questions and recommendations. I will definitely return to this great little spot.
