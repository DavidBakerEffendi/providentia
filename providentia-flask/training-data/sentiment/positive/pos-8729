Our first time eating here and we happened upon 1/2 off burger Tuesday. The 10oz. Sandwich was excellent, perfectly cooked to Midrare, we chose the house salad as a side and it was surprising: nice greens, multi-colored grape tomatoes, feta, and PINE NUTS!! on a house side salad, yum! Our service was excellent as well (Tatay) We're coming back to try the weekend breakfast!
