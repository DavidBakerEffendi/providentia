Chikfilwho? PDQ is slammin for a fast food joint. It is true the fries be kinda soggy but with fast food chicken this good, who cares? 

When I say "fast food" I mean fast. You usually don't have enough time to get your drink before food is on the table. 

The employees are very professional and freindly. A few fast food places have come around and asked me if I need anything but never does a gentleman come to me in white chefs coat and ask what I think, am I happy with the order? Very impressive for an $8.00 chicken sandwich spot.

It is very clean inside and they have a good drink bar plus I really like the hand wash station so you don't have to fully commit to a tedious restroom trip..

The chicken is really good and the choice of dipping sauces are awesome. I haven't even tried them all. I was a little dissapointed when I got a shake because the flavor was kinda watered down with a milk taste. 

If you are even questioning trying this place, don't wait. Just do it.
