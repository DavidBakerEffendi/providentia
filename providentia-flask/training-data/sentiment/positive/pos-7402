AMAZING PIZZA ALERT: 

We have previously had Slice 19's pizza in house and really enjoyed them. Last night we decided to order a couple Take & Bake 12" Pizza's from Slice 19 (located in Tuscany Village @ Chimera Golf Club). Our order included a cheese pizza and 'The Tom' - Pepperoni, Sausage and Mushrooms. The pizzas come on a thin cooking sheet (just as other places) the crust however was nice and crispy on the bottom and sides after cooking, unlike other places. Cooking directions were right on and both pizzas were super delicious with the perfect amount of toppings. I'd have to say Slice 19's pizza is way better than Papa Murphys and can I mention better looking?! The ordering process was easy and the staff are friendly. If you haven't tried the pizza here I highly recommend it! They also have a full menu and delivery service if you just don't feel like cooking.
