*****This review is for the Cafe only!*****

A friend took me to lunch at the Neiman Marcus Cafe located on the lower level of Neiman Marcus near the men's department.  I never knew this Cafe even existed!  It was packed, nonetheless.  Always a good sign.  

Sat at the bar.  I ordered the Bistro Salad without the turkey.  It came with baby spinach, huge chunks of goat cheese, spiced pecans, apples and sun-dried fruit with a sherry vinaigrette.  It was delicious!  One of the best salads I've ever had.  It was a little pricey at 13 dollars, but well worth it.  They also served an amazing bread with strawberry butter.  Yummmmm.  

My friend ordered the chicken tortilla soup and said it was fantastic and very filling.  

Our server and hostess were all very friendly and attentive.  

Next time you shop at Scottsdale Fashion Square, try the Cafe at Neiman Marcus.  You won't be disappointed.
