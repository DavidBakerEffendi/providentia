We had a great meal!  The service was good, the food was very good, the interior has been updated.  We ate there a few years ago and it seemed their claim to fame was enormous portions of food that really wasn't healthy, at least for me.  Huge portions coupled with my 1950's upbringing where I was admonished to "clean my plate" really made me feel miserable later in the evening.  Today, my side salad was fresh and crisp, my entree (hamburger steak) and mashed potatoes were normal sized proportions and I cleaned my plate guilt free.   We still didn't have room for desert but we took a blackberry pie home with us for later.  I feel better about going there for our next night out.
