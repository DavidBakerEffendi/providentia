5 stars goes to BRENDA! Came here with my family at 11:30am before I start my afternoon class. Our server was Brenda and she has to be one of the best server I've ever had! Throughout our experience, she kept a big smile on her face and had a positive/ upbeat energy. She's absolutely the sweetest! She was VERY attentive and made sure to have our food come out fast so I wouldn't be late for school. Thank you Brenda!
