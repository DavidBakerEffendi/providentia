Oh hello, mes amis! Now this is what I'm talking about...French comfort food with a little something extra. 

It was my "Happy Birthday to me" celebration with family and a few friends and we had just come upstairs from happy hour at Winebar Kensington. I'm writing this review a little backwards, so let's start with the service...

Our server, Monroe, was amazing. So attentive to our little group all evening. He had excellent suggestions and made sure we were well cared for. When my dessert came out, there was even a little birthday candle on the board holding my Earl Grey crème brûlée.

Yes, you heard me right. I said Earl Grey crème brûlée. This is the very item that tipped the scales during my research for our little soirée. It was exactly as I had imagined. Not ice cold (thank goodness) with a firm crackle of sugar on top. The crème itself was already so lovely, and then the shortbread on the side... All I could say that night about the shortbread was "it tastes like Christmas!"

From the steak, to the ravioli, everyone seemed to get healthy portions and great flavour. I ordered the cassoulet with duck and pork. Personally, had there been a magically self-refilling dish I never would have gotten to dessert! The pork and duck meat added great texture to the dish, which is primarily white beans. Seriously, this was the perfect meal on a day of crazy thunderstorms. 

The appetizers were also really lovely. Steak tartare, poutine with foie gras, more foie gras...did I mention the foie gras? The poutine showcased it perfectly as the warmth from the fries and duck gravy had the foie gras melting in your mouth. How can you go wrong here??!!

I was so incredibly happy with the evening that I will definitely be back again.
