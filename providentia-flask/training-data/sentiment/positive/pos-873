There was a bean bag game to play before you even walk in the door, so already in a good mood. Then a handwashing station right there by the door, so you know people probably wash their hands right when they get in there so the place is probably cleaner than most places.  The chicken was good, the coleslaw was good, the fries were good, the shake was good, the service was good, the place was clean and nice.  Really nice. If they had an outdoor play area they would be as awesome as Joe's Crab Shack for going and letting your kids play and not bother you while you can eat a meal and catch up with your friends.
