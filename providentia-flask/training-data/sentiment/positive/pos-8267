My husband and I took my brother out for his birthday for some Indian food. This was our first time to this place. Our waitress Pulpa was phenomenal. She was very attentive, funny and personable. She truly made our dinner spectacular. The food was delicious also. And they have happy hour and a decent wine list for an Indian place. Definitely coming back.
