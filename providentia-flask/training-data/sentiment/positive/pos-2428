Food was amazing here ! Only thing i gotta say is that the portion is too little for the price. Tacos are small but mannnn they are yummy! And I recommend trying the gorditas! On point  its little and so comfy in there and everyone is so friendly! I love it. Will come back, this time with more money  lmao ( 8/14/18 and still a year later im coming back!! ) they need to bring back their gorditas de chicharron. Ugh those were amazing!!!
