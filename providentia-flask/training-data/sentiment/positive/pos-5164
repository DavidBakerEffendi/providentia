Been to Pastel a few times but first to have lunch here.  I went with a colleague for the lunch special and it was a wonderful deal.  For $10.99, you get to pick a crepe (mushroom, chicken, frankfurter, and ham - other options on the menu for $1.50 extra) and a hot beverage (a wide list to choose from).  We both enjoyed the food and drink a lot. I definitely recommend it!
