Having been here twice - once for dinner with the family and once for "UYE - Yelp Goes Indian", I feel it's time to weigh in.  On both our visits we were treated to impeccable service and incredible food.  The owners, Hapreet and her husband, make sure that when you leave you have been well fed and well cared for.

We ordered similarly both times.  We love the garlic cauliflower and garlic naan.  I got korma both times, first navratan and then lamb.  My kids love chicken tikka masala and my husband, Jim W, always wants something different.  This time we added onion bhaji, which I love, and Jim got some spicy paneer that I didn't try.

Here's the dish on this place:  These are really nice folks.  The food is delicious.  The service is impeccable.  Go.
