Pretty hidden place. It's right across from Chatime, second floor with the black windows.

Absolutely LOVE this cafe! They have booths that are arranged in a manner that offers you a bit more privacy than other cafes. The lighting is dim and when paired with the booths it generates an intimate environment. They also have a room that accomodates larger groups; equipped with a big screen tv and a DVD player for those who wanna watch movies or play video games. They equip you with the basics but not the essentials so you'd have to bring your own movies if you wanna watch something and game console and games if you wanna have a video game jam. Most importantly, they have a service button! However, the button does not remain for long...once you've placed your order the button is out of reach... ): Well, at least it makes ordering a lot easier than waving frantically at a server to get their attention!

I'm not much of a fan of shaved ice but woah, their dessert blew my mind! I ordered the Grapefruit Shaved Ice shared between my friend and a Cappucinno on the side while my friend ordered the Multigrain Tea.  The Grapefruit Shaved Ice was a mountain of shaved ice laced with condensed milk amd grapefruit juice, toppled with pieces of grapefruit, banana, strawberry and conflakes and finally, a scoop of mango ice cream to top it off! It hit the spot! The Cappucinno was nothing special (maybe because I'm not a coffee drinker...). I tried my friend's Multigrain Tea and it was delicious! It reminded me of those chinese cereal packets you get from T&T. Definitely going for that next time! Oh btw, these dessert are massive so its best that you share! (Sharing is caring anyway, haha). Unless... you're that person who has a really big sweet tooth..

I totally recommend this place!!
