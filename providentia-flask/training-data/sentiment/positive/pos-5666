Walked in and the first thing that hits you is the sweet smell of the crepe batter.  It's a warm comforting smell, can't really explain it.

The man that was helping/checking us out was very friendly.  Since we are new to all this foodie heaven paradise, he had to help us mark our order and give us a rundown of how to order on the papers provided.

The gentleman brought our food to the table, and the pizza crepe was HUUUUGE!  Much more bigger than I thought it would be.  I got peperoni/salami, cheese, pizza sauce and mushrooms. It was very TASTY indeed.  

The hubbs' was very good too.  Loved the contrast between cold ice cream and warm nutella.

We will be coming here again :)
