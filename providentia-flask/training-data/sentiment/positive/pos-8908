We set out early on a Saturday morning. Our server was Kat. Right from the start she was On It with her customer service. Took our drink order, brought them fast and correct. Took the order. It came out correct. She checked on us asked if we needed anything (best part is she didn't ask when our mouths were full) so we could answer her. She took the time to look and see if our glasses were getting empty and automatically brought refills. I witnessed her pick up other servers tables that were slacking off. She was moving all time. Kat was one of few and far between servers in the service industry. Kat was excellent! Food was excellent. Better than eating at any strip joint. Keep up the good work Egg Works!!
