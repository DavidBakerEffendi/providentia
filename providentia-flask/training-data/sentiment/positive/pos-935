We tripped over this place on a hike. It's AWESOME to have an alternative so close to the place on the other side of Thunderbird,  which I'd reviewed some time ago, and not favorably.

Spouse tried a big breakfast plate that he regarded as a sampler. He wanted to see what needed further exploration on subsequent visits and came away stuffed as well as with a good idea of what to order next time

Staff are all so friendly, caring, and attentive, just as they were working for that other guy. He doesn't seem to know what treasures of human beings he lost!

Food is excellent,  homemade. Super chill, friendly place - love the chalkboard wall for the kids!  

We are so grateful to have a neighborhood place that likely will draw from miles around
