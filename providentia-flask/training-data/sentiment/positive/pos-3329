Tastiest pizza around.
Seems like one of those pizza places that you only taste it once and your hooked.
Best crust, way too many toppings...just right.
Family owned and the best thing is they remember you even if you only get there once a year.
Very Friendly
Comfortable relaxed place.
You,ll leave stuffed every time!
If not...try a piece of pie!!!! ;-p
