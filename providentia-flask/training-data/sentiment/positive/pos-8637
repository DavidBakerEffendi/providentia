Stopped by here tonight with my sister for our girls day late lunch/early dinner.  The staff are friendly from the minute you walk in. The decor of the restaurant is beautiful. It has this lime green wall and beautiful plants. It's really light and airy.  We ordered a chicken dish and a combination plate.  Everything was absolutely delicious and service was wonderful.  This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in the southwest.
