This was our third time here and I feel like we finally did it right. I ordered the flauta plate (shredded beef) with black beans and rice. My husband had the relleno with adovada plate with pinto and rice. Both dishes were excellent. Both bean options were great! Also this time, we left the kids with a sitter so we could relax and enjoy the wait with the yummy chips and salsa (which were spicy but had great flavor). In the past, I sometimes found the food too spicy, but we loved these two dish and will definitely order again. Our waiter was also amazing and made great suggestions.  Great ambiance on the patio. 5 stars for this visit when it was averaging 3.5 stars in the past, so 4 stars for now.

UPDATE: after another amazing visit, I have to bump them to a full 5 stars. I got the beef flautas again with pinto beans... I will continue to get it over and over again. My husband got the adovada chimichanga, Christmas style. Both loved our dishes and have decided that the pinto is our favorite out of the two bean options. The special hibiscus marg was also delicious!
