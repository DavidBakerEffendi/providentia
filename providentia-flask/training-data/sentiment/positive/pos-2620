I come to this location often since it is en route to where I work.

What I love about this place is the staff here are friendly. even the managers are welcoming, sometimes I'll get hugs!! Talk about feeling like I'm part of the family!

The other reason why I love this place is because, sometimes, I'd rather having a burger for breakfast, or nachos, maybe even an epic salad. It depends on what I'm in the moods for.

I'm not the typical person stuck on traditional meal genres and what foods are to be eaten at those times.

I like to stop in here and get whatever inspires me!

Definitely go visit this location and enjoy the smiling faces that may greet you, they're genuine smiles! #NJoy!
