My husband and I got our wedding cake from West Side.  All of our guests were RAVING about how delicious and moist the cake was.  We got so many compliments on it and we reccommend them to other engaged couples.  Now we find every imaginable excuse to order a cake from them, or just visit them for pastries!  SOOOO delicious!
