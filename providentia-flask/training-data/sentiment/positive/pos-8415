This place just opened and is located behind Gangplank (where I work a lot) and Yoli's brought in some breakfast samples for us to try out - good stuff btw!

A handful of us (12) decided to go over for lunch and check it out.

Location is somewhat hidden in the little market just west of Arizona Ave and north and between of Frye and Chicago St.  Nice little older house looking place, with a nice patio that's shaded and enclosed in the little market area.  Inside is all redone and very clean with new tables and chairs. They do take debit and have a soda machine for refills.

Food is very homemade American cafe/deli style with good burgers. Currently since they just opened they don't have menus other than large notecards with today's menu, which works well actually. Had about 10 different choices... 

I went with the turkey bacon sandwich w/ American cheese on sourdough. Very good no complaints at all. It did take a little bit since we slammed them with 12 people right away on their first day but they held in and everything came out within a reasonable time and with no mistakes at all even with all the custom orders w/ the burgers we had.
They use little baskets for the food and have metal silverware. OOOH and pickles... crisp too, not soggy and floppy :)

I had some time to talk to the two owners and they're very nice and personable and were more than happy we showed up even though we swamped them a bit. Very nice ladies and without a doubt I and the rest of us at Gangplank will return frequently.

I say get down here and try it out.
