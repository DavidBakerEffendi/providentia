Mi casa es su casa - truer words have never been spoken about a restaurant. It was a cold and rainy day when we stopped in for dinner here and we were immediately welcomed with such warmth. The person at the register, who I think may have been the owner, was such a gentleman. He thanked us for coming and suggested a couple dishes that were popular. I went with the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce with a side of rice for $11.50. The food was served promptly and was delicious and filling. 

I couldn't leave without trying their dulce de leche empanadas - OH. MA. GAWD. To die for. I only got one because I don't think I could have saved this for later. Only $1.50 a piece and so worth it. 

The staff here is fantastic. You can tell they really care about the customers and the food. Everything is made in house from scratch. 

If you're looking for a quick plate of homemade food, this is the place to go. And, grab an empanada to go, but I guarantee you won't make it out the door with it.
