Yes, you see that correct. That is a 5 star rating.

Is this the best buffet in all of the world? No.
Is this the best buffet in all of Las Vegas? No.

What it is though, is the best Cheap Eats Chinese-American Food for under $10.

With the recent change to management, means completely new everything. 

New Wait Staff.
New Menu.
New Prices.
New interior decorations.


Wait Staff - I am not sad to see the old wait staff gone. Some of the girls were not the most friendly. The new staff seems to much more helpful, attentive and friendlier.

New Menu - You still get the basics. However, the food has changed in the flavor. There is definitely more pizazz to some of the food items. At lunch the other day, I had deep fried pork ribs, eggplant, fried tofu, baby bok choy and pad thai. All of it decent and pretty tasty.

New Prices - After tax, I paid $8.48 for AYCE lunch buffet. Price increase, but now you get a drink included. Before it was separate price for drink.

New Interior Decorations - I posted some pics and it is definitely more easy on the eye on the inside. 

We went right at 11 am for lunch and they had hot, fresh food out and just kept putting more and more food out. For lunch and the price, they had a pretty good choice. 

Now, I am not saying that this place is going to make your taste buds slap your mouth. But if you are hungry, in the mood for chinese-american and don't want to spend an arm and leg or want more bang for your buck, then YES this is your place to go.
