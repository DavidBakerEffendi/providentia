Yummy Late night dessert time! It's nice to find a nice place that opens late to meet up with friends for some dessert and drinks! Tried their classic mochi bingsu. Apparently their shaved ice are made with milk instead water. Other places are usually made with water.
Also tried the litchi infused tea which was amazingly refreshing even on a cool fall night! 
Can't wait to try their other bingsu flavours and tea next time!
