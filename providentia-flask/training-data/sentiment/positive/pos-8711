Casual atmosphere, upscale food.  Family-owned, with fresh, local ingredients.  Super friendly staff, remembers you after your first visit & will keep you coming back.  Fantastic happy hour specials, daily & weekly deals posted on their website.  The chef will make special accommodations for dietary concerns, or just a special request.  Great local spot!  Open for lunch, too!
