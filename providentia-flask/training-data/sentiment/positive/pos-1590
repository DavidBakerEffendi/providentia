Came back yesterday for my birthday dinner and decided Harumi deserves a re-review.  I wish the additional 5 stars here added to my previous 5 stars, because Harumi really merits 10/5 stars, not just 5/5 stars.

I can now say that Harumi is hands-down the best sushi venue in the valley.  I'm not sure that I'll even be able to eat at any other sushi restaurants again, since I had such an excellent experience at Harumi.  Not only did we get a personal visit from Chef Juno (he even gave my mom his phone number! 911-911 baby), the food was absolutely delicious.  I had the Omakase (where you let the chef make whatever he wants) and it was worth every penny.  Every bite was amazing.  I'm in sushi heaven still.
