Simple snack outside of Merry Anns! Good for when you are out late in downtown Champaign. I tried the chicken taco! It's pulled chicken which I am not fond of, but the taste is good! The salsas are also tasty, which is super important for when I am eating Mexican cuisine. Friendly staff working the truck as well. Definitely a better choice when it comes to a late night snack!
