A regular sized Tim Hortons.  Super friendly staff.  Unique selection of donuts that you wont always find at other locations.

I love coming here.

By the way if you're going to come here to meet with someone, make sure that you order something. They actually keep up on people sitting around and whether they are ordering stuff. This location keeps tabs on people because it certain times of the day there are a lot of young whippersnappers hanging out and not ordering.
