This place is so good. Family-owned and the food is excellent. Very friendly and attentive staff. I've been here 6 times now and it has been wonderful every time. I've tried the Chicken Shawarma, Beef Shawarma, Falafel Sandwich, Taboule Salad, Lentil Soup, Jalepeno Hummus and they were all fantastic. It truly is a hidden gem in North Scottsdale. Very reasonably priced as well. Definitely worth trying!
