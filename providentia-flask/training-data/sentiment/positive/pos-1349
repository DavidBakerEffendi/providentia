This place is the moneyshot for authentic Greek food on the cheap. I say this only because I am amazed by the prices...there's no way this food should be this inexpensive. I mean- this isn't a Gyro joint, there is "Roe" on the menu for chrissake- and a wine selection....and Ouzo.

 It's no secret that there is a shortage of reasonably priced ethnic food restaurants in the Phoenix area- this place almost makes up for that fact on it's own. The ladies that work there are awesome- so friendly and cool! 

....and they DELIVER!
