The staff were all very knowledgeable of the different brews and the roasts they have to offer. They were all super friendly as well! My friend loooooved the white zombie. She dreamt about it over and over again after we left Madison. I got the cold brew which was amazing! I ended up buying 2 bag of beans to go.
