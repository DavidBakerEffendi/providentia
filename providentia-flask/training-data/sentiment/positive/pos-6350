Ordered the Fish and Chips, Scotch Egg and Deep Fried Pickles followed it all up with coffee and a Deep Fried Mars bar.

The place was packed but they were super accommodating and got us a table quickly. Service was friendly the entire night and we were checked up on often. 

All of the food we ordered was amazing. I'll definitely be back.
