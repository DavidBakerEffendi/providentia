Yesterday was my first time ever eating Sonic. My boyfriend and I ordered a ton of food with large drinks and the total was around 15 dollars! Are you kidding me cheap and good food? Yes please! The service in this location is very fast! We waited around 3-5 minutes. Overall I recommend the shakes here! So gooooood!
