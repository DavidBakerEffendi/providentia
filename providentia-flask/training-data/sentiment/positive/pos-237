Came in at 1:30pm for lunch ($20) and left at 5:00pm. We made sure to pay the lunch price, but get the best of both worlds, lunch and dinner. They probably only had a handful of different dishes when the time changed. The crab came out during dinner so did other desserts, nigiri, and some other stuff I forgot. What I like about some of the buffets around here is that we can eat some food, leave the buffet to go outside, smoke, and gamble a bit, and came back and eat some more. We made sure we got our money's worth. I visited this buffet as well as the Paris buffet. Bellagio was way better. Like what others have said, if you like meat, you'll love this place. Tons of animals to eat from pork ribs, to chicken, to turkey, beef, prime rib, seabass, three different kinds of salmon, seafood up the yin yang,  and many others. My first plate was full of meat. They also had a little ice cream dispenser with caramel, fudge, and almonds...great, wish they had more toppings. Good desserts, flan, creme bulee, fruit tart, mousses. I can never find a buffet with good sushi, their sushi sucked. They have tons of food from Asian, to Italian, to whatever else you want. I felt like a freakin kid in a candy store.
