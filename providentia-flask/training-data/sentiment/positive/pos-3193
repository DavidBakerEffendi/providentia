We popped in on a Sunday afternoon to check this place out, and we were not disappointed. The ambiance is warm, vibrant, and well decorated. I normally don't notice these things, but Taiwan Little Eats' atmosphere stuck out to me in a comforting kind of way.

We had the crispy and salty popcorn chicken, which was a little salty for me, but the name should've been enough of an indicator ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ However, I'll be back for the Taiwanese milk tea; this was my winner, as it was satisfying and not too sweet. 

Some of the menu items are still not available, but I would still recommend checking this place out for some tea or a snack as it's a great addition to the State Street food scene!
