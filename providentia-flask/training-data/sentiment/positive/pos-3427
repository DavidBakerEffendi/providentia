Questo ristorante è un piccolo pezzo di Italia a Charlotte! È così autentica, mi ha ispirato a scrivere questa recensione intera in italiano. Ok, on second thought, maybe not... But seriously, Aqua e Vino is so good, it's going to make you want to learn Italian and move to Italy ASAP. I lived in Italy for 4-years and what you see above is the extent of my awful, broken Italian. My crappy Italian is not the point of this review though. The point is that Aqua e Vino is one of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've had the pleasure of discovering this side of the Atlantic. 

We visited on a Wednesday for their Butta la Pasta special. For $40 per person, your table gets to enjoy a huge, family style spread of charcuterie and cheese to start (you can also opt to choose 3 anitipasti to share, but we love meat and cheese so that was a no brainer for us!), followed by your choice of 3 pastas and all wrapped up with a sampling of their desserts. Every dish was a hit, the wine selection was great, service was spot on and the atmosphere was small and intimate. 

I loved how leisurely and meandering the meal was. We lingered for 2+ hours but never felt like there was a lull in service. Our group of 12 filled the time with amazing food and wine and friendly conversation. It's hard to pick a favorite part of the evening, but if I had to narrow it down to a handful, it would be the bottle of chianti (I love a good chianti!), the tagliatelle with duck ragu (mmmmmm!) and fresh, pillowy, housemade gnocchi, and the berry cake made with Greek yogurt. Oh! and I almost forgot the fresh whipped cream. So, maybe a little more than a handful of favorites. 

I am literally counting down to the next special occasion for an excuse to visit again. Who has a birthday or anniversary that needs celebrating??
