The best Ramen I've tasted in Arizona. The restaurant environment was very intimate and clean. We were seated promptly and got there right on time beating the Sunday dinner crowd (a little before 6 FYI). We were provided a little pitcher of lemon infused water. When our waitress was made aware this is our first time she provided us with solid recommendations and accurate portion sizes for the non ramen bowls. Additionally she gave us time to think over the menu and we were overall satisfied  with how the workers handled the incoming crowd. We ordered takoyaki and it was presented beautifully with the sauce and toppings classic for the warm balls of goodness. Our ramen followed (Nishikawa Black). Make sure to order extra meat. The first sip of broth made me fall in love with it's perfect balance of creamy and liquid goodness. It wasn't too salty so I knew it wasn't instant. The meat fell apart on the chopstick sand melted in my mouth. Noodles were very soft and non mushy. We were excited to find how well the broth and noodles complemented each other. All the other Ingredients such as the seaweed, egg, mushrooms and shredded red pepper brought together the bowl making it a truly authentic experience. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants the non instant ramen experience
