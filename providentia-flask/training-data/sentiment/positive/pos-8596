bonnie told me about this place....oh, about a year and a half ago. i had always meant to try it, but just never got around to it and forgot about it entirely. then, i finally try it and it takes me another three months to right a review. 
this place has great tasting, coffee, isn't starbucks, is independently owned and has the most delicious egg, turkey bacon, cheese and avocado breakfast sandwich i've ever tasted (about $5) that came with a nice little side of red grapes. add to that a killer cup of organic, free trade coffee and that's all you really need to say about it.

ok, one more thing: the fact that it's survived right next door to a much larger, much more exposed to the main road bakery should be pretty telling.
