I'm TOO HOT for ya!!!! I saw the Fireman#Captain to be exact sittin' behind me at Zoe's. I noticed as I was leaving! Hahaha. As Bruno Mars says in his Uptown Funk song, "I'm too HOT for ya!" Hahaha! "EVERYWHERE I GO they be like......"#That was also a line from Bruno Mars! I see Firemen everywhere I go; especially in food places; but this is the 1st time I saw the Captain! Lol. I guess when it comes to dancin' I'm the Captain! I'll show my dance partner just what to do! Uhh Huh! Let me show him that 1 2 step!

About the FOOD though! It's the Mediterranean bomb! Hahahaha. My fav is the Rosemary ham & Mozzarella Piadina! Bombness! It's full of flavor! It comes with a side & I chose rice pilaf!#De-lish! Another fav is the chicken salad & feta cheese coleslaw! They both are so flavorful!

The lime-aid with pure sugar can is island-licious!#So refreshing & flavorful! Ya ta's home-Adecco chocolate cake is the bomb as well! The cooks are good! (That was short for cookies) i usually get chocolate chip, but I saw a new lemon, & I picked it because it was so soft! I haven't tried it yet!

Bekah was really sweet! She went above & beyond and showed excellent customer service like putting ice in my cup for the lime-aid!  All the staff are friendly & helpful! I will be back! :)
