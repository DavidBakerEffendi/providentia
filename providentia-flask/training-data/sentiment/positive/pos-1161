I'm a food snob and it's impossible to satisfy me on every level. This time I was. Service - immaculate. Food - delicious.  Ambiance, wine, bread, hosts, runners, bus boys, were all A+
The server forgot about our Cesar Salad and we didn't care.  Smashed potatoes made an appearance in more than one dish, so I'd recommend for staff to offer another side if they notice a guest going in that direction.  Thank you so much for a great meal and time. We'll be back.
