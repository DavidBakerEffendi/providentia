Visited on Wednesday around 6pm. It turned out it's related to Pacific. I recognized some of the people there. Welcomed by a smiling lady. Not many people, but food was abundantly replenished. Decor and lighting were nice. Nice layout with ample room to walk. Clean floor, table, and chairs. And clean male restroom with no bad odor (unlike Pacific).
Sushi was very good. Sashimi was never run out. There was even yellowtail sashimi! For $16, we would go there again and again.
Warm food that we liked were chicken wings, sesame balls, fried fish, sort of beef steak (forgot the name). Strawberries were awesomely sweet, even without chocolate covered from chocolate fountain.
Waitress Lisa (from Pacific) was friendly and efficient.
Patrons were friendly and we actually had conversations with some of them!
Overall good experience. So glad it's only 5 minutes away from our house. We will be back...
