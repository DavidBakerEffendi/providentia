So I think I found my new coffee shop! This place has amazing coffee and great staff as well. I've only had a couple things off the menu. The smoked lox, Chilaquiles and empanada platter. Coffees, I've now had the lavender infused latte, Mexican spiced latte, which are my 2 favorites and the coconut tumric latte, which wasn't really up my ally. Overall an amazing experience, I love sitting on the patio having coffee and editing photos and getting work done. Will I be going back here, absolutely!
