We have been looking for good pizza out here for years and haven't found anything, until we tried Angelinas when they opened in Seven Hills. We had been looking for something similar to what we used to get back in CA and finally found it! 

Angelinas has the perfect amount of sauce, cheese and the right size of crust...not too thick, not too thin, right in-between. The flavors are fresh and we now add several toppings and get creative. The Stromboli and chicken wings are really good too.

The service is great. Everyone is friendly and we usually have our order delivered, which never takes as long as they quote. All I can say is that I am glad that theirs is one flyer on my door that I didn't throw away!
