We had a wonderful dinner here before seeing a movie. We started with the Humble Pretzel, which was awesome! I highly recommend it. Then we split the Chopped Salad and Schreiner's Sicilian Sausage pizza. Both were as amazing as the pretzel. Topping it off with a few beers and some great customer service made this a memorable experience that I would recommend to others.
