Why 5 stars? Because the beer selection and the company were great.

This wasn't one of those places with a wall of 50+ taps, but they had a solid selection of some great Belgian offerings, which really hit the spot. The service was incredibly friendly, as were the surrounding patrons at the bar. I visited during the World Cup -Â sorry for the delayed posting, this draft was written but never submitted! 

But it was neat to talk soccer with some Canadians and a couple of other visitors from other countries. It was at Beerbistro that I learned about Canada's lack of interest in America during the Olympics/World Cup. I always assumed Canadians probably rooted for the U.S. in such things.... nope! They root for Canada, then England, then who cares. The border sharing does not influence them whatsoever.

Now... that has nothing to do with Beerbistro, but I'll never forget the time that I learned that the rest of the world doesn't care about us lol. Even despite that, the company was very enjoyable :)
