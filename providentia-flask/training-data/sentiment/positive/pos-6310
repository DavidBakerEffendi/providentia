This is one of my favorite shops! 
They have really good prices on tea, and they sell coffee too! 
It is the best place to get tea infusers, and they have all kinds of cute ones like ones that look like tea bags, and the one that looks like a monkey. 
The staff is really friendly and they seem to know what they are talking about.
