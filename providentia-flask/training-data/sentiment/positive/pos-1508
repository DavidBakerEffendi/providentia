Chicken Tostada is currently the special on Wednesdays.  I love their Chicken Tostadas so much that I now call Wednesday..."Chicken Tostada Wednesdays"!!!  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  I'm pretty sure if I could I'd eat here every day!  Tortillas taste homemade.  Salsas and meats taste so fresh.  This has to be my favorite "fast food" Mexican place in town.  Love it!

If you're not a fan of the tostada, try the Chicken Quesadilla!  To die for!  Tacos are really good too!

And get a punch card...after the 10th punch you get a free meal!  YAY!
