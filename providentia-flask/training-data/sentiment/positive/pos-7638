This was my first time dining here after wanting give it a try for a while. I've been to this type of restaurant before...you choose your protein, seasoning, vegetables, sauce, and side. The service was great! Our waitress was spot on and told us to fill our bowls nice and high! She encouraged us to get as much as we can. After I went through the line and did what I was told we left our bowl with a cook and he prepared it for us. It was delicious! I definitely will be back. It's a great option and allows you to control what your eating!
