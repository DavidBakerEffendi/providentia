One of my all time favorite places to go. Especially, if I'm feeling pizza, pasta, or want a massive salad. The rumors are true, their portions are huge. Unless you're starving...you might want to opt into the smaller sizes of things; )

I usually go for dinner, but went out to lunch with a friend on this day. For pasta, the Big Rig w/ chicken is the way to go. I got their lunch size, and it was quite a perfect portion. I was perfectly full, and was actually able to still go back and put gym equipment together. 

Pizza : they are literally all great! I like the number uno though.

Pasta: Big Rig w/chicken. They also have sausage and meatballs as options. Big Rig has a chipolte base, so it's a little on the spicy size.

Salad : Pablo Picasso. The dressing is a little spicy as well for this one!

Also, their cheesy bread is great! But also filling! (Appetizer)
