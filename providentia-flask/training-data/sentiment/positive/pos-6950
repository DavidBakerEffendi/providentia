It's hard to describe how unique this little shop is. First the Italians that were working so cute and so friendly. They'll let you try any of the flavors they're selling that day. Today we tried the special of the day which was white chocolate and I also tried the peanut butter. They were both good but ultimately I got the fior di latte which is my absolute favorite it reminds me of being in Florence.  I got the biggest one but I got it to go and they will pack it up for you and even keep it in the freezer until you're ready to leave.  what did we do until we were ready to leave well I'm glad you asked there is a huge freezer on the side that literally has all the wonderful flavors that the proprietor has made and you can buy them in the entire silver tin for only $45 it's incredible!!!!
