I'm not sure where to start with this place...they have life size games and not just the basic giant jenga and beer pong but twister, cornhole, giant legos, connect four, four square, etc! The furniture was made of fake grass to help go with the out door theme. There was also arcade games and such inside with a live DJ and you could hear the music through speakers outside as well. DJ was AMAZING too! Not sure if he was their house DJ or just someone who happened to play there that night but he was WAY better than any house DJ the big name clubs have!

Also we saw this cute tiny home in the "backyard" labeled 'Sugar Shack' and it was a tiny home for rent via airbnb! They were hosting a group so we couldn't go check it out but I did find it on Airbnb later and it looks fantastic!

I highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. It is indeed the adult playground, as they advertise it!!
