My kids are in town so I took them here it's probably one of my favorite places to hang out with friends and eat, the food prices are fairly decent not to much but not cheap the portions are huge so if you are not one to eat that much you might want to share a entree, everything I've tried was really good! They also have happy hour which is when I'm normally there sense I work nights.
