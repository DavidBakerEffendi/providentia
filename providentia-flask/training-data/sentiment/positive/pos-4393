My previous review was solely based on the takeout procedure and not the quality of the food or service because both are excellent. The burgers are very flavorful and I love the fries. The owner contacted me and appreciated my comments about the takeout packaging and said they are reviewing their takeout procedure so I know this will improve. Sometimes restaurants don't know there is a problem unless it is brought to their attention and this owner truly cares so I look forward to returning to eat more of their delicious burgers.
