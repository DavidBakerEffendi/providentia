I wish I could give 10 stars! My Husband and I absolutely love this place. The bartenders are amazing. B.J. makes an awesome bloody mary! If you like fish, their fish and chips or the cod sliders cannot be beat.  This is our favorite place to grab a few drinks, have some great food, and wonderful service. Keep up the great work! B.J. And Kenny are the best.
