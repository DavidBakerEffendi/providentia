One of the best dosas I've had! I ordered one of the spicier dosas that had onions, vegetables, and a bunch of spices. It was very flavorful and spicy! My friends also enjoyed their masala dosa. They have a huge selection of different dosas, along with other South Indian food. The only downside was that the food came a bit slow.
