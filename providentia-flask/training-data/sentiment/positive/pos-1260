I wasn't planning on going to Sushisamba while in Vegas, as we have a few in NYC and I never even bothered going to either of them. But we were wandering around the Venetian/Palazzo and we decided to go for it. What a pleasant suprise...everything was outstanding. There is nothing more fun than ordering a bunch of small plates and trying different things...which is why I love places like this and Julian Serrano...different cuisine...same concept. The aja sauce they give you for the lobster tacquitos is SLAM BANG delicious, the seared kobe small plate was A-ONE, everything else was great also...shrimp tempura, salt and pepper squid, oysters, foie/kobe roll with caviar and gold leaf was actually the weakest dish...I got it just because of the novelty aspect really.
