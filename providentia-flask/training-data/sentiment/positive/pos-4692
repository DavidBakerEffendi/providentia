In love with how retro this place.  I felt like I was in a fancy limo restaurant mixed Denny's with all the neon lights and the fake trees.  It's tacky but awesome at the same time.

They have a very extensive menu so they basically have everything to cover your needs.  The service here was pretty good.  Nothing to complain about.  

Southern Fried Steak and Eggs: Lots of gravy just the way I like it.  They cut the potatoes differently than other people but it was crispy.  
Gyro Sandwich: Maybe it was drunk me but it was probably the best gyro I've had at night.

I would totally come back here again.  Plus it's open 24/7.
