My bf took me here for dinner on valentines day. We've been to the Roy's in Hawaii and we just recently moved here so this was our first fine dining experience in Las Vegas. Couldn't have ask for a better place for our first experience. The service was amazing and the food was just excellent. The pork belly appetizer was so good it melted in your mouth. my bf loved the Onaga they had. And of course the chocolate souffl√© is always a winner. Can't wait to be back here again. Definitely a taste of Hawaii in the desert.
