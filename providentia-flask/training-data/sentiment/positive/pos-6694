Amazing service topped off with amazing food , meatballs are to die for ! The twist the chef has on his chicken parmigiana is so amazing and a great presentation ! All the favorites are on the menu , restaurant is so beautiful and comfortable , the servers never left my water glass less than half ! Chef came out to visit the guests which I love ! Great place for a date night or special dinner or just to have a nice dinner with friends , the manager was very attentive and gave great recommendations on what to order but I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu , will be back for sure !
