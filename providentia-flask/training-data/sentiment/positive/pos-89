I was introduced to this gem of a place after church one day and I really loved it! They have a great lunch special and a really reasonable dinner combination plate as well. This place serves only vegetarian food and even though I am not vegetarian, I felt that they had a wide variety of dishes and tastes to choose from so I felt pretty satisfied. For the dinner combo, you get three entrees, rice, pickles, onions, and whole wheat bread.  When I went, they had some kind of eggplant curry, which was AMAZING! I haven't the slightest clue what it was called but it was delicious, so keep an eye out lol. Also at first, I thought that this wouldn't be enough food because it all fit on one tray, but I was mistaken! The entrees and sides really fill you up. 


Lastly, this eatery is located within the grocery store and I find it charming! The staff are very friendly and welcoming to n00bs like myself, and it has a very home-y feel. I will definitely be back :-)
