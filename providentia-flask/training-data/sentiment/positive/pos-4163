Shove a beef shawarma roll in your face and tell me it's not delicious. 

Go ahead -- I'll wait. 

Seriously, it's one of my favorite lunch items on their menu. Perfectly spiced beef rolled up with delicious tahini sauce in a warm, slightly crispy pita. You don't need anything else on it or in it. Just enjoy it as it is and thank me later. 

Also, they have a signature Nate's sandwich, but I can't remember the name. It's loaded with delicious deli meats, cheese, tomato, lettuce, mayo and more. I don't know if they sprinkle magic on it, or what, but it's darn good. Try it with a heartier bread, though. It's better than with the pita. 

The hummus is still the best I've had in CLE--ridiculously creamy with a hint of tartness, almost. It's just perfection. And the fatoosh... I mean, is there better fatoosh around Cleveland? Because if there is, I haven't tried it. 

Still cash only!
