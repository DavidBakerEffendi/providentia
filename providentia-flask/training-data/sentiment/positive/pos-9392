You need to visit this new spot in Tremont for some great food and live music. The place is very intimate and have a small bar, a few tables and a dance floor. The decor was on point. They put a lot of thought into the music venue details, from the large graffiti wall that acts as a backdrop to the musicians, to the actual memorabilia in the bar. There was a fun band there that was rocking it out all night.  I love loud music, however, it got a little too loud at times. All part of the experience, right?! The staff was very friendly and took time to answer our questions. Perfect small bar menu of food choices. We ordered 4 different items off the menu. The beef and onion sliders were very flavorful. Chicken and waffles were awesome, however wish the waffles were a little crispier. The grilled cheese sandwich was yummy- it had spinach and was pressed in a waffle iron, and the Cheetos that came with it were extra special with some spicy flavoring. The tempura onion rings were perfectly seasoned, but wish they were a big crispier as well. The onion ring and chicken and waffles were service on drum stick planks. Cool touch. Ill definitely be back again!!
