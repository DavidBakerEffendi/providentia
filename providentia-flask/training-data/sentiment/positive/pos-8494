WOW! I love this coffee shop. It's a new fave, f'sho 

I have walked by it five hundred thousand times and never gone in. Why? Well, I'm not sure. But now I know what I was missing....and I'm ever so glad I decided to finally check it out. 

I'll tell you why I love it:

1) Cool and interesting people work here. And their sunny dispositions permeates the entire space - helping create a sunny vibe for all to experience. 
2) The caramel steamed milk is BOMB. And I'd imagine the other beverages are equally as delicious (can't wait to find out).
3) Lots of natural light insight, and there are little tables outside where you can sit and people watch. 

The prices are what you'd expect for a trendy coffee shop on 17th, and the lay out of the place is pretty basic (but with a fashionably elegant design).
