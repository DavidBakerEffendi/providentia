We sat on the couches because we didn't have a reservation. Dave, our waiter, was great. We had the bruschetta platter and warmed Brie with apricot jam. Both were fantastic and plenty for two. Next time we will make reservations and sit at a table. However if you do just drop by the couches were great.
