Amazing hearty bowl of delicious noodles made to order! You can see the noodle chef making one of their 6 types of noodles by hand as you walk in. 

I had their small beef noodle bowl with broad noodles, and I was contemplating in getting a large bowl. I'm glad I went with small for the portion is quite generous. Their chilli oils aren't spicy, just adds another flavour profile to the broth and noodles. 

My husband ordered their dry noodles with pork and shredded veggies, with his choice of broad noodles. The marination of the pork is flavourful and not overly salted. The veggies adds crispness and freshness to every bite of the chewy noodles. 

Overall, service was good and the line goes by fairly quickly. We will definitely be back to try their other type of hand pulled noodles. It's amazing, and I wished the space was bigger to accommodate more seats!
