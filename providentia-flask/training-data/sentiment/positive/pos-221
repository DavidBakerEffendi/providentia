Indian Chipotle is awesome. Fast-casual, American palate friendly Indian food. Cool, clean, modern decor. A freaking hand bidet or whatever they call it. What's not to love?

My go-to is the chicken tikka masala bowl with naan on the side. The rice, nice and soft. The chicken, tender with a satisfyingly smoky flavor. The sauce, mild yet extremely flavorful. The naan is the perfect add-on to dip and finish the leftover tikka masala sauce. 

It's so good I can't bring myself to try other things on the menu, though that chicken pot pie style biryani looks interesting. 

I will say the samosa is kind of lacking, and the menu overall is a little pricey for what you get, but I suppose it's region appropriate.

Do yourself a favor and give Choolaah a try. You don't have to be a fan of Indian food to enjoy it.
