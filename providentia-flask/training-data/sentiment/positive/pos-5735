I love all of their food that I had created myself.I chose green salad, next all of the second choices , lemongrass chicken paneng curry and coriander carrot and chilli.
It's the best food for me that I ever have in Toronto. I love spicy food and it made me a little bit cry.Their services are fabulous. They are police kind and always smile. You can ask them for free water.The price is valuable as well; I paid only 10.70$. The food is so fresh. I definitely come back.
