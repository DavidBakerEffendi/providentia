Perfect place for a fun night out. Had dinner at the Blue Hound across the street and we wandered across the street into this nightclub/arcade/bar. What I found unique about this place is that it is attached to lucky strike bowling alley, so it has a great variety of activities for someone who isn't sure how they want to spend their night out. No cover charge. We ordered drinks at the bar and hung out in the arcade playing Pac-Man, & played billiards. We we had an amazing server who approached our group and asked us if we needed more drinks. She ended up taking care of us for the rest of the night, no mistakes on drinks, and checked up on us no matter where we were at in the entire building--Lucky Strike side included. Overall the experience was great. Good crowd, good service. We will definitely be back to hang out!
