In the search for great breakfast places, especially ones that serve it all day, this place just went to number ONE on the charts!   The service here is great, friendly, efficient, and fun with the bear-oriented t-shirts and paw-prints on their suspenders.  A lot of paw-themed stuff....from the dishes to napkins and stuff on the walls.

OK, now to the food.  As others have said, portions were quite generous.  Sometimes bigger is not better--but here everything was great.   I ordered fresh squeezed orange juice.  The large size was really LARGE.  Was it really fresh-squeezed?   I saw a Minute Maid machine near the kitchen, so I don't know, but it tasted fresh squeezed!  ordered the California Omelete with home fries and biscuit.  When it came out, I was amazed--the biscuit was the size of my fist!   But it was delicious, and moist enough to even eat plain.  The omelet came with jack cheese and fresh sliced mushrooms inside, with a couple of slices of avocado on top.  It looked and tasted great!  

The home fries were outstanding.  Many places serve up potatoes fairly plain.  These were red potatoes well-seasoned with salt and pepper plus pieces of green and red pepper.  Very flavorful and great looking.

My wife got their blueberry pancakes. I had a taste--they were flavorful, fluffy, and had a nice vanilla taste to them.  The ham stake accompanying it was a nice big slab and plenty thick.

This place is great for brunch, as you will surely be well-satisfied for several hours!

The rest of the menu looks good for dinner and lunch--plenty of comfort food with creativity and flavor!
