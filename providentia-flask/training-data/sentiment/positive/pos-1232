Brought a group of visitors here for dinner. They were very skeptical and very pleasantly surprised! 

We managed somehow to get a reservation, which is good because ordinarily the seating process here stresses me out. I was also able to keep a tab open, which saved us from having to get back in line when we ordered more things.

We ordered some of everything except the soups and shared it all family style. Here were our favorites:
Baba Jaga
Boczniaki z kapusta
Pierogi

The Boczniaki z kapusta in particular was well-liked - I couldn't believe I wasn't eating meat. It has a very rich, savory flavor.

We also enjoyed several of the cocktails, which are decently strong and reasonably priced.

Overall the whole meal was a success!
