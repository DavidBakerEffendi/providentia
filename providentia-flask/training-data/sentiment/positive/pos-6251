This place is full of great service and a nice atmosphere that can't be beat.  Compared to most Vietnamese places in Toronto, the servers and owners are very welcoming, nice and make you feel at home.  I come here once in a while with my co-workers and we are always treated well and given some house specials on occasion too!

The food is authentic and the presentation is much nicer than most Vietnamese places around the city.  The restaurant itself is kept very clean and it's very well lit by the large open glass windows out front.

Overall I really enjoy this place, along with the super friendly staff.  Even when they are swamped, they still have time to chat and make sure everyone is doing well with their food.  A great Vietnamese destination in Toronto!
