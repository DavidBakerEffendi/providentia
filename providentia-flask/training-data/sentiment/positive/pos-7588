In-N-Out Drive thru was hopping on a Friday night, thankfully they have a actual person taking order for the cars waiting in line, that way payment is smooth at the 1st window and the food is ready to go when you pull-up to the second.

Food was still warm when I came home and absolutly delicious as usual.  When I do get fast food, I always make it In-N-Out because nothing else compares.

Google their "secret menu" to order special prepared items!
