In the movie "Chef", Jon Favreau plays Carl Caspar, an executive chef who gets fired after a video of him berating a food critic goes viral.  So he buys a dilapidated lunch truck, renovates it, and starts selling the most amazing Cubanos.  Thanks to social media, his lunch  truck becomes a huge hit.  The movie features so many mouth watering close-ups of  delicious food being made, I almost cried into my $8.00 box of popcorn!

And I've had a hankering for a good Cubano ever since.

And now I've found one, thanks in part to Yelper DJ J. 's sandwich list and review.

I haven't had many Cubanos before, but this was that perfect blend of ham and  pork belly, served on a yummy carba-licous  ciabatta roll.  I know a sandwich is good when I want to slowly savor each bite rather than wolf it down.  And what better way to top off a Cubano than with a nice cup of fair trade coffee?

I think next time I come here I'll try the Pain Bagnat.  Or maybe I'll come for breakfast and try the pastrami cured salmon.

But in the meantime Carl Caspar (Jon Favreau), you and your lunch truck have met your match!
