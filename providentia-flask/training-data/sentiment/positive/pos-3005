Absolutely delicious. We stumbled upon this place after a long day of walking and were looking for pretty much the closest place that had food. I am glad we found this gem.

First of all the decor is super cool and modern. I love the communal table in the middle of restaurant; so trendy looking, even if I didn't actually eat there.

The food itself is delicious and more reasonably priced than I thought it would be based on the way the restaurant presents itself and the quality of the food. I had a season pumpkin curry soup which was so fitting and then a red curry dish with coconut rice. I even had to eat every last grain of rice, which I'm not usually crazy about, because it was so delicious.

I will certainly be back here as I'm excited to try other options on the menu!
