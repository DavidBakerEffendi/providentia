My favorite place to eat Sunday morning. I love the spinach eggs Benedict. It's also dog friendly which is a big bonus! When the weather is cool and perfect the patio is filled with cute adorable friendly dogs. The staff are all nice and attentive. The whole flower garden by Morning Glory automatically puts a smile on your face. Sometimes you even get to make your own bouquet of hand picked flowers and choose a vase. If you're luck they also sell homemade goods and produce straight from the farm. I also love how this is a wedding venue as well. I hope one day I can have my wedding here! The area is so romantic and lovely.
