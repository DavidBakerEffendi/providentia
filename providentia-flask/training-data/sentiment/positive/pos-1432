Best pub I've been too. Great beer selection and good wines. I'm visiting and the food was better than any pub in California or Nevada I've been too. This is gourmet pub food. The fries here are soooo good and fresh cut. The 6oz cheese burger was very good, tip: ask for it medium-well done. The staff was so friendly and nice. Atmosphere was fantastic here. Will be back as many times as possible before I head back to the states.
