Very good food and fast service! I couldn't believe how quickly our food came out regardless of how slammed they were. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. The food was excellent! Sports Grills always freak me out because it's overwhelming to be surrounded by 30 televisions, but I didn't feel like this restaurant was too loud or too intense to just stop by for food and not a game.
