Best soup ever! I saw the other reviews and yes the server (the only server) is elderly and wobbles but he is not unfriendly just misunderstood I believe.... OK so here is what I always have there, the tomato soup (a wonderful creamy tomato soup that is to die for and please don't put those unsavory crackers in....) then I would go for an order of fries and garlic dip so yum! then the chicken sandwich that is garlic infused and amazing!!! I've also had their moussaka and was impressed as well as the shawarma beef which was excellently seasoned and marinated. You won't be disappointed but look beyond the surface on this one. Also on some Fridays they have  belly dancing shows..... so great for a night out with a large group! check it out!
