Ok so I thought Yougurberry was THAT FIRE of the frozen yogurt community. But not so! Mojo is the best I have had since Pink Berry in Hollywood. 

This place is a self serve joint that has a variety of flavors. They have tart flavors and regular. My favorite is the boring plain, but they have a 'cookie' flavor that is like a grey color that taste like a puree of a Oreo Blizzard. It seriously taste amazing. 

The decor of this place is really rad. Wood panel walls with orange accents. There is only room for like 4 people to sit in-store. Which sucks when its so F'n cold outside. But we got there during a down time and got  to sit down.
