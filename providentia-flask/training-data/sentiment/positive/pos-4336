201 Central is a really nice spot. I've been frequenting it recently even though it is about a 15 minute drive. It's got everything you need from craft beer, wine, snacks and common grocery items. 

I try to go on Fridays because starting around 5 or 6 they have select breweries and wineries giving out free samples to help you decide what it's time to buy that week. 

They have a ton of selection here. They have the beers divided by types and also a vast cold section. They do have domestics as well and kegs. 201 Central is pretty much a one stop shop for you if you're hosting a party or getaway weekend. 

Don't forget they have an awesome bar you order a beer or wine and sit down or sip and shop!  Great prices too!
