I have made this statement before, in some of my other steakhouse restaurant reviews, but it is worth repeating here: "In my opinion, Las Vegas has the most great steakhouse resturants, per square mile, then any other city in the world (and keep in mind, I lived 35 years in the NYC area, and traveled all over the world, so I know what I am talking about)". That being said, Anthony's is another fantastic steakhouse that Vegas has to offer. Anthony's steaks were seasoned and cooked to perfection, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the prices were very reasonable (when you compare the prices to other upper end Vegas steakhouses). If your looking for a great steak dinner, Anthony's should definitely be on your list to consider.
