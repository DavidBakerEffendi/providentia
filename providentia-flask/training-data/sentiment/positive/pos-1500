THE STICKY BUNS ARE SO GOOD!

Seriously though, my fiance and I went to El Chorro for Sunday brunch this morning and we loved it. The restaurant is beautiful, offering stunning views of Camelback and Mummy Mountain. Dining is available inside, or covered outside seating with portable air conditioners. We chose to dine inside.

When we sat down we were immediately served some fresh sticky buns and croissants. The sticky buns were warm, gooey, and delicious, everything you could want in a sticky bun. We each ordered a mimosa that seemed to be the perfect balance of orange juice and champagne.

My fiance ordered the two eggs for breakfast, which came with bacon, potatoes, and an arugula salad. I ordered the omelette of the day, which was a carne asade omelette with peppers and mushrooms. The omelette also came with potatoes and salad.

Overall we were very pleased with the food and service. The wait staff was super friendly, the front desk was super friendly, we felt at home. El Chorro highly recommended for anyone looking for an upscale brunch experience complete with sticky buns.
