Went to The Irv on Sunday evening.  Had walked by numerous times but felt like giving it a try Sunday evening.  We were thrilled with everything.  The greeting was very warm and welcoming.  It was around 8:00 pm and was a bit slower due in part to the long weekend.  We were ushered out to the back patio by Sarah and were pleasantly surprised by how roomy and comfortable it was.  The haven't cheaper out on furniture, and the placement was very comfortable and sensible.   

We ordered the pork belly salad as a starter.  It was beyond good.  The flavors,  texture,  and presentation was stellar.  For mains I had th Black and Blue Salad which is served with a delicious, done to order steak.  My partner had the Halibut Fish and Chips.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food.  It really was an exceptional dinning experience all around l

Great prices, great food, fantastic service.

Only recommendation for improvement would be to beef up the non - alcoholic beer selection.  There are too many good ones out there just to serve Becks.

Well done Irv.  We'll certainly be coming back for more.
