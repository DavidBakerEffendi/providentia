Best. Jewish. Deli. Ever. I will not get rugalah anywhere else. Every time I'm in town I make a point to stop here. Everything I've tried is so fresh. Would recommend the corned beef and hash with eggs (breakfast), shrimp salad sandwich, and bagel with the nova spread. The owner, Sarvas, really knows how to build that customer relationship. Will always come here as long as this place exists!
