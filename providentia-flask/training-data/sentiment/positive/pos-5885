Small cute little shop. Upon entrance you can see some desserts and a menu in case you are waiting for a seat. Upon seating you're greeted with water right away. 

We got Verne brûlée, raspberry tart and green tea shaved ice. All were amazing. The presentation of the food is beautiful. 

The green tea shaved Ice is so light and just melts.  

The crime brûlée was just the right amount of sweetness and lightness.

The raspberry tart was full of awesome and raspberries. 

Each table also has the wifi password written on them which was super helpful. 

All in all this place is small and gets busy quick but service is great, friendly and fast. I would definitely be back here again to try different desserts.
