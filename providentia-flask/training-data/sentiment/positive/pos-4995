Q Bistro is at the top of our list of favorite Korean restaurants, on heavy rotation! We love this place! There's a handful of Korean restaurants in Las Vegas, but no one hooks it up like Q bistro. They are owned by Karaoke Q Studio right next door, but don't share the same entrance. 

The food is always very flavorful and the service is always wonderful! There is also a table buzzer (like a doorbell but on the table), which you can press to call their attention whenever you need something. They also bring out a complimentary selection of their delicious rotating banchan (side dishes) and everything is always seasoned perfectly and pairs great with all of the dishes. Some of the banchan items we tried: pickled daikon, kimchi, japchae (clear sweet potato noodles), seasoned potatoes, fish cake, potato salad, mac salad, pickled bean sprouts, etc. All so tasty! They are always happy to refill your side dishes as you request.

Here's what we've tried:

* Soondubu $9 - Q's version offers a generous sized clay pot, filled with soft tofu and a fair amount of protein of your choice. My favorite combination is spicy bulgogi (marinated beef) and add mushroom for $1 more. The broth is bubbling hot, flavorful and extremely satisfying. The spicy level is never too hot for us to enjoy, it's actually perfect for us! (We like spice) Rated: 5/5

* Dol Sot Bibimbap $10 - This is the tastiest version I've tried in Las Vegas! It's traditionally served in a hot stone pot with veggies, bulgogi (marinated beef) and a fried egg. Let it sit a bit before you start mixing it all up, so that the rice has a chance to get crispy! Also, be careful while eating it, the dish stays scalding hot for a while. It's an explosion of flavor and texture! They also provide red spicy sauce on the side so you can kick up the spiciness of the dish if you wish. So delicious! Rated: 5/5

* Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) 10 pieces for $10 - We tried the "supreme sauce" which is a delicious balance between sweet, salty and spicy. We love spice, but we didn't think it was too spicy. Plus the batter is super airy and crispy! Rated: 5/5

* Seafood pancake $12 - Large with perfectly crisp edges, but it's rather doughy. The seafood isn't too generous on this one, but the flavor is great! Rated: 4/5

* Bulgogi $14 - A classic dish of marinated thinly sliced beef served with onions on a sizzling platter. Their version tasted fine, maybe not the best I've had but you can't go wrong with it. Rated: 4/5

This is the first place that comes to mind when we want to satisfy our Korean cuisine cravings. The pricing is fair for the amount of food that you receive, on top of the complimentary side dishes offered! We always leave happy!
