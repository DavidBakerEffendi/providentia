I WISH THEY HAD A LOCATION CLOSER TO ME! 

A friend and I had the pleasure of eating here in the summer. I've heard amazing things about the legendary Ravi's Soups and had to have a taste.

The soups are rich and full of flavour. This is important because I love soup and it's so hard to find a soup that is rich and full of flavour. I literally ate every last drop. My sandwich was amazing and it was full as well. I had a wrap that fell apart because that's how full it was! Ravi gives you your money's worth!

It's a bit pricey, but I got a soup sandwich combo which was more than enough to fill me up. 

We ate on the patio and it was so cute and intimate. This is a great place to have lunch, grab lunch and go, or just spend an afternoon with friends. I love the oak table in the middle of the bistro.
