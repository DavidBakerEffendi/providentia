I have been to Sushi Samba 3 times now and every time I am blown away.  I love their service and their food - the kids' bento box lunch is an adult-sized portion and the kids gobble up every last morsel.

I can't think of a better combination than Japanese food and grilled meat - the best of both worlds!
