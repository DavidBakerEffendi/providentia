I have been coming here off and on since they opened.   The staff and owners always treat me like family, and have bent over backwards to ensure me and my family had a wonderful visit.  Although it is a perfect place for date night they will accommodate the young ones with fare they are used to.  The tastings that are done here elevate your palate with flavors that you aren't used too, for a complete win.   Bar Vinedo is always a go to when you are looking for an elegant evening that is close to home.
