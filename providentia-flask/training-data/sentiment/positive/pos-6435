If you want to get blown away with a prototypical Vegas experience, look no further.  Come here and get it all.  An elite and large casino.  Plenty of tables and slots.  New and old machines keeps players happy.  Being an elite casino, the table games are not cheap.  My only gripe.  Go next door to Harrah's to get the more affordable tables.  Dealers are friendly and helpful, but sterile. I wish they would joke around more.  There are so many nice restaurants in this place too.  The Grand Luxe was a pleasant surprise.  I always eat there.  Go upstairs and get the most visually exciting shopping mall you will ever see.  Don't forget your camera, it will blow you away.  You feel like you're in the real Venetian, except it's Disney clean.  Shops are high end and you need to be a millionaire to shop here, but they are neat to walk around and in them.  You get the feel that you are outdoors too.  All rooms are suites.  Let's make this clear though, they take a room put a partition in the middle and call it a suite.  Still the rooms are nice as in first class nice.  You'll feel like a King or Queen here.  So, in summary, one of the nicest casino on the strip, one of the nicest rooms in Vegas, one of the best shopping anywhere and you get The Venetian.  I really don't stay here because I get comp roomsl like I do with Total Rewards (Harrahs) since the Venetian reward program doesn't give back much.  If they did, I would be staying here all the time.
