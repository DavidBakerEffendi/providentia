I was scrolling through my Instagram and PDQ had a $5 coupon. I had seen it before, but didn't know anything about it. I was hungry, I was passing by and I decided to go in. I looked at the menu and I figured the best decision was a chicken tender meal. I think it was $7.99 before the coupon. 

I went to go get a drink and looked around. One really amazing thing is the sink by the drinks. Sinks can get pretty nasty and I was happy to see that it was SPOTLESS and didn't have water underneath it. The drink area was also spotless. I feel the need to mention that since at many fast food places the drink area is atrocious. 

After I settled into a booth, I looked around. It's bright, clean and unlike most fast food (or fast casual) places, there are televisions. My food was brought to me rather quickly, so I didn't expect it to be good. I am a Raising Cane's fan and I would have a hard time saying which is better. I have no clue what people are talking about with the fries because they were so good, I finished them before all of my tenders. My visit was only about two weeks ago, so I don't know about the fry change. The ones I had were perfect. The chicken was just the right mix of crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I am very particular with my fried chicken since I only eat it at Cane's, CFA and Blue Ribbon Chicken (I eat one of those once a month). Otherwise, I only eat grilled chicken. 

I am not one for sauces. If food is good you don't need to top it with sauce. I didn't put anything on these tenders. Any sauce should complement the food, not mask it. And the food should not NEED the sauce. I dip my Cane's into their sauce, but I don't drown it. And I use the sauce because its ridiculously good. I love honey on my chicken, so the next time I come here I'll try that. I read some of the other reviews, and it's great to know the rest of the month when I am eating clean I can come here as well.
