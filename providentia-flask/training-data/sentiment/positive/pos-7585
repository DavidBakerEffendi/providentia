I never thought I would like Middle Eastern cuisine, but after lunch at Aladdin's, I'm a changed woman!  This location isn't far from my office, and Aladdin's is perfect for a light, inexpensive lunch.  On my first visit here, I got the Aladdin's Favorite combo.  This comes with lettuce, tomatoes, vermicelli/rice, Beef Kafta, Shish Kabob, and Chicken Tawook.  I believe the price was around $13-14, but it was well worth it.  The portions are decently sized and just enough to satiate my lunch cravings.

I went again today and my coworker and I split an order of the grape leaves to start. Oh. My. Goodness.  I had tried grape leaves at a potluck once and HATED them. I swore I would never eat them again... until today.  Aladdin's serves theirs warm with a side of pita and topped with olive oil and feta cheese.  They were so good that I honestly considered ordering another plate as my entree!   I was craving lamb though, and ordered the Aladdin's Lamb Rolled for lunch.  It was the perfect size and only $8!  It was filled with lamb, veggies and Tahini dressing. Yum, yum, yum.

Service is quick (I think we waited maybe 10 minutes tops each time for our food), prices are great, and the flavors are amazing.  One recommendation I definitely have to make is to try the zesty sweet tomato dressing OR cilantro vinaigrette when ordering a salad. I tried both when I had the Favorite Combo and kept alternating dipping my fork in them before each bite!
