Sample of 100 meals:

MUST TRY:

1) Kang Massaman Lamb

2) Special Appetizer Platter (2 shrimp cakes, 2 chicken satay, 3 cold rolls, calamari)

RECOMMENDED:

Nuer Yang / Grilled Beef

Cashew Nut Chicken. [Another reviewer said there were no cashews.. I've had this over 50 times and there are always lots of cashews]

Radnar Talay (seafood + rice noodles)

Pad Woon Sen (glass noodles)

+Coconut rice side order

OK:

Green Curry

Pad Thai *** I encourage you to order something else. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as good as the other noodle dishes


I've been coming here for 15 years. The food is very consistent at dinner time, and you will always be full after a meal here. Yes, the lunch special is a good deal, but the dinner options are definitely better. (I have yet to try the lunch buffet, but it sounds more promising than the old lunch specials)

Service is attentive and friendly.

Real Thailand is excellent for the price point. It's good for group reservations, as they have a large seating area.

BONUS: It's perfect for take out / delivery, especially for a group where you can share different dishes.

Note that the review has been updated for the new location. It's the exact same quality food and service.
