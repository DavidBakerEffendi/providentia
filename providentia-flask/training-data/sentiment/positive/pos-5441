Owner Tom Burke and Chef Ivan make this our "go to" spot for breakfast/lunch/dinner and to watch all things sports!!    Check out Slice19.com for specials (the chicken salad wrap is a delicious meal for 1 or appetizer for 4!)   I LOVE their BROASTED CHICKEN!!  Don't miss Taco Tuesday at Slice 19 and stay for Trivia!!  We are SO lucky to live within walking distance but it is nice to know they also deliver!
Chimera Golf Course is Henderson's best and Slice 19 is the perfect place for the winner to buy everyone a cold beverage!!!!
