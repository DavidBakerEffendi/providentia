I came in to get a pair of Louboutin's for my assistant for her birthday slash bonus. The staff was very attentive and helpful. We ended up having to order them in here size and come back in. Not a bad place to have to go back to, but they could have mailed them to her for free. While I was there I of course found a pair double the price that I loved. They were on sale and I asked if they were by chance going to go down again. The woman told us they were and with in a couple days. Did I want her to hold them for me so when we came back they would have them?? YESSSSSSSSS! Wow. Talk about going the extra mile for your customer! Thanks Sophia! When we came back they had not just gone from $1295 to $800 but down again to $600. Over 50% off for this year's Explotek Louboutin's!?! Wow! They aren't even 10% off online yet. Thank you Sophia, and thank you Scottsdale Neiman's!
