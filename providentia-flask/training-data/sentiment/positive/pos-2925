MiraKuRu, which means Miracle, is exactly what the food turned out to be, A Japanese/Italian restaurant, what a mix, I have been waiting for this place to open, with the Master Chef, SEKIHATA  KATSUYUKI and his experience from different parts of the world, working in some of the finest restaurants. He brings new flavors, fresh ingredients, and an amazing presentation. So after I saw that they had a soft opening, I took my family for dinner on a Sunday night. We were greeted and seated in the booth facing the front of the restaurant and also 17th Ave. I ordered miso soup, and soy ginger marinated chicken for appetizers, then came the mains: MiraKuru Roll, with Prawns,avocado,mango, tuna, cucumber, salmon, himachi, scallop. It's definitely the "Feature Roll". I also had the Dynamite Roll w/ prawn tempura, wasabi mayo, and citrus teriyaki sauce. WoW! My kids tried the Teriyaki BBQ, and Chicken Nanban, both need serious explanations, but I won't because they need to be Tasted and Enjoyed! We ended the night with Italian, we had the Tiramisu which was lovely, home made with love! And to Top it all off, the value for portion was great, I will be back soon!
