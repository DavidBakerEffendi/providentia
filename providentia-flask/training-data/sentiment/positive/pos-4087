A great new addition to the Ayrsley area. We stopped in Saturday night which was only their 2nd full day of operation. The staff was incredibly friendly. The tap room area nicely designed, with good seating and lighting. A very inviting atmosphere. For those familiar with the Matthews location, it apparently is the same format. Twenty six beers on tap, ranging from Belgian style to Local IPA's, Stouts, Ales, etc. They had at least 4 local IPA's, Legion's Juicy Jay, Woody Robot's What He's Having, and a What We're Having Triple IPA. I like that you can get a half pour or full pour. The Half Pour allowed me to sample more beers than I otherwise would have been able to. They also have a great selection of cold bottles, and a retail area for buying a full range of craft specialty's. Need Wicked Weed, they got it. Need Noda, they got it. Ass Clown, D9, etc. Need something unique, they got it. Our area needed this kind of location. They also had a Cider on tap, and several wines available.

They have some great snacks, pretzels, cheetos, animal crackers, etc. Always a welcome addition when doing some beer tasting. They had sandwiches from Rooney;s next store, and you can order in food from the local restaurants. My wife and I walked just across the doorway and ordered a great Portifino's Pizza, brought it back to the Beer Temple and had a great evening. The crowd was thin the night we were there, but there was a steady stream of people popping in, like us I assume, to check out the new place. They also have a great outside area. Look forward to seeing you there.
