Hubby, mom, brother and I popped in for a quick lunch.  We've been hearing / reading good things about Ramen Hashi and wanted to check it out.

The menu is simple.  For mains, you have four options, three of which are noodles and one is a cha shu bowl.  I ordered #1 (shio, chicken base) and added extra chashu and an onsen tamago while hubby got #2 shoyu, chicken base with extra chashu.

Every element of my bowl of noodles was very enjoyable.  The soup was flavorful without being over rich or salty.  The noodles (made in-house) were perfectly cooked.  The chashu was nicely flavored and torched prior to servicing.  I hardly ever eat chashu in my ramen but the chashu here was delicious and fatty, balancing out the entire bowl.

And, to my surprise, there was already half an egg included in my bowl so the onsen tamago sat prettily alongside it.  Both eggs were perfectly cooked. (I ended up eating the onsen tamago in one big slurp!)

The price is affordable.  The noodle bowl already includes some chashu, bamboo and half an egg so there is less of a need to build up your bowl with the extras, like at other places. One regret I had was that I did not get more noodles afterwards because everyone else was done eating.  

Hubby and I agreed that our favorite part of this meal was that we weren't thirsty after the meal.  While other ramen places are tasty, we always end up gulping down gallons of water afterwards.  We did not get that way at Ramen Hashi.

Definitely a place to check out!
