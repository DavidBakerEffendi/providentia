I really wish I had stopped by sooner! I've been here twice and neither time was disappointing. The second time I came I ordered Banh Xeo pancakes with tofu - with it (as you can see from my picture) come lots of fresh vegetables and mint to wrap it in. The avocado smoothie I ordered was great too - not sweet which I like. The service is superb - I came with a friend who is a long time customer and essentially told the owner to "surprise him" which she did. The personable atmosphere along with the A-1 food make this a must-eat destination for Vietnamese in Charlotte.
