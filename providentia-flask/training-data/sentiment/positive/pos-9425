My husband is a foodie we know great food.  This place was crowded and it's the food not just because it's on the strip and it's a vegas classic place to go, the food is really, really outstanding.  My husband ordered the Reuben with the marbled Rye this is his words..."It was an experience that I did not want to end". I had the Tangy Buffalo Wrap it was so good.  The onion rings are delicious as well.  The drinks are pricey but that is because your on the Strip.  3.25 is pricey for me but hey this place has the prices of Cheesecake Factory which is worth it because they give you a lot of food.  We are coming back to try the breakfast which we heard is excellent, all the hungover tourists and locals can't be wrong.
