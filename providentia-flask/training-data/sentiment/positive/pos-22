This Turkish caf√© is a gem. The vibe is laid back, most people come here with a book or their laptop and the place tends to be pretty quiet.

The coffee is great and so is the food! You MUST try the salmon bagel - sounds so simple and classic, I know, but you'll understand what all the fuss is about once you taste it. You're welcome.

Staff is OK, not super friendly but polite. The coffee and food alone is enough to keep me coming back.
