Thomas Street Tavern has quickly become my favorite bar. The best way I can describe the scene is eclectic. It's awesome to have all types of people in one place who just enjoy having a good time. The bartenders are always personable and make pretty good drinks that are priced pretty well. On the inside you'll find a busy pool table and live music on certain days. The real fun is out back though. Fun times playing corn-hole and ping pong.
