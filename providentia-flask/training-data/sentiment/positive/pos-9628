I found this local spot a couple of months ago and I have now found myself to be a regular.
Their service is unparalleled! Everyone that works there is genuinely happy and welcoming.
Everything I have tried had been excellent and I enjoy the unique spin they add to their menu!
One thing that bums me out is they have a limited amount of bacon cheddar waffles on the weekends so if you want them get up early!!!
