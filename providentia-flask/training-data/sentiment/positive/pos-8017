Crab legs, seafood cioppino and much much more. 

You cannot go wrong with their prime rib. It was super tender and juicy.

Most of the items were great but there are a few that were down right nasty, like the lemon butter mussels. The mussels looked and smelled like they were rotting just prior to cooking. 

I brought my friends here and they all said they liked it. This is a must on my Vegas trips.
