If you have a name like Bertha, you better know good food. And Bertha, well, she makes a mean sandwich. All you need to know is this: pesto chicken sandwich. 

Ok, I lied. You can also do a half sandwich with ANY of their salads. Most places make you get one of those pathetic "garden" salads with a cherry tomato and some carrot slices. Not Bertha. She lets you get anything from the Thai Chicken Salad to the one that comes with little grilled cheeses. It's ridiculous and I love it! Now, if she would only open on Sunday.
