There's everything to love & everyone is incredible! Banh mi - I love theirs! I think the "smear" I don't what to call it,  a form of mayo but not mayo taste different from other places.  It's strong enough to be distinctive but it's not too much,  & personally that's one of the main things I like about a banh mi. It may look like a simple sub but to get it right, there's almost a science to it.  And you don't have to figure it out bc here they did it for you so go for it! The classic is great but the unique options they offer are not to be passed up! 
The teas! Just delicious. They're all good but winter melon is my favorite.  Along with their beautiful fruit infused teas with delicious mix of toppings,  they even offer coffee to pistachio frappe to the delicious & beautiful mangoritas wide range of goodies for suuuuure! Open as late as 11, big surprise & a plus! But don't keep them any later  than that please! It's just a good to know bc sometimes I'm off late & appreciate that this is an option.
