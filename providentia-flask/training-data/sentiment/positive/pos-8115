Flippin love this place!! I have always been the kinda golfer who likes cocktails and music when I'm out on the course. Topgolf is my kinda place!! A place where I can be competitive and enjoy some good cocktails, food and music. This isn't a golf course, but the way the range and games are laid out you really get the challenge of golf, minus the putting. Topgolf did a great job with it's staff and the food is great pub grub. Can't wait to take some more friends and family to my new practice range. Oh yeah, Talking Stick is right across the parking lot. GAME ON!!!
