I compare this awesome new place to a Chick Fila.  This was our first time here and we loved our experience. The chicken tenders are great and Canes better watch out this place has a way better variety.  Any extra sauce is free.  They have a variety of different sauces.  The fresh apple slices with toffee dip is so good.  The meals are priced less than Canes and they include your drink.  Way better deal.  I had the 3 pc with blueberry coleslaw. It was very tasty.  The French fries were fresh cut very good. Daniel helped us and he was amazing. Love this place service was Excellent.  The reason I compare it to Chick Fila is because the lemonade was better and I'm a certified lemonade conniseur (wink wink). Seriously the lemonade is great, way better than Canes as well but no extra cost.
