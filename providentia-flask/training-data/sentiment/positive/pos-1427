I am surprised how good their vegan pastries are! They are available in many different flavors and varieties. I ordered a plum scone and a gingerbread latte. Both are beyond excellent! The contemporary hip atmosphere is perfect for meetups, or to spend a couple hours chilling with your laptop. I went there at dinner time and they are full. Glad there is a full vegan diner that opens 24 hours!
