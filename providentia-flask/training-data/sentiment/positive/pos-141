What a great place. Vegans and vegetarians will love this place. We had the Agave BBQ pizza with the soy sausage and mozzarella (we are vegetarians but they also have great vegan cheese). We talked to the owner and she makes a lot of the ingredients from scratch. Come on down, you will not be disappointed.
