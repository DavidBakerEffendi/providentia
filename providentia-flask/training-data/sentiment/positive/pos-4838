Same ownership and cookery as Gandhi's (just east of Bathurst) but with a seating area and better hours!

So you need not look any further than my review of Gandhi's to know that I love the food.  I can't possibly say enough wonderful things about it without sounding like a crazy person.

If my last meal on earth came from this place, I would die a happy man.

I'm not quite sure if the spice rating system here is the same as Gandhi's, although I have the suspicion that they both somewhat recently started making the spicing levels more westerner-friendly and far less spiteful/vengeful.  (The "hot" was pretty brutal when I first found out about them a few years ago... think molten lava pouring out of your face inferno)
