If you are a looking for a delicious hot dog, this is the place to go! Food is fresh and the service is excellent.  They have something for everyone; spicy, chili cheese dogs, or a good old fashioned dog with ketchup and mustard.

If you are daring they have a Dragon Kimchi dog challenge. There has been 1 person to complete the challenge successfully and it's me! 

You have to eat 3 of there Dragon Kimchi Dogs in 5 minutes. It's not easy but if you finish it it's free.

Their Euro Fries are pretty delicious. The sauce they have on them gives them a good flavor mixed with the bacon and cheese. I tried the Santa Fe Dog last trip and it was pretty good. It is not a hot dog it's a hot link. Adds a different flavor and a little spice other than their normal hot dog.
 
Caeser is no longer there but they still have good food.
