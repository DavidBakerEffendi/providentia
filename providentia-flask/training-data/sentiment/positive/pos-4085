For Asian Fusion, this is a very rare find. Foodies will be amazed. Started with a Tempura appetizer which was house made, light battered, fresh and served with several spice cups for dipping. I strongly advise the 3 or 4 course tasting. Similar to an Asian tapas, we started out with a seafood selection including an oyster, shrimp, etc. It was total savory stimulation. The main course could be kobe beef cooked on your own hot ceramic plate or a cod slowly cooked with light spices. Finished with a sushi assortment which was the best I'd ever had. I found the white shrimp to be the best, but all were excellent. Price is reflective of the great food and service. Small venue. Splurge and enjoy!
