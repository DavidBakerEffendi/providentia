AYYY after hearing about this place selling MACARON ICECREAM, I HAD to have one!! They had so many flavors to choose from, pistachio, cotton candy, coconut, strawberry, etc. I had the strawberry shortcake & my mom had the coconut! The strawberry shortcut was so cute! It also tasted veryyy good not too sweet just how I like it! (Coconut was good too, I like how they put nuts in it!) I just wish it wasn't so big, beware guys! I could just finished half of mine, next time I'll probably just end up splitting it with someone! Cool place to check out if your ever in the boardwalk area(:
