Hidden gem! The food was so awesome and the staff was really friendly. I would definitely recommend ordering the biscuits and gravy "volcano style" with the chorizo - seriously amazing. Their take on a Monte Christo was also really good. Would definitely recommend this place if you are anywhere near Chandler!!
