Finally a wine bar that has an interesting wine list and amazing food. Actually the place is more of a temple dedicated to wine. The team here is wine loving but not stuffy. 

Brought my husband here for late night nibbles. Came back for dinner and absolutely died for the flank steak. Only issue is I couldn't decide what to eat and drink. Thankfully the staff helped me. 

I sat in the front at the high top. Saw the booths, hope to try them out later. 

The reason I live in Torontos west end.
