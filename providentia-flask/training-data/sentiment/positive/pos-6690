Stopped in on a Wednesday evening to try their $10 burger and brew special.  We were sat immediately.  The server explained the brew selection and which drafts were included on the special. 

I ordered the Diner Burger, cooked medium rare- which has two huge beef patties, cheese, tomato, onions, lettuce, served with a side, I selected sweet potato fries. This burger was pure mouth watering deliciousness!  The sweet potato fries (cooked perfectly - not too crispy but just right) came with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  

Service was outstanding! The bill came and was correct - $10!  I left there in disbelief that the food and service were so good for such a phenomenal value! Will definitely be back very, very soon!
