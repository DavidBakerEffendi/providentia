This is my 200th review! I have been scouting the Chili Man out since I kept seeing such amazing reviews on Yelp! I agree with Nikki W, it's strange that a Yelp Elite is bestowing 5 stars on a hot dog vendor. Well you better believe it! 

First off, he is a super nice and friendly guy! He knows his regulars and jokes with them. He engages the new customers. Word has it, that Cam Newton eats there at least once a week. I thought Cam was a pescatarian but if anything is going to make him turn to the dark side of beef, it would be the Chili Man's hot dogs. 

Every week, he has specials and they are interesting takes on a ballpark snack. His regular menu is amazing itself. Next time I go, I am trying the Vinegar dog which is dill pickles, saurkraut, jalepenos, and mustard for toppings. The chili dog is also amazing and I could eat about ten of them. If you are reading this, try it out! Its worth your wile!
