What's not to love about Gold Spike??!? Cause honestly, I can't think of anything. Whenever I think about DTLV, Gold Spike is the first place that comes to mind. I've definitely spent a substantial amount of time here. And believe me, once you go, you'll be hooked. 

First off, there's no cover...ever! And I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get in. This place has the perfect ratio of fun, games, alcohol and shenanigans. It's pretty impossible to be bored here. Giant beer pong & chess, CORN HOLE my personal favorite, darts, billiards, shuffle boards, four square (popular with the boys). Lounge on the comfy bed near the entrance or the ginormous bean bags while you hang out with friends. Or take a step outside to catch a breath of fresh air and perhaps a game of oversized jenga. Be forewarned, I am a jenga master, lol! Play me at your own risk :P

Overall I just love the vibe here. You can show up in a pair of jeans tank top and sandals and fit right in. Drinks are reasonably priced and the food was pretty decent. Burgers, sandwiches, wings. Typical but tasty bar food. It's a great place to take out-of-towners or just a cool spot to #meetup with friends. 

Helpful tip: Valet at The Downtown Grand, it's free and adjacent to Gold Spike. Very convenient.
