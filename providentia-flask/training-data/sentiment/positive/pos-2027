Okay woah.  

Jimmy's A & A is a true hidden gem located on the corner of  20th Avenue in the NW, sure it may look ghetto but its ghetto good!!  Its a small place with a ton of food.  

Whenever I go, I always order a shawarma which is a Arab sandwich-like wrap.  They make the BEST CHICKEN SHAWARMAS in all of Calgary.  They're truly amazing.  Sometimes they can be out of the chicken or beef so you would have to wait a couple minutes, but its definitley worth the wait! Fresh chicken or beef? Yes please!!

Just like everyone else said, the SMALL is huge! (~$9) They stuff the wrap with the meat and have this amazing garlic sauce, lettuce, pickles, onions and tomatoes (if you want all of the toppings) and you can get it spicy or not.  The spice is just some hot chili sauce they squeeze on.  But the wrap itself has SO MUCH FLAVOR! Not only can you taste it, but you can actually see the spices on the meat.  Its mouth watering.  There is a very strong garlic taste but I love garlic! So I dont mind..  They do have a big selection of food, from salads to shawarmas to samosas to baklava!  I ordered 3 random pieces of baklava for after and they were nice and flaky.  They seem really oily (which they are) but they're delicious!

Ps. If you order a shawarma, be sure NOT to take the shawarma completely out because it can get very messy...the paper bag and wax is like a support system for the wrap. Keep it in or it'll all fall out! :)

Pps. If you haven't been there, I suggest you to go ASAP!!! You won't be disappointed.
