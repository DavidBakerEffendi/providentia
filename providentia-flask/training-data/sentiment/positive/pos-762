Hmmm... I really can't fault anything about this restaurant.

The service was awesome. The waitress (Victoria?) was friendly and very helpful. 

The food was simple, fresh and delicious. The portions were generous. 

The decor is fun, eclectic and comfortable. Perhaps a bit too dark for me? But I guess that's the mood they're going for.

The thing I like most about Piano Piano is that it's completely unpretentious. It lives up to its name.
