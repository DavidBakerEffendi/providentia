I've never been a huge fan of food places that can drive away before I order, but this place is awesome! We weren't sure what to try, so we basically ran a sampling of everything on the menu. Light, tasty and fresh across the board... Experiment with what suits your tastes, but make sure to have the loaded fries. 2 tacos, an empanada and loaded fries were plenty of food for the two of us, but as god as my witness, we could have eaten this yumminess until we burst! I'd honestly chase this damned truck to get this food!
