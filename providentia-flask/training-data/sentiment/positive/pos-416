Had tomato basil soup and grilled cheese lunch combo. It was so yummy. Soup nice creamy seasoned good. Grilled cheese was delicious, I'm picky about cheese and this had good quality tasting cheese. 
They have a pretty decent Meir, but a week of traveling, eating, drinking this is what my belly was craving and it hit the spot. 
I tried their Moscow Mule and it was great. Sometimes they are a hit or miss with flavor to me and this is one my favs I have tried. 
Waitress was quick, accurate and friendly.
