Ok... My wife is 100% Jamaican born. She is picky about food, but VERY picky about Jamaican food. Well...she LOVED the Curry Goat. Best Jamaican food we have tried in AZ and yes we tried a bunch. One thing, the cooks are Jamaican so go figure that helps. If you want to taste REAL JAMAICAN FOOD, for real,  trust me you, have to eat something here.  

One thing, we discussed Joe if Americans go to Jamaica and only eat resort food.. They would NEVER get the chance to taste authentic Jamaican cuisine. This is the real deal Jamaican.
