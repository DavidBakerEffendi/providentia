We arrived at 4:30 today on a Thursday evening and noticed it was pretty busy. We put our name down, had a table for 4 and it was a 40 minute wait time so I looked at it as a good thing.

If you have to wait 40 minutes on a Thursday than people are coming here for a reason.

When we were seated it was a pretty good atmosphere, very nice, clean and our table was a half circle table with loads of room.

My oldest son and I ordered the Big Beef sandwich and my wife had a pasta dish with a mushroom sauce. My youngest son had the shrimp scampi.

The sandwich I had was phenomenal, I mean every bite was tasty, the bread was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle but the havrati cheese and spice from the pablano peppers was the key here. My kids loved their food and my wife did as well.

We are coming back my wife and I for a date night. Absolutely fantastic place...food, atmosphere, drink and the whole experience!
