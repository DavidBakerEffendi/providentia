I really love their tom yum soup here. I always come to eat jere with my mother (who let me tell you, dislikes to eat at restaurants that has MSG) because this place has none. Which is great. We really like the fried rice with cashew and pineapple. Best thai resto ive come accross in mtl. Definitely recommend this place!
