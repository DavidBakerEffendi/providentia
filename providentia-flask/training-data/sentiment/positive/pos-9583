Had an enjoyable dinner here after finding out the other Japanese restaurant in the area that we wanted to visit was closed for Easter Sunday. The service was impeccable! We were greeted and seated immediately and our server was readily available, without being intrusive. The food was not only delicious, but they had a great variety of items to offer. They even had agedashi tofu - something my daughter demands from a Japanese restaurant but it's usually so hard to find. I am somewhat of a Japanese restaurant snob since I am Japanese and from Hawaii. All of the food was delicious and I couldn't believe how quickly it came to our table. I'm used to waiting a long time for rolls. My husband enjoyed my Spider Roll so much that he ate mine and had to order another. And I loved the presentation of the Kane Age (soft shell crab app). The only food that wasn't quite right was the chicken teriyaki. We didn't complain about it because the rest of our meal was so enjoyable, but the server noticed that we left it on the plate while we packed up the rest of our food to go, and asked about it. I honestly told her that the texture seemed a bit off, and she immediately rectified it by letting us know that she needed to let the kitchen know so that it wouldn't happen again. She later came back with mochi ice cream for us, complements of the sushi chef/manager. Way to make things right! Our server was attentive and cared enough about our dining experience that she questioned and then did something about it. My daughter asked if we could come back before we end our vacation, because our dining experience was so pleasant!
