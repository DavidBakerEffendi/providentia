Stopped in with a buddy last night because it was wing night and we heard they had awesome wings. 

It was a nice place. Dimly lit with plenty of TVs. Tuned to ESPN. Looked clean from what I could tell. Buddy ordered a Pepsi and I a Long Island. Long Island was perfect. Friend ordered 10 garlic Parmesan wings and a fried bologna sandwich. He said both were excellent. I just ordered 5 Sweet Heat Teriyaki and 5 Chili Diablo wings. You can choose between "breaded" or "naked". Go with breaded. Trust me. These were the best wings I've ever had. And I've had many a chicken give their lives so I could have wings. Both flavors were very good thigh the Chili Diablo was the better of the 2. 

Got another Long Island and a Diet Pepsi and the bill came to about $20. Pretty fair if you ask me. Service was also up to par. Nothing special but not bad.
