I stopped by on a hot Sunday afternoon, after my massage, and just when I thought the massage put me in a good mood...no no, it's the tasty cakes, delicious poke, and the unexpected guava filled malasada that was given to me, that put in in a super great mood.

The poke was pricey, but it is what the market price is.  My half pound of container filled with poke came out to $7.77.  I got the creamy sauce with a hint of sriracha, green scallions and white onions.  I would like to try the shoyu and the garlic sauce next time.  

All the cakes look so delicious, but because I am on a healthy streak, I limited myself to two only.  I got the chantilly ($4) and guava cake ($3.75).  My bf, who doesn't have a sweet tooth, kept coming back for more bites while I was enjoying the chantilly cake.   It was a moist chocolate devil cake, with two layers of custard like frosting.  It has the perfect level of sweetness (not overly sweet).  Yum yum.

The guava cake was delish.  I had that the next day prior to hitting the gym, and the cake was still so moist.  It truly tastes like guava.  Gosh, I wanna head back for more, but I can only do so on a cheat day. 

The owner is such a friendly and awesome person.  He gave me a guava malasada and that is such a nice gesture.  I totally did not expect that.  Also, it shows how detailed he is since that guava malasada choice must be due to my selection of the guava cake.  

I can't wait to go back and try other tasty cakes and a different type of poke.  Yum Yum Yum.
