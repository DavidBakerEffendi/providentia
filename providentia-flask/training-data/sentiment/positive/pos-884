I came here on a Thursday for brunch not knowing what to expect, and now its my favorite breakfast spot! I got the Belgian waffle with strawberries and it was so tasty! They get an A+ in presentation too. When you get your food you automatically want to start digging in. Our waiter was so nice too! She went above and beyond for us and I really appreciated it. When my friend and I got there they did not have much service and that could play a toll in why we got really great service so I am curious too see what it's like on a busy day. All together, my breakfast was perfect and I would totally come again and again.
