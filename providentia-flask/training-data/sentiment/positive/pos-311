As an update, I took a work-group here (about 20 people) for lunch and it was still great... they were very accommodating of anything my group needed.  People ate and drank like crazy, and it was still only around $400.  Not bad for 20 people.  Just opens up the possibility of this place being good for work meetings, and not just at night...
