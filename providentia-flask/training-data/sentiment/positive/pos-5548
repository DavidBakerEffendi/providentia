Amazing food in a cozy little restaurant! 

I walked on St -Viateur so many times and never noticed the restaurant until my friend proposed to go there for dinner.

Yelp reviews are great and it is definitely accurate. We went for the tasting menu for $60 each ~ you can also choose a vegetarian  version.  We took both and shared. 

Let me tell you that the planting is beautiful and the taste of each dish is simply delicious!  The portions are not big but at the end of the meal I didn't feel hungry anymore...it was just right! 

The restaurant is not big but you don't feel crowded at all.it is quite cozy and intimate. If you are looking for a romantic restaurant and amazing food, well this is the place! I also love how they write the name of the person who reserved the table on a big piece of rock and place it on the table :)

The name of the restaurant is not mentioned outside so make sure to look for the address.
