Being from Philadelphia and experiencing great diners growing up, I was saddened to move to Raleigh, NC and find we don't have a good diner here. So after watching a diner's drive in and dives show, which featured this establishment, we decided to give it a try once we visited Charlotte. The Neighborhood is "sketchy" at best... I was a little worried about the outside not being much to look at. So imagine my suprise once inside to see the dessert case with (gasp) tasty and large treats to try. We went for dinner, and as Guy had suggested I tried the turkey dinner. It was lip smackin' good- as they like to say in the south. I fell in love instantly with this place.Just to be sure I wasn't dreaming about a good diner in the south, we came back the next morning for breakfast..and the dream became a reality. Our breakfast was just as tasty, and now every visit to Charlotte requires at least one- or two- stops at the Landmark Diner!
