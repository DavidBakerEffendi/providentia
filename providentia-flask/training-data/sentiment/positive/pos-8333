Deep inside the Paris Paris hotel is La Creperie. It's a small, unassuming window with a side area of tables. People usually walk by because the buffet is on the other side.

When we landed my wife said lets check into the hotel and go to La Creperie. I said, don't you want to explore the Aria where we're staying? We've never been to the hotel. I'm told, take me to La Creperie right now this second! Yes dear..

Walking up to the window, the chef greets us. 

How many I assist you? One Ham & Cheese Crepe please.

A few minutes later, his masterpiece is ready. My wife grabs a knife & fork, I know to sit back and let her take the reins. She takes a bite. She shakes her head. She's in the zone. I know I can proceed without getting shanked.

When I tell you this crepe is so light, so flavorful, so bangin', its too legit to quit. Made with the freshest ingredients, the ham & gruyere cheese crepe is our go to crepe spot when we're on vacation in Las Vegas.

La Creperie sells dessert crepes as well as savory crepes. I never had them. We keep getting the Ham & Gruyere cheese crepe the day we land.

Cheers!
