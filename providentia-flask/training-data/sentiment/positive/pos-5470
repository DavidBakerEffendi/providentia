Came with my girlfriend for late night snack and drinks during the week. I have to say that I really liked how friendly waitresses were. Very attentive and gave us many suggestions. I don't drink, but my friend loved their beer on draft. We got 3 appetizers and they all were really nice. Overall they offer typical bar food with some signature dish options. Will come back.
