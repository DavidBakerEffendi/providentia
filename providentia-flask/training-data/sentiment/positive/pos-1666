Monday's and Wednesday's are the time to go here.  Dollar drinks all night! Right across from ASU campus so there are a lot of younger college kids, which normally is fine, just watch out the week school gets back in, because it can be a little nutty!

Axle, the bartender is an awesome dude who takes care of his customers.

Get the tall 32oz beers for 3 bucks! Good selection of pool tables and darts too.
