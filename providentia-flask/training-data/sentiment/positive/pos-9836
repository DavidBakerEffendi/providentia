This is classic Italian food and dining.  I felt like I was back in Italy!

It's not going to be what you really expect when you see "Italian Restaurant".  I was a little skeptical being someone who doesn't eat much pasta, but I survived and had an incredible meal.

I know the menu changes pretty regularly, which is fine with me.  There's a few antipasti dishes, pasta, and proteins.  I wasn't amazed by the pasta (Italy still holds that crown) but was happy with the anitpasti and proteins that we ordered.  Additionally, the desserts were fantastic!  Bianco's mother was in town and had made a special galette that night.  It was magnificent.
The wine list is also pretty good.

Keep in mind that it's a small place so it doesn't do a bunch and the restaurant is quite intimate.  That being said, it is the truest representation of classic Italian food and dining that I've experienced in the Valley so that's why it has 5 stars from me.
