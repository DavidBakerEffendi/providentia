Great pub food and service!  We were so stuffed after dinner we had to be rolled out.  This restaurant is big and has the Irish pub feel.  There was no wait when I came here for dinner on a weeknight.  They also have daily specials like 2 for 1 wings on Monday and $10 burgers on Wednesday.

Mussels$12  - These mussels tasted fresh, comes with pita and is served in a red sauce.
Calamari $12 - Nicely breaded, good texture and yummy dipping sauce.
Cauliflower dip $11 - Comes with pretzel bites to dip in this sinfully delicious dip.  It's hard to tell there's cauliflower in it since it was so cheesy. 
Chicken Mahkhani $17 - Juicy tandoori chicken, well cooked basmati rice and nicely spiced sauce.

The private lot in front of the restaurant can accommodate about 8 cars, but there are extra spaces next door _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _
