Good and service is absolutely 5 star worthy!! walked in 20 minutes til closing.....I anticipated cranky workers, I would be (the husband was craving Thai)...

We are greeted by a young smiling hostess, waited on expeditiously but without feeling rushed....we ordered and got super fresh food...from the rolls to shrimp (trust me, shrimp is easy to screw up when rushing to cook it)...panang is crazy good, as is the fried rice.....

We received refills and were asked how the good was...even though we are ten minutes past closing...

Dessert came out fresh....they cared about how we felt the experience was as well add the quality of good they put out...highly recommended...
