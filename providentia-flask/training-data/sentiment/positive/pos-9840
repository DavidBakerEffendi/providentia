"they've recreated the great hole in the wall placed you find in the west end." 

Literally a hole in the wall as it's at 9555 Yonge st which under construction right now is at Yonge and Weldrick. Hard to find parking during the week because there are office buildings and other restaurants and businesses around but worth it. If you can't see it off the street it's because the front entrance is maybe 20ft wide and it's all the way at the back. 

Real Vietnamese people own and operate this place and the menu is very vast but affordable. Dated tile flooring, white walls, and jade touches everywhere scream authentic (I'm serious) so already I was impressed. The cutlery is nicely laid out and they use green coloured chop sticks, spoons and little bowls and that is pretty cool. 

Pho soup is really on point. Delicious, aromatic, fresh tasting withoit being salty or drying. Meat was cooked perfectly and delicious. Lots of it too. Very happy to come back and eat this again as it's inside warming and good value. I always avoid the biggest size a pho place has and get one less. More than enough. 

5 out of 5 if you like pho.
