Always heard of this place but never thought I'd get to try it since there aren't currently any in Toronto. Found myself in Sauga over the weekend and couldn't resist giving it a try after having dinner. 

I ordered the matcha slushie with grass jelly, red bean, and tapioca, topped with a chocolate wafer stick and a maraschino cherry. It was very yummy! The texture of the tapioca was just right, the drink wasn't too sweet, and it was overall very refreshing. Service was also great. Even though we just ordered drinks, a waitress kept checking up on us to see how we were doing.

Would definitely come back the next time I'm in the city.
