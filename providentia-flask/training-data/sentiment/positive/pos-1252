Still consistently outstanding per my last visit there yesterday before heading back to the OC.  Heard that they were moving to a bigger location by August 1 with this Sunday being their last day at the Island Sushi location.  I will be checking out the new location (215 and Stephanie St) when I am back in Vegas first week in August.
