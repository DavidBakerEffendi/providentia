Been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally went today with some coworkers for lunch. Got the Butcher's plate which was amaaazing! Also had the cheese ravioli and one of my coworkers had the short rib stew. Both were delicious. Need to go back and try some of those awesome looking drinks and desserts.
