Have been here at least four times and it was excellent every time.  Just don't take one of the two tables by the front door on cold days or nights.

Great place for a beer or a family dinner.  Open for both lunch and dinner with the same menu.  Wonderful burgers and steaks.  Chef makes special soups which have been excellent, like the white cheddar poblamo.  

Does get crowded so come other than at prime feeding times or on weekends.  You wait outside, so cold weather demands that you bundle up.

Salads are nice, beer and wine selections are super and there is a full bar.  Onion rings are fresh made, not from a frozen package and with their house made ranch dressing are a meal in themselves.  If you are not into onions, the fried pickles are a great appetizer.

Menu, for a bar/tavern is very extensive and a pleasant surprise from the standard bar fare.

Great servers who obviously enjoy working there as much as we enjoy eating there.

Among the gems in little old Waxhaw.  A treat to enjoy.
