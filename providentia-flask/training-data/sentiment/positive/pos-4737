A wonderful little treasure tucked in a corner of the Coventry Road area, The Mint Cafe is a Thai restaurant that offers a fragrant variety of curries, rices and other wonderful fare for both the carnivore or the ardent vegetarian. 

Their meals are wonderful from appetizers through the main dishes right down their tasty and exotic desserts (the banana spring rolls are a personal favorite of my wife and I:) The service is great and the atmosphere is nice and intimate. 

They also have a nice selection of drinks from Lassi's (the drink, not the pooch:) to tasty bubble teas and other fine fare.

Parking is available down the street, and then you have access to all of Coventry's wonderful stores. Truly, a great way to spend an evening with friends or a way to treat your significant other to a special evening out.

NOTE: TODAY, JAN 4, 2011, SADLY, WE FOUND OUT THAT MINT CAFE IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED FOR SOME STRANGE, UNKNOWN REASON. THEY RECOMMENDED GOING TO ONE OF THEIR SISTER RESTAURANTS LIKE PEPPERMINT CAFE. IF ANYONE FINDS OUT WHY THIS WONDERFUL PLACE CLOSED, PLEASE, LET ME KNOW.
