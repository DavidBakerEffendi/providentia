Loved the fresh and minty lemonade. Excellent service with great halal food. Loved the combination Shwarma plate.Flafel, chicken and beef all made fresh and yummy in the tummy.  Also tried the chicken steak type dish and loved it. Satisfied our sweet tooth with the baklava and considered it a great night! 

Also loved the spicy cauliflower,  olives and radish given as a tapa style before the meal. Happy to have a halal food place which has great food and looks great. Can't wait to come back!  Be sure to ask for the spicy sauce!!
