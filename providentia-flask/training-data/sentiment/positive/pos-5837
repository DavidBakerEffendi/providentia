I decided to try this new sushi place after noticing the great reviews, and I'm happy I did! I admit I was hesitant to stop here because of the location (Corner of Smoke Ranch and Rainbow, basically the edge of North LV) but it's convenient, literally right off the freeway and a fairly quiet place. It is inside a shopping center, right next door to Pepe's. 

We did the AYCE, and I was impressed. Everything was fresh and tasted great! The server was friendly and the owner was behind the bar making the sushi. 

A few rolls I ordered: 
*Pink Lady 
*Playboy (my favorite) 
*Something Wrong 69
*Donde PaPa 
*James Bond 

Definitely going back! It's a small location, so I will probably only go at lunch so I don't have to worry about a wait.
