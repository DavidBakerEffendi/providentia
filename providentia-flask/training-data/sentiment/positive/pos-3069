Had a great lunch here today!

I would recommend making reservations as it gets quite busy during the lunch hour. My sister and I arrived at around noon; without reservations, we were seated in an awkward area along the bar. Luckily, a table opened up and we were able to relocate. On Temperance, it's tucked in so you might have trouble finding it. I love the decor here; it's homey and cozy. I especially like the open concept where you can see oysters being shucked. 

As for the food, my sister and I were happy with what we ordered. The shrimp tacos are so simple yet delicious. It comes with three tacos so it's a perfect portion for sharing. The fish and chips were also great; it wasn't too heavy and it wasn't overpowered by breading of the fish. We also ordered the lobster roll (w/ salad); this was another winner. Full of lobster chunks, this sandwich was a hearty one.

Lastly, I wanted to mention the service. It was excellent; staff came often to fill up our glasses and see how we were doing. Can't wait to return !
