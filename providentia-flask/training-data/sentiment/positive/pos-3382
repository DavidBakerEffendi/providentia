First time for Brunch -which was awesome!   Got there right at 9am and seated right away.   
Started with a nice cup of coffee which was always topped off.   All the dishes were nice sized servings and every one enjoyed their choice.    We tried the Smoked Salmon, Ciabatta French Toast, Farm Scramble, Morning Staple and the B.E.L.T. 
Hidden gem for sure.   Don't forget Mon/Tues $20 bottle and board after 8pm
