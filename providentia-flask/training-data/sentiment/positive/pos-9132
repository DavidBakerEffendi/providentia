This place has great food, good service, and excellent outdoor atmosphere. Tacos are good, drinks are strong, and sitting outside under the zigzag of string lights is very romatic and laid back atmosphere. We come here a lot and order the ceviche which is amazing. Happy hour is the best, and taco Tuesdays. The music is laid back, and we seem to sit here for hours and talk, and drink, and eat tacos. It's fun to see people walk by and the staff is very friendly.
