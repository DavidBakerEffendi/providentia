UPDATED REVIEW: 

I still LOVE the Root Cafe.

My all time favourite dish to order is the culture sandwich. In my opinion, this is by far the best item on the menu. I am not even a vegetarian but I love this tempeh sandwich. Try it!!!

The "my egg sandwich" for breakfast is absolutely delicious. I think the avocado and cilantro inside really bring out the flavour of the sandwich. 

I've also tried the "vegan style burrito" which I didn't actually order. A friend ordered it and I eat almost half of it. It was very good but I didn't realize it has onions inside so I didn't like it as much (I hate onions). 

I've had the Root Wrap twice now and while it is tasty, I didn't like the mushiness of it. It either has too much chipolte aioli or sweet potatoes. The wrap ends up being too soft/mushy; thus, when you try to bite into it, some parts fall off.

Live music is here on some weeknight evenings so call ahead or check out their website for a list of events if you are interested in listening to a band. Or just call ahead if you want to come here to work or study because I know I can't concentrate too much if loud music is on.
