Can ice cream ever REALLY go wrong? 

The same delicious Ben & Jerry's ice cream we all know and love, plus a quaint setting (Davidson = adorable) and a friendly staff. Parking is easy in downtown Davidson, and this shop is certainly walkable from anywhere downtown.

As I sit here and polish off this last bit of my hand-packed pint of Chocolate Therapy, I am contemplating going back to replenish my ice cream stash.
