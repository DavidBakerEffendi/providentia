Fox & Hound is one of my favorite bar chains in Charlotte, they are geared towards watching sports, offering decent bar food, good drink specials, and entertaining events.

We are regulars here on Thursday nights for the live trivia, also because it is $2 domestic and $2.50 imports night.  The wait staff are friendly and cute, our favorite server at this Northlake store is Fran, she is friendly, fast, and remembered my drink of choice after only my first week there.

The beer selection is above average for your average sports bar, lot of choices in imports, including a couple of my favs Smithwicks and Boddingtons.

Besides live trivia on Thursdays, we have seen Jello Wrestling (check photos), Bikini contests, Karaoke (Sundays and Tuesdays), and various themed holiday celebrations.

Make sure you join the FREE All Star Brew club, after only 50 beers you get half price wings for life.  There are a lot of other benefits as well, including free appetizer parties each month.  It is valid at all Fox and Hounds in the US and Bailey's and Champs restaurants as well.

If trivia on Thursday brings you here come early, it starts at 9 but bar will be filled up by then.

P.S.  The bathrooms have mouthwash dispensers if you find yourself going overboard with the Spicy garlic wings!
