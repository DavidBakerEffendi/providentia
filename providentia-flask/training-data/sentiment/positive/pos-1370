This place is absolutely gorgeous from end to end, you're going to want to take lots of pictures of the food and venue! 

Staff were very friendly and came often to refill your water.

I came with my cousin just to hang out and grab a bite. I had the Truffle Grilled Cheese with a side of salad, which was perfect because i was debating on getting a full sized salad vs the sandwich but turns out the sandwich comes with sides. It was delicious btw! It's exactly the flavour you want in a grilled cheese but enhanced because of the truffle oil.

The price wasn't too shocking either! It's what you expect in such a luxurious looking place (think steakhouse prices) and i was quite full by the end of it so i thought it was worth it. 

I wouldn't suggest going with a big party, the biggest tables seat 5 comfortably and it's best as a brunch meal.

****I went around 12pm and I had to wait around half an hour for my seat so i gave them my phone number and they texted me when it was ready, in the mean time you could just walk around the gallery.
