Really just excellent. At $11, their Soup & Wrap combo is the best lunch value around.

Ravi's storefront is easy to miss, and the front of house where orders are placed is crowded and chaotic, but only because they are a victim of their own awesome. Several soups and wraps on offer every day, with the selection revolving.

The corn chowder (with Blue Crab chunks!) and the roasted red pepper bisque are phenoms. The porcini mushroom bisque didn't seem very bisquey to me, but had tons of flavour. The Ravi Stew will stick to your ribs and keep you warm all afternoon.

And the wraps! The roasted pork shoulder would be great enough, but the curried lamb wrap is just sensational. Great flavour on the curry, big chunks of lamb, and lots of greens make it really pop. One of the best wraps I've had.

Pro-tip: Go. Then, the next day, go again.
