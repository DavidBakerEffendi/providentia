I can't believe I haven't left a review yet. 
This place is LEGIT! Best Indian food in Arizona. 
Usually Indian kitchens are not the cleanest and some concern what's going on "back there". 
These guys have an open kitchen so you can see your food being prepared.
The food is always fresh and so flavorful. Usually Indian food doesn't sit well with my stomach but this food I can all the time. 
We eat marigolds on average at least once or twice a week for lunch. So sad we are moving away since we will miss Marigolds. Super friendly staff and a very organized restaurant operation they are running here.
