Delicious meal with great service. More people need to come and try this place. 

We ordered the ceviche and the lomos saltado. Both were made beautifully. 

The ceviche was fresh with perfect amount of acid. 

The lomos (steak with tomatoes, onions, and French fries) was tender and paired well with the vegetables. Ask for their green sauce on the side, it's delicious on everything. They were nice enough to give me some to take home too! 

The prices might look a little steep if you're going for a casual meal but the size and execution makes it worth it for me. We left happy and full.
