It is rare that a restaurant completely blows me away.  This place was an unexpected amazing experience.  The atmosphere/vibe of the place is very laid back and relaxing.   The menu just blows your mind with Peruvian-Sushi fusion dishes.  There are so many excellent dishes I don't even know where to start.   The shrimp tempura appetizer left a memorable impression as did the pork belly.  

The star dish had to be the miso-glazed sea bass skewers.  They were amazing and I could have made a meal out of just the skewers.   The nigiri was super fresh, well presented and a large variety.  I am not a big sushi roll fan but this place delivers some of the most inventive rolls I have experienced. Absolutely delicious.   

We even indulged in desserts.  The chocolate ganache was so rich and flavorful.   I ordered the banana split which was weirdly wonderful.    Carmel soaked bananas with popcorn and the smoothest ice cream you have ever had.  

The place was busy so the service was a bit slow but honestly we didn't mind as the atmosphere is so relaxed. Do bring your wallet, the meal is not going to be cheap but it will be memorable.   I highly recommend this place if you want a unique sushi experience.
