Love coming to this place! The service is always amazing, coming here always makes me feel welcome. 
The boba is the best! Best consistency! 

Marc is the best at making drinks. Always ask if he is working! Ask him to make your drinks! 

The food here is top notch! I love getting the ramen and the bowls and if I'm not that hungry, the appetizers are great.
