The Cafe that is much more than a cafe.

Food: the food is phenomenal. Everything is farm to table and healtht but delicious at the same time. Not one of those places thag sacrifices taste for healthiness.

Vibe: The vibe is really chill. This place would fit in perfectly in Noda. Tons of plants everywhere. Great spot for dinner lunch or just grabbing a drink after work. An instant classic in Charlotte's new restaurant scene.
