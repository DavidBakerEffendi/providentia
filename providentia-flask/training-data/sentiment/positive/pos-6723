I noticed on Facebook one afternoon that The Coronado just recently opened and went that same night to see what it was all about. A friend of mine described it as "a mix between Lux and Braggs" (RIP), something I definitely agree with after visiting.

The bar is also the counter you order food from, and is covered in fresh pastries in little glass cases. They had plenty of cookies, tarts, pies, and even a pineapple cake. Water, napkins, and silverware are all self-serve. Seating is also DIY, and while it's limited inside the tiny rooms, there's a huge patio on the side and even a few tables in the front. 

My husband and I are obnoxiously small eaters, so we split the jackfruit siders and fries. I nearly licked the plate clean! Flavor and texture was awesome. Spicy mayo was perfect. Between the two of us, it was the ideal amount of food. Even with a full stomach, though, I couldn't help eyeing the Monte Vista Torta ordered by the table next to us. It was gorgeous, and something I will definitely be trying on my next visit.
