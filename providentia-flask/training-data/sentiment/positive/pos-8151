You know, I thought Burrito Boyz was good....
I was already impressed when I brought it back to my office and picked it up, and it was HEAVY. I mean, like at least 2 lbs.

I was also impressed by how the thing did not fall apart while I was eating it. 

Okay, really - CHOW MIEN instead of rice in your burrito?!?! It wasn't crunchy, but definitely a chance of pace. Also TONS of toppings that you don't need to pay extra for, including guac, cheese, sour cream, red onion, green peppers, edemame beans, black beans, cilantro and chipotle sauce.

$6.99 you can get steak, pork, fish (wow looks yummy), chicken with all I mentioned above, rice or noodles.

$7.99 there is a VEGAN option that looks also equally amazing. 

Honestly, after stuffing your face, it all tastes the same, except for the texture. 

I just finished it in my office, and now time for a nap!
