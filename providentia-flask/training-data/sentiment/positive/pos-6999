My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday and took me here. I cant say how impressed I was with everything! We both got the build your own entree. I love the concept of being able to create my own deliciousness for one price. I loaded up on the shrimp & scallops. The cooked it right in front of me and it was such a fun experience. The service was great as well. Everyone was very attentive and polite. After the meal our waitress gave us the flyer for their Bottomless Sundays... You know ill be back for that!
