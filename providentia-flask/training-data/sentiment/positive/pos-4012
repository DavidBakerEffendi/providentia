Was running errands before work in the area so I decided to try a new spot. I was running way early for work so I decided to go inside although they do have a convenient drive thru as well.

As soon as I walked in I received a warm welcome from the guy behind the counter. He asked if I had been there before and offered a couple of suggestions so I didn't have to stand there long trying to quickly decipher the menu. I went for an iced nuts and berries with an add shot. Quite tasty and hit the spot! They also had a nice selection of tasty sounding options as well.

This place isn't on my normal route from home to work but I will definitely keep it in mind and come back when I am in the area again and looking for a fix. I want to try the food next time as well.
