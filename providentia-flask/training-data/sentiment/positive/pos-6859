One of the best coffees in Montreal.  I might even say the best, but I haven't tried as many places as I'd like in order to claim that just yet.  I was tempted to take my coffee to go when I saw how small the joint was but I cozied up to the bar and I'm a better person today for that decision to stay.  Although it's in Old Port, they definitely seem to have their regulars as the baristas knew who ordered what.

The space is small and well designed. Not sure if they sell alcohol but it felt like they should. It was like being in a little dive bar except it's clean and your laptop is welcomed. The staff was friendly but not overly. When my barista saw that I wasn't taking my cup away, she brought over a glass of water with a smile. Great playlist and a chat with another barista about that and how great coffee is made.  Enjoyed people watching, especially the people just ordering at the window off the street. Ended up having a really insightful conversation about life with a random stranger.  Okay, social commentary time...put your phone down and try talking to a live person, a complete stranger. I dare you. You might learn something about yourself.
