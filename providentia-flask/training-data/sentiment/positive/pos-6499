This review is solely based on the service that I got from Sheila. The fastest I've ever gotten through this drive-through hands-down! Her customer service skills are impeccable. She's professional and she makes you feel like there is a sense of urgency and there was. She's too good for this place. Jack-in-the-Box I suggest you do whatever it takes to keep her. You're awesome Sheila!
