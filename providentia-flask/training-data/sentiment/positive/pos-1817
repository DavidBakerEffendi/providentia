I love how this place is reliable and open 24 hours, you can literally walk in at 4 am and still be served. I also love how the servers here actually acknowledge you when you walk through the door and it's normally not busy at this time so you get seated right away. Food takes a bit to cook if you order the soups, but if you order all you can eat they have quite a variety of Meats and their meat quality is DEFINITELY better than honey pigs guaranteed. You can also get appetizers whichever appetizers you want so there's quite a variety of stuff to choose from and I love VARIETY LOL. This place is very clean, the floor looks spotless every time I come here to eat, and their bathrooms are as well HELLA CLEAN!! I love it, I love eating at clean restaurants, it makes the whole meal more enjoyable if anyone else feels me on this?? Anyways 5 stars for perfect customer service, cleanliness, variety of quality food AND open 24/7. I'd recommend for everyone to go here seriously especially if you're a night owl and always crave for late night food
