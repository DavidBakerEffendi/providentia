We went to Melt to grab a quick bite before the movie across the street. It's WAY less expensive and way yummier than the crap that they sell at the theatre. 

There were so many yummy choices & they had me at avacado & chicken. They have an assortment of sauces too, I opted for the mustard aioli and I swear it was homemade. If the other sauces are as good, I can only imagine. 

It's worth noting that they had gluten free bread which was really good - not an easy task with gluten free bread. The size of the bread was a big smaller but it in the end, it was the perfect size. 

I noticed that they have poutine (made the correct way WITH curds) that looked pretty good.

We stood and ate our sandwiches inside because it was raining but it was a very small eating area. I would suggest getting it to go (perhaps smuggling it into the theatre :D) 

**this place makes a mean sandwich and is super cheap (and clean) ** Go while it's still new BEFORE they have line-ups out the door. It's really only a matter of time :) **
