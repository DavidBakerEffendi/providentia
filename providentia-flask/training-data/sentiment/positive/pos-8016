As far as cheap buffets go, this one has the best dinner buffet for a small selection.  They will be more than happy to help you in any way they can.  I have quite I few food allergies and I have to be careful of what I consume... I love orange chicken and I noticed they had sesame seeds on it.  When I asked the staff if they have some without sesame because of my food allergy.  They lady I spoke with was more than happy to make an entire NEW tray.  I thanked her 10 times at least.  Then another cook spoke broken enlgish talked to me, he said, "you no see what you want, you ask us we make it for you.  You happy it make us happy."   He was very kind and so was the rest of the staff.   I've even met the head chef one day and he was very apologetic & respectful when I told them there was a problem at the buffet.
