Love love love!!! The food is amazing. We are kind of regulars at this place. With family previously working there we got to try all sorts of different food. Although the menu isnt huge, they still have a pretty good selection. We went here to celebrate my grandmas and my birthday. The server, a family friend. Was fantastic!!! She checked to see how everything was going througout our meal. It was not overwhelming nor not enough. We even had two complimentary appetizers. This location is more on the quiet side. Unlike in kona Hawaii it is very loud and notthe easiest to carry on a conversation.  Butterfish is great! The pear salad just the right mix. And our desserts, put together beautifully.
