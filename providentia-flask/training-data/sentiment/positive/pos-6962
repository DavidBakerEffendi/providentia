With me being reviewer number 909... I think I'll keep this short. lol

The Venetian is a beautiful, elegant casino hotel that offers great shopping, restaurants and clean, nice rooms.  It's a favorite of my friends and mine when we visit.  You can usually find good room rates on the discount sites.  

See ya there!
