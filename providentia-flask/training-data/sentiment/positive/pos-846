Oh Molisana Bakery.... I've been coming to this bakery for as long as I can remember. The Pizza is by far the best ever. The POTATO PIZZA is heavenly. Its a pizza consisting of roasted potatoes, roasted sweet peppers and onions.... I just can't get enough. I remember ordering whole potaoto pizza's when I was pregnant. haha... Being my mom is italian, this is the only place where I can eat most of their hot plate meals. It tastes like home.... the service is always warm and friendly. The baked goods and bread I would steer clear from... I've never  had a good experience with the sweets/muffins/croissants etc... always hard. 

P.S. they cater... so order up!
