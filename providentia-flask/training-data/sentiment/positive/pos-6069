I'd been meaning to go here for a while, and when I finally did - bam!

I love Mexican food. It's delicious, it's spicy (hurrah), and it can be either bite-sized or massive.

Campechano's tacos were not that large (anyone could eat 2, most would be OK with 3, and 4-5 would not be that crazy if you're hungry). 

What they were is delicious. I had three different ones, and every single one was delicious and tasty in it's own right.

It on the more-expensive side, but absolutely 100% worth eating here. It's my #1 taco recommendation (with Tacos Al Asador #2).
