Steve's has been in my neighborhood for years and I've only stopped in twice and that's when I'm getting my nails done.  I want to slap my own forehead for not coming more hereoften. "smack!"
After my latest mani/pedi I was in need of a java jolt. I ducked into Steve's and ordered a medium ice coffee. Service was quick (it was a slow time in the later afternoon) and the barista friendly. I added a little milk to my drink and man-o-man was it perfect. Smooth and rich and what can I say...perfecto! 

The atmosphere was so nice and calming with wooden seating that I decided to plop down for a while instead of heading home. I read my new book and sipped my caffeine and totally relaxed. I could have stayed longer and probably should have to take advantage. Instead, I'll come back more often and enjoy my neighborhood coffee bar.
