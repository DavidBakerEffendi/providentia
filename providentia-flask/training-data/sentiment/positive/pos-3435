Fantastic Family Outing!
Our family has attended the last 9 shows at Jubilations and we have never been disappointed!
We started going when my daughter was 10 and she loved everything - the excellent singing, the hilarious wait staff, the great kids menu, and that she got to stay up late!
No where else will you find a team of people working harder to entertain you than at Jubilations. Your server is in character the whole time, and participates in the live show in between bringing you your four course dinner! 
They are efficient, everything is well thought out, and boy can they sing! Always a great selection of classic rock, modern hits, and any other song that fits the current theme.
Birthdays and anniversaries are always acknowledged at Jubilations too, so it's a great place to celebrate with family where everyone will have a great time.
