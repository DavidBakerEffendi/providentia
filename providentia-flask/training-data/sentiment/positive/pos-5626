Gold spike 
Came here for some grub, before a night of drinking. We had the best server that you can ask for Anne Marie, who was attentive and hilariously entertaining 

We ordered our food, which came out pretty fast I got the Gold Spike Burger. It was so delicious; it's the kind of burger you should get if you don't care about calories. Haha. 

When you're done with your food you can hang at the bar and grab drinks, there's the gaming area  where you can play oversize versions of beer pong, connect 4, chess, etc. 

Of course, I will be back for more food, or get some stuff Postmates since they use them for delivery.
