I walked in there today, didn't buy a single thing yet I was greeted with a gracious smile, warm welcome every kiosk I passed. That alone left a lasting impression on me, especially since the fact that I don't exactly dress like a typical Neiman Marcus customer. I was really quite impressed by the warmth and friendliness of the staff and that alone will lead me to return to find something I like and buy it there.
