Me likey!!!

I had lunch with my girls Jenn N. and Raissa R. here during the first week of Stampede. The place was bumpin', but we managed to score a table in the back right near the kitchen. I was surprised to learn that this was a part of the JOEY chain, I enjoyed the atmosphere and couldn't help but notice the amount of cooks in the kitchen and servers running around. Being that it was Stampede, that's expected, but it was nice to see everyone working hard to get things running smoothly. 

We ordered a couple of cocktails - Caesars - which were served in adorable boot mugs. They were garnished with a green bean, olives, and a pepperoni stick and were DELISH! I also tried one of the lemonade cocktails and enjoyed it as well. 

Our meals were burgers with fries, as well as a Chicken Sandwich. Food came out quickly, which was appreciated during a busy lunch hour! The consensus was that everyone loved their food. The burger was HUGE, messy, and delicious! I actually saved half for my boyfriend as I was too full to finish, and he raved about how great it was eating it over an hour later! The bacon was so thick and crispy, I actually contemplated coming back and only ordering a plate of bacon. I loved the shoestring style fries, which came in a bucket - cute! On top of everything, our server was super sweet and our bill was extremely reasonable. 

I'm loving LOCAL so far and will make it my go-to lunch spot while working DT. it would also make a great spot to meet friends after work for drinks.
