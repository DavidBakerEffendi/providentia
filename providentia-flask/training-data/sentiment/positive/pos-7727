I had high hopes for this spot and was not let down! From the minute we walked up, we felt so genuinely welcomed by our server. We got one of the sidewalk seats, which had a great view and was situated next to a window looking into the (very clean!) Kitchen! 

My pork belly burger was delicious and came with a generous serving of fries. I also had a few beers and a Nu Fashioned (a spin off of an old fashioned) which was great.

 I really can't say enough for the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. We will be back!
