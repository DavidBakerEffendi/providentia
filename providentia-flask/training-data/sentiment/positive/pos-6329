You pay for what you get. While the restaurant is a bit difficult to find, it is a favourite amongst my gym going friends who live in the area. I have heard comments that the food is too sweet or not authentic but to be honest each time I have asked for them to alter to my specification and they have been delighted to do so. 

For a place like this you don't expect much in terms of decor or service but yet it does just fine. I would def come back if I'm in the area because it was quick food and while it is a bit food-courty there are no food courts nearby and I'm certainly not going to drive to First Markham as this is much closer to my gym and home.
