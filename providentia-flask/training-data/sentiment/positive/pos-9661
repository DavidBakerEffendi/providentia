Me and my family come in here every Saturday morning. Our usual waitress is Sky she is so sweet and always makes sure we are well taken care of! 

My son asks for the same thing every time... a hot coco with cream and a waffle with cream and berries.. this morning they were out of the cream for the coco (the cream for the waffles is freshly made and absolutely delicious!! It's a thick whipped cream) she made sure to tell the guy that this kid is very serious about his cream  they made it happen he got extra cream in his hot coco!! 

They always take such good care of us and the food and coffee is outstanding. I literally can not order a chi tea from anywhere else because the one here is so good!!! it's ruined chi tea for me everywhere else.. (which is not a bad thing)
