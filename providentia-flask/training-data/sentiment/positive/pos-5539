This cool place is pretty dope. Went with my boss and Mom and we got a ton of different things to try. I ordered the chili cheese dog with a fried egg on top which was bomb! The Mac and cheese quesadilla, oh my god! Best thing in life so cheesy and merry and delicious. Literally can't go wrong with anything
