I finally had the chance to eat at the new Wildflower location today and all I can say is bravo Wildflower. Another job well done. 

First, the location. This area needed a Wildflower badly and I plan on adding this to my weekend rotation immediately. Wildflower went above and beyond for the customer's needs at this location. Did you know that each booth has multiple power outlets so that you can plug your computer in from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant? For anyone who works on the go, they know how much of a godsend this is. If a shop doesn't have enough power outlets, they can lose customers quickly because a computer battery only lasts so long! The restaurant is incredibly spacious and even though there was a line out the door, I found a seat right away because it's big enough to accommodate the large crowds. 

So speaking of large crowds, apparently Scottsdale got the Wildflower memo because it was swarming with lunch goers! But the Wildflower staff did a fabulous job with getting each customer in and out in an efficient manner. They didn't rush anyone but they knew how to handle the crowd. Once I got through the line, I was impressed with the friendly and fast service. 

Like other Wildflower locations, the food is fabulous as usual. The bread is fresh and soft. And the salads and sandwiches are still tasty. Today, I noticed adorable mini cakes in the case. They would make for a perfect miniature birthday cake for a friend or coworker! I also noticed the arrival of pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. Let pumpkin season begin my friends!
