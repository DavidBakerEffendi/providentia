Perfect is perfect for late night eats and early morning treats! They have  everything here from dim sum, chinese food, seafood, and a variety of other yummy dishes!  The service was pretty good for 3am and they were very accomodating to our party of 10. We ordered chicken balls, fried rice, veggies, salt and pepper squid, dim sum dishes, and hot and sour soup.  All of the dishes came out quick and they were super fresh! 

Their hot and sour soup was amazing! I could not stop eating it!  Their dim sum dishes were fresh and it felt like a great finish to an awesome evening! It was my first time coming to Perfect and I can definitely tell you that I WILL Be back! (Arnold Voice).

The price was cheap and parking a plenty! Come here to end on a Perfect note!
