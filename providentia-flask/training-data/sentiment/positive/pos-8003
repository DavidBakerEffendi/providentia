Perfect date spot. 
Dark and romantic... How I like it. 

BEST THAI FOOD IN VEGAS. 
We order: 

Pad Hed: A must!!!!!!!!!! The sauce is savory heaven and the Brussels are cooked perfect with a crunch. 

Tom yum: Pretty spicy and sour. How I like my tom yum. The bowls pretty big to share between four people. 

Duck Panang: BOMB. CRISPY. SPICY. CREAMY. RICH. TENDER. PERFECT. 

Sua Rong Hai: okay. Nothing special. Wish they have us a choice to have the ribeye medium rare.
