I'm kinda surprised about the negative reviews from this place, because I really like it. 
The happy hour is great, but I came for lunch this time.
We ordered the Firecracker Shrimp and the Calamari as an appetizer. The shrimp was sooo yummy, and the calamari was good, but wish there were more hot peppers in there. 
Then I had a cup of the Lobster bisque, which was also good, and the seafood Stuffed a Jalape√±os.  They were great, but I was so full by this time, I could barely get through one of them. 
I also had a delicious peach sangria that was made with fresh peaches and strawberries, and finished with a basil leaf. This was really a very light refreshing drink that is perfect for summer.
