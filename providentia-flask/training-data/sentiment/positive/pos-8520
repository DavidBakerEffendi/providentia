They are back!! Same food same great service just back at Greenland Market Place. Russell at the front of the house same great personality serving up great portions of local Hawaiian favorites favorites and Korean food.. one of the few places in Las Vegas that make Bi Bim Kook Soo. I haven't had a bad meal in the 18 years that I've been visiting Island Style.
