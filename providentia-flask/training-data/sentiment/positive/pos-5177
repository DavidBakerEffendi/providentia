Rimrock Bar & Grille at the Phoenix Airport Hilton has the nicest staff. This is my third visit to this bar. It is my go-to place when I need to wait for someone at the airport. It is also my favorite place to eat Carne Asada nachos. The last time my daughter and I ate there, it was off the menu, but we were so happily surprised that it has made a come back. What makes this $15 dish so special?
*delicious marinated steak
*crunch tri-color chips
*smooth and tasty guacamole
*salsa on the side
*fresh pico de gallo
*sprinkling of black beans
*pickled jalapenos available as per request
*beautiful and well-balanced flavors
*best deal on the menu (all items are priced similarly)
Happy Hour is from 4-6 pm, discounts on wines and beer. What makes this place amazing is that they made room for our large 11-person party. When I noticed that there were no black beans on our first 2 orders of Carne Asada nachos, Teri, the manager comped us another order executed perfectly. They took care of us for several hours and were the perfect hosts to our family gathering. When we asked if we could play our favorite card game, they were welcoming and gracious. Thank you, Teri and Rimrock!
