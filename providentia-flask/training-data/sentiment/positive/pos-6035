The food here is saboroso! I almost melted eating the seafood enchiladas for the first time, and the chips are some of the best I've ever had. I get butterflies in my stomach when I think of coming here - everything is very delicious that I've tasted thus far (but my favorite remains the seafood enchiladas!)

Side note - it's in a fairly empty strip mall & it's a very tiny store front itself. I'm pretty sure there are only two tables that seat four people on one side, and two other tables that seat two on the other side (possibly three & three?) I have rarely been to this strip mall before discovering Francisco's - now I head there exclusively for their food. I have them on speed dial, and usually order something before leaving work to pick up on my way home.

They recently started selling Oreo Churros. I have not had one myself (I'm fighting off the urge) but my son has & he begs for me to get this for him every time he knows I'm heading there.
