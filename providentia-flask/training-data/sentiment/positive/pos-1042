Can't believe that ive skipped thisplace so many ti es. Ive been coming to vegas every year since 92 and from the strip it didnt seem worth the stop.  Should have fead the revies. Found it by doing a google search of must see and best of.  Be careful what you order. HUGE HUGE food.  Delicious and top quality. I got a fantastic buger with incredible rings. The environment was fantastic too.  A must see.

The bar area has spectacular ambiance. GOT TO SEE!
