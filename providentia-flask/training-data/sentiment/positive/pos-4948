I've been eating lunch at Donna's for about ten months now - since I started working around the corner. Paul, who is generally manning the front counter knows me by name, makes great, honest suggestions and notices when I've had a hair cut - what a guy! 

I frequently find I don't really have time to actually take a lunch, but with Donna's a mere two minutes from my office, and free wi-fi in the dining area, I often pack up my laptop for an hour or so midday, enjoy a sandwich and keep up with the ever present flow of emails - or ignore work entirely and write reviews on Yelp - which is what I am doing now. On site review! 

This little bakery is a fantastic place to get a sandwich. On my way in to the shop each visit I check out the blackboard at the door, which shows you the daily $3.99 special. For that super low price you get the sandwich of the day (today it was a roast beef with pickles - my favorite is the chicken walnut salad), a bag of chips and a small (refillable) drink. If whatever is on the blackboard doesn't quite spark your interest, the shop has a decent sized list of other cold sandwiches for purchase. The sandwiches are made on fresh bread made by the bakery - which you can purchase and take home for around $2.50 for a (rather large) half loaf. 

Beyond making some of the best red velvet cupcakes in town - they are a STEAL at $1.29 (I just paid $4 for one somewhere else), the shop also offers lots of traditional pastries including cinnamon and Danish rolls and a variety of cakes for purchase by the slice or in whole for a party. I love that in addition to these more familiar items Donna's also offers unique items like green tea pastries and bean tarts. 

With the service, pricing and great food and pastry selection I plan to keep up my current 3-day-a-week custard bun habit as long as my waistline will allow.
