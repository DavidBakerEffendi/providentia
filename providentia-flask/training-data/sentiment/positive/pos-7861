My husband took me to this restaurant, it was extremely tasty it was also pretty busy . We weren't that hungry so we just order a couple of different appetizers. I always heard the clam chowder was to die for so we ordered a cup. We also ordered the 16 different flavor ice cream which was fun and we both enjoyed it !
