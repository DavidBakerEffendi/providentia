We originally planned on going to the Parlor next door to the Armadillo Grill. After being told there would be an hour wait at the Parlor, we walked outside and saw mist blowing across the parking lot. Staring into the mist, we saw the lights from AG and like a scourge of mosquitoes, we flew in! Ohhhh am I glad we went there. The service was exceptional, food was amazing, drinks were cold... Man oh man am I glad we went there. I will FOR SURE be back to AG.
