Always awesome here they have all kinds of desserts, super fresh salads and great soups. Usually a short wait and it's always worth it because when you sit down you're given great service. Open on holidays which is really great.
The parking lot is horrible no one parks in the lines and it's really too small for such a popular bakery surrounded by offices but that's usually the only negative.
