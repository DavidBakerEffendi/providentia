After a 12 hour fast for blood work, I screeched minivan tires and headed up Central for a full tilt lunchtime pig out! For less than 10 dollars I stuffed my face with one of the best cheeseburgers and fries the city has to offer. If you like burgers, and let's face it, you're weird if you don't, Lenny's is a must stop shop!
