Ranch House Grille has quickly become my favorite breakfast spot.  Everything is from scratch and tastes homemade.  I love that the menu has a good variety.  You can get serious and order country fried steak with biscuits and gravy or something on the lighter side like yogurt, fruit and granola.  I think the pricing is fair.  You definitely won't leave hungry.  LocalDines.com generally offers a $10 for $20 deal.  I highly recommend Ranch House Grille!
