OMG OMG OMG, like, OMG!  This place is great - great food, great presentation, generally enthusiastic service.

My favorite appetizer is the Golden Bags (don't laugh, they're named perfectly in earnest, and they're tasty. Golden Bags are pretty, too).

My favorite dishes here are the basil friend chicken, a salmon dish that I think is called Lady in Green, I don't think I've met a Mint Cafe curry that I didn't like, either.
