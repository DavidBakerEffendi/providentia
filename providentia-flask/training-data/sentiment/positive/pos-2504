This is one of my go to spots when I cant decide on the weekends when I want to go out. For some reason I enjoy this loud, busy, and packed place. Which is always a good thing when your looking for some place to eat right? They have a easy menu and if they don't offer what you want they will work with you. The nova spread with a  garlic bagel is my all time choice along with the mushroom and cheddar omelet which I get "customized". Generally there is a wait time but they normally seat before the time they give you, which gives you a chance to browse around their deli and bakery area- from cheesecake to canolis to giant cookies (peanut butter, chocolate chip, m&m just to make a few) to tiramisu, they basically have everything.
