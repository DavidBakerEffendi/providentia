This is a high class buffet with great service and a rather good price, especially for what you get.  The food is displayed in an appetizing way, and none of it appears or tastes like cheap buffet food I've come to be used to.  Servers come by regularly to check on you, even though they do not have to do much. The staff is friendly and helpful.  Good experience and tasty food.
