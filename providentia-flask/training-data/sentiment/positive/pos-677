OMG , I Found one of the VERY BEST Hot Sausage WITH CHEESE sandwiches that I have EVER tasted. Pizza Italia is a wonderful small business ( and I LOVE Small Buz ! ) You should check with your cardiologist before ordering these fine delicacies. This is a great balance of fine Italian hot sausage with onions and souses.  They even speak Italian to each other !

Pizza-hut can burn in hell ! This is how it should be done !!!
Also , The Prices are very reasonable.
