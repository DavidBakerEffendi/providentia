Lora at Baker Wee made my dream wedding cake; I provided her with a picture and she created an exact replica. Words cannot express how excited I STILL feel about my incredible cake, and how grateful I am for Lora's dedication to perfection in appearance and taste (my gluten-free Aunt ate TWO pieces of it, not because it was gluten-free but because it was that delicious!).  

While it's hard for me to stop raving about the cake that took my breath away, I must say the personalized service and attention I received from Lora and her staff at Baker Wee was just as amazing. I am so grateful that this small, locally owned and operated bakery was available to provide my wedding cake. They even went the extra mile and delivered the cake to my caterer the early morning of my wedding.  And if all this perfection were not enough, it was *incredibly* affordable too. 

I'm so glad I wasn't drawn in my the supposedly fancy and overpriced wedding cake bakeries because Baker Wee exceeded my wildest expectations for a fraction of the cost! A million thanks Lora!
