THE Buffet, yes, the best buffet I've had so far.

Other Vegas buffets so far are not up to the test with luxury: caviar, lamb chop, cod, smoke salmon, gourmet crackers to go with it, etc, even deer! I am not talking about the usual suspects like snow crab, roasted beef, shrimp, those are must haves.

Service also very good, the chefs as well as the waitress, very attentive and takes special care with needs.

Their ethnic food is pretty mediocre, but I dont find any Vegas buffets do it better: Sushi pretty low end, only fresh (I didnt touch them so dont know how they taste); Chinese so not authenticate (Caesars have them beaten with very good porridge), might be very good American Chinese but seriously not authentic; Mexicans/European I didnt bother (Caesars again seem more authentic), pastry is top notch for my liking but family all agree Caesars have them beaten (in cuteness, in taste, etc).

One thing to warn people to stay away from is the lunch/brunch, very mediocre, waste of money, dinner is THE Buffet. Again, from meat lovers perspective.
