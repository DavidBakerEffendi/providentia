Came here for yum cha. Nice place, good service. Very pricey. But portions are big and the food was good. Would come back. Want to try the special everyone is talking about before 11:30am. 

Also had my engagement reception here with family. They manager that I worked with was nice, accommodating and gave me a good price. The device that day was good and food was decent. I did however over stock the the tables, so food was portions wasn't as big(for 12 people but would be good for 8-10) but with $525 a table it was not bad. Would come back for 10 course meal again but will reconsider the portion size and number of people different Ly next time :) 

Love the decor of the tables and chairs... Maybe it's just me, everything was a shade of purple and I loved it. I didn't even have to ask for it :) their decor outside in the hallway is nice for group pictures :) flower covered heart shaped  gate was a very nice place for after meal group photo op.
