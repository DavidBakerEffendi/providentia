This is one of the most beautiful places in Scottsdale!!

They have indoor and outdoor seating with great views of Camelback mountain.  I went once and sit inside and it is fine dining and great service. We got the Hummus and veggie appetizer and all the veggies were so fresh!!

The second time we sat outside and it was a little chilly so they brought all the ladies blankets. How nice!

The food is always fantastic here! Very great pork.

This place is expensive, but well worth it for a celebration. It is great for showing out of town guests what Scottsdale is like. They have a beautiful section out back lined with trees where I think they hold events/weddings and such.  

So beautiful! I'll be back again soon!
