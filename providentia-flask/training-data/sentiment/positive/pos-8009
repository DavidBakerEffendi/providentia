I used to come here all the time when I was a student at UNLV. Since I graduated & rarely on this side of town, it's been forever since I've been back.

But 5yrs later, their sandwiches are still delicious & STILL around the $3 price range.. SCORE!!!

I got my sandwiches to-go, and the gentleman making them was super nice & helpful. They make the sandwiches right in front of you from scratch, which is a plus knowing that it's fresh.

I even bought sandwiches for my sis & bro-in-law, and they're now fans! We can't wait to come back & buy a bunch of sandwiches to bring home.. haha

Good sandwiches for ridiculously low prices = AWESOME =)
