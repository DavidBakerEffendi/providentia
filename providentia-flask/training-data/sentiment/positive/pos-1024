The five stars is for the fantastic panang curry.  I cannot wait to order this again and I still have left overs in my fridge.  The crazy noodle was okay but the panang was so much better that I'll explore different menu items in search of something as good.  The crazy noodle didn't stand a chance against the perfectly seasoned curry.  The restaurant has a nicer ambiance than most Cleveland thai establishments. Entrees were between 11 and 18$, the specialty items on the higher end and the typical curries, noodles, rice dishes on the lower end.  Be careful about arriving here just 30 minutes to close because one time they said it was too late to order anything but carry out.
