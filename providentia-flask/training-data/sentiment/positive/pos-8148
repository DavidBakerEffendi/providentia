Love this little Greek spot.  Most days you'll find the owner, Nick, running the register.  Nick is super friendly and always generates a conversation with his customers.  Actually the entire customer experience is great as everyone here is really nice. 

The food is consistently great.  I have tried several items, but my go to is the Mezze Platter which includes spinach pies, dolmades, tzatziki, feta, olives, hummus, cucumbers and pita.  Only $8.95 for all this!!

For the gluten allergy people, any sandwich on the menu can be made into a lettuce wrap.  Also pita pizza, burger or chicken fingers for the little ones that may not like the regular menu. 

This place easily gets and deserves 5 stars.
