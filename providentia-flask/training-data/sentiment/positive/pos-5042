Wow, color me surprised. I was expecting another charbucks/phoenix coffee cookie-cutter place. This blows UH-Arabica out of the water without a fight.

My date and I spend 2 hours playing chess while the barista hung out and had oranges and beans cooking on the fireplace. The time flew by. An enclave of peace and warmth.

The coffee was good (if a little cold) at 7:00p, and my date loved her tea. She said the date filled pastry left something to be desired.

But I have not seen a coffee house of this caliber since leaving the West Coast. Everything in the place feels "organic." It is like wandering into David the Gnome's tree and hanging out.

I wish, as Chris said, I found this place earlier into my time at CWRU.

Just an excellent tea/coffee house nestled away with a toasty fire and good music playing.

I'll be in back playing chess if you need me from now on. Shall we play a game?
