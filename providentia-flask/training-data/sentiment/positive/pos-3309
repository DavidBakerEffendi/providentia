Wanted to try this place for awhile and I'm glad we did. Danae has exceptional customer service, and helped us figure out the menu. So we ordered a 20 of boneless wings, large fries, Texas toast and 3 sauces. We tried 4 different types of wings Cajun, lemon pepper, bbq and medium buffalo. Let me tell you the food was delicious, fries were yummy and the wings were freaking huge.

The boneless wings are seriously like mini chicken tenders. We only ate 8 of them between the two of us. They are like this size of tennis balls just a lil flattened out. Super yummy though. And they are breaded in potato chips instead of normal four. They have a lil crunch to them but are very delicious. But they also make the flour ones as well you just have to request it. 

For two Adults, we only ate 8 wings lol so a family of four would be fine with a 20 piece. My eyes are bigger than my stomach but trust me 4 per person was enough with fries. 

Everything is priced great here. They give you huge portions for the food you order. And I love that. This place puts wing stop and Buffalo Wild Wings to shame. Try it out and I promise you won't be disappointed.
