Diamond in the rough. Don't let the location deter you, this Japanese grill is not to be missed. It is located in the North West corner of Pecos and Tropicana- across Trop from Sprouts and behind Dunkin Donuts. Interior is quaint, clean, casual. Superb service- owner is the server. Chef came out during our meal to greet us - traditional Japanese-style bows and all. Menu is tapas-like with no dish more than $9. Servings are generous. Sapporo on tap, lengthy list of sake. My husband and I shared: Coconut shrimp, screaming-O, kimchi taco sashimi, dynamite, broiled green muscles, bacon wrapped enoki, garlic calamari, yellowtail carpaccio, and ika yaki. Will definitely return to try more of the menu! Highly recommend a trip to Yatai!
