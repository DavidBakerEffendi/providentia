Okay.... Soo. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of breakfast food. I usually end up being hungry after breakfast so I tend to avoid diners. BUT, my cousin strongly recommended Gus's so I humored him. By his recommendation I also order the gyro sandwich. Wow! Let me tell you... It was pretty frickin good! Arguably one of the best gyros I've had. Ever. And I've been to Greece. As if having an amazing gyro wasn't enough, the chicken noodle soup I ordered was the BoMb!! Salty and noodley just the way I love it. 
I would come again. 
I would recommend to a friend. 
I would get fat if I lived next door.
