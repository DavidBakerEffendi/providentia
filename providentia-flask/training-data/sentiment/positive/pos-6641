Had another good meal here.  We tried the green curry chicken which was very tasty.   I also had the cashew chicken whxih was good too,  with a nice sesame flavour to it.  But they were both huge,  big meals for one person and certainly for lunch.  You could share these meals.  We also had the spring rolls to start which I like,  they're not greasy and very tasty.
