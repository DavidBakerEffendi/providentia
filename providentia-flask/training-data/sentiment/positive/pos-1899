Great new North Shore bar!

Some co workers and I decided to check out this new addition to the North Shore, It just opened this month and is located in part of the former Firewater's North Shore Saloon across from PNC Park. They are open daily from 11 to 2am. With about 20 flat screens on the wall they are a great place to catch the game. They offer a ton of different drafts and great specialty cocktails. My favorite so far is the Thai Coconut Tea. Simply delicious!

They offer some type of drink special Monday through Friday. Food choices include all of the bar staples, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, wings, sliders, fried shrimp, fries and much more. I haven't had a chance to try any of the food yet but, I can't wait to try some.

All in all they are a great addition to the much needed bar scene on the North Shore.
