The service was excellent. 

It is an "old school" kinda place. Nothing trendy here. 

The food was top notch. 

We went to Yolies because we heard they had an ala carte menu as well as an all you can eat sample menu. My husband never eats much at one time. So he ordered the porterhouse. The waiter told him that the rib-eyes were the way to go. He was right. The steak my husband had was perfect. 

I had the sample menu.  I couldn't have been more impressed.
