Amazing, outstanding, should I keep going this restaurant not only has a fabulous name but it makes the best egg and bacon sandwich I have ever experienced. The clerk was a fantastic host explaining the name and some of the history of their restaurant. Then gave her recommendations, which is the egg and bacon sandwich. It comes on a fluffy roll and the egg looks like that in their pictures.
