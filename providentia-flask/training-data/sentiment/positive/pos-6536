Lotus was closed due to renovations and we were severely bummed but one bite of the pad see ew at
Chada and we said Lotus Schmotus.

Sweet sassy molassy is the pad see ew here good. Quite possibly the best pad see ew I've had and I eat
Thai food frequently. Look, I like the Thai food that's $7 in Hollywood and that's super legit. The valley has some great places too. Glendale has my favorite Thai Food Express. But man oh man did the pad see ew here take me to church. 

They do subtle things that end up making a big impact. Bell peppers, fresh veggies with broccoli and Chinese broccoli. The sauce is fortified and ample with a sweet soy and a mixture of other concoctions that my palate wasn't able to discern but it all worked. Flat wide noodles were buttery. I am literally salivating writing this.

I asked a friend in Vegas to bring me back some and that's how much I liked this place. It's next to a karaoke bar and is open late so you just dodge the people drunkenly collapsing outside the bar and get in here. The crab curry was good too and rich in flavor but a mere afterthought to the noodle dishes here.
