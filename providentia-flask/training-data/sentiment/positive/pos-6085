I cant say enough good things about this place! I have been coming here for well over  a year with my boyfriend. The first time we came was just to have a drink after we had  dinner across the street. As we sat at the bar we noticed all the lights go out at the restaurant we ate at. We realized our car keys were still there because we did valet. As we rushed to pay our tab and get to our car the server asked what was wrong. We explained our situation and before we knew it he was across the street knocking on the door! We got over and he was already in the restaurant explaining our situation! We got our keys and have been coming into Olivor Twist ever since. I actually called the management the next day to tell them how helpful he was, he really went out of his way. We love happy hour and the half price pizzas are awesome. By the way the servers name is Tim and he makes a mean martini!! All of the staff is friendly and I have never had a bad experience here.
