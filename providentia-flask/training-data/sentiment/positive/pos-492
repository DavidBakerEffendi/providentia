The place was recommended to my boyfriend by a friend, our reservation was pretty late therefore is was fairly quiet but at no point did we feel rushed. The food was unbelievable, I had a pasta special with butter and shaved truffle. It was the best pasta dish I have had in a long time, maybe ever.

Highly recommend this place and we will be returning.
