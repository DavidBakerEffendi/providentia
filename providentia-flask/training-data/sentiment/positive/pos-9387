I've always wanted to try the food but the location in downtown Los Angeles always has a long line. It was my lucky day because this location didn't have anyone in line. I ordered the cheeseburger sandwich, it took about 5 minutes to get my food. Once I took a look at my sandwich I knew I would enjoy it, the first bite had me in heaven, really good food. Now I want to try the other items on their menu.
