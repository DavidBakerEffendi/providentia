If someone kept putting La Sem's Tiramisu in front of me, I would keep eating it until my stomach exploded. I would literally be unable to stop myself even with my life on the line. With every bite, you feel like it is your first. The flavour is so amazing, you just do not tire of the taste.  

They do make a variety of other cakes as well. All that I have tried have been, as I have mentioned before, to die for. There is also a nice selection of fresh pastries ready for you to choose from if you happen to stop by to fill that sudden craving for sweets.

This place has easily become one of my favourite joints for cakes, and it will just as easily become yours.
