Not sure why the bad reviews? 

I'm Asian, have a pregnant white girlfriend and we love this place. VERY good service, respectful of Groupon deal. Chill atmosphere and casual. They play indie Electronica in the background at  relatively low volume making the experience pretty good. 

Decor is wonderful, the lights or a mixture of red, blue and white. 

Will add more to this review later.
