I know, I know....a five star for a chain restaurant. But seriously the steaks are absolutely delicious here.  Sure it's not Ruth Chris served with sizzling butter....but there are two "made from scratch" sides always included! Their steaks are always prepared exactly how I ask, very little fat,  juicy and thick.  The 6 oz  sirloin is pretty close to the tenderness of a filet. 

We ate here on a Thursday night, arriving at 5:30 and it was pretty crowded.  We chose to eat at the bar, which was great because we got excellent service and met a few interesting people. 

As soon as we sat down, we had delicious hot rolls and cinnamon butter sitting in front of us. So good, you can't keep them full in the basket.  Also a big bucket of peanuts at the bar will keep you busy while cracking them open. We ordered ribs for an appetizer which were crazy delish, falling off the bone smothered with a really nice mild bbq sauce, which didn't over power the smokiness of the ribs.  

We both ordered the 6 oz sirloin, mine with baked potato and Caesar salad and my husbands with baked potato and a salad with honey mustard dressing. Caesar's was tasty and the dressing was spot on. The steaks were perfect....wonderful and flavorful.  If you order extra toppings for your baked potato  (bacon, cheese, sour cream)...they charge with out telling you. 

Come Monday thru Thursday before 6pm for dinner and you can get their early bird special and save some $$$ that you can use towards their Legendary Margaritas :)

We always return to this location. Quality food, superb service, fun atmosphere.
