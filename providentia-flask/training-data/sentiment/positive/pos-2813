El Chorro sits right on the backside of Camelback mountain and has a southwestern decor and gorgeous patio.  Casual dress or a nice dress could be worn here.  The menu has a variety of options.  We started off with a shrimp pot dish and it was deelish.  My entree was trout almondine with green beans ( ordered a separate side of scalloped potatoes also)  My dish was prepared perfectly and didn't walk out feeling overly stuffed (like my usual) so I felt pretty good about myself for having the self discipline to not order a dessert.  Sit on the patio if you can!!!!
