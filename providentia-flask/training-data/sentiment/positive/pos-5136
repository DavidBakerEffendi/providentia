This place has some of the best brick oven pizza around!  Not to discount the salads because they are awesome too, but the pizza is where it is at.   Came here today for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I had the Emiliana salad which has Arugula, Baby Greens, Red Onions, Red Peppers, Pine Nuts, and Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano with a Balsamic Vinaigrette.  I also got the Americana pizza which has Tomato Sauce, House-Made Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Parmigiano Reggiano... it was awesome!  I have also had the Margherita pizza which is very good too.  The ingredients are all fresh and so tasty... I would definitely recommend this place to you!
I love to come here and have a great glass of wine along with my pizza but today is a work day so I could not have a glass of wine:(.  I will be back!
