Everyone I know raves about this place and now I know why. The service was wonderful - super friendly and helpful. The coffee excellent and the food fabulous! The lemon blueberry French toast was superb! My kids loved the hash browns and Mickey Mouse pancakes too.

The only negative is that it is super loud but everything else makes up for that.
