So this was my 2nd time trying Pho in my life. Honestly the first time was a let down at Little Saigon in Glendale. But Pho 602 made me a believer and a future consumer. It was just delicious plain and simple. The broth itself was packed with flavor, an explosion of flavor and im not exaggerating. Then throw the noodles and makes it a better dish. The noodles were soft and chewy and gave a good taste to the broth. Put the veggies and it adds the fresh factor. Throw in the meats and man do you have way more flavor. its just crazy how much flavor these guys can pack on their Pho. 

I got the #1 which is a combination of most meats. Round eye, flank steak, brisket, tendon, tripe and meat balls. I was disappointed it only had a tiny piece of tendon. Other than that it was a good amount of meat. 

Note - I've been sick with an infection and I don't know it was just coincidence and antibiotics just kicked in or the Pho helped out and jumpstarted me because i felt GREAT after eating these(not 100% but still with more energy).
