The door had a sticker proudly saying that people love them on Yelp. So my friend and I decided to confirm that. We surely were not disappointed for doing so! The place is exceptionally clean and tidy. I ordered smoked salmon crepe and she ordered chicken crepe. Both were fresh and tasty. Quiet music playing in the background. Free WiFi. Service is exceptional, staff clearly love working here. Will surely come back for more.
