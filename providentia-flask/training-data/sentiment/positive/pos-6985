It's simple..forget Hot & Juicy, this place which is right across the street is the BOMB! I used to be a regular at H&J but no more. First & formost our server Chris was very accommodating, it was our first time here & we had a lot of questions. She answered them all without making us feel stupid. 
We ordered a combo meal with king crab, shrimp, & Crawfish. And the sauce was the house special sauce called urban mix or something like that. I was going to do it mild  spice but because I told her that, she suggested that I do no spice. I'm glad I did because it was perfect! It was savory & spicy enough for my taste level. I also ordered the alligator & fries basket. They were both great. The fries were crispy & alligator was great. She also told us about their fried rice. I'm glad I got that. Most restaurants out in Vegas make it very dry. This was perfect & tasty. Didn't even need you sauce.
And I was only going to get water but she also told us that they have young coconut. I didn't know what that was, but upon further explanation, I was told that it's a coconut with the top cut off. You can drink it! Pretty awesome. 
Chris came back during our meal & took care of us. They were a little busy but I felt that we weren't being rushed out of there. Great food & perfect service.
