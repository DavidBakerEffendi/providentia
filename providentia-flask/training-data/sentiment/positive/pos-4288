Excellent service by Lupita she was so friendly and very helpful. The food beat our expectations. Fish tacos made with homemade tortillas were mouth watering. The Delicioso was delicioso! The size of the gulf shrimp were huge. Expect to take home left overs. We had the regular large margaritas and they were perfect. We were told they are $5.00 for happy hour Monday thru Friday. This is a Texas restaurant chain and happy it's the first in Vegas. We will be back!
