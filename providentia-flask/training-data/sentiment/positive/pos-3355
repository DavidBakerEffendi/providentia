Classic NY Style pizza! Definitely on my top 3 favorite pizza places in Charlotte. They have fun and unique topping arrangements but even the boring old classic pepperoni is fantastic. 

Great spot for big groups since the market is set up with an extremely open plan. 

LOCATION TIP: Pure is inside of the 7th Street Public Market. An easy place to park is the deck located between Brixx & Queen City Q.
