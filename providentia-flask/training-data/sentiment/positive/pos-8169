Update: I previously had written a review on an unpleasant experience that I had on an incorrect charge. Ownership reached out to me and resolved the issue in a professional manner. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to me and help me with this!

Just had the worst experience at this restaurant. Read the menu and ask questions about the pizzas to see if there is extra charges before ordering. This was my first time there and I did not know that a specialty pizza was only thin crust, instead I ordered it with stuffed thinking that you can order any pizza with different crusts. I got charged an extra 17$ on top of the 16$ build your own pizza charge!!! Outrageous. The manager did not seem to care that I would not be coming back either.
