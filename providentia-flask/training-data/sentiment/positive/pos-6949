We typically don't like to go off of our beaten path for our food. But husband had an insane craving for steak and eggs. He googled, "Best steak and eggs in Henderson" and he came across Rise and Shine. Let's just say HOT DAMN! The ribeye and eggs were delectable. The ribeye is rubbed in coffee grounds and it was sooo juicy and flavorful. I had the Lox and Cream cheese omelet. I never thought I would enjoy capers in my eggs but wow! This location is the first that serves alcohol and I had the pleasure of trying their sake Bloody Mary. It was light and full of flavor. 
Our server, Dane, was informative and super friendly. He kept up on all of our needs and made us feel comfortable. 
We will definitely be coming back. Maybe even tomorrow. :)
