This place is awesome! Absolutely amazing! Plenty of hot queen crab legs. Went around 5pm and got right in, no wait at all. The ice cream is incredible and the Brazilian chicken wings are now a new favorite for me. Besides coming back for the crab legs I would definitely come back just for the Brazilian chicken. Wait staff was polite and on top of drinks and plates. We will be back soon!!! Thank you for a great memorable dinner.
