Pickle barrel is always a favourite for me. They update their menu with even more variety of foods. Loved it. Spacious so not much wait for a table esp since its at yorkdale so it's probably always packed. Service was good as they kept on asking every once in awhile to check if everything was good. I wouldn't expect that much when it's prime dinner time. Huge portions tho. Tbh, it is like a cheaper version of Joey's.
