The first hint about this place is the name of the restaurant--if you're in a sake sushi bar, expect to drink. This place is super awesome for groups of people who is looking to spend the night drinking. Keep ordering the drinks the free food just keeps coming. We were stuffed with alcohol and yummy eats by the end of the night.

Now my knowledge of the Japanese and Korean culture doesn't seem to be up to par, because things here get me a bit confused. The place is in Korea Town, the name is Japanese, the people who work there is japanese, the menu has japanese, but the side dishes that come, the combinations of alcohol and food, dishes like pancakes and fire chicken is pretty Korean. 

Not that it matters, because you're not here to be a "foodie", you're here to drink, and then eat yummy whatever food they bring you. The sushi is actually pretty good. The sashimi pretty fresh too. Like someone said below, you can get a 30 piece sashimi+5 beers and a ton of side dishes for $32--why not?

The servers here are super polite, super pretty, and super efficient. For someone's birthday, the had a cake (sashimi cake?) and they flickered the lights on and off and happy birthday music played. Pretty funny.

Honestly, great place for a night out in town.
