Shocked at the reviews- this chicken was SOO GOOD and the location was just as great. It's a clean, open space that's very pretty inside. Their staff was extremely helpful with ordering, preparing and delivering. They even had someone help us clean up! It wasn't what I expected, it was better than expected. I tried the black and blue burger for January and it was BOMB DOT COM. Can't wait to go back for the February love bird sand which!
