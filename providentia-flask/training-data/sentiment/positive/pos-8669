This steakhouse is a hidden secret, and is spectacular. I would recommend this steakhouse to anyone wanting fine dining at reasonable prices. This is Not a stuffy stuck up location that treats you poorly if you don't order alcohol. We had an excellent meal with great service from Steve Wilson. Thank you for an excellent meal at reasonable prices. The new york steak was excellent, as was the prime rib.
