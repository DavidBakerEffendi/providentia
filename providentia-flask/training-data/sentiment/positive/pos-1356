Get the palaak paneer.  Seriously.  I cannot emphasize this enough; I don't go anywhere else when I'm craving it.  If that were its only redeeming quality, I would still give the place 3 stars!  However, the rest of the food is also fantastic.  They're excellent at adjusting the temperature of the food for whatever suits your palate (which is great since I'm a weakling but my boyfriend likes things extra super spicy).  

The garlic naan is awesome, and a staple of our visits in addition to the palaak paneer.  We usually order a lamb dish and a chicken dish along with the rice, and trust me there's leftovers each time.  The vegetable pakora is great, as well, and I've enjoyed several of their other vegetarian dishes from time to time.  

I can't speak to the authenticity of the place, as I've never been to India, but I can speak to what tastes great, and this place is it!
