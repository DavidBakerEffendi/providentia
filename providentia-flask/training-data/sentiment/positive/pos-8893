Definitely this place needs multiple visits. Very unique options on the menu.
Ordered -
Cauliflower Tacos : tasted really good and portion is meal perfect. Cauliflowers are deep fried and not too oily which is what I like. Topped with pumpkin seeds and tad of tangy lime. Not the best taco I had but outstands many.
Horchatta : not a espresso fan, but I kinda liked it. 

Great ambience, Cool interior design and well maintained hygiene. Totally worth multiple tries.
