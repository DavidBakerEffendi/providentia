I really like this A&W's, the burgers are consistently good here. The staff are friendly (one girl was a little umm...uneducated but that's fine). Most are polite and go above and beyond to help the customer. 
They allowed us to have refills on our root beer, gave us some a&w seasoning to go, the food was presented well and it was delicious.

My boyfriend always wants to go here. He is obsessed with their seasoning, sweet potato fries, and poppa burgers.

I enjoy going here as well. He's new to A&W's (first time was this year), so he's obsessed with it and especially this one as the food is consistently good and the staff is nice.
