This place is terrific!  Make sure you are having a cheat day from your diet that's for sure.  You walk in and you're greeted by the guy who smokes the meat.  He asks if you've ever been there before and explains the entire set up if you haven't.  You go up to the counter to order and the staff comes out to answer questions about the menu.  They are also well versed in the story of how Piggly's came to be.  Which was great.  We ordered dinner and also a funnel cake to get later.  Our food came up and we were literally in heaven.  This was the best fried food I think I've ever had.  It lives up to its name for sure.  I felt like I was at the fair minus the carnies.  We ate our meal and the woman who took our order came over to make sure we got our funnel cake which we hadn't.  We were really happy to have such great service and yummy food.  We have relayed the great review to friends and they are all lining up to go as well.  This place is a new favorite for us.
