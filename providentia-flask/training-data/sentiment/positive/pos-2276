I LOVE this place-I went to L'Etoile on Friday night and Monty's Blue Plate on Saturday afternoon-guess where I had the better meal?!?  Monty's won by a landslide-a giant bowl of veggie chili, a square of jalapeno corn bread as big as my head and a slice of chocolate rasberry pie a la mode.  It doesn't get much better than this folks!  I cannot wait to go back, I've actually had a dream about that pie!
