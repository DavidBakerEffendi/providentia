Loved it!!!! Food is amazing!!! 

The atmosphere is not very appealing, but the staff and delicious food sure make up for that! 

The staff is friendly and inviting, and our waitress anticipated our needs very well.

The strawberry cream-cheese french toast is an absolute must. I would get all the dressings on the side that way you can add it to your own liking. Also the portions are gigantic! Either come with an empty tummy and big appetite, or share with your friend.
