If you want to know how much people love Gandhi roti, you need look no further than the hell Kat F. went through to come here when she found out it was the same people running this restaurant, only this one is open on weekends. Any restaurant worth 3 different streetcars - and a cab ride - is well worth checking out*.

The food is just as good as Gandhi's - spicy, tasty, and huge. As Kat noted, it's very strange to eat the roti from an actual plate and not out of foil. The dining room was empty - there might have been one other table of people eating there. 

Normally, my motivation for coming to the Big City is to see friends. Since this became a weekend option, my priorities have shifted somewhat... "I can get roti! Uh, with friends!"

* transportation issues due entirely to traffic insanity. On any "normal" day it would have been far easier.
