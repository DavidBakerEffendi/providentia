Many have started out with this and it should be stressed , this wonderful place is TINY! 

Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store. We started with the stuffed mushrooms , like many others raved about, and the Portuguese style mussels. Both were fantastic and left us wanting to come back to try the other mussel offerings and appys as well. The endless bread was the perfect tool for soaking up the rich juices the mussels were bathed in.  

We're we're pretty full, but thought we would take a run at the Espana pizza. Hands down the best pizza we have ever had. The flavor could not be any better and the perfectly created thin crust let you enjoy the toppings as both a compliment and as a way to get it easily into your mouth! 

Feels more like you have been invited to a friend's house for an awesome meal as opposed to a restaurant. Great people and they went to all lengths to make ours and the other patrons meal fantastic (even the entirely needy, hard to please, and somewhat obnoxious woman seated near us)

While I am sure they would make your super comfortable if you had to wait, suggest you  make a reservation so you can enjoy this great little place
