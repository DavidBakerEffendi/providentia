We came here for a little snack while waiting for our coffee on Friday. See my review for Not Just Coffee.

We ordered the individual pulled pork explosion to split between the two of us. Took about 10 minutes to cook and came out right to our table with some slaw on top (just like a pulled pork sandwich).

The pizza was amazing! Decent price and great location.
