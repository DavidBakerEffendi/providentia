Went here again for the second time this past Sunday. I got a third pound bacon burger with American cheese on an onion bun. The burger was delicious just as I had remembered. Topped it with a little ketchup, onion, pickle and mayo and washed it down with a red cream soda. Also split some fried mushrooms and zucchini with a buddy of mine. It's not the fanciest place there is but it's just my style. Was able to watch a little football and have a great burger. Will be going again.
