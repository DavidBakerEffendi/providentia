The new remodel their looks really good. They have added a couple TVs that blast CNN all day. The stop is always friendly and smiling. They have 1 of those awesome New Coke machines with all the flavors. They have daily specials every day, which is a huge plus when you're on a budget. My baby loves their chicken. in my opinion the beat the pants off subway.
