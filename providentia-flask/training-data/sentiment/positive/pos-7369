A gem hiding in Crowfoot!  Finally, really, really great ramen, sushi and sashimi in Crowfoot!  We ordered the following:

- Chef's Special: Red Tuna Maki and Hamachi Maki - both maki rolls were so fresh!  More fish than rice.  

- Endamame - good appy.

- Tonkatsu Ramen - Cloudy broth so tasty and not salty at all!  The ramen was cooked al dente and the bowl came decorated with 2 slices of belly pork, 1 soft-poached egg, halved, 2 square pieces of nori sheets, and some green onions for garnish.  Loved everything in my ramen!  

- Teriyaki Chicken Don - tasty chicken, crispy and covered with teriyaki sauce over white rice, garnished with broccoli.  Yummy chicken!

Great service!  Great food!  Will absolutely be back!
