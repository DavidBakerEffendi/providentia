We ordered the Beef Massaman curry that came with rice and the Chicken Pad see ew (drunken noodle). With Thai tea that is $3 for the regular size and $5 for the large.

The prices are affordable! All the entrees were mostly under $10, can't beat that.

They also do take out and delivery.

Everyone was really friendly, I think the lady that took our order was the owner. She was very attentive to make sure we enjoyed our food.

I asked for a 8 out of 10 spice and I barely even tasted any! So i guess I'll ask for a 10 next time.
