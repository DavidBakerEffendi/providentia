Mmmmm so good! These guys only have 3 things on the menu.  We tried the bao of course and the dry noodles.  Both we excellent! 

The bao is so juicy and has lots of soup, skin is razor thin in top and nice and crusty on the bottom. Filling is all pork, sweet with tasty tasty soup. I had to order another batch!

The dry noodles have a bit of soup on the bottom. Noodles we're cooked perfectly el dente. They are thin ramen type noodles with crushed peanuts, sesame dressing and seaweed. Really good combination!

Will be back to try the third and final menu item, wonton soup!
