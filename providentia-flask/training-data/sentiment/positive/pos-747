Been going to Yoli's since it opened..Love it!  I have been told by friends that they have the best hamburgers, so I finally broke down (since I'm not much of a burger guy) and tried one with skepticism.  I now think they need to change their name from Yoli's to YUMMY'S Cafe! Holy cow (no pun intended) it was Awesome! Has to be the juiciest most flaverful burger I can remember eating. Not sure I can order anything else now.
