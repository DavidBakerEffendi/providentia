Yay love it! Perfect vegan comfort food. The unchicken is soooo good, Love the unchicken burger and the unchicken and waffles plus the fries are fantastic. Dessert is also amazing, we tried both the pie and the chocolate mousse and I don't usually like chocolatey things but this was heavenly! So so so so so tasty. The servers were super friendly plus they have a good selection of beers on tap.
