If I had a friend from overseas come to visit, and he asked me to show him what good American food was like, I know without a doubt this would be the place that I would display to him with great national pride. Actually, I take all my friends who come to visit Madison to Monty's. I once had a friend visiting who was on a very strict diet (gluten free + fasting for lent) with me and she had a good three pages of vegetarian and gluten-free menu to choose from.

This shouldn't scare off those looking for a greasy spoon, however, because you're free to order something at the complete opposite of that spectrum. Bacon grilled cheese, donut french toast, chicken fried steak, alcoholic milkshakes...You name it, they probably have it. My one piece of advice is that you should probably look at the menu ahead of time because it is so expansive that you could spend as much as a half hour just trying to make up your mind.

Be prepared to wait a long time if coming in during the weekend brunch rush. Do not be deterred, it is completely worth every second.

For what it's worth this is probably my #1 favorite restaurant in Madison, if not my favorite restaurant ever.
