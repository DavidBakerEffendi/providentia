For a fast food joint the customer service here rocks.  Got a to-go order and Maria was nice enough to give me a plastic bag so it was easier to carry.  Did she have to? No.  Could she have looked the other way when I had my hands full?  Probably.  Maria, and other Carl's Jr. workers here are making this my to go place for burgers for the service alone.
