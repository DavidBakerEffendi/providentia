While the fountains dazzle us with their graceful movement of water set to music during the day, as well as at night, I have only viewed them at night.  A coincidence only, I assure you.  However, I think it'd be better at night because of the lighting that goes with it.  Beautiful.  Each show, the music changes, and so do the water designs.  Sometimes, it's classical music, sometimes easy listening.  Whatever the case, it's all quite impressive and well worth a few minutes of time to watch.  I can't even count how many times I've seen it, and it never gets tiring.  Oh, and by the way, IT'S FREE !!!!!!!!!!!
