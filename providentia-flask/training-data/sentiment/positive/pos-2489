This place is a staple amongst Korean families, and definitely a hidden gem.  

The lady who runs the restaurant is very kind and polite, and they keep the place cool on hot days (like today).

For a restaurant known for their Beef bone soup, they were QUITE busy on a fiery hot day! All tables packed and a line-up for takeout definitely means something.

I come here regularly and if you're looking for korean soups, this place has the best Haejang guk (hangover soup) and beef bone soup in the city.

Their kakdugi (radish kimchi) is the best too!

Also tried their Galbi for the first time today and it is VERY tasty and meaty, but be warned, their marinade uses lots of sugar (altho super tasty).
