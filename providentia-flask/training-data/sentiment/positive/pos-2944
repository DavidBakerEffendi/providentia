Omg! This restaurant is amazing! It is a little on the pricey side but it is totally worth every penny! Plus you can never go wrong with all you can drink red and white wine. I tried the shrimp Alfredo, lasagna, spaghetti, as well as their salad with salami. It was soo delicious. If you are in Vegas you must try this!
