A cool relaxed townie bar with a nice menu. Some awesome stuff:

-At least one good drink and food special daily. Tons of lunch specials for $5.49, with the menu having nice variety. Lots of traditional bar snacks, good wings, awesome nachos, and lots of healthy things too, like the house made hummus and veggie plate, caprese wrap, salads and fresh sandwiches and burgers.

-lots of games here, pool (upstairs) golden tee, cornhole (tournaments weekly) and a couple sweepstakes machines.

-excellent patio area, and dogs are welcome, so feel free to bring your pup out with you (they need to stay on their leash though). The patio fills up quick before cornhole tournaments so arrive early for a good spot!

I used to have some major beef with an awful witch bartender who used to work here. I talked to a regular about this a little while ago and found out she no longer works here. Five stars!!!
