This place is amazing.  I can't believe I didn't find it sooner!  

The most noticeable thing is the service.  Literally if you take one sip of your water there is an entire team of people walking around that will make sure your water glass never gets below completely full.

The food is quick and absolutely delicious.  I didn't try anything I didn't like.  And their menu goes on for days!  I had the coconut curry with tofu and I could literally eat it every day of the week.  Wow.  My fianc√© got the lemongrass chicken and it was beautiful.

Vietnamese desserts are my absolute favorite and Lang Van did not disappoint!!  They brought out a handful of "cookies" with the check.  ~the end to a perfect meal~

We brought our own wine and I don't even think they charged us a corkage fee.

Overall - love love love.  Cannot wait to go back.  The noms are strong with this one.
