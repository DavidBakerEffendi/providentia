Hands down my favorite Indian restaurant in the East Valley.  The garlic naan is better than anywhere else, and the palak paneer and aloo palak are unmatched.  Portions are average to above average for the price.

Waiters never leave your water glass empty.  The servers used to be very polite but a bit severe and serious, lately they seem friendlier and more open.  Regardless, the food is wonderful and I highly recommend.
