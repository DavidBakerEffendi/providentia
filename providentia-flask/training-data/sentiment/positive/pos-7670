Fantastic spot.  This is one of those restaurants that will be a staple, if it isn't already.  
I travel a lot and America has become a stamp over and over.  Same, same, same.  
This is different.
My experience was that it brings several different cultural experiences together and makes you break social barriers.  Go here with people you don't know well and watch what happens.
Flavors are familiar yet new.
