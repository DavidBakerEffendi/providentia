Sitting at the house on a Sunday afternoon with some of my other sushi loving friends and the plan was to BBQ some steaks that night and have a few drinks... Somewhere in this mix the idea of going to sushi came up, and then somewhere in that mix the idea of me just making sushi came up. Okay, so now that the dinner plans had officially been established I had to run to the store to get the things I was missing. Yes smiths and albertsons are right by my house but I have heard great things about the selection here but again it is just sooooo far from my house. 10 or so minutes later I was in the car on my way to Greenland Supermarket. This was in no way a mistake... what a selection, and the fresh fish market is amazing. They had everything I needed and much much more. I have always wanted to have a market I can go to and get Sashimi grade fish and it is finally possible.
