Tried the second floor with my boyfriend and his parents on Sunday. Wow!!! It was amazing!! To start we had the meat and cheese board. I do not care for meat but they said it was so good and cleared almost the whole board. The presentation to the little information the girl presented when she came out was perfect. Our server was also beyond amazing, I wish I remembered his name, :( !! Well he was great and he had a new girl training with him she was doing a nice job as well. They cleared our silverware between each course and were tip top on refilling my iced tea. For dinner we shared some pizza, the Margherita and hot sausage/potato. The Margherita was probably the best I have ever had. I'm not sure which floor is better the meatballs or the pizza..? So try and find out for yourself!!! :)
