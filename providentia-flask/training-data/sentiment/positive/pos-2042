I think they have at least 2 locations (not sure which one this is), but regardless both are really good.  Good food, good atmosphere. The menu is simple and short and not pretentious.  Fun young staff. This place is sort of in line with The VIG restaurants. If you like The VIG you'll probably like this place.
