Hubby brought me for my birthday weekend...LOVE!  I tried the chicken adobo and eggs and hubby had the longsilog.  Everything was delicious as usual.  The menu has grown since our last visit, plus they are now open for dinner during the week - now there are so many other things to try here! Chef Matt came by and hubby needed some extra rice for his meal (you know how us Filipinos are)...other than that, we let him know everything was delicious.  I love how creative and tasty his dishes are, and it saddens me to see so many others try to bash this place.  Hoping to be back soon to dry the Peruvian Lomo Saltado and the Bento.  This is the only place that we always finish our meals at the restaurant.  I absolutely LOVE this place.
