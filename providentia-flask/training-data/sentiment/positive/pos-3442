I was going to try the ballantyne location but recently moved closer to the steel creek location so I tried it today for the first time. I took a minute to look over the menu and decided on a bologna egg and cheese, a hash cake and a chocolate chocolate donut.  

When I approached the counter I was quickly greeted by the cashier and ordering was easy.  I received my donut immediately and the biscuit and hash cake took no more than 3-5 mins tops, and was fresh and hot when I received it.  

Biscuit was excellent I would put it a step above fast food biscuits for sure, there were 3 larger slices of Bologna that hung over the biscuit and the egg was fresh fried and cooked perfectly.  

The hash cake was good but a little small for the price and a bit oily so I set it on a few napkins for a couple mins before I tried it, it's a conglomeration of hash browns, cheese, and what appeared to be some herbs or seasoning of some kind and is deep fried, it was good but lacked a little flavor overall, maybe needed a pinch of salt. 

The chocolate chocolate donut was a cake donut with a little frosting to hold on top the chocolate crumbles, and it was a damn good donut, it was moist and tender, not dense like some cake donuts can be.  

I was greeted by the owner and asked how I enjoyed my breakfast and I spoke with him for a few minutes, he was very nice and helpful.  I will be back
