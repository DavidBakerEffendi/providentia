Decided to try this after reading a review in Phoenix magazine.  Went on a Saturday morning.  It is a huge place - lots of outdoor seating - will take the pooch next time, a bar area (no-one was sitting there) and a normal restaurant  area that was busy.  They have a big menu, with a mix of southern and mexican influences.  I had an omelette with cheese and ham, potatoes and an english muffin.  My partner had, eggs, biscuit and potatoes,  The omelet was awesome and so was the biscuit (freshly baked in house).  My only comment would be the specials on the board may have been a little bit pricey.  Also, this place will be a word of mouth place due to its location, not really on a main street, but worth locating.  The staff were super friendly.  We will be back.  Lots of bike racks too (we cycled)
