REVIEW UPDATE:

Ok, I've been here many, many times since I first wrote my review, and the place just gets better and better.  Dinner is now regularly served, the outdoor patio is open, and the Baristas and Bartenders have clearly hit their stride.  Let us hope that Barista Jeff and Bartender Josh continue to rule the beans and the booze for many years to come.  These fellas are seriously at the top of their game, and extraordinarily personable.

I originally complained a bit about my lattes being a tad too "wet" with milk, but those concerns have completely evaporated.   In fact, all coffee drinks (save one) are downright splendid, and I really appreciate the uniformity of quality I get from one day to the next.  The one and only coffee drink that lies south of perfection for me is the frozen/blended mocha-ish one.   I taste some granulation in there.  Its not unpleasant at all, but detracts from the smooth "blendiness" that one hopes to experience when buying a drink to stave off the imperial Phoenix summer sunshine.

The place continues to avoid pretentiousness, trendiness, kitsch and gimmicks,  and that "institutional confidence" in their atmosphere and product is reflected in both their staff and service.  Now THAT is rare, and worth a trip from wherever you may be in the Valley!

The prosciutto-fig-marscapone sandwich?  Yeah, that's really good.  Where's the button for 6 stars for that?
