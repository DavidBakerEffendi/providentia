Just a heads up they are now  sadly , closed. :(
This is little strip mall is dangerous to the waistline... there is Bistro pizza and a great cupcake place right next door. 
 The owners are super nice and down to earth and generous. The cupcakes and gooey bars are awesome. She also makes breads and cake pops, They ran out of pumpkin when we were last there. ( Someday!!!! :)
 Nice homemade taste. Nothing tastes like it came from a box, it tastes as if someone had been working very hard to please your taste buds. The efforts pay off, never been disappointed. 
Cute little place with a family friendly touch, some artsy fun gift items and aprons for sale too.
 Worth the trip, worthy of the treat.
