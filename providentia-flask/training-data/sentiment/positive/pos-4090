I went to Panda Express with my wife today for a late lunch and much to my happiness everything was wonderful We were served by a wonderful woman who introduced herself as Yanti who was the GM of the location She made all fresh food for us that was hot and tasty She made our whole experience so pleasant if felt like I was dining at a 5 star restaurant not a fast food take out one All her employees came across as very happy to be there and as a customer you could feel the wonderfully pleasing atmosphere inside this Panda Express
