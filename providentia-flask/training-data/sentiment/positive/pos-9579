Wowsers! This place has been on our radar for awhile as we drive by often. It was my birthday and hubs wanted to surprise me with a nice meal out - The bread was warm, fresh & awesome. , The service was impeccable and that lobster carbonara is what fresh pasta & lobster dreams are made of. It was lick-the-plate good. Hubby got a filet and it came out cooked perfectly (which is often hard for steakhouses to do on a Friday night). The kiddo devoured the lobster Mac & cheese (though I have to say relative to everything else, this was my least favorite bite). I give extra kudos to the touch of offering some fresh individually packed coffee cakes for the next morning. Brilliant marketing and brand reinforcement right there - as we were clearly thinking of them and talking about our experience around the breakfast table the next morning. (Smart marketing that others could learn from). The coffee cake was delicious as well... we will be back for sure.
