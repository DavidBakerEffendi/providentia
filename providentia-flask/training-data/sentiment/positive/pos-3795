It's not often that I give a chain restaurant a 5-star review but this place truly deserves it.

This is a custom pizza (or salad) joint sort of on the lines of chipotle. You choose a base option from their menu or design your own. They have a line that adds whatever toppings you want. Additional toppings for your pizza do not cost extra! Yay! But your options are pretty basic, standard pizza toppings with a few odd ball ones thrown in.

Ater your pizza is made, it is sent to the oven and this is not your conveyer belt oven like some other pizza chains use. This is a gas fired oven where your pizza is monitored by an attendant. 

For drinks, they have your typical tea and soda but also offer lemonade, craft beer and a few other specialty drinks.

Service is where this place shines. You are greeted as you walk in the door and everyone is friendly and helpful. On my most recent trip, they noticed something wrong with my coworker's pizza and put it back in the oven and offered him some garlic sticks while he waited. Then they brought the pizza out to him.

Their pizzas taste great. They have a flavorful red sauce. But I would skip the garlic sticks. They were a bit disappointing.
