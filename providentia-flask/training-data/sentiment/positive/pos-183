My wife and I, along with a friend were excited to try a new dining spot.  We were not disappointed.  Located between Grimaldi's Pizzeria and The Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park this location is sure to garner a lot of attention.  We started with a couple of appetizers.  I especially enjoyed the Crispy Brussel Sprouts, $8.77.  I highly recommend this dish.  My wife tried the Roasted Tomato Bruschetta, $8.77 and she enjoyed it.  Also, I tried their Roasted Beet & Kale Salad, $12.77.  This was very good.  However, I did not care for the Burrata in this salad.  My wife had the Wild Pacific Halibut.  At $29.99 I though this to be a bit pricey.  However, my wife loved this entr√©e.  It was cooked perfectly and she can't wait to have this again.  In addition, I ordered the Crab & Shrimp Cake Sliders, $12.77.  I felt they missed the "meat to bread ratio" with this item.  Service was exemplary.  Three points of interest.  One, the "style" of ordering off the menu is quite different.  The first time is a little confusing.  Two, the drink menu comes in the form of an iPad.  I know this is the future, but I found it time consuming.  Also, they only provide one per table.  I much prefer an old fashioned paper menu, or at the very least provide one iPad per customer.  Three, they have a nice happy hour.  Bottom line, we are looking forward to going back and trying other items on their menu.
