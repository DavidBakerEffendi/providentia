Love love love it!!!! I feel like I had breakfast in a house w a white picket fence. Great decor. It's such a cozy place I absolutely had a great time. The mimosa was only 5 bucks and breakfast combo 10 for huge portion of eggs sausage and potatoes. Service was very chill and friendly. They have the nice side patio which is great to sit at on warm days. Great bang for your buck.. Does not disappoint
