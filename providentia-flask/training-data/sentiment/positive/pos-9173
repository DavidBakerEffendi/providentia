I wish I could eat here everyday! My coworker and I decided to try this little restaurant beat our office. We were not disappointed! I ordered the curry chicken, which fell right off the bone and was delicious with potatoes in the curry. I also had the "rice and peas" which is rice with some beans in there, also delicious. We had sides of plantains, perfectly cooked. They have other dishes I'd love to try, such as deep fried cornbread, jerk chicken, and a selection of Jamaican beers. We checked in on yelp and received 10% off. Definitely try this restaurant! They have a much more extensive menu than the picture of the menu that's here on yelp.
