It doesn't get better than this.  This place has become our weekend hang-out.  The friends and I love this place for more than one reason. #1.  Great tacos #2 Great customer service, the waitresses go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need.  #3 EXCELLENT KARAOKE from Wednesday-Sunday!!! We can sing all night long to pretty much anything we want.  
If you want to go to a restaurant, eat some good food and have a great time, then this is the place right here!!!  Two thumbs up!
