Have to say was very impressed on how fast the order arrived to the house.  by the food arrivingâ€‹ really quick also meant that we ate a hot meal. have to say the standard of the food was a lot better than I expected also has it was the first time we ever ordered from them. we had the family meal, we had beef broccoli and Pad Thai chicken, with the meal we got two egg rolls and crab rangoon and of course egg drop soup and last but not least pork fried rice. Me and my wife really enjoyed the meal and my son had something to said "it was really good". so I have to recommend this place
