The sushi here is amazing!  I have never found a good sushi restaurant in Phoenix up until now.  We decided to order a few different specialty rolls and each one was fresh, tasty, and yummy especially the oh my god roll.  What's in it, you ask?  Order it and find out. you will definitely say "oh my god".  Find out why they named it that.  

Now, one major weakness.  I saw that they have beef bulgogi on their menu.  I got excited that they had this.  Usually, bulgogi is a korean dish, but I was hungry and decided to order it as well.  Word of advice:  Don't.  It was really really chewy and rubbery for me.  

Stick to the sushi and you can't go wrong.
