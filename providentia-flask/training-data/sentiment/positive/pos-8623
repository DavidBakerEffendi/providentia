If you've never seen the fountains at the Bellagio, GO! What are you waiting for?!

I LOVE the fountains! Something about music and dancing water and lights just fascinates me! Yes, I'm easily amused, but seriously, it is pretty awesome to watch! 

Its a free show and the songs change every time. 

What my boyfriend and I did was we actually went to the top of the eiffel tower in the Paris hotel and we watched it from up there. You have to kind of listen closely for the music but you get a better view of everything! 

The fountains are beautiful to watch! GO SEE THEM!
