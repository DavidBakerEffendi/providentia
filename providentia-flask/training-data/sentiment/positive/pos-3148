Authentic Mexican taqueria? Nope! Paco's Tacos is unabashedly Tex-Mex fusion at its best. Shortly after opening, it became our go-to spot in South Park and hasn't fallen from its lofty perch.

I honestly haven't had a bad item on the menu, but some of my favorites are the (free!) tomatillo salsa, the Shakedown Shrimp taco and the fajitas. Yes! Fajitas! These aren't your typical chain restaurant fajitas, but ones made with top notch ingredients fried in drawn Mexican butter. Oh, and don't forget about the namesake Paco's Taco, made with spice, tender beef brisket barbecue, that sums up the Tex-Mex fusion philosophy perfectly. And the margaritas are good, especially the tequila infused Firestarter. And the guacamole. And the specials. And they always have a Shiner Bock seasonal on tap. And... OK, you get the idea, right? At Paco's Taco's, it's ALL good!
