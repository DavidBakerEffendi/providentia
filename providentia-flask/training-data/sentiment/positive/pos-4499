Carnivore here who tried it out. Went for brunch and was impressed with the buffet beyond words. Couple kinds of salads, couple kinds of veggies, couple kinds of pasta salads, orzo salad, and some suprisingly tasty vegan desserts. I had the black bean burger and have to say it's been the BEST alternative burger I've ever had in the city. Place was cool to look over and lots to keep you talking . I would tell anyone who asked me what the best vegan brunch in the city was at the Zenith. Super spot.
