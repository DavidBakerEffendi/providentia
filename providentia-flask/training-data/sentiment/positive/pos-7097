I'm in LOVE! 
I came here after purchasing a Groupon... 
We sat on the patio enjoying the great weather. 
Our server was great and we quickly found out he was the Owner/Chef. 
They were offering two liquors that evening and one was a Vodka filtered 5 times through white rose petals. There are no mixers so it was served over ice. It was THE best vodka I have ever had! 
We ordered the Artichoke and Salami pizza and the Portuguese style mussels to share. 
The owner recommended the pizza since it was our first visit. It was WONDERFUL! I couldn't get enough. 
I normally do not like tomatoes with my shellfish but I was easily convinced that the Portuguese style were the best, so I gave in and boy am I glad i did!!! I was actually eating the tomatoes out of the broth (if you know me that is amazing!). 
We had parked our car right in front of the patio we were sitting on... 
While the car parked in front of us was leaving they crashed into our car and began causing a scene...(long story short) 
The owner stayed with us until the police arrived and made sure everything was taken care of properly. He was so amazing and sincerely concerned about our safety. 
We owe him big time! 

Thanks again and I will be back very soon!
