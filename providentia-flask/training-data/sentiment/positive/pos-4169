I ve been wanting to come here for a while. I know that their reputation is phenomenal and really glad I finally made reso for dinner.
The space is modern. The staff is very friendly, enthusiastic and helpful. They seem to be having great fun working which is an amazing thing to see. I could feel their positive vibe (and they should because this is 2 days after their Laurier win)
The concept is simple: everyone eats the same thing! I have signaled them in advance about a need for glutenfree friendly and they absolutely took care of my request. Everything that had gluten, they replaced it with something else just as delicious.
We took cocktails to start: The mushroom miso & the parsley basil, both made with gin. WOW! I especially loved the charred mushroom slices atop the drink.
The food was frigging amazing! Great flavor balance in every bite. Almost everything was fish & seafood except for the chicken and beef. Very well executed in terms of herbs & spices. Some surprising matching as well like the cucumber & white chocolate ganache dessert: whaaaattttt!!!!! Wow wow wow!
We also took the wine pairing service and everything was on point (i would suggest taking the half size if you are here mid-week lol!!!)
I would definitely come back and highly recommend this restaurant. Treat yo self!
