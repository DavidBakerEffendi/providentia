Roots is deliciousness on wheels. They offer delicious locally-sourced food to uptown lunch goers from their truck every weekday until 1 at 3rd and Tryon and I've managed to track them down some dinners at Chow Down food truck rallies and elsewhere.  Understanding that you have to pop a squat elsewhere, this is my have of all food trucks.

My obsession with them started when we first tasted them at Yelpo de Mayo. Then the stalking began.  For a long while I held the title of mayor of this little food truck that could. Each day they offer 3 different lunch choices- typically 2 big ones and a smaller one or salad.  Sometimes they offer a soup too. It really won't do you too much good for me to list off my favorites because it truly changes every day and I haven't seen too many repeats.  They often offer a nice vegetarian alternative which is nice and don't overdo the current meat au courant, pork.  Some of my have veggie dishes have been a winter root vegetable pita with pumpkin hummus and apple risotto sliders.  You can view their inventive menu every day at their website but don't trust their social media unfortunately. 

They offer tea complimentary with the meal.  Generally they are efficient and the prices are reasonable.  My only complaint? They shut down at 1 sharp every day and I often get hungry at 1:15 (or have a meeting that precludes me from getting there before 1) and they're always gone. Doh! The other complaint is twice they've had cilantro in dishes but didn't have it listed on the menu which is dangerous for someone with allergies. I'm used to it with mexican or vietnamese, but they put it once in an italian dish which is why I didn't bother asking. Other than that, I love thee Roots.
