Had the opportunity to enjoy at the CES in Las Vegas the Service was extremely friendly and professional. Excellent job of explaining dishes to first time Indian cuisine enthusiast. The owner is Rajah was amazing and interactive. The dishes I had were not what I expected can be extremely spicy if that's what you like, they have no problem fixing it for you.  It was so good I went back for second later in that day. Looking forward to try there Restaurant.
