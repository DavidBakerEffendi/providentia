I stopped by for lunch due to having read an article about it. Wow! So good. I only tried two types of tacos, but they were both amazing. I'd like to eat more, but I'm full after three tacos - 2 tacos chiwas and 1 taco pollo. They were both delicious, but I have to say the chicken was my favorite. It was more than an average street taco. It had a nice flavor balance to it. I don't know if the onions had some vinegar or what the flavors came from but it was just delicious. I'm pretty sure I'll be back on Monday.
