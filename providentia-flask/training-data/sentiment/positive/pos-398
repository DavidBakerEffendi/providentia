I love this place! We found this adorable shopping center while looking for a place to have dinner after a trip to Discovery Place Kids in Huntersville. It's so quaint but still has the right amount of the best stores. It kind of reminds me of a mini Georgetown. It's a great change of pace from the normal shopping centers we see here in S. Charlotte.
