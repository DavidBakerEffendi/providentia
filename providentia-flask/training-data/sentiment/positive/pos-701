I worked at Urban Bean for a summer a few yeras ago and absolutely loved it.  One of the main appeals for me was how "green" the place was.  The to-go cups are biodegradable, the coffee is local and organic, the pastries are baked on site, the used coffee grounds are composted, and the extra pastries are donated. 

The drinks are quite tasty as well. Although I haven't been in a while to try newer items, all of the classic stuff is delicious! I also recommend the cardamom cake if it's still offered--it tastes like a chai tea in cake form. Yum!
