Can I put 10+ stars? I took my husband here for his 35th birthday dinner and I never saw him like this. We were greeted with so much warmth and felt comfortable right away. Started with delicious cocktails then the waiter came to start our journey on this exceptional foodie experience! I will try and describe each dish as accurately as possible. It was a menu in collaboration with the Festival Montreal en Lumi√®re. So i took the seven service with wine pairing menu and Felix took the eight service with wine pairing menu and the extra truffles in one of the dishes. Every dish was as mesmerizing as the other. Not one single bad criticism about any. I am, by profession, a pastry chef and usually would have something to criticize about. Nope. Not this time! We were taking on an unforgettable journey! I am a sucker for good service. Ok. This, what we had was exceptional service! I will most definitely come back as soon as I can. The bill totalled up to about 450$ and it was all worth it. A special occasion for a special person in my life at a special restaurant! Look out for Jocelyn. He was our waiter. Attentive, professional, nice and all around very pleasant to talk to! Cute too if I might add!
