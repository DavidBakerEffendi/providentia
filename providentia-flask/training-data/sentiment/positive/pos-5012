Smoky Jon's rack o' ribs puts all other rib places, and places that serve ribs to shame.  The portions are ginormous and the meat is tender.  The sauce that's slathered everywhere is spicy, tangy, sweet but not disgustingly so, and smokey.  

It reminds me of sitting around a campfire roasting some damn fine meat, slathering it up in top notch BBQ sauce and then grubbin' happily. 

For sides we had baked beans, garlic mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.  However after stuffing ourselves with tons of ribs there was no room for the sides! 

We ordered out because the dining area in Smoky Jon's is teeny tiny and the parking lot is even worse.  

Truly, my only complaint was that I spent all night in the bathroom after eating here.  I think that's because my system was just not prepared for the rich, smokey, deliciousness that I have never experienced before.

So it was worth it!  YAY!!!
