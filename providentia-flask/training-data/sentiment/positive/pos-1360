We started going to this place because we found an offer on Groupon. We have been there about 4 times so far, and every time we do, we always have a good meal. We have tried the pizza with various toppings, wings, salad and garlic knots. The pizza is always good, and we love the thin, large slices. 

We appreciate the fact that they participate in Groupon, as it helps save some money for us, and allow a young family with a child to go somewhere and have a nice meal. We are grateful for that. Without Groupon, it would be a little too pricey for us, but outside of that, everything is nice. Service is always very friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant and comfortable. We definitely recommend them.
