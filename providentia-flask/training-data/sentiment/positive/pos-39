This small, family-owned Italian restaurant combines warm hospitality with great food. They make a number of dishes from scratch: cannelloni,  limoncello, cannoli, and more. For seafood lovers, the scallops and the lobster ravioli are fantastic. Decent vegetarian options, too, including a great ravioli al pesto. 

My family has celebrated anniversaries and my wedding rehearsal dinner here, because of all the personal touches. The husband and wife owners try to talk to as many guests as they can; and, the husband is the chef, so they seem to be interested to hear reflections on the food and the restaurant.  

Parking available behind the restaurant and very very limited street parking. Kids menus available.  Full bar available. 

Worth the drive to Sharpsburg!
