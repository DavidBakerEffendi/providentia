Love this spot! It has a great vibe, great food and cheap beer! And their patio is puppy friendly but fyi it's not kid friendly. Parents think by jumping the patio railing allows their children but it doesn't and you'll be asked to move inside on the opposite side from gaming. They also have a fire pit that's perfect for the cooler nights
