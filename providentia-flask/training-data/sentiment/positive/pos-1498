Just what Concord needs.   This place has the most delicious food and atmosphere.  I agree with some other reviewers that the service isn't really at the top of their game yet but it's also just a lunch place.  I've seen signs that they are expanding for dinner service and hopefully patio service but for what it is, it's excellent.   I haven't had anything there I've been disappointed with.
