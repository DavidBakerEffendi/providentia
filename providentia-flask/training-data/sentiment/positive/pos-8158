Thank god for Eggslut!! My friend and her family took a trip to Vegas back in April. I was just in Vegas for business and she told me before I flew out that this place was a must visit. My coworker and I went to Eggslut around 9 am Sunday morning. There was a line as expected. It goes pretty fast though since you just have to walk up to the register, order your food, and wait for them to call your name.

The first day I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese. The brioche bun was so soft and really big. The bacon was cooked to crispy perfection and the cheese and over medium egg combo left the sandwich filled with flavor. They do put sriracha ketchup on the bun which takes the sauce level up a notch. I would highly recommend this one over the sausage, egg and cheese which I got Wednesday morning. The sausage, egg and cheese comes with turkey sausage, over medium egg, cheese and honey mustard aioli. This wasn't nearly as saucy as the first one. I wouldn't recommend the orange juice, but I still have that bacon, egg and cheese on my mind!
