Since we still have gift card credit from Christmas... We try to use it here and there...

The last time we went to the Tempe Marketplace one and our visit was horrible... The only + out of that experience was that we were using a gift card haha

Tonight however

Alex took great care of us...
He was very nice and attentive... 

I ordered a Mai Tai and water with lemon...
For my meal, I ordered a pizza... And I ate it all haha I was hungry 
The food was good! 

We also had the Belgian souffl√© dessert and it was excellent! So rich! 

But we enjoyed the service by far compared to the other location...

Thanks Alex for taking care of us and for making our next "CPK" dinner location to be set!
