Walk up to the counter and start your pizza they way you would a sandwich at subway. The guys working are really nice, make a good pie and not hard to look at either :D
2 topping original crust with the usual sauce plus a side of broccolini was $24. Not bad. The broccolini was spicy which is good but they were very heavy handed with the garlic.

I'm a local and I'll definitely be coming back here!
