Oooookay! I would consider and probably call myself a pizza connoisseur, and not just because I like the title. You probably don't care but I've lived in Europe and travelled around Italy where I had the opportunity to marvel in some really delicious pizza and some really bad ones ( I know, it's only pizza and I'm being dramatic) but pizza libretto has it down!!! The crust is perfection, the flavours are perfectly combined. The sauce and crust is the only thing that matters to making a good pizza. Libretto, with a few other favourites, will always have my forever love!
