This place is awesome! Wish I had one of them back home, it's literally an adult playground with so many games drinking as well as non drinking games.  There are so many bars in here as well as awesome music.  They have a food bar if you have any munchies.  This place is a one stop shop for a night of clean adult fun.  

Our server suggested that we check this place out as well as Freemont street and I am so glad she recommended it.  Both places where awesome!  There is no cover charge to get in and most of the games are free to play. Darts you need to hand your ID to the bar tender to get darts and pool you have to pay $10 for an hour of ply as well as put your name on the list.  So bummed that there isn't a place like this back home, I would come there all the time
