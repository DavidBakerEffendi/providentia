I'm reluctant to review this place because it is one of my favorite secret little hide aways in Charlotte but people do deserve to know and I love seeing the place do well.

I have been to England many times because I have family there and this feels like an authentic neighborhood English pub.

The food is actually fantastic. It is not traditional terrible bar food. I do not think I have had a bad thing on the menu and I have tried most of it. I love coming for a late night bite and a pint or there have been several occasions where I have come for dinner itself. The burger is very well seasoned and is one of the best straight up cheeseburgers in Charlotte. Some of the more traditional UK food like Shepard's Pie and Bangers and Mash are also very well done here. I have Bangers and Mash every Christmas (100+ year-old family tradition) and this place definitely does it well. I'm not a fish person but I have heard the Fish and Chips is spot on too.

The inside has a terrific pub atmosphere for mingling or grabbing a table with your mates. The outside boasts a nice brick patio under some trees for an almost secret garden feel.
