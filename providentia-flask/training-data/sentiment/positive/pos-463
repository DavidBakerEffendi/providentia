Let the Phoenix Food Truck Revolution begin!

Leading the pack in my opinion are the smiling folks in the Pizza People Food Truck..."Pie on the fly!" How awesome is that? 

From the homemade dough (YES...homemade or shall I say truckmade?...) to the passionate owners to the local, fresh ingredients to the gluten free and vegan options...this food truck is on a roll baby!

The thin, crispy yet pillowy dough and the tangy marinara with the local fresh basil...OMG...let's just say I devoured every bite. And with prices around $6 you just can't beat it! You can't beat it...but you most certainly can eat it!

I can't wait to see where Pizza People park their gorgeous truck...I just want to be first in line! I even have hired them to cater my business's holiday party! You should too!

Pizza People...you are my kinda people!
