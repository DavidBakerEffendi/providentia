Finally a place where you can really get your money valued for "your schnitzel". LOL

...and I'm not just talking about the value for your moolah. I'm talking about the quality of the food.

The Golden Pheasant is a restaurant that will satisfy all appetites.

They are friendly and they'll do whatever to make you at home while dining out. You have many delicious entrees to choose from: WeinerSchnitzel, Chicken Paprikash, Goulash, Stroganoff, Dobos.

Good luck trying to finish it!
