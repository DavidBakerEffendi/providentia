I've read the other reviews and understand reviews can and are different. My wife and I have dined here several times and never had an issue. The menu has changed, bringing improvement to the kinds of meals that are available.

On November 15, 2012, we had a late breakfast here. Upon entrance, we were greeted right away and shown to our table. Our server, Beth, asked if we would like coffee or something else upon giving us the menu. Our drinks arrived within a few minutes. My wife ordered the four cheese Quiche while I ordered an omelette made to order with bacon/cheese with potato with onions, peppers and mushrooms-a nice touch to the home fired potatoes. A big muffin was also included with my omelette.

Our meals arrived in 10 to 15 minutes as everything was cooked to order. Our breakfast items were HOT which is always a good sign. Drink refills arrived without hunting the server-always a great sign of customer service. My wife could not finish her quiche, so it was packed in ice as we had other things to do before going home. The leftover arrived home at a safe temperature and was enjoyed the next day. Beth gave us service above the normal and we shall return. Our total bill was $26.83 + tip. For a great breakfast, that cost was reasonable.
