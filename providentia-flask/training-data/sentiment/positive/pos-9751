No lie: I don't even like hot dogs lol JJ's is awesome! Went here for a family birthday dinner. Good beer selection and delicious dogs. I recommend the Southern Girl. The building has cool decor/signage and 2 outdoor seating areas, patio and rooftop. Servers were really friendly. We stayed until they closed and they still told us not to rush in leaving. Just a great, fun neighborhood hang!
