I decided to take my bff to Roy's as a surprise for his Bday. I had an evening planned of dinner and fun and Roy's was definitely an excellent choice for his surprise seafood wish.
To start off dinner we actually had a couple of the "Original Hawaiian Martinis" - Maui pineapples are drenched in SKYY Vodka, Stoli Vanil Vodka & Malibu Coconut Rum.Shaken and served with fresh pineapple (SOOOOO Yummy.)
We then decided to skip the appetizers and went straight for our dinner entries. My bff got the Roy's Trio which had Hibachi Salmon, Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi & Misoyaki Butterfish then sides of Baby Bok Choy & Steamed Rice. An absolute must try if you have a hard time deciding to dedicate to just ONE fish :-) I did the Shellfish Sampler (another moment of indecision here) which had the Butter Poached Half Lobster Tail,Seared Crab Cake, U-10 Sea Scallop & Shrimp with the most delish Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto & Lobster Curry Sauce. Absolutely amazing. Our two dishes together made for a teeny little Roy's sampler buffet and was to die for. Unfortunately at this point we were way too full for dessert so we will be going back to try their Prixe Fixe menu.
A side note, my friend got a special little menu with his name on it and the Happy Bday greeting. nice touch. We had only experienced this one other time at the Oceanaire in San Diego .
