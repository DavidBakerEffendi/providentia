**** IMPORTANT ****
The following review was for the previous management & chef talent of AoF.  Things have changed, and my previous reviews no longer apply.  I haven't been to the new version of AoF, so I have no basis for a rating.  You should look at the dates of the reviews.  Reviews prior to February of 2015 are the older incarnation.  The new version is post May 2015.



I'm in Vegas, and I'm stopping in at Art of Flavors.  Never do one without the other.

First visit I had gingerbread cookie.  This is why I rate this gelato so high: if I made this gelato, it would be different.  But I enjoy Desyree's as much as I imagine I would enjoy my own, perfected version -- and I love what I can create.  AoF's is different, but it's a divine balance.  Any place that can take me somewhere I wouldn't normally go and make me elated for doing it gets 5 stars.  

Second visit I wanted to try more flavors, so I had chocolate.  I almost never get chocolate ice cream.  If  you like chocolate, you have to try this.  I bake and craft a lot of chocolate desserts.  My goal, intense chocolate flavor (it's why I detest red velvet which is light-chocolate and LOTS of food coloring).  This chocolate ice cream is CHOCOLATE.

Some information.  Someone was concerned about the sourcing of the cream.  Except for the vegan gelato (where coconut milk is used) the cream is sourced from cows.

I know I'm not the first to suggest this (a professional review of AoF was the first time I read it), but let me carry the message forward: this is the best gelato / ice cream place in the country.
