I went here for lunch and couldn't have asked for more. Service was fast despite the lunch time rush. The food was authentic and there were a wide variety of choices (all at a low price point). I decided to go all in and order the crazy burrito. The crazy burrito was $7.95 and was honestly the largest burrito I've ever seen. Staff let me try it with beef and chicken. It also had avocado and grilled vegetables in it. It was so large that I could barely eat it all.

This restaurant is the real deal. Go and check it out.
