My man and I made last minute reservations at 8pm and got there about 15 till and The place was packed to the gills! I got a glad of wine at the bar and we were seated before I finished it.
It's definitely close quarters down there, I could hear what everyone on either side of us ordered. I could have forked something off of a neighbors plate if I had been desperate! It really didn't bother me though. Out waiter was helpful with the menu and helped me find the best scallop choice for me (the one with portabella mushrooms, it was amazing!) And my boyfriend Ha blackened halibut that was incredibly flavored.
The food came fast with big salads to start. The only thing not amazing was the veggie side, but who cares about that with so much good stuff to eat! We left there happy, full and so glad we had gone!
