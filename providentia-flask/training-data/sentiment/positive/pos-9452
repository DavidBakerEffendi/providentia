Seriously delicious! I had the steak and pepper skillet with country potatoes and I could probably order that every single time and be a happy camper!Also my food came with homemade flour tortillas, which were delicious! Definitely coming back, super affordable, homey little gem! Oh and my husband said his biscuits and gravy were bomb!
