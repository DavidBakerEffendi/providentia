Great customer service from the manager, I think his name was Alex. They had made a mistake on a steak sub I ordered and left an ingredient out, not a big deal. I called and spoke to him about it, he told me to come back another time and he would take care of it. Stopped back a few days later, he personally made me a new sandwich and apologized profusely for the mistake. He was obviously sincere and very engaged in making sure he improved my experience. I think he threw in chips and a drink too. By taking care of business the right way, he now has my business anytime I'm in the mood for a sub. Kudos.
