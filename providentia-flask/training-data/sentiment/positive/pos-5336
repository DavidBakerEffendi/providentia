The best pollo & carne asada you will find! 

 The restaurant is tucked away in a small strip mall located close to Mesa's downtown area. Pollo Picante is immaculately clean and the staff greet you with a smile. There are several platters to choose from but it's pretty simple you pick if you want chicken or steak and pick your sides. 

 It's worth noting that all the side dishes are amazing and packed full of flavor, you get several different salsas including hot mild and medium along with some fresh guacamole that puts all others to shame. Additionally you get fresh grilled jalape√±os, onions and some other vegetables which I didn't eat but it looks like nice. Pollo Picante does a great job with takeout orders & packed everything up very nicely.

In closing, if your taste buds are craving some amazing food at very good prices I highly recommend you visit this restaurant which is locally owned and family run and is a great option for satisfying some cravings.
