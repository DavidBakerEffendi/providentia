El Chorro is a classic. It has the best patio in Scottsdale with great views of Camelback mountain. In March the smell of the orange blossoms fills the air and combined with the spectacular weather makes for an amazing atmosphere. The bar area is great and opens onto the patio so even if you go just for drinks, it will ge a great time.
