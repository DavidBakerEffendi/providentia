I thought they only had noodles, but turns out they had fried rice too! Had the pork and shrimp fried rice for takeout and it was really good! Best fried rice I've had in a lot of restaurants, and the shrimp tasted really fresh. Really large portion too. 

Would not recommend the bubble tea (it's pretty diluted and uses powder).

Staff was fluent in English and served food quickly. My place to go for a quick large asian rice/noodle meal. The best Chinese restaurant around the neighbourhood.
