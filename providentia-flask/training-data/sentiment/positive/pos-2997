Went for the first time on a Friday night! It was so much fun! There's 3 floors to hit off- one is ground level. The first round gives you 20 balls to hit. After trying some different clubs and styles of swinging, you learn a decent way to hit. There's music playing in the background, food and drink service to your table, think of bowling alley style service. Best part is watch the people beat you to see how to hit better lol. It was $45 for an hour of golf, I think for anyone hitting, not per person, per party- but I didn't pay so not totally sure :)
