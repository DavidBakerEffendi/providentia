The boyfriend and I came twice since the grand opening and gulped down the noodles both times.

The menu is quite small (the waitress mentioned that they will be slowly expanding), but what they offer is classic and delicious!

You get a choice of small, large and mega and different sized noodles. I tried both the three xi and kuan noodles. Both were really good, but the kuan edges out as the winner for me. I prefer the thicker texture and it just feels heartier. Each bowl also comes with generous portions of perfectly seasoned and not over-cooked beef. The broth is also just the right amount of saltiness (I tend to like saltier broths and the boyfriend prefers milder broths and both of our taste buds were satisfied). If you prefer spicy, they add the perfect amount of chili oil on top, which somehow doesn't make the entire dish too oily.

The actual restaurant size is fairly small, so I wouldn't recommend for groups any larger than 4 people. Service was very fast and the staff was extremely attentive.

I can't say enough good things! I hope their standard remains equally high past the initial grand opening phase.
