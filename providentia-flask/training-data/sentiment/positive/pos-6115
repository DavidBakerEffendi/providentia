First introduced to TIABI Coffee at their first location on Maryland Pkwy for a Yelp Coffee Cruise event, I was happy to learn that they would eventually open a second location in our neighborhood.  I told co-owner Tiffany S. at that time that I couldn't wait and sure enough, we frequent TIABI quite often since they opened.  My usual order is the Honey Cream latte with almond milk, but the other drinks that I also like are the Twilight Lavender Latte and the Pistachio Latte.  Waffles are a specialty here as their name says.  Try the Red Velvet or the Bananatella for a sweet treat.  
There are still several other items I have yet to try, but since this is TIABI is so close, I'll get around to them sooner or later.  A great addition to our neighborhood and an excellent coffee stop for the locals.
