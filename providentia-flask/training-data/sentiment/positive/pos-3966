I work right across the street from Wynn, so brunch here is just a short walk after my overnight shift. The most striking thing about Wynn overall, is just how clean everything is there. I've never seen a single thing out of place. Terrace Pointe Cafe is just the same; everything is extremely clean, organized and on point. Terrace Pointe has an outdoor patio that looks out to the pool. I'm always in very early before the patio opens so haven't had a chance to sit out there yet. First chance I get, I will have to get out there. 

The food is fantastic. I've had both the waffles and the three egg breakfast with potatoes and a choice of meat. The orange juice is fresh squeezed, and a little small for seven dollars, but I get it, it's The Strip in Vegas and the prices are high. Excellent service, and a very pretty environment that appears to be French decor inspired.
