This is still our favorite place I absolutely love it! The fish is so fresh and not tough at all. The portions are great and they are so fast. 

The restaurant is always clean and fresh feeling.

I love sushi and eat at lot of different restaurants and this is by far my favorite.

This picture is of a roll my fianc√© got me for take out.

The staff is friendly and I will continue to go here!
