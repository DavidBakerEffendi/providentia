This the quirkiest, artsiest, and most delicious cafe in the Cleveland area. There is comfy seating, Bedouin type decor, and authentic, freshly prepared Middle Eastern food. The owner of the cafe is a wonderful artist who takes great care with all aspects of the cafe (his studio is in the basement). 

The tables and mugs are all handmade by him, as is much of the artwork. I also want to add that pretty much everything here is made from scratch. He soaks chickpeas in large tins overnight to make fresh hummus. The muhamarra is pretty much to die for and the coconut almond chai is amazing. It doesn't get much better than this.
