Driving on the strip hungry at 9:30pm. Almost ALL dinner buffets were closing at 10pm. Saw the bright PEPPERMILL sign and checked the yelp ratings and decided to give it a try.

Upon entering the restaurant, the inside was so pink and purple, kinda like an old-school limo. I ordered the fruit fantasia waffles with the boysenberry syrup. It was huge!! & it was delicious!!! 

The portion sizes were huge, even the cup of coffee and the onion rings were stacked high. You get what you pay for. This is by far the best 24-hour restaurant on the strip in Las Vegas.
