We have been there twice in the last week.  First time there I got the taco plate with one chicken and one carne asada. The tacos were fantastic but the rice and beans were phenomenal Such great flavor! Also, we got the special which included fresh guacamole. I would challenge anyone to find better guacamole. it was fantastic. The second time I went I tried the barbacoa tacos. Again, our experience was fantastic and very fresh and flavorful food.
