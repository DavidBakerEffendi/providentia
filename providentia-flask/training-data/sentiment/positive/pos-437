While there are many Irish pubs in the Valley, Fibber Magee's is by far the best. With its warm wooden walls, cozy booths and friendly staff, I can't help but feel relaxed when I'm sipping on a Black Velvet at my favorite Chandler bar. The bar attracts a lot of regulars. The drinks won't set your wallet back and the food is great! Be sure to try the Bangers 'N' Mash.
