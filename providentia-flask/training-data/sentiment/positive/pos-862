I love this place.  I'm from Hawaii and this is as good as it gets living in vegas.  I got their number on speed dial baby!  When I'm coming home from work I'm calling in my pick up order.

They are from Hawaii.  As most Hawaii people know "Meat Jun" is a must have.  I've noticed that "meat jun" may be a hawaii thing.  Its thin slice marinated beef coated with scrambled egg. yummy!!!  HITS THE SPOT EVERYTIME.  That's because its comfort food for me.  A great amount of food - rice, entree, salad (dine in), and 4 side orders.  Check out the pics left by fellow yelpers.

Staff is friendly and since I'm a regular they are always nice to ask how i'm doing.  I'm so happy its so close to my house!
