We have always loved the 7th Street Market and as we watched it grow we usually did it by sitting at one of those tables in the middle of the open space eating a Tyrannosaurus Rex Pizza.  The crust is amazing.  My wife loves the honey they give you to dip the crust into.  I have to say it is absolutely one of the best pizzas I have ever had in Charlotte or anywhere.  It is worth a try and I hope to see you at the table next to us some weekend, watching the market grow.
