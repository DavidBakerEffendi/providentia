Excellent food here! Definitely top notch and when people ask me where they should go for Asian food in the area, this is the place I recommend. I am a foodie so I had to get two entr√©es and an appetizer to make sure it was true. I had delicious leftovers that were enjoyed by all. The pad Thai was my favorite!
