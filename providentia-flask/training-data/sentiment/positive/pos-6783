The BF and I just love this place!  Fabulous margaritas....and cheap during happy hour!  Great chips and salsa, and tableside guacamole.  The Enchiladas de Avocado is our favorite entree.  It comes with this amazing jicama salad which I think I love even more than the enchiladas.  Service is always good....everyone's friendly.  Bartenders are great too.  This is our go-to margarita spot!
