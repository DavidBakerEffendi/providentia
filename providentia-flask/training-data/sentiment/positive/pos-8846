Shop. Sip. Savor.  What a concept!  After an exhuasting day of shopping, what a perfect thing to do is slip right into Fred's, located on the 2nd floor of Barney's.

Sexy Bar area with dark lighting.  All the service, from the moment we entered, to being seated, to drink & food orders, was impecable.

Racheal, the Assistant GM, came over several times to inquire how things were tasting, gave personal suggestions, tips & insider info.

Richie, the bartender, shook the perfect martinis.  We tried new Sobieske Vodka, (smooooth), his special signature Pomegrante Drop, (sugared rim), French Manicure (only for those who like them sweet), and the man drink: 007, (grey goose, Tanqueray, blue cheese stuffed olives).

The pomme frites we presented in a tall glass wrapped in parchment paper & served with 3 sauces for dipping.  (i much rather fries from Burbon Steak, or the garlic truffle fries at Greenhouse).  These were more like large steak fries.  But, still good & hot.

Emilia Romagna White Pizza with 12 year old Balsamic glaze was pretty ok.  I would have preferred a thinner crust.  Was a bit dry from  too much parmasean.

My 5 stars are obvisouly based on the awesome attention we recieved, treated with the ut-most respect (HTF), and service from days gone by!

I will denfinatley be back for their AMAZING HAPPY HOUR which is EVERYDAY, 4-7.
