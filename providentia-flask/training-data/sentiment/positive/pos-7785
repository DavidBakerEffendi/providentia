Fun lunch! The place wasn't too busy for our first time here and the waitress, Amanda was wonderful...very attentive...came back several times for drink refils and to make sure we were good! Food portions were huge...and the Monster Platter was everything it implies and  really delicious. We also had the chicken tacos which we also enjoyed. The management stopped by our table to make sure we were good and the busboy was on top of clearing off used dishes. Kudos to the entire staff!
