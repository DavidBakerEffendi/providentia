I spent two months in Germany this past September and October, and one happy discovery there (a thing I'd avoided on my many past trips because I thought they'd be uniformly terrible) was the excellent, freshly prepared, authentic, and CHEAP Thai food in the cities there. I returned home to Calgary on Halloween 2014 and the next day threw a bone at the new Thai Fusion Delight hoping to recapture some of that German "Schnell-Imbiss" Thai excellence, and this place does it perfectly. Portions are huge and fantastic value, remarkably so for Calgary, the dishes are layered and complex, flavours are mostly spot on (you might want to ask for extra spicy), everything is made to order by real Thai people...I could go on and on. Kao Soi is as good as at any sit-down resto in town and much cheaper, about half as pricey and just as good as at the excellent Khao San up the street. That's my fave dish along with the crispy chicken with basil, addictive. We need a hundred more places like this in Calgary but this is a start. With this and Watercress Express bookending Uptown 17th I'm a lucky man!
