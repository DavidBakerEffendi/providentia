First place I had ever tried a poke bowl and I am so glad I tried it here. A friend took me here and we ordered the FNB poke bowl. At first I was a little hesitant about having mango in the dish but turns out, the mango actually gave the dish a nice sweet contrast. The sauce they placed in the bowl was yummy and since I love spicy food, the jalape√±os in the dish was a thumbs up for me. The only other bowl I had here was the spicy tuna bowl. It was good as well but nothing special. I would definitely stick with the FNB poke bowl.
