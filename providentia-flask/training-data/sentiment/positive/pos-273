Absolutely amazing man ... it is just as good as (if not better than) Frostbites in Los Angeles (http://www.yelp.com/biz/frostbites-crepes-and-frozen-delights-cypress), which I considered as one of the sorbet I've had (except that Frostbites is $2 cheaper comparing with Art of Flavors). 

The owner was very nice and I was able to sample several flavors. Here were some of gelato / sorbet flavors available during my visit:

Steak and Eggs, Lamponi Raspberries, Pork Pate, Pistachio, Passion Fruit, etc. 

Ananas pineapple (sorbetto alla frutta) + Fior di Latte (milk's flower, sorbetto) $4.95 with 2 flavors - Simply perfect ice to sweetness ratio. Pineapple was just a tad sweet and fior di latte has such a smooth texture and creamy flavor. It was so good that I had to restrain myself from ordering more gelato / sorbet. 

I know the store is located off the Strip (pretty close to the Stratosphere), but I strongly recommend this little gelato / sorbet store and it was definitely worth the drive for me.
