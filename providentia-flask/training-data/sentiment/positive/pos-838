What a refreshingly delicious experience at this self serve frozen yogurt place. After having tried quite a few different chains over the years as the trend of self serve fro-yo took off, they all were always so similar in style, taste, and options. But this place makes all organic yogurt with some organic toppings too! I tried the organic spiced pumpkin, apple cinnamon, and salted caramel and they were all delicious! The flavors were right on and tasted very fresh and real. What really put the experience over the top was the crock pot of warm, cut up cinnamon apples to put on as a topping. What a unique touch to the topping bar. 

The inside is super cute and trendy. They even have board games in the back and tables to hang out at. The price is all done by weight, in typical self serve fro-yo fashion. It is a bit expensive, but it wouldn't stop be from going back to get some well made unique frozen yogurt!
