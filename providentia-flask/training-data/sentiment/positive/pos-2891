A beautiful interior decor and a terace for the outside lovers. This place is very fancy and sophisticated. It's located in centropolis " the downtown laval district". I've been coming here for a Long long time. And can proudly say I'm a loyal customer. I never was disappointed with this beautiful resto.

This is my go to for Pi√±a coladas! I am always so happy with they're service. All the waiters and waitresses remember me fondly and they know how I like my mixes to be super sweet. They make sure I love the drink and its to my liking all the time! They have an amazing food menu as well
Food: So far I tried their butchers board the half portion which looks super big I can only imagine what the big one looks like ahaha. They have amazing rustic wood oven baked pizza ! Super delicious. I shared it with friends. 

Overall, it's a beautiful place to come with friends or go on a date and even sit at the bar in their comfy chairs haha. I am definitely going to recommend this place and will return very shortly!
