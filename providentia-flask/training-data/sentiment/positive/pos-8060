Seriously yummy food! 

If you are thinking about eating here, I recommend having a reservation. We did on a Friday night, so we were seated quickly (even though one in our party hadn't arrived yet).

You'll find the wait staff to be very efficient, and of course, you'll find the choices for beer, cocktails, wine by the glass or a bottle from next door all perfectly acceptable. Because you are in a "tavern," have a drink. If you like Reese peanut butter cups, I recommend the peanut chocolate porter (from a can) and pair it with some appetizers. I recommend the Bruschetta Three Ways (classic tomato, olive tapenade, and a chef's choice) and the Roasted Local Beets with Crow's Dairy "quark" and chives. Both were divine, and the beets were so addicting--such great flavor and paired perfectly with the cheese that my mouth is salivating as I write this. 

Next, you'll have to decide on a main entr√©e, which will have you squirming in your seat. Which one to choose? So many wonderful choices. Homemade fettucine--final answer (win!--so tasty, and you'll have leftovers).

You could be done and quite satisfied at this point, but why stop because look at that dessert menu! Yes, you're stuffed and you're saying "I'm really too full for dessert," but look again. Squint at the line "Cinnamon Spiced Chocolate Mousse with Salted Caramel & Whipped Cream" and just say yes. 

P.S. Don't share it. If someone in your party thinks you might be a tad selfish, just say "hmmm, I think I'm coming down with a sore throat." 

Enjoy!
