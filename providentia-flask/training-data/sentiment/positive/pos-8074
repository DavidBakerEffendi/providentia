This is the real deal: a gift to the Vegas food scene.

Chada is a restaurant that cares deeply about each dish, each diner, each evening, each experience, each moment.
It's a restaurant that understands the word "soupcon".....
Those are the qualities of an artist, and Bank (the owner) is an artist.

His wine list is blisteringly sophisticated and well-priced; a testament to how much the wholesale wine world loves him from his days at Lotus.

The food is positively poetic: delicate, thoughtful, harmonic, ethereal.

Yes, it's Thai food, but nothing that you've ever ever had.

If Thai food was a person, and it went on a walkabout with an angel of the universe, Chada's food would be the result.
