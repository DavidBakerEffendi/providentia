I have been here about three times with friends and my child and then I have been here with a film crew the desert portions are a gigantic I think everything is gigantic but it's definitely a mix of a tourist trap and locals who like to sit by the fire in the separate room the service is very good parking is never a problem and this place has a good reputation since it's been there for
A really long time it's a Vegas favourite
It is open 24 hours and I have tried multiple things at multiple times so I can't remember much of anything particular I have some pictures that I can upload
But I would have to dig for them I know there's many film crews that's that by this place so don't be surprised if you see a camera someplace
