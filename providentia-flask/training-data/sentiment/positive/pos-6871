I've been meaning to come back to this place for a while now after discovering it through a Yelp Elite event some time ago.  I finally had the time, so I jetted down to the restaurant and I had a really good time.

The service here was great.  I was greeted and seated immediately, and decided that lunch was the way to go for me.  I like the fact that they serve breakfast here until 2PM, because sometimes I DO want breakfast at noon!  They also have happy hour daily from 3-7 which is awesome as well.  No need to rush after work.  Just do happy hour on a Saturday!

Anyways, I went with the burger, and surprisingly, they have a variety of sides to choose from.  I "like" french fries, but am always looking for something more at times.  Sometimes I want a salad instead, or soup, and BLD gives you that choice.  Instead of fries, they have 4 or 5 choices to go with.  I went with hummus.  It was delicious!  Nice change of pace from fries.

Anyways, its a bit of a drive, but a nice alternative from the ordinary.  Lovely decor, spacey with lots of good food to choose from.   I will be back!
