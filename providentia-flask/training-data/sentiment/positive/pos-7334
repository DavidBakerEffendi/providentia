Open 24/7 the food is awesome go for the steak egg and cheese burrito if your wanting some good food it always hits the spot. The drive through is tight so make sure you just walk in haha if you like spicy the hot sauce is really fantastic can't beat this for 24/7 Mexican filly b isn't anything compared to this place. Hope this helps and encourages you to try it
