Buca Yorkville offers a regal culinary experience. The menu features items we don't see often in other Italian restaurants, stuff as "Gnocco Fritto" or "Burrata Pizza". A lot of individuals may say it's very expensive, but when it comes down to it, if you avoid alcohol, the food is reasonably priced. If you don't have a reservation, you might be lucky enough to sit at the "Tasting Menu Bar", which is right in front of the kitchen. These seating usually go for $100 exclusively for "Tasting Menu".

 A must when visiting Toronto if you ask me.
