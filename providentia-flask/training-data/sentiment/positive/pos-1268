This is now my new favorite for sushi! I have been here twice and I almost did not go because a couple bad reviews. I am happy I tried it. The rolls are so good that after the first time I went I was craving the rolls so I had to go back. I have had the asu roll, las Vegas roll, a baked samon roll, seaweed salad, bento box with chicken, tempura and other things. Every single item was fantastic! The places nicely decorated and very clean. Now the bad, they need more staff and the owner needs to treat the staff better. I believe that when someone is trying, even if they are not perfect, they should not be disciplined, especially in public. They are working out the kinks and getting a customer base and rep. I would advise, go there, enjoy he food and look past the minor issues they are ironing out.  Also their happy hour is cheaper than any sushi place I have seen, basically half price! I believe those hours are m-f 3-7.
