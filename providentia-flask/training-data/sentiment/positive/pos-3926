This was such a fun and unique experience!My wife and I dined there last night and it was definitely something everyone should try at least once. The food was delicious and guessing exactly what you are eating is part of the fun.I was half right on some totally off on another.The staff was courteous and very friendly and while in total darkness I still felt comfortable and at ease.My wife and I recommend this restaurant whole heartedly
