This is a fantastic little coffee shop/restaurant featuring vegan and vegetarian goodness. I am a vegan myself, and I loved the selection of sandwiches, salads, pizzas, and sides I had to choose from. As much as possible is local and all of the veggies are organic. Awesome.

My husband and I split a few things: the wet burrito, the tlt, and a side of roasted potatoes. The burrito was good, but we really went nuts over the tlt. This is a sandwich I am going to be craving now! The potatoes were also really good. My husband had a black iced coffee which he said was really good (he is picky about coffee), and I had a hot soy chai that was really tasty and not overly sweet like so many are.

The staff is really friendly, and we thought the prices were really good. We we definitely be regulars here now.
