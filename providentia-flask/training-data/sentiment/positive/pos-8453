So I came here for drinks and hanging out and fell in love!
All white classy elegant vibe with intricately detailed mixology intertwined with excellent food. I heart Monday's they have pasta special nights!:)
I definitely recommend this spot as a date spot, romantic with a bit of an edge. Lots of open space and it's great for a summer day due to the outside patio or an evening in.
