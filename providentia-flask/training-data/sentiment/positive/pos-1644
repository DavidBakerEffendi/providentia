We are sitting in the back corner. 
The atmosphere is nice, Cavs game is on. 
We ordered Wednesday $2 tacos - 1 chicken, 1 beef. 
Flame warmed flour tortillas! The best!
If you like this style of tortilla try them at Bomba tacos in Rocky River.
Chicken is grilled, cut into thin strips, topped with shredded cheddar cheese, and pico de Gallo.I make better tacos at home.
I asked for barbecue sauce because they only had Tabasco, added it to the taco with the Tabasco and it was almost like Touch Taco Truck tacos, or what I like to call "drunk tacos."

 I opened my neatly rolled silverware and discovered a dirty fork; cheese dried on the back type fork. YIKES! I like cheese, but not someone else's sloppy cheese. Things happen I get it, used the knife. 

I think the best feature is the "fireplace." 3 little kerosene lights with small rocks in a frame on the wall. Whoever came up with this satirical fireplace on the "lava" wall needs more recognition. He is clearly an artist.

Come here, eat here, come back. If you get a dirty fork, use a knife.
And remember people get drunk here on the weekends.
