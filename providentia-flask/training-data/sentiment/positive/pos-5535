I figure I'd add to this review too, my sister (michelle r. here on Yelp) already wrote a great review and I just wanted to say that I agree with her that this place is really authentic!  I come here for lunch all the time to try their different lunch specials.  If not the special, yes, the katsudon is delicious (served w/ rice and onions and an egg on top!).  So are their bento boxes, I'll usually order their grilled mackerel.  And yes, their sushi is also really good.  My only complaint would be that it's a little small and it can get too crowded and busy, when that happens I'll go to the other Japanese restaurant right around the corner...
