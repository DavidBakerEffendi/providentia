I got the Tori Paitan which is a chicken based white soy sauce flavored broth. In fact they're all chicken based. It was delicious! I added black garlic oil to the broth for an extra kick. It was very well done, lots of flavor, no hint of it being too salty like other places I've been to. Served at a perfect temperature. The Egg was also perfect. The Chashu(pork) was nice and fatty with a healthy serving. I'm not sure what the noodles were though, they were alright but I've certainly had better.
