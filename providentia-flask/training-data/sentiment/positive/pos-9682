Attending a funeral down the street. My dear friend recommended. His father used to come here and order the Scrod sandwich with a pint of black beer. 

I'm italian and can be very particular when reviewing italian restaurants. This place is  solid. Everything was perfect!

Stuffed Sweet Peppers appetizer, Seafood Linguini  with white sauce, Veal Romano, espresso almond cookies perfect!

Ericka was an excellent server very attentive.
