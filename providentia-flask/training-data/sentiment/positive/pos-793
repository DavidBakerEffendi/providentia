I love The Root mostly for their food menu.  The staff here is hip but friendly.  The place is often packed around midday.  I would not recommend studying/doing work here because the noise level is HIGH. Also, be warned that if you eat in you have to nab yourself a table which can be difficult when they are busy.  We like to order our food to go usually.

I've eaten my way through most of the menu here and these are my favorites:
-Root wrap
-Tempeh reuben (woah!)
-The Balanced Equation calzone

From the bakery, you can't go wrong with a chocolate chip scone or sun butter cookie.
They have a raw food menu on Thursday nights too which I'm super excited to try.
