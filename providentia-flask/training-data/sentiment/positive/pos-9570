Last night in anticipation of an event I was throwing, I agonized about where to order pizza from for my party in the Newmarket area. I scrolled through Yelp and even Google but as Newmarket is still growing on Yelp in terms of review content I ended up rolling the dice and going with Naples. 

I phoned them up earlier in the afternoon and asked to place and order for delivery for around 7pm. The gentleman I spoke with on the phone (whom I assume was the owner) was very friendly and had great telephone mannerisms (hard to describe but you know what I'm talking about when someone is not just taking orders but is also helpful and friendly). 

After consulting with the man about his types and sizes of pizza and how many guests I was having we agreed on 6 extra larges (each starting at around $16 for plain cheese and sauce). I upped the toppings on 5/6 pies and had two pepperoni and bacon, two deluxe and one vegetarian ordered. 

In total my bill came out to $140 and change, extremely reasonable for hosting a pizza party for
36 adults. 

How was the pizza? Wow. I was amazed. The toppings were fresh, the sauce had a lovely slight sweetness to it that didn't stand out but mixed in well. The crust was excellent and I'm
Not sure how it was cooked but it had a crispy crust on it which made each bite as good as the last. Even later in the evening when most pizza gets cold and soggy this 'za held up. 

I probably ate more than I should have, but I dare you to order a pizza from Naples and not do the same. Probably the reason they've been in business in Newmarket for over 40 years. 

Eatcrest OUT!
