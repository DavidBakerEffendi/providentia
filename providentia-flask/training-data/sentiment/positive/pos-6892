I'm a HUGE fan of the Silverton Casino. 

My review is based on the Casino atmosphere and dinning, since I've never booked a room on the property.

There is so much to do for such a tiny locals casino! To start their new sports book area and betting has improved greatly! If you've ever been to The Palms Sport Book it is very similar to that but on a slightly smaller scale. Plus for major sporting events they put out extra tables and seating areas along with a cute hot dog stand! 

The dinning is good, there is a lot of different places to choose from between Johnny Rockets, Twin Creeks, their Buffet and Cafe they cover a great variety. Plus there is going to be a new food spot so there will be an update to come! 

It really is a local casino, I always see a familiar face whenever I go. They always have great promotions going if your a card holder.
