The brisket stack was phenomenal, Mike the GM came to check on our table and had a great conversation with my wife and I. It is refreshing to get both exceptional food and service. My wife loves the pork and grits. Special kudos go out to Charles in the kitchen !!!   We will be back - open a Peoria location !!!! 

Visited on April 29.  Have previously given this place five stars... While the brisket stack today was again excellent - they changed the portion on their other signature dish - the pigs and grits as shown on DDD.   Tonight's dish was all grits and very little pig, the pig that it did have contained some bone, and overall it was extremely dry no sauce

Tonight I give it a 2 star and this was about our eighth trip overall and we are very disappointed

May 2 update -  As noted in the above reviews, I have been to the Thumb many times before and it has been beyond excellent on every occasion except the last. My intent on the review of last week was not to be overly critical but only to let Mike know of my experience. Mike as an owner, visits the tables, checks on his customers, and is known for his friendliness and follow up. Well -- Mike saw my review, contacted me personally and offered to send me a gift card to make up for the one less than perfect experience that I had. I could not be more impressed with Mike following up and caring about me and his customer base, you see far too little of that in today's society

I will head back to Tom Thumb as soon as possible -- I highly recommend it, the menu items as seen on DDD are exceptional.  Thank you Mike for reaching out, thank you for caring about your customer base, thank you for caring about your establishment and the product that you present, you are indeed a class act sir

Mike - May 5th.   A DAMN INCREDIBLE meal at the THUMB.   Anyone who has not eaten here and sampled the pork or the brisket is missing out !!!
