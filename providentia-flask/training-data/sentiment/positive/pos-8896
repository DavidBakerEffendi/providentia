They have Japanese food on the menu that you will have a very difficult time finding anywhere else, which makes them unique.  It feels and tastes like a home cooked meal, and the three times I have been they have had great service and consistently good food.  

Take a break from sushi bars and try this out instead, you won't regret it.
