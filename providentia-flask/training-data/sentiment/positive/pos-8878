I can't wait to go back here!

When we arrived there was a wait to get in, and I can understand why. The food is amazing!
The d√©cor is minimal but colorful. The place is a little loud, which I actually thought made it more fun.

The menu is large and everything looks delicious. I ended up ordering the Camelback Panini with broccoli cheese soup.
WOW, the soup was heavenly and the Panini was grilled to perfection. I also go to sample an omelet, a pancake, a side of sausage and eggs benedict.
Every bite was better than the last.

I plan on dining here as often as possible to try as much as the menu has to offer!
