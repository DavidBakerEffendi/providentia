Amazing service and very flavorful food has made this our Brampton Indian restaurant of choice. Everyone we have brought has been a real fan of the food and staff. I've tried nearly the entire menu and I'm always pleased with new discoveries.

It also has a great and affordable bar. Free delivery is also a bonus, though we've not tested this as we prefer visiting on site.
