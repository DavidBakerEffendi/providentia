Lou's is a little "hole in the wall" gem that I came across about 2 years ago while searching and searching for an east coast diner type place here in the little old desert.

One of the reasons that I give Lou's 5 starts is because they have "old fashioned", no frills, down home eats .... Things like Creamed Chipped Beef which most people out here don't even know about.  

Everything at Lou's is made from scratch.  They are open limited hours - like 6am to 2pm and are closed on Sundays and maybe Mondays (I can't remember).  Lunch specials are about $6.99 and they include salad or soup - you really can't beat it.

I normally come here on the weekends for cream chipped beef - something my mom always made but for whatever reason - it's damn near impossible to find the proper dried beef out here. 

In addition to the creamed chipped beef - we've also ordered french toast, various sandwiches from tuna melts to clubs and I've also had their home made New England clam chowder and chicken n' dumplings.  You seriously CANNOT beat $7.99 for a big ole' bowl of chicken n' dumplings and a cup of clam chowder.  The claim chowder is seriously one of the best chowders that I've had in Vegas.
 
The owners are a very friendly husband and wife who are often seen sitting in their "office" (a booth in the back of the restaurant) and the staff is ALWAYS friendly.  The male half of the couple does all of the baking and he makes some GREAT pie as well as some moist as chocolate layer cake.
