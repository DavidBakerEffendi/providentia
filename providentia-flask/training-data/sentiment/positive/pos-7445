Went here on a Sunday night and ordered brisket sandwich and my companion ordered the pork sandwich.  It's a pretty simple menu--you can get either a combo dinner or a sandwich plate, and both of em come with two sides.  I got the side salad & sugar fried donuts, he got the french fries and pasta salad.  Side salad=basically straight from a "American" salad bag with a packet of dressing on the side.  Sugar fried biscuits reminded me of beignets.

Anyways, onto the important stuff--the BBQ! I usually get pulled pork when at a BBQ place and was not disappointed. Rich and tender, good flavor, without an overly greasy mouthfeel like some places. was very happy with my meal. I am no BBQ expert, but the meat was tender and the BBQ sauce had a nice vinegar tang with some heat (not very hot, though). 


Atmosphere is very casual, paper plates, paper towel on the table, etc but service was very good.  The employee got our food out to us right away, cleared plates promptly, and even went out of his way to check the football score.

My only request to Smoky John is to turn up the heat in winter...the place is always a little cold with the door constantly opening and closing because of customers coming in.

My #1 BBQ place in Madison...plus while you are (briefly) waiting you can look at all the crazy little pig statues and BBQ awards for Smoky Jon's.
