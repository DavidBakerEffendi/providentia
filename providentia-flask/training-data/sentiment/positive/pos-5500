Love watching these beautiful fountains whenever I'm walking the Strip.  I'm a local, and have gotten to experience them many times.  I really like that they're every 15 minutes; if it's anytime during the day and night (before midnight), you won't have to wait long to see a show.  As of right now, I haven't experienced the same song twice.  This and their indoor garden make the Bellagio my favorite casino in all of Las Vegas.
