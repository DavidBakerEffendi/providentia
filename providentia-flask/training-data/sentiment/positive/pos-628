A wonderful place - a little house converted into a cozy indie coffee shop and restaurant. 

The food is amazing and reasonably priced. The entire pastry case contains yummy things, especially the coconut cake - and I don't even like coconut. Their veggie sandwiches, pizza and savory scones are delicious. They have coffee, tea, cocoa, Italian soda, beer, and wine.

The atmosphere is adorable - lots of cute little rooms, tons of cute decor, wonderful indie art and great attention to detail. Check it out soon and you'll get to see it all decked out for Christmas!
