This was good, I secretly didn't want it to be good though. I often have a resistance to restaurant chains, but Mod Pizza is good and healthy apparently.

I ordered their "Dillon James," which is basically a Margherita Pizza. However once I saw they had Pesto. I thought I can have a fancy cheese pizza anywhere. So I decided, I must seize this pesto pizza moment. Sadly enough pesto pizza is becoming an endangered entree.

So I played with the Dillion James recipe by subbing and adding with a caption cloud above my noggin of me wearing a lab coat, safety goggles and holding beakers looking smart and such. The red sauce..gone, in is the pesto and tagging along was his friend ricotta.

Washed it all down my gullet with a pompous craft draft San Tan Devils Ale and it just couldn't stop there. I also had a pretentious can of San Pellegrino Blood Orange bubbly agua. This pizza deserved the beverage theatrics. I'm like this most of the time dining out....okay all the time, Happy now!!

I do what I want, and what I want is bespoke craft pizza....deal with that.!!!

Stay Calm and Dine On.
