Short and sweet - this is what you should order to make it a great and incredible experience:

Appetizer:
Oysters Rockefeller or Bucket of Clams

Entree:
5 lb. stuffed lobster (not on the menu)
(the body cavity doesn't go to waste! they stuff it with giant scallops, bread stuffing, and crab)

Your entree also comes with a side salad (do the Tarragon dressing), baked potato and veggies.

The server will crack everything for you and sometimes the claw is so large, they have to take it to the back so the chef can do it for them. But most of the time, they can crack it using their leg as the "table".  Amazing staff, always.

The hubs and I have been going here every year for our anniversary for the past 11 years and we have never, ever, ever been disappointed.  Trust me!
