Come on it is Vegas baby!!!! The Venetian/Palazzo combo (it really is both hotels together) is the 2nd largest hotel in the world. By square footage it may be the largest. With that said it is gorgeous inside and out. The suites are very nice, the view makes it or breaks it. The Venazzo (Venetian + Palazzo) have everything you could ever need or want within its doors.
