This place is such a gem! Not only is this place adorable and chic, but the food is outstanding! You can't choose your menu as it is a degustation chef's menu; however they will work with allergies and to accommodate you.

The price itself is only $89 per person, which if you've been to any degustation restaurant you'd know it was a steal! It comes with 4/5 courses however they add more to make you feel like you're getting more for your money which is always nice. So in the end there were a total of 9 courses.

The service was amazing and you can tell the passion and love for the restaurant from the waiter. He was also so nice, he gave us a private tour of the kitchen and a little historical background of the restaurant.

I highly advise anyone who is considering this place to make a reservation and get excited to eat here!
