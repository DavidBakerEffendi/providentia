The thing i like about this place is the selection and it is all very fresh!    The coupons really help as well. It is always very clean here,the kitchen and dining area.   So no problem there. Soup is fantastic and if you can't find what you like ,then you are very picky.     Something new that they have started is charging for special toppings.     Which can really up your bill.  But, other than that, you cannot beat the choices.  Bathrooms are somewhat clean. I am sure it is hard to deep up with it all the time. Lots of parking in the lot.
