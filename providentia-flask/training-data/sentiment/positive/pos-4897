We recently fell into an affair with Indian food. If they cook it, we have/will eaten/eat there! It led to a search of cookbooks with many spices I had no clue where to find locally. A little search on Yelp popped up this little gem that meets both my eating and cooking wants! 

The BF and I ate at the food booth in the back and shared a  vegetarian thali (comes with 2 dishes-among several choices, dal, rice, pickles, 2 bread:$5.99), samosa chat (I believe $3.99) and a paneer stuffed paratha w/ yogurt ($2.99). It was plenty of food for two and all very nice. I am a big fan of the samosa chat here though. The chutneys were fresh and vibrant and kept me going for more. There is a water cooler and a hot tea dispenser that is complimentary but there is also various drinks in the fridge area. If you're in the area and want a tasty snack or a nice veggie meal, definitely drop in. 

Grocery side has everything we were looking for! They have also some more common spices that I decided to get here as the prices are really good. For example, I almost bought a $6 jar of cinnamon sticks at the grocery and it's $1.99 for the same amount here. A nice sized jar of spices start are mostly about $1.99 with the harder to find spices like green cardamom pods are around $4, very few are over that. For those who need spices in mass quantities, they have huge value bags as well and they seem to be a better deal than buying at Sams/Costco. I also hoped I can find some fresh herbs and they indeed had fresh curry leaves and fresh fenugreek. If you're not into the cooking stuff, there are plenty of tasty and interesting looking snacks and prepared packs of food. We bought a few heat and eat packets and some were good and some not. I suppose it's hit and miss, but hey, it's packet food and isn't anything like the fresh. 

Eat, cook and be merry!
