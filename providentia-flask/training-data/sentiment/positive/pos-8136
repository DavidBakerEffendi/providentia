Heard positive things about this place so I was happy when a friend suggested it for our breakfast today. It's in a nice area and has great decor with an open setting. We didn't notice they had a patio until we left, and it was really nice. We would've rather eaten there! Everyone was friendly and the waiter checked up on us plenty of times. 
This is probably one of the longest menus I've seen at a breakfast place, which usually overwhelms me. Just give me one page and limit my options! But seriously, a great selection and lots of lunch choices too. I ordered the sun-dried tomato, goat cheese and pine nut omelette. Delicious combo! I got hash browns and pancakes on the side, both great and the cakes are huge. Overall I really enjoyed this place and hope to come back.
