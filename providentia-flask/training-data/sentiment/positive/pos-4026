I call this Little Koreatown in Vegas. Prices are awesome. Food court is great. When facing the entrance there's a puppy store on the left for your puppy fix. On the right is a great, authentic Korean restaurant called Lee's. Next to Lee's is a Vegan place that I have yet to try. The snack aisle in Greenland has a great selection that's reasonably priced. Love the section in the back with Korean household stuff like socks for your chair legs to avoid scuffing up the floors.
