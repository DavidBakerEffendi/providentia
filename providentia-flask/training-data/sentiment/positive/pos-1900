I arrived at the funky lil joint this morning, and was pleasantly surprised that I did not have to sit in the long stream of cars in the drive-thru line. The gentleman at the window was friendly and patient, he suggested the Vanilla/Honey Latte Iced, this was my first experience here so I was grateful for the suggestion. It was FANTASTIC! I also ordered the breakfast burrito which was delicious, (their home made salsa was perfect) & it did NOT weigh 10lbs so I still feel fantastic after devouring it, not like I want to curl up, clenching my stomach, and sleep for 10 days. The service was also prompt, and the gal who walked my order out to my car was super friendly! Prices were very reasonable as well! This experience sure beats out the long line, hasty service, tiny over-priced cups of joe, and hard pastrys, at your local chain Starbucks. They also serve a great variety of craft brews and wines and, have a comfy, dog friendly, patio! I will definitely be back when I am in the area again! Support LOCAL, check this place out, you'll be glad you did!
