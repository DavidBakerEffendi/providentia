Several of us who are blind visited this restaurant after an NFB meeting in Tempe.  Wow, what a find!  Our server was Alexa (just like the Amazon Echo) and she would get an A++++++ for helping us with menu selections, paying, etc.  Kudos to the owner (who also helped guide us to the table, etc.) and Alexa for service  ABOVE and BEYOND!  I had a veggie pizza and it was fantastic!  I will be back, and soon!
