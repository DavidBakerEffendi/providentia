First off, thanks to GM Michael for taking the time to read my review (and others) and act on the complaints/suggestions. Many owners/managers have written me, but few have gone to this extent to make sure I was satisfied (including texting me). Not going to recap my old review, but the side dishes were much improved and the brisket sandwich was stacked with that same excellent brisket from my previous visit. I would even suggest to get the sandwich over the platter due to more meat. They even added a new cole slaw which is mayo based and that was my favorite. The vinegar slaw was much improved with celery salt and the mac and cheese has returned to the original recipe and now includes Ritz cracker crumbs instead of panko. The staff is very friendly and for me - finding Mello Yellow Zero in the freestyle machine was a plus. Once again, thanks for bringing me back from the dark side.
