Came back to this little gem and another amazing experience.  We had the lasagna and ravioli with Alfredo sauce (feel free to drool). We chose the white wine, had salads and cappuccinos too! Everything was fantastic. We got there pretty late and they were still very polite. Can't wait to come back to Vegas and eat here again!
