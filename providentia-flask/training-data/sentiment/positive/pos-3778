ATMOSPHERE: Its a small takeout restaurant with few spots to sit down inside. Its pretty clean and the menu is small but its because they excel in what they make.

FOOD: Awesome. The chicken was super flavourful, juicy and just perfect. Fries were awesome (best I've had) and rice is delicious. Also the portions are ENORMOUS. I couldn't even finish my dish in one sitting. Everything was on point. I would definitely come back here again if I was in the area.

PRICE: Super affordable. The prices range from 5-10$ and this place is definitely a bang-for-your-buck spot.

SERVICE: Servers are super friendly and nice. They're welcoming and are happy to give you as much food as possible as efficiently as possible.
