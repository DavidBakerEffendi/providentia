Wow my new favorite Latin restaurant in Las Vegas!!!! I cannot say one single bad thing about it. The decor was very tasteful and the ambiance with the salsa, merengue and bachata music playing at a reasonable volume where you can enjoy a conversation, but still jam to the music was awesome. For appetizers we had the empanadas which were filled with ground beef, rice, beans and plantains was phenomenal. We also ordered the chicken chicharrones which I initially thought was only going to be the fried skin, but it was not... it was like chicken wings that were flashed fried and it had an amazing spicy sauce to it. For our main courses we had the Brazilian style steak with grits and that by far was the best plate of the evening. The grits were very flavorful and the steak was so tender I could cut it with my fork without using a knife. My partner had the halibut with the plantains and the halibut came with a mango sauce it was so flaky and tender, I have to say I was one of the best fishes I've had this year. Save room for dessert, the tres leches and the bu√±uelos were to die for. When you go there ask for Monica to be your waitress as her service was beyond exceptional, she knew all the highlights of all the plates and recommended her favorites which is what we ended up choosing and we did not go wrong. I'm dying to go back and try their brunch all I heard from all the employees there is that brunch is even better than dinner. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're at the Venetian or you're in the mood for Latin fair. Even though this place considers itself Peruvian fusion food, I have to say that there were strong influences of Cuban, Nicaraguan, Venezuelan and Argentine flair to it. Staff is very nice and they made the dining experience so much more worth it. I can't wait to go back.
