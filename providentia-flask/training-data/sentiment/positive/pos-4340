What a great find!

Came here with a friend for a very late lunch. 
We were there for tapas menu, we had a few items off the tapas menu (shishito peppers - spicy but so yummy, and the buffalo cauliflower) and they were all great!
I also had a salad (wild chop salad); the portion size was huge. It was enough for two meals. Maybe not as amazing as the tapas items, but very fresh and tasty. The dressing stool out as really delicious!
Our waitress was great; she was really sweet and we never felt rushed.
The restaurant itself has really cute decor, and is super clean.
As a vegetarian I will definitely be back to try other menu items!!
