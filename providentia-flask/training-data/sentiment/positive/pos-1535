I've been awaiting the opening of Crispy Banh Mi!  I ordered the grilled pork banh mi (my usual) and it met all my expectations and more.  I noticed the bread was way softer than more places I visit so that was a plus.  I also ordered the Mango Tango. Soo soo good!  It was a nice mixture of fruit and I topped it off with the passion fruit toppings. The customer service is superb.  You really feel welcomed and valued. I'll  be back again for lunch!
