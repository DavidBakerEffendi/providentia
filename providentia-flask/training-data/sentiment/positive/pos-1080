What can be said about Egg Works other than our whole Family loves it and we bring all out of town visitors to eat here and they all agree... This place is the best of the best for breakfast and lunch!! Stop by for a muffin or enjoy they're AWESOME Fall Menu!! My 7 month old cant get enough of the beef stew. She's addicted. So am I. Service, food, atmosphere, it's all good here everyday of the week. 
*weekends are busy but worth the wait if you have the time *
