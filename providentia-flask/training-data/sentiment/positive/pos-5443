Long time coming

been away from yelping for no particular reasons!! 

decided to regive it a go

so Mr Smith... been there a couple of times during summer season (nice cozy terrasse in the back, noizier one on the street) i love the atmosphere, very local, no dress code, just good times. 
food is pretty good (not a huge menu, but does the main thing wich is filling up the belly and giving u more reasons to drink!!)

during hockey nights they have some tvs AND a huge screen so check it out. 

but what i love most is hanging late nights with great music, no place to dance but you make place and a pretty nice crowd... oh and it's walking distance from my place... so bring on the Jamieson shots!!

That's why they call him Mister
