First time here with the gf, she had been begging to show me the place after coming here with her girlfriends during their nights out. Totally worth the trip! Had the meat jun (naturally) and it was bomb. I'm still looking for something to fill the void that Yummys/Tasty's from back home has left in my heart but for now this spot is definitely my #1 go to.

Place was cozy and casual, staff were beyond friendly/sweet/kind and attentive. I felt bad that neither of us had any cash to leave a tip, they deserved it and more. Come check it out already!
