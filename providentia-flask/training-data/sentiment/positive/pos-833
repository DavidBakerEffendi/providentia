All I ask for is good food and good service. This place had friendly & attentive service and awesome food! YES!!!! 

The wait was about 5-10 minutes on a Saturday evening. The hostesses greeted us with a friendly smile. Peanuts available from a large barrel while you wait, toss the shells on the ground? 

I don't care much for chain restaurants, but this place had reasonable prices for delicious steaks and ribs. You can order a combo or add ribs or grilled shrimp to your entree for an additional cost. The food was fantastic! The salad dressing is made from scratch, not from a bottle. They offer fresh rolls. Our food arrived on time. 

What a fun overall ambiance too! Looking forward to our next visit!
