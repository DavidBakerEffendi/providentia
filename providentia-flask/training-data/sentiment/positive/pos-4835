My boyfriend and I were visiting from Oshkosh, WI (planning our move to the Phoenix area).  We wanted to watch the Packer game with some fellow cheese heads and this place came up with a simple google search.  It was awesome - flat screens all over, a decent menu, and excellent service- Also, the GO PACK GO chants made us feel right at home.  We will definitely be returning in the future.
