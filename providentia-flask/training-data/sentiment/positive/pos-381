This place is awesome! 
The prices are great, its clean, they actually use vegetable oil and NOT LARD.
Thats right folks, I can actually go through this place late at night and get myself a burrito without the worry of lard! 
YES!  Thank you Federicos! 
I am so looking forward to getting my Black bean/refried bean cheese burrito mix from them. They are located right next to my 2nd job and they are the bomb. 
Also, the burritos are big XD. 
You will not be disappointed either your stomach or wallet if you stop in here.
