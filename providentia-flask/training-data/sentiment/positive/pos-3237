I love Chinese food, however, it's hard to find a place that is good. This place by far is the best I've had. The prices are cheap for all the food you get. The best thing is they aren't stingy with the meat. I had a ton of shrimp and chicken in my rice. The service is good and fast!  I definitely will be coming back and recommending this place.
