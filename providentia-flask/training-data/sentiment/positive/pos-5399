Hands down, easily the best sushi in Phoenix and surrounding areas. H3 roll and Ahi Tower are to die for along with their dry sake.  

I had previously left a poor review about their service but I am here to correct that judgement. We just ate here again with our 7 month in tow and staff was wonderful.
