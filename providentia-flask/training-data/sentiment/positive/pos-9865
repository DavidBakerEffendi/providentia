Tried the Ginger Monkey for the first time today with my husband. We started with the Kung Pao Calamari and it was fantastic! Great amount of heat, flavor, and the Calamari itself was very tender! Loved the sauce, aoili, and the bed of cellophane noodles was fun (and added a great crunch!  Entr√©es:  I had the short rib manicotti and my husband had the pork chop. I don't think I'll be trying any of the other menu items for a while because I am enamored with the manicotti!!! The cheeses are gooey and bring the best flavor combined with the short rib. Seriously, omgogosh on this dish!!  My husband is harder than I am to impress and he was so happy with the pork chop. His exact words were 'top notch.....juicy, flavorful, and the apple, onions, and gravy were right on. The Brussels sprouts = perfection. 

Service was good. Not overly friendly but we never wanted for drinks so that was great! The hostess was very welcoming and friendly. A gentleman brought our appetizer out and he was very personable!! (he may have been one of the managers/owners). We will be back for sure!!
