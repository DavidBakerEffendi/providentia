Great food & service. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. We went with a large group & the restaurant was very busy. We were seated after about a ten minute wait. Our server was very helpful & offered drink & food suggestions. My husband and I shared the fajitas for two (steak & chicken) & it was plenty of food. We also had margaritas. I didn't love the house margarita so I upgraded to the Cabo Wabo which was delicious.
