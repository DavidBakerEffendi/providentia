I've been recently visiting this place more often because they're open late, and they ALWAYS fulfill my sushi cravings late at night!

The service here is phenomenal, late at night there's usually only one waitress serving the place, but she always does a great job, very pleasant.

The sashimi is always fresh, and they're flexible when it comes to substitutions because I mainly like to eat Salmon more than any other fish.

The seatings in this place are very comfortable, not too loud, and lots of room.  Recently found out that this restaurant has taken a part of the Lexus Platinum members group so you can get 10% off if you have the discount card from Lexus! They also have $10.99 pitchers of Sapporo or $4.99 for a pint after 10PM as their special.

I will always be coming here from now on whenever I'm craving for sushi late at night!
