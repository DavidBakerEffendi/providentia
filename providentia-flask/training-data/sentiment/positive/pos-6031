I really don't understand what another reviewer meant by the potato tacos being bad, they were excellent! Had a friend try one of them and she loved it as well. They were cooked perfectly and the sauce in the tacos had a good flavour and really complimented the tacos.   Also not sure why the other reviewer complained about using store-bought tortillas. This isn't some crazy authentic mexican place in the barrio that has homemade everything...not surprised by the tortillas at all. Also had the homemade lemonade and it had a really good flavour and nice tartness. Will totally be going again to try more things. Highly recommended!
