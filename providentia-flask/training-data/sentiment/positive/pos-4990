Had a great dinner experience tonight this place has the best tasting vegetable soup its all vegetarian taste almost like manoodle with that touch of indian food spice I absolutely love it and it doesn't tast like ministrony. Add papadome crackers with your soup its completely free. The same with the salads they have the best dressing sauce. For only $4 they give you a huge salad! That filled me up quick maybe because I'm pregnant. I did order a chicken tandoori  I didn't know what it would look like and I wasn't up to having anything spicy or with their famous red sauces because  my appetite has been wack lately with this baby. They brought the Chicken and my stomach turned the waitress and waiter was so polite and understanding they took the chicken away and didn't even charge us! My fiance and son ordered a big feast of food.  So at the end they even gave us 15% off our bill it was so nice I felt bad about the Chicken so in return gave them a big tip. Honestly I can go here every single day to eat their soup, salad and papadome I'm definitely going to be stopping by here more often because its perfect for me and my appetite.
