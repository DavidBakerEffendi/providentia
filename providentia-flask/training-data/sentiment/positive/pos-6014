I never used to be big on Texas Roadhouse, but lately I can't get enough of it. I realized that I was never particularly fond of their burger, which is what I used to order before I discovered that their BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich was the best thing ever. Now that is all I order here and all I ever want to order, because it is so good. I also love the loaded fries with bacon and cheese! And obviously everybody knows that their bread rolls are one of the best things about coming here. Those butter rolls are so addictive that I am almost full before the main course even arrives.

The wait staff is usually quite good, although one thing I don't like about the restaurant is that it is very loud, although I guess that is to be expected for a place like this. I still think its a very fun experience!

So what a difference a few years makes! I never was excited about my family deciding to eat at Texas Roadhouse, but now I am the one suggesting to come here (although I still wouldn't recommend the burger)!
