Hands down beats Roberto's or algobertos  ANYDAY..  Portions are always HUGE! Very informative and explains anything and everhthing about Jeff's tacos.. Green and red sauce are the best! The mini chicken tacos are amazing! 
Make sure your hungry when you come here. You will got lots of food. Good food at that! Real big limes as well none of those tiny shit ones! They also grill the mini taco tortilla just a tad bit so that the tacos don't fall apart.  Make the stop and go to Jefes you won't be disappointed. Located inside the sinclairs gas station!!
