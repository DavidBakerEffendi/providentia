I was staying down at The Plaza for a week long event and was dying to get out of there.  So my friend and I took a stroll down Freemont Street and happened upon the Golden Nugget.  We cruised in and found the Grotto.  Italian food...PERFECT.

It was a Tuesday night but it was very crowded.  We were seated within a few minutes and the gluttony began.  We started with Stuffed Mushrooms...always a perfect start.  We ordered a bottle of Reisling Wine...can't remember which brand but it was good.  We both left with a little buzz and that was even after we ate so much.  Next we moved onto the Tomato Caprese Salad...delicious.  

For my main course I ordered the Penne Diavolo and my friend got the Seared Sea Bass.  Both dishes were superb.  And what meal wouldn't be complete without a little Creme Brulee to top it off.  Our service was excellent and the food was wonderful...by far the best meal I had my entire stay in Vegas.

We had to walk around Freemont Street to keep from going into a food coma but it as well worth it.  I'll be back here again the next time I'm in the area!
