Delicious food! We order delivery from here at our workplace. The food is always hot, fresh and you can tell, handmade. The prices are incredible. 

Ordering over the phone is easy to do. There is always a friendly staff member who answers. The gentleman who delivers is friendly, thankful and professional. 

Their shredded beef has tons of flavor!
