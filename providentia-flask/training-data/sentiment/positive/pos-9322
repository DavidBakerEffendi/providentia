More people need to know about this! $10 is a steal for a fun Saturday night in Noda

This is an improv-style show and is put on by some great comedians The show changes based on audience suggestions and is truly hilarious. The show is R rated but not bad enough to where I felt uncomfortable bringing family...but use your best judgement. The show runs from 8-9:30 every Saturday - reservations are suggested but not mandatory. 

Venue was rustic, small and actually pretty cool! The bartender was serving up drinks at a reasonable $3-4 price and he wasn't too shabby to look at haha. He brought my dad some chocolate to go with the Guinness which I thought was a nice touch. One thing to note was that everything including bar was cash only. 

I'll be back with friends for sure!
