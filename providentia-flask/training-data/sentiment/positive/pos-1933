I am so glad I found this cute place right down the street from my house, they have so many great options on there menu that can be made for many different food intolerances or preferences AND my husband even enjoyed his food which is a total win for me. They have a pear Moscow mule that was awesome. We've tried the Baja Lime Wrap & the Paco's Pear Tacos, seriously give those a try they're AMAZING.
