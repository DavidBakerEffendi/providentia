Holy crap, waffle battered fried chicken?!?!!? Okay, this food truck wins. 
      I'm not really one to eat vehicular based foods, but today was junk food lunch day and they were close by and it smelled so good and I was tricked!! 
      They were fast, my food was made to order and piping hot. The truck was clean, the girl who took my order was friendly and sweet. The man behind the fryer was friendly and nice. And my waffle chicken fingers and fries were SUPER GOOD. 
    Were they tasty? Yes. Do I regret eating them? Yes. Will I do it again? Yes, but it will be at a time when I can take a nap immediately afterwards. 

Waffle. Fried. Chicken. For. The. Win.
