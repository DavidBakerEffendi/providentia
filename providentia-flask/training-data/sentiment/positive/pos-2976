Everything tastes as good as it looks and they really know to set the mood. They have perfect-sized starters, tacos, and quesadillas. The vegetarian/pescatarian options are mouth-watering (ie. rajas, camerones, and pescado). If you're looking for a refreshing beverage, the jamaica really quenches that thirst. To put the cherry on top, the staff are amazing and the prices are extremely reasonable!
