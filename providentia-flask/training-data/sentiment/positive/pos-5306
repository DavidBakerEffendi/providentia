Gimme Some Sugar has opened a dessert bar/bakery in Henderson.  It was opening day and the baked goods and treats were ready.  The place appears to serve desserts, coffee, and wine (not sandwiches/bread).  They don't open very early (11:00 am) and stay open up into the evening.  It would be a nice place for a casual date, conversation with friends, or an after movie/theatre/church snack. The owners might have come up with a nice niche for their business and hopefully it works because the desserts appear awesome.

The  service was very friendly and the pastry I  had (chocolate brownie/chocolate chip cookie) were really yummy.  The pastry looked like super quality stuff and from what I saw prices ranged from about $3 for cookies/brownies to $4 for very unique macarons to about $7 for very high-end cake desserts.  The more pricey desserts looked big enough to share with a date, spouse, or significant other.

The shop has about ten tables and is nicely decorated and clean.  It has a classy-artsy-bistro feel but is mellow with cool music.  It's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall at 215 and Stephanie, but it is not hard to find.
