My first Keg dinner experience was with Gayle and our Calgary friends (Jim and Kathy) at Banff. It was a great meal and a wonderful time together. That Keg had sort of a family lodge feel and was certainly a full step (or two) above Outback or Black Angus. 

A few weeks ago, I was on a business trip in Sarnia Ontario. After a full Friday work day, 3 of us decided to make the 3-4 hour drive up to Toronto (via the 402/401) for the weekend. There was a fair amount of truck traffic coming up, so we didn't roll into Centre City until around 10 PM. We were all tired and being a morning person, I would of been happy to check into the hotel and fade into the evening. However, my project leader (whose family lives in Scarborough) insisted that we have dinner together before she headed home. And with a Keg close by to our hotels, why not? 

This Keg took my Banff experience and added a cool city look and feel. Since there was a 20 minute wait for a dinner table, we started out in a bar that was filled with stylish and happy people who were starting their weekend. We sat at the bar and enjoyed our beer and appetizers and before we knew it, we were seated. 

When I'm in Canada, I tend to stick to local choices, including wine. The Niagara region in Ontario has some excellent choices, and to we found a delicious red that matched my most excellent "Bleu Cheese Filet" and some great conversations perfectly. 

It's nice when the stars align after a long and stressful day (especially when you initially didn't want to go to dinner). I went back to the hotel full and happy, with a deeper positive understanding of my colleagues and our company, and with directed motivation to have a great weekend in Toronto.
