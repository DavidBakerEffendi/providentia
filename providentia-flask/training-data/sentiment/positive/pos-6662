Went yesterday 9/5/14 and it was so great I felt compelled to write a review.  It was just such a perfect Olive Garden meal.  Everything was exactly how it should be. The salad was fresh and crunchy and the breadsticks were hot. I had the peccatore pasta and my husband had the vegetable lasagna.  Our waiter was always one step ahead of us in anticipating our needs.  A different waiter came by and congratulated my husband and I for our new baby.  And a manager came by to check on us.  I don't know what was going on over there last night but everything was on point! Way to go, Olive Garden.
