I've come to Flock multiple times, and it is consistently great. On one occasion, their kitchen was a bit backed up, they recognized that it was taking longer than normal and offered me a free beverage. I didn't take it, but I appreciated the gesture. My girlfriend and my go-tos are the rotisserie chicken and boho salad. They have a nice patio in the summer too and a nice selection of drinks. Whenever I mention flock to my girlfriend she gets excited. I think it's the balance of flavour while still being pretty healthy!
