Great Mediterranean food! Mediterranean is by far my most favorite cuisine. 

I ordered the combo plate; hummus, salad, chicken, beef and falafel. The flavors were amazing!! Perfectly seasoned, but not over the top. I'm usually not a big fan of falafel...however, I WILL MOST definitely eat it here. I literally cleaned my plate. It was also a good serving size. 

The gentleman that served us, was just that. Simply a gentleman. Checked on us and opened doors. Superb service!!! 

Try to homemade lemonade!! It was delicious.
