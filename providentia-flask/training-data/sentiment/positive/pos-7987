Sushisamba is my favorite restaurant ever! Be prepare to explore and enjoy an explosion of flavors and the most unique an rare dishes in a menu.
The ambiance of this restaurant is modern, a little noisy, the graffitis all over the wall are cool and modern. I personally love the Latin music in the background. 
The signature drink here are Caipirinhas: A Brazilian drink made with limes, sugar cane and cacha√ßa. 
Service is amazing! Ask for Issac, he is the best! He takes good care of you and just let him pick what to get you. Everything in this menu is different yet the best food you will probably ever experience. Here are some of my favorite dishes:
-Chilean Sea Bass: the best Sea bass you will ever taste, I promise. 
-Peruvian corn: this corn is amazing! Is not too sweet not to salty, just the best flavor.
-Coconut Rice: OMG! I can die happy after having this rice. I grew up eating coconut rice in the coast of Colombia, but this Rice I tell you it's SO AMAZING!  
-Sweet Plantains: Delicious yellow plantains
-Samba and Rio roll for sushi 
-Yellowtail taquitos
-Fried scallops 
-Lamb chops are a most have! Delicious, perfectly cooked. 
-Asparagus for the healthy eaters 
Then we you think you can't experience anything better. Here comes dessert  I have an obsession with DULCE DE LECHE ice cream, but I highly recommend the SAMBA SPLIT DESSERT. It's a combination and it's delicious and not rich.
