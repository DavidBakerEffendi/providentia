Spacious rooms and great customer service!   Walk in restroom with double sink, vanity, tub, standing shower and separate room with toilet.  Safe, robes, mini bar, full size hair dryer, printer, sunk in living room, dining table, three tv's.  All the amenities you can possibly want and probably don't have in your own master bedroom!

Great location on the strip.  Tons of shops and restaurants without having to walk far. 

Cons -  
1. Upgrade your toiletries!  
2. Get rid of your mini bar sensors. We used our mini bar to store some leftover food and got charged for drinks in the mini bar.   However, the front desk waived the charges.  
3. Door Locks - Our door lock kept getting stuck.  Once in a while, we couldn't get into our room because the sensors were off or the battery was low. 
4.  Having to show security our room key each time we walked to the elevators.
