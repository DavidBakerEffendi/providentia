We stopped by on a recent Sunday afternoon.  It was surprisingly quiet here.  Turns out that they opened very recently.  This will all change when baseball season starts.  They have a prime location right across the street from PNC.  We were greeted by the bartender who helped us pick a table.  Our server Krystal is the sweetest person ever.  She was very helpful with recommendations and advice and we appreciated that.

For my drink, I took a queue from Tim W.'s review and got the Thai Coconut Tea.  The drink was so so good, I had two.  Very refreshing.  BJ got his usual beer after trying a sample at the bar.

We started with the Goat Cheese Crostini with forest mushroom, honey and parsley.  Who doesn't want an appetizer with honey?  So good.  BJ got a Shrimp Po'Boy.  It was served with yummy fries and were delicious.  I got a Buffalo Chicken Salad.  It was not at all what I was expecting.   The chicken wasn't your usual deep fried battered variety swimming in red hot.  If I had read the menu more closely, I would have been inquiring as to what piri-piri chicken is.  It's basically chicken marinated in a hot chile pepper marinade, then grilled.  It was really a nice surprise.  And I loved the combination of arugula and romaine lettuces and thinly sliced fresh radishes.  I was very impressed with my salad.  

Their dessert choices were limited, but the choices sounded great!  They offer a chocolate lava cake and s'mores cheesecake which I was really wanting to try.  Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert.  We really liked BZ's and plan to visit again soon.
