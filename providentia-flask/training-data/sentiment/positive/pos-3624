Didn't really know what to expect, but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The sushi was very good. The wait staff was very attentive and our waitress Candace was amazing. She was a lot of fun and had tons of energy, but in a good way that wasn't annoying. Will definitely be back to check the happy hour next time.
