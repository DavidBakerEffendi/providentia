Another osteria? Yes sure, but this is exceptional. As another addition to the Buca family - the Yorkville location's focus is finer - while the menu's of the King location are quite similar, the focus on southern italian seafood is greater at the Yorkville locaiton - and somehow, they have an even more refined touch in their service. Especially with serving and fileting fish table side - excellent little touch. Many different and new ingredients at this locations like tuna blood. 


Atmosphere wise - very nice - modern, bright and warm. Service is what you've come to expect from Buca, attentive and slow dining. Take your coat off, you'll be here a while. Note to the wise though, entrance is actually not on Scollard but just south next door to the FourSeasons hotel's courtyard.
