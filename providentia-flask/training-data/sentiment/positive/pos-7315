I had ramen hashi bookmarked on my yelp since they first opened. I finally got to try this place over the weekend, and I am pretty satisfied with their shio ramen. It was a bit salty, but then again I did order "salt" ramen. I expected the broth to be heavy, but it was rather light (which is perfect!!). I will definitely come back to satisfy my ramen cravings.
