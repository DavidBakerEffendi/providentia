I have to give this place a 5 star!  Not the fancy type of restaurant but solid fresh delicious food, real cooking and authentic taste, plus excellent service. What more can you ask for?  I've been here quite a few times, loved the service, cozy and warm ambience, they only serve what's fresh and in season. All the dishes I had were fantastic. Anything from salad, pasta dishes, pork chop with bone in to desserts tasted delicious with a homemade flare. Presentations were great as well!  Highly recommended if you live nearby. Please note this place is small, reservations recommended. If there's one down side to this restaurant-the menu is not extensive, as I said earlier they served fresh and in-season items so their menu changes from time to time.
