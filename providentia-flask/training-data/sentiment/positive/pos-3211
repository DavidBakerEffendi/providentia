My bf and I ordered a veggie pizza with hot wings. We were told it was going to take 45 minutes to an hour for delivery. Our food arrived in about 30 minutes. Quite surprise but it was better for us of course! The pizza was very delicious and filling! The hot wings were cooked well and had a nice hint of spice. Peep the photo :)
