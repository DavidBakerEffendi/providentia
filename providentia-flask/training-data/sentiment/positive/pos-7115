WOW!

This restaurant has a well-earned reputation.  Having eaten pizza in some of the best restaurants in New York, Chicago (and God forbid California), I have to say that this restaurant does beat them all hands down.

Let's get to the pizza.  Wood fired oven.  Great crust.  Fresh mozzarella.  Unbelievably flavorful tomato sauce.  Fresh basil.  Perfectly cooked.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Best.  Pizza.  Ever.

And because we came on a Sunday, we got to have the Sunday Gravy.  This is a meat sauce made with the trimmings of sausage, brisket, meat.  It's a deep, dark tomato sauce, slow cooked, and just rich as all hell.  Over some fresh pasta.  Just an excellent pasta dish that we shared among all four of us.

Service was impeccable.  The environment was like a campagna according to the wife.  

Wish I could give this place 6 stars.  Maybe I'll dock a star off of all of my other ratings.
