We became huge fans of Tapas when we travelled to Barcelona. We have tried almost every tapas/catalan style restaurant in Montreal, and this is by far the best!

Service is impeccable, they give you space and time, they don't push but they certainly don't forget you, and make sure you have what you need (which replicates well the atmosphere we had in Barcelona, where you can take your time to enjoy eating, and talking).

Prices are quite reasonable given that you are in the heart of the old port, and even by Montreal standards. The wines could be a bit cheaper.

Last time we went, they had very few vegetarian options (Valentines day 2014), but we went this week and were quite happy to see a vegetarian section on the menu.

The ambiance is warm and welcoming, they have GREAT music, including live DJ.

Great place for a romantic night out. 

The food is absolutely delicious! We have tried every vegetarian dish on their current menu and were not disappointed by anything. We can even say that they have the best patatas bravas we have EVER eaten. And their crema catalana.... to die for.

Will definitely be coming back, and highly recommend.
