I truly believe that in today's world of social media, it is vital for a place of business, that is susceptible to reviews that the entire world can see and can determine whether or not that business is successful, to be very responsive to it's clientele's concerns.

My initial review for 800 Degrees was just a so-so food experience.  Great place, average pizza.  But as I love pizza, I am always willing to give a place another try if I think there is great potential.  This place definitely has great potential. Fantastic location and great personnel.
Management has invited me to return in hopes of improving my dining experience with some recommendations and I truly am impressed with their due diligence to satisify their customers, thus the 5 stars.
I will be returning to 800 soon and will follow-up with a dining review.  Looking forward to it.
