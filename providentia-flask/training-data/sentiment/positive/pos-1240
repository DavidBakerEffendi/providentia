11pm-3am happy hour...need I say more?!

I've always gone to PT's for drinks, but they continue to shorten their happy hour, which is now only 2 hours long. Additionally, all drinks are no longer 50% off. 

At this location, the bar itself is not the largest and it does not have pool tables, however, the price of drinks should be reason enough to come here. Their draft beers, house wines and certain liquors are $2 and appetizers are 1/2 off! 

The next time I decide to have a get together with friends for drinks, this is the place I'll be choosing.
