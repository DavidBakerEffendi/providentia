This is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to, definitely the best in Vaughan. The quality is better than most sushi places, but the price is the same. The atmosphere and decor is very nice, but I also order take out a lot, and its usually ready in 5 - 10 minutes. I should mention that the maki pieces are huge, and everyone I bring also agree that the sushi would be more enjoyable if the pieces were smaller, because it's a little hard to eat. I have been here many times, and I have never been disappointed. One time I ordered the salmon teriyaki for pick up, only to find they gave me chicken teriyaki when I got home, and they actually delivered the right order to me very quickly. If you are ever on your way close to closing, sometimes they leave a little earlier than the closing time if there are no customers, so call ahead of time to let them know you are coming.
