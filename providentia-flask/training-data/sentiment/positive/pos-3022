We happened upon this place after searching Yelp while in the area and I'm sure glad we did.  Biaggio was very friendly.  We both ordered a sandwich and cannoli.  The Italian sandwich was amazing and by far one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  Since neither of us ordered a slice of pizza, Biaggio brought over a slice for us to try while our order was being prepared.  The pizza had great flavor and crispy thin crust...perfect.
