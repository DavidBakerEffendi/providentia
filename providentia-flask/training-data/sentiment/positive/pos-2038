Bloom Bakery is amazing. I got really excited when I hard about this place because what could be better? A great cause, inspirational mission, and donuts. Yes, please! 

I finally stopped in for lunch with a friend and everything met my expectations. The staff was incredible, as was the smoked salmon sandwich and the beet salad. My friend I went with claims she doesn't like beets, but she liked that salad, so that's saying something. We stuffed ourselves and still went back for a dessert each. Her chocolate cake was decadent and delicious, but my key lime bar was better if you ask me. :) 

I can't wait to come back and relax with a donut in the morning or dig into another sandwich!
