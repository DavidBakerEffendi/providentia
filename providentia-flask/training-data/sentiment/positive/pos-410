It's impossible to have a bad meal at Monty's. I've never actually met him... but he is on to something! 

Why do I love it?
1. They have vegan shakes! Yes, vegan... now as a lactose intolerant vegetarian this was music to my ears. I ordered a vegan shake with walnuts and banana's. Oh em gee.... they give you a glass and a half. It's a lot. It could put you in a diabetic coma but who cares. I took it home and it took me 2 days to finish. Yes, it was a cheat day but I wasn't going for a setback.
2. They have/had vegetarian gravy. It was a special item on the menu one day - one of the best biscuits and veggie gravy I have ever had!
3. They have a TON of vegetarian options.... in fact too many. My indecisive excited brain just can't make up my mind. My hubby dare not order the same thing I do - because we have to share. 

We have brought our friends from Chicago here and they loved it as well.
