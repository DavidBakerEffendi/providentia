This is a great, new restaurant. I ended up here after most places were closed Sunday night and was not disappointed. It was happy hour so I opted to try a half price margarita which was fantastic - not too sweet like most places. A bag of duritos is a must, first one is free. I could best deaceibe them as Mexican funions. 

There are plenty of vegetarian options, I opted for the cauliflower taco which was phenomenal. I tried the crispy rice and beans as a side and that was decisions as well though a tad spicy. Another person in my group got the street corn which was a tasty blend of corn, cotija cheese and some kind of chipotle sauce. 

Super friendly staff, great food, awesome happy hour. Will definitely be back.
