Delicious Delicious Delicious!!! The fajitas are delivered on a wooden skillet sizzling straight from the grill!!! The chicken was spicy and moist, good enough to be eaten alone. It's a large amount of chicken, much more than the average restaurant.  It comes with 4 tortillas and a moderate amount of fillings (lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, beans, guacamole.) Friendly staff, manager and clean bathrooms!  Thanks Crystal for great service!
