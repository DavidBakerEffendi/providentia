This place is amazing. I work in the same complex and have not eaten here in awhile. After hearing they revamped the menu and hired a new chef I needed to try it out. I ordered one of their spinach wraps during lunch and I cannot say enough great things. I went in with 3 other co workers and everything we had was amazing. I will definitely be back more often. Jimmy is the new chef and he has definitely turned the place around not to mention the decor is very beautiful.
