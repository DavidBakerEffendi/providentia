My boyfriend and I went to O.Noir on a Saturday. I ordered the surprise appetizer and the surprise main course while my boyfriend ordered the surprise main course and the surprise dessert. I ended up eating the food with my hands because it kept falling off my fork. The food was good, but it didn't leave us feeling full. It was such a cool experience and our server was fabulous. I would recommend that you go to this place for the experience and not necessarily for the food.
