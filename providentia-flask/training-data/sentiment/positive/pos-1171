Second Helping has delicious soul food and a sweet tea chart to boost.  The best thing about this restaurant, it is good for the community and it employs women who have been incarcerated. 

Even if I didn't know that they were helping women, I would still love this place, black eye peas, sweet tea, homemade cakes and collards.  Count me in!!
