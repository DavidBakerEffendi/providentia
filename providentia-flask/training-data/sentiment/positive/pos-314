Mouthwatering!!!! I recently discovered this place and I am completely enamored! Coming from the east coast,  it's really hard to find quality bread let alone a cheesteak worthy of being called a Philly cheesesteak. Famous has perfected their culinary craft! ! I love mine with extra cheese (American) and their secret ingredient, love!! This family owned,  family run business care about what they create and the passion is revealed in the taste. Thank you Famous  Philly and keep up the amazing quality food and super service!! See you later this week!!!
