Delicious Italian food at affordable prices. I went here for dinner with a few friends last night and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service here. We ordered the gnocchi, seafood linguine and spicy salami pizza. All were very flavourful, mainly because the tomato sauce was so delicious. The portion sizes are quite generous too! The restaurant is small so it's best to make reservations if you don't want to wait for a table. They also have a small patio if you want to dine outside.
