This place is a dream come true for anyone who is gluten free and especially anyone who is newly gluten free (like me).  They now serve breakfast lunch and dinner. I love how they dont even need to advertise or flaunt that they are gluten free because even people who dont eat gluten free would enjoy thoroughly and probably wouldnt even realize.

I got the chicken and waffles and it was amazing. Better than any other chicken and waffles I have had in a long time. I went to lolo's a couple of times and always left feeling sick and bloated. This is not the case here at Jewels. You will be pleasantly full but wont feel disgusting. 

Check in on yelp and you will get a free (delicious) cookie. I can not wait to bring my non gluten free friends and boyfriend here because I know they will love it. 

I read some other reviews about the service being bad but me and 2 friends were here at around 930 am on a Sunday on Labor Day Weekend and there was no wait, the server was attentive and the food came at a normal speed. I can't complain about anything here. I can't wait to go back!!!
