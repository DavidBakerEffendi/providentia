I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!

Fastest service, kindest servers. Freshest sushi, not the best rolled. Cheap & always delicious. The servers explain the food when it comes out so your'e not just left looking at a plate like " wait... what is this? did we order this...?" Such a wide variety on the AYCE options as well.

Favorite spot for quick sushi and cute decor!
