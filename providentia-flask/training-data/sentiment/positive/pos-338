This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I can honestly say that this is the best steakhouse I've ever been to. It makes Claim Jumper look like McDonald's! Our server is usually Bruno, and he takes very good care of us. I always get the filet mignon, medium rare and it is always tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, and melts in my mouth like butter. My husband on the other hand, likes to order whatever the four-legged special is and he has yet to be disappointed. Most recently, he ordered the buffalo steak, medium rare. I tasted a bite and it was delicious. I wish that I had ordered it myself but that's what I get for not trying new things! As far as appetizers go, I like the oysters and crab. I'm not really a dessert person, but on Valentine's Day, our meal included a fruit and chocolate plate which was pretty good but again, I'm not a dessert person so it didnt really appeal to me. 

Writing this review has now gotten it into my head that my husband and I now need a date night so we can go to Anthony's!!
