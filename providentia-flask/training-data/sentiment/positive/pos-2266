Best wings ever.....  Original sauce with dry rub....   Also their homemade blue cheese I could drink and the funniest thing is I hate blue cheese!  Great deep fried mushrooms and tater tots as well.  Limited menu, very busy place, no waitresses, you order at the bar, fast service, friendly bartender and so on.  You basically come here for wings and that's that! 
This is one of those hole in the wall style places with literally the best sauced, seasoned, wings this guy has ever had.  I would say for anyone within a 3 state mileage range should drive here to eat these.  It should be on any foodie's bucket list.

Cash only!  ATM is available!
