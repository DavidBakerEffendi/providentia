Thank you fellow yelpers, this place is fantastic.  I have been wanting to come and check it out for a while.  This place is definitely worth the 52 mile round trip drive.  I had the carne asada burrito.  I had read so much about it I was salivating while my order was getting ready.  My hubby had one carne asada taco and one barbacoa.  Both were delicious, too.  We also ordered the guacamole, excellent.  This place is a little gem.  Can't wait co come back, I will try the fish platter another diner was having, it looked really good.
