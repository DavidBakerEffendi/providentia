You like Thai? What's the best Thai restaurant in the city, Chao Phraya? Phaya Thai? Thai Grill? WRONG!!! It's THIS little hole in the wall on Cote des Neiges and Cote St. Catherine.

I've dragged dozens of people in there, daring them to NOT call it the best Thai they've had in the city, and they universally come out agreeing with me. It's f---g delicious. Go try it.
