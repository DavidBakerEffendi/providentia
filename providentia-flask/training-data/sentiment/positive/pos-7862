does everyone come here for parties or occasions?  well me too. 

been here twice for birthdays. food has always been excellent. 


was here this weekend for a friends birthday in the private party room downstairs. 

good service from our waitress and the manager -- he 'managed' (yeah pun intended) to pop in from time to time to check on how we were doing. :)

Momentus Experience:

I had the best veal sandwich I've ever had in my life last night!

okay for dinner typically most people choose a pasta or a pizza perhaps. that what a majority of people from the table chose.

I felt like getting something light and different. so I chose a Panini specifically. 

Veal with tomato sauce, red peppers, mushrooms, in a warm panino


When the food started to arrive the server was wielding this Huge blue flying saucer asking who ordered the Veal Panini? Umm guess that was mine as my eyes popped out to size this up.. this sandwich was Humungi !!  How was I going to eat this? 

suspicious I thought to myself  why on earth do they give you so much? is the taste good?

When I bit into this it was heavenly, the panini was so soft, i could tell the bread was freshly baked.. i could taste the dusted flour, and the meat was so very tender and fresh. It was perfect. I was stunned!!

This sandwich also came with a boston lettuce salad? perhaps a bonus as it wasn't specified on the menu. thanks. it was very good too. 

The decor, ambiance, service and food were all great. It's not everyday you experience food made perfect. Ciao i got to give you props. i'll be back discovering your menu and celebrating my own 'invented' special occasions here. :D
