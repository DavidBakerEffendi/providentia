This is a swanky new restaurant & bar near the University of Illinois Campus. It is a huge space with a nice relaxed urban feel. There are many huge TVs and cool lightning all around. The people who work there are super friendly. I come here for lunch or dinner a few times a week. They have really good food specials and pricing. My favorite is the Spicy Siracha Burger. It's soooo good! If you haven't been to this joint, check it out soon. Great place for a date or social gathering!
