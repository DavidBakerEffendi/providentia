We went here for our anniversary dinner.  The menu here changes often, so I will just say that this place is a foodie's dream.  Fresh, innovative and tasty courses served by informative, polite and courteous staff.  Definitely get the tasting menu, and if it is not available, have them put together a selection.  You won't be disappointed.

It is intimate, so I wouldn't recommend for a large gathering.  But for a special dinner it is perfect.  I would make a reservation in advance, as it was quite busy.  And they have wine.
