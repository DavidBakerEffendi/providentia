I ordered the onion naan and lamb tikka marsala for take out.

The onion naan tasted like omelette in a bread.  It tasted soft and squishy.  It was so so.  I threw it away after trying to eat a few minutes.  Nowhere close to being the fresh oven baked naan I am used to.

The lamb tikka marsala was something else.  The lamb was very soft and tender.  Obviously slow cooked.  The sauce was excellent and had deep flavors.  The basmati rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Probably the best tikka marsala I've had in Phoenix.
