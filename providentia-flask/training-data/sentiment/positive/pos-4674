Wow this is a GREAT deli. I tried the corned beef sandwich and it was perfect. Simple and delicious and they will make it extra lean if you ask. 

My friend ordered a hot pastrami sandwich which was devoured so fast that I didn't even get a chance to try a bite. Apparently it was that good. 

We'll be back.
