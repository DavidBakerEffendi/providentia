I recently had lunch while waiting for my better half with me in Vegas. I did not know what I wanted but, Sushi was definitely top of mind. 

In my opinion every good meal needs a good beverage to go with it. I personally like to have a local beer, or one that matches the entr√©e. This day, I selected the Hitachino Red Rice Ale. 

It was an outstanding pairing with my sushi rolls and quinoa dish. 

The Sasa Handroll came with shrimp tempura, quinoa, shishito, spicy mayonnaise and red onion. It was an experience to eat, and should jot be missed. 

It was upstage only by the Quinoa Chaufa side, which was fried and topped with delicate plantains. These were the stars of the meal, and the two pedestrian rolls I ordered, were expertly prepared, and delicious. 

Well done!
