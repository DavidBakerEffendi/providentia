I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas and this one by far is my favorite!

For starters, the rooms are HUGE! It is like you are staying in your own mini apartment. The beds are comfy, the remote controlled blinds are very helpful on hungover mornings, and there are 3 tvs (one in front of the bed, one in front of the couch, and one in the restroom!)! Also, there is a printer for your own personal use that you can connect your lap top to, or insert your memory card in and print your documents/pictures. If it wasn't for the fact that you were in Las Vegas, you might probably never leave your room.

The casino is also very nice, the restaurants and clubs are great and open late, and if you are flying Southwest  you can pay ten dollars to check in your luggage and have your boarding passes printed for you at the concierge! 

It's fabulous! Stay there!
