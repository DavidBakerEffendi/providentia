Go figure - We are from Los Angeles, where three+ EggSlut locations stand, yet we have never visited an EggSlut until now in Vegas. But hey -  a first for anything and damn, these are amazing sandwiches!

We ordered two sandwiches: 
Fairfax: fluffy delicious scrambled eggs, chives and caramelized onions, with thick slice of ooey gooey cheddar, lathered with sriracha mayo all packed between toasted, soft, amazing brioche buns! Delicious sandwich, we just wish there were more onions! 

Sausage, Egg, and Cheese: surprisingly delicious turkey sausage, nicely seared, great seasoning and spice of flavor, soft meat, on top of an over-medium egg which EXPLODED with yolk all over my hands and plate (I LOVE that) oh so sexual I know, a thick slice of cheddar, with honey mustard aioli in that amazingly delicious brioche bun! I should have ordered a biscuit to scoop up the yolk!

Both of these sandwiches were absolutely amazing! Delicious bun, perfectly cooked eggs in each, delicious sausage, lovely sauces to accompany the sandwiches, and overall just a great breakfast!
