Great breakfast and brunch spot. Great for groups and children. A lot of menu items to choose from. Plenty of seating and not a long wait. Prices are affordable. Worth a drive if you're in the area. Waffle batter is tasty didn't even need syrup. Had the red velvet and created my own 3 side meal. Everything was delicious no complaints. Will be back for sure to taste rest of menu as there was a lot to choose from. Staff was friendly and attentive. Met one owner and she introduced herself and was talking with most customers. You can tell this establishment cares about their customers.
