Nice and juicy South St. Burger! How much I love them. 

I dropped by today after a co-worker who lives in the area told me about it's recent opening. I figured since I was in the area, we could stop by.

This is gourmet burger! You can choose any toppings you want. There are neat toppings and sauces like mango chutney, wasabi mayo, pepper jack cheese, blue cheese, goat cheese, guacamole. The best part is that they are not stingy with the tomato or the lettuce. They are fresh! I'm very picky about how fresh my vegetables look if I have to eat it raw.

The best part is, if you are a fan of New York Fries, you'd love this place!

I can't wait to go back! *drool*
