We decided to go here because they are part of the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Dining program (we wanted the points). We went about 5pm Saturday night and there were only a few people in the restaurant. They told us to sit anywhere so we chose a booth. The waitress came right over and took our drink order. I needed a couple minutes to look at the menu so she said she would come back. When she brought or drinks we ordered. Didn't take long for the food to arrive. BBQ chicken sandwich for me and philly cheese steak for hubby (he got the full and it was huge). Food was good. The staff was great.
