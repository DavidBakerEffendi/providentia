So amazing! Got the vegan sausage with Mac and cheese, veggie chili and pico de gallo. This was the first vegan hot dog I've had and it blew me away. Also got the tots, which were fried to a perfect crisp, with the Thai chili sauce. Would definitely come here again just to try more toppings! Be warned... Don't put too many toppings on your dog or it will just fall apart. Three was more than enough, and it was plenty filling!
