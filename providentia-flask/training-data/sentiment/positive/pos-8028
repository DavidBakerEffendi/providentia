I'm so glad I stopped by Knuckle Sandwich.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  Was it just take out, more like a Subway?  Or something more formal?  It's a fun, lively place where you order at the front counter, pick out your own drink from the cooler (soft drinks and a selection of beers) and they'll bring your meal to your table.  We had a shrimp po'boy and a chicken sandwich.  I don't think I've ever seen a po'boy sandwich in a Toronto restaurant, but this shrimp po'boy was just as good as any po'boy I had on a holiday in Louisiana.  The chicken sandwich was delicious with nice, fresh and crunchy toppings.  Lots of sides to choose from.  We chose tater tots because, hey, who doesn't love tater tots?  I was stuffed by the end of the meal.  A great lunch and terrific service.  Lots of customers so it looks like they're doing a good business.  And fun, indy music in the background.  I could tell that all the other customers around me were just as happy with their meals as I was.  Highly recommended.
