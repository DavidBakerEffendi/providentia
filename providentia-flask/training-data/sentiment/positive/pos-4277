Place is amazing. People call it bowling for golf I'd say that is an accurate representation. They have everything food, drinks, a full bar while you wait for your tee box. The range itself is all digital it tracks your shots down to the exact yardage. It's sort of like Dave N Busters in terms of playing as you insert your card and it tracks your play as you pay by the hour. Definetely a great date or group spot. It is expensive but I think it's worth it.
