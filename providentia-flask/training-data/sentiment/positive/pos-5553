The first time I came here, I did not like it. It was salty and the meat was not pleasing. Although after being invited by my best friend to eat here, I agreed to give it a try again. And I must say, it was the best choice. 

On my first visit I got the typical Shoyu Ramen. It was saltier than the other ramen places I had visited. The chasu was not the greatest. It had a very weird texture to it. Because of my last choice, I decided to choose something different on my second visit. Tori Paitin is what I chose (I hope I spelt that right). It is a chicken broth. Now I know the traditional Japanese ramen is pork broth. But for me, I did not mind. This broth was so good. I think it was appetizing because I added the garlic oil for an additional dollar. I typically do not finish the broth when so eat ramen, but this bowl I had to. Asides from the broth, I loved the chasu. I do not know how it was cooked, but it fell apart in my mouth easily. It was seasoned very well! I dipped it with chili oil to give it an extra kick. I was very happy with my second visit. 

Moreover, service was better too. The guy who took care of us made sure that our ramen was exactly how we wanted it. He even said if there were anything we wanted to change just let him know. I didn't catch his name. But he was great. Writing this review makes me want some again. Hmmmm, ramen for lunch tomorrow?
