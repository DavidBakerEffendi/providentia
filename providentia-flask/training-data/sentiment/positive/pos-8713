5 Stars (Excellent)- This is my all time favorite spot for breakfast and lunch in Las Vegas. I have been coming here since they opened in 1996 and have always had an excellent experience. Ma & Pa owned and operated with care which you can tell by the outstanding food quality. Most authentic Jewish Deli and fresh bakery outside of New York City. The pastrami sandwich is the best in all of Las Vegas period!  The soups (matzo ball especially) are amazing and of course the rye bread and traditional cookies are done correctly. It is common for this place to get pretty crazy busy from time to time especially around lunchtime. However they do the best that they can and are always courteous, friendly, and helpful staff. Thank you Bagel Cafe for the years of superb food and fresh bagels!!  Keep up the good work!!!
