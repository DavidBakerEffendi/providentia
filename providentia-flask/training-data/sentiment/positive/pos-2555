This is a beautiful hotel! I stayed here with a friend and somehow, they gave us the romantic suite with our tub filled with rose petals, lol, but other than that, I thought the room was gorgeous. Well, we got the suite, not just a regular hotel room, but it was gorgeous nonetheless.

I'm a big fan of their club Tao as well, it's beautiful in there and the bouncers are rather generous.
