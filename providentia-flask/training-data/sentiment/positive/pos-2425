WOW, let me tell you! Travis and I had one of the best dates Friday night and it all started at La Piccola's! Friendly service take us 'to the best table in the house' and at first I thought they were just joking around, but they bring us into this cute little room and seat us in a window seat next to a fountain glowing with simple lights. 

We ordered the Hummus appetizer - it was served with warm pita pieces. It was full of flavor and deliciously combined with baba ganoush. Yum

Then we moved onto dinner, I ordered the Turkey Roast with Raspberry Pepper Sauce - WOW! The turkey was tender and full of flavor, but not over-spiced. The combination of flavor when I used the Raspberry Pepper sauce was incredible. My Greek salad was amazing with the home-made dressing and the grill asparagus were perfect.

To top it all off, we ended the evening's dining with some Gelato. The food, service, and ambients was as good as it gets for me!

You can tell everything is home-made because at the end of my meal, I was full and well-fed but not bloated or weighed down by grease and salt. La Piccola Cucina has become my newest favorite in Italian restaurants and I'm excited to go back and try something new.
