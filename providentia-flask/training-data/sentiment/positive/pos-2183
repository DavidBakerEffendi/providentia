Moved to NC from Los Angeles last year and was desperate to find what I refer to as "real food" AND I was so happy to find The Pickled Peach! Everything is yummm, fresh, seasonal and impeccable quality. 

I've had the following items on my visits and enjoy all of them: chicken & veggie soup, carrot ginger soup, ham & brie sandwich and the roasted root veggie salad (deli case). Aditionally, I'm obsessed with their coffee and tea! I don't recall the brands but so good...Please open in Southpark!!! Please.
