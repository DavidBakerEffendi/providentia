This was great! We used to come here years ago when it was called Bombay Spice and it was located a mile south on Tatum and Shea. The delightful Kate K and I mutually decided to come here and try out their menu. They have a pretty spectacular happy hour menu from 5-7pm if you sit at the patio/bar area.

We tried their veggie samosas, papadum, and chicken tikka. Everything tasted yummy and the sauces were the perfect accompaniment to our food: mint chutney, yogurt and tamarind. For happy hour prices, the amount of food we got was filling.

Service was excellent as we got our order quickly and our water was filled frequently. I'd like to come back and try their lunch thali. Glad to see that this place is still consistent and although it wasn't super busy they had quite a few people dining.
