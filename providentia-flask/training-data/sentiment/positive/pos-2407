Reminds me of home (NJ)! Best bagels in the area by far!

I had the chocolate chip bagel with plain cream cheese and a small coffee (a breakfast special which included any bagel with plain cc). The coffee was meh, but that's typical of a NJ/NY deli, so it still met expectations haha.

My boyfriend got the everything bagel, also with plain cc.

They put way too much cc on the bagels, but you can always take it off.
