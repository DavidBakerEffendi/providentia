Ahi avocado bowl...holy hell, this thing is awesome.  Insane amounts of ahi, avocado, cucumber, and rice all for $10.  I have been eating here once a week for the last year, they don't even ask what I am ordering any more.  I am usually the only howlie in this place but I think they have finally accepted me.  

PS - Don't go here for lunch because that is when I go, I need to keep the lines short.
