Way cool new place to eat in Downtown Gilbert. I had a little trouble finding it, it's a little bit off of Gilbert Road behind other restaurants in a square. Loved the decor and met the Manager (very nice guy), they have a great selection of unique and delicious subs and sandwiches and even Breakfast Burritos. The staff was very helpful and I love their mission of every sub you buy they give one to charity. I had the Pot Roast Dip, it was great and can't wait to try others on the menu!
