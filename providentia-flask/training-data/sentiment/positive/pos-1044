I had never tried this place out and I had lived in Vegas my whole life. On my first visit back (since moving to California) my bf and I decided to eat here after my doctors appointment because we were starving. I ordered the stuffed french toast and he ordered the original breakfast burrito. The works potatoes were delicious! I truly wish this place would open more locations outside of Las Vegas. I liked it that much! Service was great and VERY fast. Ashley was our server and she was very friendly. We will definitely be back when we visit.
