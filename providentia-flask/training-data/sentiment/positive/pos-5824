This is probably the best Indian restaurant in AZ. I've never had a bad meal here. And the service is exceptional. Be sure to come hungry. My husband and I always order extra naan to scrape off the leftover curry that we weren't able to get into the to go box... we'd use our fingers if it weren't impolite. Letting it go to waste isn't an option. It's so good! 

The goat curry is delicious, but there are bones in it. I highly recommend anything with lamb... you can't fail with the lamb curry or lamb coconut curry. I like the chicken makni, butter chicken, but usually get the lamb. Be sure to leave room for the rice pudding and the gulab jamun. I like to combine the two, so damn delicious.
