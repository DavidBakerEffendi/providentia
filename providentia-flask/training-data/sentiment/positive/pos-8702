Move over Sura and all other Korean AYCE BBQ - the new undisputed champ has arrived and that is Woo Nam Jung!

The atmosphere, service, and food quality trumps them all.  They serve their gal bi filet style where it's cut from the bone.  Almost all the other serve the other cut of ribs where with 2-3 small bones in each.  The taste and quality of their meats is so much better.

I like how they bring the food to you and help you cook- added service bonus.  The atmosphere is also much nicer and their ventilation is better so you won't be coming out smelling like BBQ as much.

Considering this place has been open a few months and only has 12 reviews, I'm really surprised.  This place is severely underrated and is easily my favorite AYCE BBQ.
