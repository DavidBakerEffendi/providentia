An amazing dinner. Started off with the crab cake appetizer which was tasty but very tiny. Not enough to share.  My hubby then ordered clam chowder  which was beyond words and I don't even like clams. Sweet and flavorful goodness. We both had surf and turf as our entree and it was the best king crab I have ever eaten. Filet was perfectly cooked. Would have to say the highlight of our evening was when Rick Moonen came over to our table to wish me a Happy Birthday.  He was very warm and welcoming and seemed genuinely interested in what we thought of our meal. 

The service was outstanding. Our waitress was friendly and very efficient. 

Can't wait to come back and  dine here again.
