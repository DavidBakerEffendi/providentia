Oh my! This place is the best! Before Dynamite Grill opened, I had been pretty limited to the Kazuki Sushi across the street. And that place was just okay. Not my favorite. But boy am I glad Dynamite Grill opened up! 

My first impression coming in was, "wow, it's so clean, bright, and organized." Often times, I go to sushi restaurants and I can barely read the menu because it's so dark. The people who own this restaurant are just the sweetest people I've ever met. They're so gracious and they make you feel like they're happy to have you in their restaurant. 

At first, I expected the small sized sushi that I usually would see at the other sushi restaurant I used to go to. But when I opened up my to go box at home, I was so surprised by how big the size was of my rolls. I ordered the Jerry's Special, Caterpillar Roll, and the Crunch Roll. Usually, I order at least 4 rolls and eat it all at other sushi restaurants. I couldn't even get through 2 rolls! Everything is so fresh and flavorful. It's definitely my new favorite place to go for sushi!
