Only place in Calgary so far that compares to the Boulud, Bourdain, Samuelsson, Ramsay and Batali's of the world.  Service is what sets it apart from the other places.  Set your napkin down, go to the bathroom, come back and it's neatly folded back waiting for you on the table.

Food is also of very high standard, some of it is local and seasonal which is a plus.  The best part of all this, it's great value for the money.  Without wine it'll be difficult to spend over $100/person here.
