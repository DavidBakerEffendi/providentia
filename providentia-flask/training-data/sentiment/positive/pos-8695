I'll always remember this fine dining establishment as the place where I had wild boar for the first and only time.  It was unique - firm, yet succulent.   It was delicious, and if I'm ever in Calgary again on business, I will try to go back.  It's a special occasion kind of place.  We had a 7 course meal (I think) that lasted 4 hours if I recall.   The wild boar was most memorable.
