Tried it out last night and am super excited to have this place around! 
We ordered Breadsticks, Extra Cheese Pizza, and an Italian Hoagie. 

The breadsticks were so soft and chewy!  You can tell the dough is made from scratch, and fresh!  Along with their delicious sauce.  It's not your typical pizza place, they have set themselves aside with that one! 

The pizza was a thinner crust all around, but chewy and so delicious.  They have to use a good quality cheese, there wasn't a pile of grease sitting on top of the extra cheese, which was lovely!  There wasn't a piece left! 

The Italian Hoagie was our favorite.  The meat was sliced thick and piled on!  We had the dressing on the side, but you most definitely didn't even need it with the flavor that sandwich had!

Will most definitely be going back for more!
