i went to rio carnival, paris buffet, and spice market buffet. bellagio's buffet is by far tastier! the food selection is definitely unique. there is cracked alaskan king crab and regular cracked crabs, peeled cocktail shrimp, oxtail soup, various sushi, and meats. my favorite buffet in vegas. i didnt try wynn but i wish i did just so i can compare the tastes. the price is up there but its vegas so im not surprised! the line wasnt too long since i came on a monday night. the dinner was prob a few bucks cheaper than coming on the weekend for dinner. it took us less than an hour to get seated. my waiter was okay . he didnt really check on us and didnt offer refills. we had to almost hunt him down!! this one is definitely worth the experience!
