Not all chinese restaurants are the same.
Wong's Chinese Cuisine is so much netter than the rest!
You can tell the owners pick the best products and freshest ingredients to serve their clients.
Everything is lighter and crisp/fresh.
I'm a huge fan!
Hot and sour soup...delicious!
My friend lives for their egg drop soup.
Its our go to lunch spot.
The sesame chicken featured below isn't fatty deep fried balls of chicken frenched in oversweet sauce like other places.
Its top notch quality of homemade good cooking.
Flavorful fried rice and yummy eggroll.
We also had the dumplings and they were cooked deliciously.
David is the nicest guy and comes over to check on everything.
All the staff remember you and are always serving with a smile.

Roomy dining room and plenty of parking.
They have great hours and you can call for takeout.
