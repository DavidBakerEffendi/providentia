I have had the chance to eat here on three separate occasions and each time the food was great and very consistent. The hummus was very good and fresh but the real stand out is the Shakshuka, unbelievably good, there are two versions and I recommend them both. I also tried the falafel which is by far the best I've ever had. 

The place is very trendy and maybe a little artsy, not very comfortable for a long dinning experience. There are two very large "community" tables, one small round table for four people and two bar style tables with extremely uncomfortable stools. 

I've always had the same server and she is extremely friendly and the food is served quite quickly which is good because you really don't want to be stuck sitting on those stools for to long. 

The food is fresh, homemade and you can tell that they care about what is served. The only downfall about the menu is that you can not get a traditional Coke or Pepsi, all of their drinks are artisanal and not really my taste.
