Are you staying at the Palazzo? Scratch that, are you staying in VEGAS ? Wait no--- Do you live in NEVADA ???  This place is a MUST. I've been 3 times now and cant wait to go back. Is it a little expensive? maybe, but  you're in Vegas... Listen this place has it all-- The staff is amazing. They go above and beyond here- you get what you pay for- they are fast with the food- the drinks are AWESOME. HUGE Props to the restaurant manager Jason. Very professional- checked in on us often and even made some recommendations that were jaw dropping. I understand that this is what a normal place should be like but coming from the industry myself- many places aren't. The music was upbeat- the bartenders were having a great time with their customers at the bar-- All in All, I love this place. I cant stay in Vegas and NOT come here. Ask for Ryan as your server- Tell Jason that I sent you :) 

Thank you Jason and Ryan for the great time- another amazing Vegas trip with our friends and good memories to last as long as we can remember.
