Smack. The lovely sound of dough slamming on a an equally lovely countertop.

Tried the classic Lanzhou noodle soup. The portions for small and large are actually huge. The price for the small is around pho pricing so cheap.. I think GB is a better value than pho and ramen at this price range. And I'm a huge pho guy, but the vermicelli noodle at your avg pho place can't compare to this.

The soup is tasty and didn't have any grease. Tasted quite healthy and refreshing. 

Got the flat wide noodle it was so good and chewy. Wow, mind blown. Glad this place opened in a great location at Dundas and Bay. Will be back.
