I never leave this place without taking more home than I plan! 

I've tried a few sausages, including Weisswurst, seafood, cheddar brat, and the Hungarian sausage. All FANTASTIC! 

The most unique one is the seafood  which actually had salmon in it. I stir fried it with veggies, Five Chinese spice, along with the Aloha Mango Teriyaki sauce I also purchased. So good!

I seared the Weisswurst and added the Rotkohl purple Sauerkraut (also purchased there.) Mmmm!

I recommend the smoked salmon, as well. Great smoke and fresh taste. 

Something else I ordered three Weinerschnitzel. The pork was thick, tender, and juicy. That, with the German sauerkraut (also purchased,) and I was in Germany nirvana! Kostlich! 

I've been helped by the owner and the lady who are very generous with samples, a great selling tool that's gotten me every time!

Be prepared for a bill that's a little high, but the quality is worth it.
