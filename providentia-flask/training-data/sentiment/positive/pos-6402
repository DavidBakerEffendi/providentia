Great restaurant and even better service.  We stopped here after a day out by the lake and it well worth it.  Prices are a little high, but it'll be well worth it.  Even though complain about service, it's difficult to do that regarding this restaurant.  We felt at all teams taken care of!  It's our hope to return again this summer!
