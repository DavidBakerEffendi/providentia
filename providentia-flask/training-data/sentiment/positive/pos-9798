This place is so cool. We bring our friends from out-of-state here all the time. It's like a blast from the past and feels like walking into the glory days of Las Vegas.

Drinks are top notch. My fav is the Bloody Mary.

Food is over-the-top delicious! Breakfast is my favorite. All of the dishes have been awesome so far. 
 
The staff friendly. The prices are good. And the ambiance can't be beat!
