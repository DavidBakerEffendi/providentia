This is my all time favorite place:) totally in love with service, food and their smart colorful decor. American Greek food is fast and extremely delicious. Their speciality oils/dressing for Greek salad is exotic. A big cheers to Rachel Zoe and I think more of these should open up for everyone to try it out ! Waiting for it in California !!!
