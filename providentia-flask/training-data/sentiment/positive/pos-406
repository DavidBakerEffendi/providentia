The lox platter with the works was amazing. The waitress was very prompt and pleasant, over bagel crisp and a dab of cream cheese while I waited for my food. Everything was off the chart. Brought extra napkins with meal, bonus, as eating a tower of cream cheese, tomato, onion, cucumber, capers and thinly slice lox (perfect) can be messy at times. The servers and bussers were around often to refill my coffee mug. Made me feel like I was on the East Coast at a NY Deli. I put the address on my phone screen to press and get me there, as I am new to Las Vegas. Still learning to get around.
I can't wait until I try their sandwiches. They looked awesome at the table next to mine. Best of luck, you have a great product. Got some pastry to go on Saturday back to eat on Tuesday.
