Seems like it's the only ramen place that offers shio. Which is that light chicken broth based ramen. Not a lot of Americans like shio but it's definitely my taste. The noodles are good texture. They torched the chasiu so it has a smoky touch which is unique to the light broth. But the bamboos are a bit sweet so that doesn't really go with the whole picture. 

The interior is just all chairs along the open kitchen. I hope they get busy so they will have to worry about their seating arrangements soon? 

The price to portion is a bit on the pricey end. I look forward to trying some of their other menu items when they are more developed though.
