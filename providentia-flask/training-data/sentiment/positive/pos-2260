I don't know how to put Fazio's into words. It can only be sung. All I have to say about Fazio's has already been sung. Stop reading this immediately and go listen to the eternal words of Smokey Robinson and his wonderful composition, "You've Really Got a Hold on Me" if you want to know more about why you should eat every meal at Fazio's forever. Except Mondays because they are closed.
