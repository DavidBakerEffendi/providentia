From beginning to end, I had a phenomenal experience here. First off, they kindly accommodated my large party with a last minute reservation and from the moment we sat down, they provided stellar service to each of us. Their drinks are absolutely delicious and could easily rival those I've had in larger cities such as Chicago or NYC. Food-wise, I highly recommend the chips and dip. I wasn't sure what to expect with whipped octopus and caviar, but I have to say it was surprisingly delicious. Other items I'd recommend are the fish nuggets, beef belly and of course--my favorite--the brussels sprouts. 

This was my first time visiting and I will certainly be back. This is a nice place to chill out with some friends and enjoy some great food. Plus, it's right next door to Platform Brewing. So, you can easily pop in next door to cut loose after dinner.
