I can't wait to come back and eat here again! This little gem is hidden away in an Albertson's plaza with an unassuming "Vietnamese Food" sign on top. 

The service here is minimal, a sign of a true asian restaurant in my book. However, they've done a great job decorating with red umbrellas on the ceiling and photos of Vietnam on the walls. 

The food is fresh. Its not that greasy/sweet americanized flavor. 
I had the Pho Tai which had a surprising kick to it, and I tried some of my dad's chow fun noodles which were amazing. 

Prices are really cheap too!
