What can I say but the best!  We originally ordered thru Postmates but they cancelled the order.  I called Juan's and the person who answered was so nice.  He understood our issue.

We ordered 2 steak fajita meals and carnitas.  A side of chips salsa and bean dip.  The portions were huge!  Easily enough for 2 meals each.  We got all the sides and condiments.  The food was awesome!

Our go to for Mexican food from now on.
