We found the Toronto location for Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu using Yelp and were very impressed, but it was so far away, it was tough to visit. When we noticed this new location in Mississauga, we had to check it out. Is it as good as the original?

I'm happy to say, yes! They don't seem to be as busy in this location, so we've always been able to get a seat and our orders processed quick. With a simple menu like this, it makes is much easier to choose your meal adventure. Though our one problem is, remembering what we had each time. Thank you to whoever posted a photo of the menu!

So, some of our favourites:
#4 Dumpling Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab (rice) comes with a raw egg that you crack into it when they serve it. YUMMY, and a huge portion with extra rice.
#7 Stone Pot Bibimbab (mixed vegetables in rice) very tasty too.
#8 Dukbegi Bulgogi + Dolsotbab (beef soup) + (rice) is fantastic.
#9 Broiled BBQ + Dolsotbab (rice) is a great option for anyone who shies away from the "tofu" part of the name, as it is fantastic BBQ!

We like to bring friends from out of town when they visit, and even the pickiest eaters leave full and with a smile... With only 9 options to choose from, you really can't go wrong!
