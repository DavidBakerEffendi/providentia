Hopefully you have seen this place on Triple D or more recently on Tanked(fish tank show).  But let's get to the important stuff, the food?  BBQ that is wood smoked is incredible.  I ordered the 3 meat platter so I could taste a few different meats.  I had sliced brisket, pulled pork, and chicken.  It came with two sides, I ordered Mac and cheese(get ready the serving it's huge and tastes amazing) and BBQ beans(talk about super nerdy, they put brisket in their beans and it tastes awesome).  I am a huge fan and will without a doubt be back!
