This I my third time here. We love this spot. Food is different, original, and delicious. Atmosphere and ambiance are incredible. 

The service has been impeccable so far. Matter of today I went around 6-7pm and though busy I wouldn't have known the difference. Everyone is on point. I also got the honour of observing the owner/manager in action. He is an amazing man, and you can tell he's humble at the core.

I saw him assisting his staff, checking in with each guest. Matter of fact he took the time to sit down and have a mini chat with me and my daughter. 

For those having a hard time with the service, don't give up on them give them another try and I am sure they will redeem themselves.

This has become our favourite local dinner spot. My fianc√© and I absolutely love their creative menu, and find it absolutely delicious. 

We also really like the main bartender. Not that either of us drink, but he has come over and talked to us any time we are having a problem i.e I didn't know that they no longer serve regular menu during the late night"Happy Hour." The French fries aren't on the menu at happy hour and that's all my daughter eats along with a little sushi. He told us he apologises for the misunderstanding and would have the kitchen make her fries! 

Again don't give up on them so easily. Remember it's a mom & pop at the end of the day. Not a big name restaurant. That's what makes this place so incredible.
