I heard so much about this restaurant. I could not wait to try this place. When I made the reservation, they didn't have a spot, so they placed us on the bar. When we arrived, there was a cancellation, so we got a table. The whole menu looks so exciting! I ordered the oysters, Mac n Cheese (sharing with my friend), and fried chicken (2pcs) with maple shiracha sauce. Believe me every dish was super delicious. Love the oysters it was cool with the pop corn chickens. Such a sweet touch. Man n cheese just melts beautifully in my mouth. The batter of the fried chicken was perfectly crisp and tasty. The service was good. Everything was perfect!
