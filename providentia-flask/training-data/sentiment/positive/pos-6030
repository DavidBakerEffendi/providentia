Hands down one the best Pizza establishments in the Cleveland Heights area!!! 

Positives:

* Ton of pizza choices (gourmet or custom) and unlimited toppings included in the price when you make your own
* Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity you get
* Ingredients are top notch: from veggies to meat, everything feels and tastes fresh 
* I have tried only the regular crust and that is yum, it holds the toppings and still feels soft when you take a bite
* Friendly staff who give you suggestions (that are legit and not just so that you place your order)
* You can order online (yay when I don't want to speak to a human being)

Negatives:

* Delivery can take time during weekends so plan accordingly
* If you look at their website/Facebook, they have a lot of deals, however the Cleveland Heights location does not participate in a few of them (3 pizzas for $20)
* Pizza prices are for two pies and you can subtract $5 if you want one (they want you to order more). This is a little confusing on the website
* Their pizza sizes are smaller than the regular places you are used to (Pizza Hut, Dominos). A Large is actually a Medium, and an X Large is a Large so order a size up

I have done a take out once and delivery a bunch of times. Each and every time my pizza has been delectable to the point I are stuffed but want to eat another slice. I have tried the Bombay Pizza, French Quarter gourmet pizzas and the rest have been custom made. I have to say the chicken in the Bombay Pizza is an almost great tandoori chicken - it has the red color, slightly spicy, slightly tangy. The sauce adds to the flavor and the banana peppers are just about the right addition: everything works together. The French Quarter pizza tastes like something I have eaten in NOLA. The cajun seasoning along with the andouille sausage and pepper/onions tastes like a part of a jumbalaya. As for the custom pizzas, most of them have have been made with the spicy garlic sauce and a ton of veggies. The great thing is that even if you order all the items on the list, they know how much to put to make the pizza tasty rather than only edible. Kudos to the people assembling the stuff in the kitchen. The spicy garlic sauce is definitely one of my favorite sauces there, which is why I keep getting it. 

Overall, this is a high quality pizza place, that is open late (especially on weekends), delivers in the Cleveland Heights area and satisfies all your cravings with a simple slice of pizza. I have yet to try the Miracle crust and the Chicago style gourmet pizza. That is next on my list.... Definitely a 5 star place as in my opinion the positives far outweigh the negatives.
