I've seen the sign posted on Gibson on my way home several times and thought another shop with overpriced goodies. Then I read the reviews and decided regardless of the price, I'm going to try a cupcake. I even bought a Yelp deal. 

I'm so glad I had gone! The shop is really small, cute and clean. When I walked in, I was greeted by the daughter. I then made my way over to choose my goodies, which was a little difficult because I wanted them all! I finally made my decision and went with Very Vanilla, Cake Batter, Key Lime, and Strawberry Shortcake. 

When I got home i cut each cake into 4 pieces so my family could try. The majority favorite was cake batter and strawberry shortcake.  
My favorite was key lime. I'm not one for lime flavors, but the cupcake tasted really good! I was not expecting a such a pungent punch in my mouth. I usually eat the frosting then the cake. This definitely tastes good with both together. 

Strawberry Shortcake was good also. The frosting was not over bearing in way that it was too thick. The flavor and density were really good. It tasted like a strawberry puree which went very well with the cake. 

Cake Batter is always a favorite. I can eat cake batter for days if there wasn't such a risk. So eating cake flavored cake batter will have to do. It tastes just like cake batter and i think theres sprinkles or something in the frosting. Very good. 

Very Vanilla was my least favorite. It didn't taste like vanilla to me, but I still ate it. Frosting on the cake was very light.  My mom loves vanilla flavor, so she liked it. 

So my assumption of over priced goodies was wrong. The cupcakes are reasonably priced. When I bought mine, they were $2.60 each, which isn't bad at all. They also have cake pops (when you check in you get a free one). There are also bars like an ooey gooey bar that I'm going to try on my next visit.
