Don't go anywhere else, this is the best steakhouse in town.  Everything is so good, I always get the sea bass, it's killer.  Hubby got the tomahawk for his 4-0 and two years later can't stop talking about it.  He's also loved the chops and other steaks.  Do not leave without trying the tater tots!  Once you've eaten here, every other steakhouse will pale in comparison.
