If this was closer to me, I would be there quite often. They do not skimp on fish, veggie, or toppings. What I really like is that they have such a wide variety of toppings--octopus salad, tamago, wasabi masago(!), tofu, and all of the usual veg. Fish tastes fresh, sauces are great, and service is good. 

You really get a nice size bowl for your money. A lot of other poke bowl places overcharged and don't give you enough, not so here.
