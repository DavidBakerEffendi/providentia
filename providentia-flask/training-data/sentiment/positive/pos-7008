Hands down, the best glazed donut I've ever had.  The inside was fluffy and the glaze was perfection.   I scarfed this down and I don't even like glazed donuts!

Their other donuts aren't too shabby either.  I really LOVED the cinnamon donut covered in nuts and..uh..cinnamon.  Really tasty and fresh.  The cake donuts are winners too with options of chocolate, vanilla, maple, or cherry frosting.  

Half a dozen costs around $4.50, full dozen around $8.50 (note that apple fritters are extra).  Cash only.  Looks insanely sketchy but seemed pretty clean inside.  I wasn't shot, stabbed or robbed.  That's a plus, right?
