Everything on the strip cost a lot more than anywhere else in Vegas, the rent must be sky high. For a quick fix to the munchies and when you need it fast, this is a great place to go to. Order exactly what you want and how much you want and within 15 minutes your special pizza is done, yum just the way I like it.
