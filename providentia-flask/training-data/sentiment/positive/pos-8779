I went here with someone from work not expecting much, and holy cow, I was blown away. The pulled lamb is the best I've ever had. (And it comes with a side of this delicious mint sauce stuff that is so good.) They have amazing corn bread, garlic bread, and this spicy broccoli and cheese casserole. It's in a sort of bad part of town, but the rougher the neighborhood the better the barbque.
