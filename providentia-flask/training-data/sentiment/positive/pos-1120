This place has changed their menu since last time. They now have a mixed Asian menu. There is so much to choose from! We ordered the egg rolls again and they are just as good as last time. We also tried Roast Duck Wonton Noodle Soup, Beef Chow Fun, Potstickers, Charbroiled Pork Chops and all were so delicious. This is the best food in the hotel! Cashiers were super nice too. We will be back for sure!
