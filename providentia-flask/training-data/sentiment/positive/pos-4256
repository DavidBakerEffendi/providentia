I was craving Tom Yum so decided to give this place a shot. We ordered the chicken satay to start and I liked it. My picky burrito-obsessed daughter ate it, too. My soup was exactly what I had been craving, also. Had all the perfect flavors that I love in Tom Yum. My fianc√© ordered the BBQ chicken (although he's super snobby about his Thai BBQ) and he really enjoyed it. I tried it too and it was great. The staff was really friendly, which was also nice. We will definitely be back. I still want to try the Pad Thai.
