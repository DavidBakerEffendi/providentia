I will always love Kelly's bar. I have been coming here for years and it always holds a special place in my heart. The $4 drink specials are always worth trying and they also change seasonally. The interior of Kelly's is a beautiful dimly lit bar with red booths. In the summer it's always worth hanging out on the patio. The staff is quick and knowledgeable. Oh and don't forget the food, I always get a mini mac and put hot sauce on top! They have a really great barley wine festival every March and it is the best beer festival in the city- hands down!
