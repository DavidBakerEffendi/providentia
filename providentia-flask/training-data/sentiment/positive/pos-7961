Is this the best sushi I've ever had? No, but omakase for $35 is a great deal! There was nothing exotic but there was 6 pieces of tuna sashimi, 3 pieces of seared tuna, 3 pieces of seared salmon belly, 2 pieces of tuna nigiri, 2 pieces of salmon nigiri, 2 pieces of spicy tuna nigiri, and some other goodies I devoured so quickly that only my tummy remembers.

The service was fast and the fish was fresh. It was a great value! I would've loved to try one of the cool rolls; maybe next time.
