First off, for a veggie burger, I've never had one better or juicy...how can it even be juicy? YUM. Fries were great and I love that they give you ranch and fry sauce. I couldn't believe how packed the place was, it was soo worth it. My husband had already been and he loves their bacon cheeseburgers. Will defiantly be returning!
