I'm always on the prowl for new breakfast spots! This place looks a little old fashioned, but isn't that how you want your breakfast to taste? Homemade just like mom or grandma cooked when you were a kid, well that's what you can expect at Ranch House Grille. The menu selection is huge so you can satisfy your craving for eggs, pancakes, omelets or a burger. Maybe split a few meals between the family or friends, that's what I do, and trust me no one is disappointed with a variety of flavors to go around. Awesome service, too - thanks to Noah! I didn't have to wait long for the meals to arrive, so add this spot to your brunch to-do list!
