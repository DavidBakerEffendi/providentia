First time here last night, and we will always return when we're in the mood for Mexican food, in particular fajitas!  It's really hard to find decent Mexican food in Vegas, and we believe we finally found our Mexican spot.  From the minute we walked in, everyone was so welcoming and friendly. But, the people that stood out the most were our server, Amanda, and her sidekick Erick!  They gave 5 star EXCELLENT service! They were so awesome, always checking on us, giving us refills on beverages, chips, salsa, etc! The food was so yummmmmy and authentic!  The complimentary chips, salsa, grilled onions, jalape√±os were to die for, and we couldn't get enough!  Can't wait to return!!!
