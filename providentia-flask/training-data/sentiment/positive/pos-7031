We had a great dinner at Kneaders today, The turkey bacon avocado sandwich is really good!  My wife had a soup, I can't remember what it was called but it was very good too.  And the kid I loved the cookie! Fresh, clean, good service, and reasonably priced.  


Back again, had the turkey bacon avocado again, still 5 star food and service!!!
