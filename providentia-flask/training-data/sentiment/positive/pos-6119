My family had so much fun eating at Bodega 13. The tapas were so fun. We probably ordered one too many but we wanted to try everything. Our favorite was the lamb lollipop and the Brussel sprouts. 

The paella was delish! We ordered the meat lovers and they definitely don't skimp on the meat. The best part was the rice underneath though. Slightly browned from the hot pan adding extra flavoring. This dish was on the salty side but all the flavors were excellent. We want to try the seafood and the vegetable paella next time.

They have live jazz on Thursday nights which we are looking forward to next time. Enjoy!
