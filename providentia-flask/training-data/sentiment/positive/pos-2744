I usually take at least 5 minutes to decide what I want off a menu, however at Served, it took me 15 minutes and I was still hemming and hawing when the waiter came. The menu is filled with the most interesting, mixed plates and it's hard to decide what sounds really appetizing and what sounds a little too weird of a combo.
The restaurant is very small and has what looks like leftover carpeting from a previous tenant. First walking in, I was a little worried that I had chose the wrong place and that the Yelp reviews were all a lie, but DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU AWAY. 
Corned beef bread pudding benedict: Oh. my gosh. The texture of this plate was perfect. Corned beef is usually too salty for me, but the one at Served didn't have me downing waters. I wasn't too sure what part was bread pudding and what part was benedict, but the combo worked. 
Pork belly benedict: Separately, the benedict and the pork belly were not the best I've had, but the combo made it good. It was all a little dry, but after popping the egg, it was fine. 
Blueberry Pancakes: We ordered something "normal," just in case the "cultural favorites- redefined" dishes didn't work out. The pancakes were definitely some of the best I've had. Huge stack for a much lower price than other entrees on the menu! 
The serve breakfast and lunch all day. The presentation of the food is adorable and the waiters were very friendly. It's the perfect place to come with a date, a SMALL group of friends or even maybe your hip mom. It's too small for large groups and their eclectic menu may be too much for grandma and grandpa, if their idea of breakfast is 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon and hash browns. 
It almost hurts me to write this review. As much as I want Served to succeed, I also want it to stay secret and hidden. The restaurant is so small, I'm worried that coming in on a weekend would be impossible with a bigger following.
