Very helpful staff! Super excited that there's something besides Starbucks in a mall setting! I ended up getting a Cortado, it was delicious! Very cozy setting cause it's not as busy as the other locations. The gentleman behind the counter suggested that I get a pour over the next time, so I will be back to try that!
