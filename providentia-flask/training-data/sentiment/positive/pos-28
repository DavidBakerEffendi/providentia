This is the best pizza I've had in a long time! I think it's the crust! Or maybe it's the fresh ingredients! Or the sauce! Hell, I don't know which factor it is. I just know that it's hella (it's a Cali thing, sorry) good! We've been in Charlotte for almost a month and we've already been here three times. We usually get a medium custom pizza ($15.95) with cheese and jalapenos. The crust is thin and chewy-ooey goodness. They even give you a sample of honey to dip your remaining crust in. One sample had red peppers or cayenne in the honey which gave it a little zing to the sweetness. 

The staff is friendly and the food comes out extremely quick considering that they make each one custom. I love the location as well. It's located at 7th Street Market, which is one of the Lynx stations, and it's also just a quick walk from Times Warner Cable Arena.  

I remember the first time he ordered a pizza here. We took it to go since we already had dinner and he just wanted it for a snack for later. He had a slice right when we got back to the hotel and ended up falling asleep from food coma. He woke up to one slice left since, while he was sleeping, I had discovered how good it was. I couldn't stop myself from eating it all except for the last slice. Lala-oopsy! I think we're upgrading to a large next time ;)
