I love Thai House, everything I've gotten was delicious! The staff is also more than willing to adjust the spiciness of an entree, or adjust a meal for vegetarians. My favorites (so far) have been the Pad Se Ew and yellow curry. Their springrolls (I ask for vegetarian ones although they normally come with chicken) are excellent.
