Met up with some old friends here and they have great beers and whiskey to drink.  If you dont like this place your a dick....  I dont know when veganism and punk rock came together but whatever.  I leave that up to the college kids and hippies.  The lyrics to "College Boy" by Sheer Terror sum it up the best.   You will hear everything from Mr. California to Parkers west coast hip hop here.  Its always a blast.  Ill just bring a pack of raw hot dogs in and eat em on the shitter next time if I get hungry....
