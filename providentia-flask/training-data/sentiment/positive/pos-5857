I've had the fortune of living close to Sunny China Buffet many years before moving and continue driving over all the way to Urbana for their food. They offer a cornucopia of savory selections. They have bean noodles with fried bits of egg yolk and sliced green onion, they have soft tender shrimp in a delicious sauce with bits of celery, they have fried bits of hot potato, they have steamed and cooked mushrooms in a special delicious sauce, beef on sticks (to die-for), fried rice with bits of fried egg yolks and slivers of green onions, chicken and broccoli, pepper beef, stir fried veggies..two varieties of egg rolls (and trust me, the thinner egg roll is the best in champaign-urbana, even topping Peking Garden's!)! And they also have appetizers like fried crab rangoons, stuffed mushrooms with cheese, fried breaded shrimp, and for dessert..! sliced fruit for dessert and little coconut treats, coffee cakes, cookies, chocolate pudding...ahhh

It's really comfort food..will have to return again soon
