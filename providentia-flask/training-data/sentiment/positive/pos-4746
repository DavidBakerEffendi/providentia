I went yesterday after noon to the mall and then here. My first time eating at five guys burgers and fries. I this is what I got and recommend

cheeseburger with
lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, ketchup, mustard
with regular fries cajun style

The cheeseburger is in between and in&out burger and a culver's burger. And they fries are very good, even though they look dry. Put some ketchup on them fries because they have a very strong flavor. And finally the soda machine lol I seen that on tv and funny that after me there was 2 teenagers and they guy was what the?....vanilla coke? and i can pick more flavors? He was so surprise that he started talking to the female about it and saying can you believe that?lol wow. And is it me or my lol look like a drowning guy LOL
