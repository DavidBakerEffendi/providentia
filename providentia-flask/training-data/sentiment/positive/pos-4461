Long story short, we (party of 4) flew into Vegas and picked up our rental car to drive out to Utah and Arizona for our 6 day national parks/scenic trip. We stopped in here to grab a quick bite before starting our trip and it was the best/worst idea ever. Best because the food was great but worst because throughout our entire trip we were comparing everything we ate to the food here and wishing we had taken some sandwiches to go (which we didn't ugh!). On our way home, we drove like a maniac from the Grand Canyon and made it back to Vegas in good time, just in time for some departure Pho. (They open at 10am! I've never had Pho at 10am!) We were all afraid the quality would've changed but it hasn't. The pho was still delicious and the Viet sandwich with ham and cold cuts was still delicious. If I'm ever in Vegas again, this would be my first and last stop.
