This is a great place, i really like the barbecue pork and all there salads are great. It is family owned and the service is great. I like the fact that the food is not greasy. After a workout i am usually very hungry, so i know when i go there i will get waited on fast and my food will be ready quick. If you like fresh clean food this is the place to go. Everything is priced fairly also.
