I finally ventured out of my comfort zone and tried just about everything here and I am in LOVE with their Korean food. The flavor and food quality has been consistent no matter what time of day or week I visit. The egg battered beef, I believe is called meat jun mandoo, melts in your mouth. The meat jun mandoo meat is cut thin and I was worried it would be tough, but it's so tender and the egg batter adds a nice touch instead of being  floured and fried. I personally never seen anything like that before. I get the Jun's Special all the time now because you get 4 types of meat and your pick of 2 sides ( Banchan ), so you get to try a little bit of everything. The portion for this special more than enough for seconds and I had some left for lunch the next day even! I highly recommend the seaweed salad because it's light, a little sweet, a little sour, and it compliments the Bbq chicken, Kalbi rib, and the famous bulgogi. The family that runs the restaurant are so nice and sweet and very helpful in answering questions about the food. It's located in the Regal Movie Theater plaza so there is plenty of parking. Maybe I have a thing for mom and pop shops, but this place really takes pride in their food. The place is also very clean and comfortable. I found out today the gyoza is made in house. Nice!  Highly recommend. Give this place a try!
