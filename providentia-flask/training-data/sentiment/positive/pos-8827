Delicious!  First time going here.  The food was top notch.  The staff was super friendly.  I was having a lunch with coworkers, having a serious discussion about the future of the company.  We were making great progress, then Hank walked in.  The first thing he did was call out the butcher.  "Who's the arrogant jerk!"  He yelled.  Then he started making inappropriate comments to the male wait staff.  He insisted on having a drink, and when they wouldn't serve him, he lost it.  He pulled a bottle of 151 out of his pocket, slammed it, and smashed the empty bottle on the floor.  Thank goodness he passed out on the floor.  The manager and one other guy, rolled Hank out the door and left him on the sidewalk.  I recommend The Arrogant Butcher.  I do not recommend Hank.
