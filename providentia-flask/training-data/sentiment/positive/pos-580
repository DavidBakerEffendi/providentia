Very good!!!
I happened to show up on the day the health inspector showed up lol.
I ordered The Rudy Burrito. Very big and very good.
The girl that took my order was super nice and shes the owners daughter. Chips and salsa are gratis.
The inspector seemed impressed with the joint as well.
$7.57 with water cup and chips and salsa.
