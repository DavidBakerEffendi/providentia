I stop at this Sheetz every morning to get coffee or a fountain drink on my way to work.  On one occasion the Diet Dr. Pepper was out so I got a different drink and went to the register.  While trying to pay I mentioned they were out of my original beverage just to let them know so they could fix it.  He apologized and told me my drink today was on them.  Another time the cappuccino machine spit the hot beverage out onto my hand and not in the cup.  Once again I let the cashier know and again she apologized and gave me my coffee on the house.  While this only probably saved me about $2 between these two visits, their commitment to customers spoke volumes to me.  Way to go, Sheetz!
