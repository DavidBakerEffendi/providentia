This is probably one of my favorite places to get tacos. I recommend doing reservations!! Last time we went there was a 45 min wait. This time I called and made a reservation and we walked right in and got sat! 

Their salsa is so good. We asked if they had anything spicer and they have a habanero salsa. That was delicious. I'm definitely asking for it next time. 

I always get tacos with flour tortillas. No slaw with extra rice and refried beans. I'm not a big bean fan but their refried beans are the best. It's cheesy and has a smoky flavor to it. I got the beef taco, steak taco and shrimp taco. They are all loaded with meat! My favorite taco is the calamari. They only do that as a taco of the day but I would love if they bring it back!! 

Service was excellent!!
