So great!!! I'd been wanting to go for awhile, just based on the reviews and the tales that spoke of an all vegetarian brunch place with an antique store in the waiting area (my dream come true?). 
The Zenith lived up to every wild expectation I could have. They sat us fairly quickly considering we came during the busiest Sunday brunch time. Interestingly, we could've been sat immediately if we agreed to share a table with another couple who were regulars. The hostess explained some people love it, others would rather eat alone; personal preference! 
Excellent, attentive service. You order a main dish, which is accompanied by a buffet to the side with all the delicious side dishes you could want! Ridiculously quickly our server brought us out our entrees. I got the banana pancakes with syrup which was paired with an Indian tasting rice. Such an unusual, surprisingly perfect combination! 

I will admit the coffee was not good, but the rest more than made up for it!! I will absolutely be going on the regular.
