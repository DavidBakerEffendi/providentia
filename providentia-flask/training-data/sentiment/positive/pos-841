Fast Forward a Couple Years... all the things I 'dinged' them for are no longer an issue.  In Fact... their service and attention to detail are Amazing!  They are attentive and helpful without being intruding. 

First, The Service...
Clifton our server was Fantastic!  I highly recommend sitting in his section.  He knows how to pace the meal and made several wonderful recommendations.  And all the folks helping him to attend to us were wonderful... they seemed to come and go like ninjas.  One moment you're enjoying a lovely conversation or bite of food and the next your wine glass or water glass is filled and you have no idea how it happened.

Second, The Food...
Freakin' Awesome!

*Oysters - I don't like Oysters so I didn't partake.  But the husband said they were really good.

*Appetizer - I ordered the Charred Octopus... this is my new favorite dish.  The octopus was PERFECT... not fishy, not oily, not slimy... meaty, tender and succulent.

*Salad - Papaya Salad, Thai style.  It was refreshing, with a bit of a "bite" to it.  Not like it was bad... it was like it opened up your tastebuds so you could enjoy all the flavors that you were enjoying and going to enjoy.

*Main courses: 
- Rick's Catch - so I don't remember the name... it wasn't anything we've had before or even heard of before.  It was a white fish. The texture was similar to halibut steak... so it was meaty but flakey. It definitely had a fish flavor but since we all like fish this was not a turn-off... I thought it balanced the flavors of the dish.  It wasn't overpowering is what I'm sayin'.  Served over roasted garlic and shaved asparagus.
- Sturgeon - this was done in a wonderful chipotle-like glaze.... not spicy at all... a hint of sweet... whatever, it was fantastic.
- Diver Scallops - compared to the 2 other fish dishes, this one was just your standard fare. However, this "standard fare" was perfectly executed.  Scallops were tender and juicy.  If you like Scallops... you'll like this dish.  I had mentioned in my prior post that I thought it was salty... I don't think that anymore.

*Side - Brocollini - big enough for 3 people to share.  It was done with olive oil, garlic and a touch of red pepper flakes.  It was cooked but still had some "crunch" to it ... just the way I like it.

*Dessert - we didn't order dessert.  But Clifton saw that we were having a special evening, and decided to bring us a small dessert to share.  It was Amazing.  It was a Key Lime Cheesecake Mousse bar and (I think) Chocolate Hazelnut Crème Brulee.  I wasn't paying attention to what he was saying because I was too busy eating it.  I wanted to lick the crème brulee dish... it was 'That Good'.  But I decided to keep my good manners in place for a change.

All In All... A Fabulous Meal!  
(Oh... and we ordered a lovely bottle of wine too with the help of Clifton.  I kept the cork in hopes of trying to find it at a retail location.)

While speaking with Clifton, who was able to take a couple moments from his busy section, he mentioned that Rick Moonen is often on site overseeing operations.  We did see Chef Rick at one point in the evening and as we were leaving we saw him again at the entrance and even got to speak to him for a minute.  What a Nice person.  

We will totally be back.  :)
