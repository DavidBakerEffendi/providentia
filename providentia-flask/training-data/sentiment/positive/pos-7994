This review is loooong overdue. I've been eating here with family and friends...and their families for years. Dim sum, fondue, buffet - Regency has it all and does it all extremely well. 

This large venue also fantastic for meetings as they have several private rooms off the main dining rooms. The stage at the rear is ideal for large functions and the room can be segmented further for smaller functions. Personally, I've been here for fundraisers, Christmas parties, and the Sien Lok Society's Chinese New Year Party (which is by far the most elaborate and extravagant "do" of the new year...not to be missed!).

If I were to pick favorite dishes, I'd say that the Peking duck is always outstanding. They also do a wonderful scallop dish for banquets that I don't know the name of, but it always makes my eyes light up. It is savory and slightly sweet and oh-so wonderful.

For dim sum, well, I can't live without my lotus-leaf wrapped sticky rice, ha gow and shaomai! It's so great to have the carts circulating and continuously have food brought to you at will. After years of eating dim sum, the novelty still hasn't worn off! 

The fondue (hot pot) is also such a treat and there is a wonderful selection of meats and vegetables to add to the broth. Don't even get me started on the buffet...it's delicious.

All I have to say is come hungry and bring friends...lots of them!
