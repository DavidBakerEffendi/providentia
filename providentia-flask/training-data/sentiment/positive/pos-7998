My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out last week and was not disappointed. The aroma of the mesquite hits your nostrils as soon as you enter. Meanwhile, your eyes catch the open fire grill slowly cooking the chicken and carne. Slowly and steady wins the race. 
I ordered the quesadilla supreme and had my choice of meat(of course I got the carne) and a chicken taco. While my bf got the bean and cheese burrito and a carne taco. The portions were huge and delicious. The two things that are missing would be some pico de gallo and maybe give another option for cheese. The cheese had hard bite to it-think it was hard jack cheese, maybe something more mild?
The owner was very nice and gave us two coupons for free tacos. Overall it was a win win!
