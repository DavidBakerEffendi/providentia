We love Blue Agave, and have been coming for years.  The service is always very accommodating, friendly, and attentive.  We usually order the Chohulo (sp?) salad which isn't a typical taco salad, but a much different, "spunkier" type of meal! :) It's excellent.  We've also had the enchiladas and Owner's Burrito (I think it's called) and all are very, very tasty.  

They attract a vast array of people from business lunch-goers, to sports fans, to kids and older adults alike. There's something for everyone on their menu and we continue to call it one of our favorite restaurants.
