Finally! A restaurant that's gonna work in this location. Local Patron is a modern Mexican restaurant, great menu, great ambience, great bar TVs everywhere. The deck outside is perfect for socializing hanging out we're having a party. I've only been here once and the food so far has been great. Anxious to try to again. I love to go to places where you immediately walk in the door and you just feel welcome and it's low-key and easy and you know that you're going to have high-quality food and drinks. You need to try it out!! Dutch~
