This is the best dive bar in Phoenix.      Not the diveyest,   the best.    It's not the "scary" or "rough" sort of joint,  I never feel even the slightest bit unsafe here, nor worried about my car outside. 

If you're not into laughing, being positive and casual and openly social with everyone at a dive bar,    this place won't be good for you and you won't be good for it.      Take your negativity somewhere else. 

At Harvey's you can look like you just rolled out of bed or dressed up,  whatever, doesn't matter.     All that matters is everyone's there to be happy,  be themselves,  be friends.    

As for the food?     The burgers are unpretentious and have no real gimmicks,  you order a burger and it shows up and it's just an honest delicious  burger,  not too much salt or seasoning so you can taste the 
meat, the lettuce, the onion for exactly what they are - PERFECT!  

Update:  I invited my brother in law here,  and he refused because he says the wings are awful.    Well,  simple solution:  don't come here for wings.    It's Harvey's WineBURGER.     I'm not a wing person so I don't know first hand how their wings are.    Some other reviewers also said their wings suck so let's just go with that.
