It seems like there aren't a ton of great restaurants in this section of town (I could be wrong!) but I was pleasantly surprised when our friends took us to breakfast here. It's a super cute coffee shop and caf√© by day and wine bar and restaurant by night. Or I guess by afternoon.

Their breakfast menu isn't huge but good if you're looking for a simple, smaller meal. We all opted for the breakfast burrito. (we each got our own, of course - haha) It was a decent size - not Chipotle-size but big enough for a meal. The tortilla was nice and soft and it was full of eggs, bacon and potatoes. On the side was a green sauce that added a nice little kick without being overwhelming. I thought it was very tasty and everyone else enjoyed theirs as well.

The place isn't very big, they do have a patio but in the summer that might be pretty hot. But it's got a good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. I would love to go back to try one of their lunch or dinner options.
