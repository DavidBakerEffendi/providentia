This place is delicious! Reasonably priced and fresh food and ingredients, you can tell with each bite. The beer is pretty cheap (I think they offer $3 dos Equis or Pacifica or something) and the atmosphere is pretty cool, more of a hang out with the guys kind of atmosphere, but my wife and I love this place and their food
