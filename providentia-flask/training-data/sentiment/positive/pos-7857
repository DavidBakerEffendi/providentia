Solid food, especially for meat lovers. We've been here a few times (for dinner and brunch) and the staff has always been friendly and service was great. The burgers are solid, steak is solid, and the sides are all delicious. Sides are definitely large enough to share. The deviled eggs and pork belly as apps are also recommended. 

One time, we made a reservation and realized after we arrived that it was for the Mooresville location, not this one. The GM was gracious enough to try and find us (party of 7) a spot to eat, despite being pretty booked. They could have easily said, "sorry, no can do," but they didn't and were able to make it work.  Note, this location is not on OpenTable, but Mooresville is.

All in all, great food and service. Highly recommended.
