I love sushi samba, it's delicious and unique. I'm so sad they removed the sao Pali from the menu, but now the Lima is def the best roll selection from the menu. The yellowtail and kanpachi sashimi are super fresh and delicious. I also love their heavier dishes. The new teriyaki chicken is bomb, the skin is crispy on the outside and the purple mash potato is sweet, they go perfectly together! The sea bass is amazing too! It's super soft and tasty with the miso sauce over it! The ramen is legit and yummy, broth isn't too heavy and salty. The fried calamari is nice and light, not too oily and greasy!
