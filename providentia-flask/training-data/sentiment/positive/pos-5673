Great service, too notch. This place has not changed since we were here last time. Few hiccups in our order but was fixed promptly (but it was probably more to miscommunication, ie, my wife didn't realize that her sushi would be breaded, but was immediately fixed by the kitchen). Duck confit is best in the city, just unreal! Gazpacho was ok, parfait was ok, otherwise, great experience. Our server was attentive. (One recommendation to the restaurant - have your servers talk about that Bruell tour, ours didn't mention it, but it's no big deal). So great job, keep it up
