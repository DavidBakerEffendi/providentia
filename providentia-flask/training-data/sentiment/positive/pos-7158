My pie is MY favorite of these new pizza concepts that are popping up everywhere! 

First of all, as a vegan who finds it tremendously hard to eat out, and enjoy pizza like most others do, I LOVE that My Pie has vegan cheese!  Added bonus they have a vegan predesigned pizza on their menu! Love their mindfulness! 

Also like the fact that they have a choice of white or wheat crust, added bonus!  Their selections of sauces and toppings are on point and their salads & cookies look as tasty as their pizzas!  

Wonderfully satisfied with my experiences here each and every time!
