Stopped in while in the neighborhood for work. Had a great selection of proteins. Small shop in a nondescript strip mall. 

Lots of options and had a hard time deciding on what to get. Ended up with the small portion of the Windy City fries. Only 5.99 but the portion was well worth more. Nice charred carne asada with great flavor and fresh toppings. Pico and guac were flavorful and delicious. The full portion for 11.99 would've been a good challenge but will take that on next time. 

Service was fast and friendly. Quality was right on point. Will be sure to stop by again when back in the neighborhood. Highly recommended.
