Absolutely my new favorite spot! So cozy, comfy, and incredibly cute! My husband and I went for brunch Sunday. You order your food and drinks inside, pay and seat yourself in or outside. Stay to get your drink and food is served to you at your table. We got the Carmel Macchiato, and Nutella Coffee, both iced. Both very creamy and yummy. For breakfast we split both the OMG Sandwich (Prosciutto, fig, honey, and mascarpone) and the Tomato and Lox( w red onion, capers, cream cheese on and everything bagel). Also both very scrumptious!! 

The atmosphere was cozy and tranquil! Happy Bob Marly tunes played in the background. Friendly people and pets around. You've got to love the Buddha/Water/Succulents shrine! 

Tips: Try and know your order before you step in the door. It is very small inside and the staff is very busy and running in & out. 

If there are 2 of you one should order and another find a seat. 

If you have a dog they are welcome on the outdoor seating area and they have a place to get water for them. 

If you follow them on Facebook you can see what their daily dinner specials are!

They have happy hour from 6am-6pm plus daily specials like 20$ bruschetta & wine on Tuesdays!! Awesome!! 

All in all its a must try awesome spot and your supporting local business! What's not to love?!
