Fabulous! The classic bistro interior suggests the menu will be as charming as the place itself, and it does not disappoint. Delicious food, sizable portions, sweet and attentive waitstaff. They offer a you-pick-two option at the bottom of the menu, which I appreciate, so I got a half pasta and half salad. Even with that, I couldn't finish either dish and had to take them home. The butternut squash rigatoni? Holy cow. The classic pear salad was perfectly sweet and tart and textured. My husband got the Sicilian sandwich--WOW. We chose this place from the Yelp reviews, and they do not lie. Even the music played all of my favorite artists--a total win in my book. 

My only gripe was one of the hostesses. I understand modern fashion, but with her scattered, unwashed hair half-up in a non-ponytail and the T-shirt-dress accidentally showing off her rear when she bent over, and the lack of make up in general, she took the atmosphere from hip and casual to almost unprofessional--a far cry from the fashionable, laid back couture of her peers.
