The only complaint I have about this place is that they run out of stuff from time to time. But the po' boy is excellent, the ribs are great, and the cheesesteak is the best one in town. Get it. Eat it. Dream about it. To Hell with the Mr. Hero ones up the street. Dude that runs the place is always there and cooking the stuff in the parking lot next door.
