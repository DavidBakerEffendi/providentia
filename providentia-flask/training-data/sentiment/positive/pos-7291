I couldn't be happier to see another Bndz location! It's great to not have to trek through South Park to get one of my favorite burgers and fries. Furthermore, this location seems to be more open and spacious.
 While out and about in Mt. lebo, I called in my order and took my food to go. I immediately began to compare the new Bndz to my beloved South Park location. Overall, the food was spot on. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and delicious. My only gripe would be that they seemed to skimp a little on the fries. When you add on the fry and drink combo it's another $3. The burgers are already about 10-12$ each so, a little pricey to start. Therefore, if I'm paying 15$ for a burger and fries, I do expect to have a good size helping of those delicious fried sticks. 
Fries aside, my favorite aspect of Bndz is the emphasis on quality, hormone free meat. The ingredients are always fresh and of a higher quality than most. Have you tried the chicken bacon burger? Yes, it is diced chicken but, it's much tastier than the typical, dried out chicken breast most places call a burger. Overall, I'm thrilled to welcome Bndz to the growing restaurant scene in Mt. Lebo.
