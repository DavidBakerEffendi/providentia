This place is fantastic. We came here to celebrate a birthday party and were able to reserve the entire top floor of the restaurant. Everyone loved the margaritas, but if you want to get a bit more bold, try the beer-garita. 

When I came, I was starving and the chips and salsa were seriously incredible. I really love the salsa Verde, and everyone around me loved the salsa roja.

Despite my hunger, I wanted to have something a bit on the lighter and cheaper side. The fajita bowl fit the bill and was a great mix of vegetables, rice, beans and cheese. Nothing too fancy but still great. 

The waitresses were super nice and with such a large group, handled us really well. Definitely check this place out if you're in old Towne and looking for some quality eats.
