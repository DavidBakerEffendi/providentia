For a place that only has two items ( I would pray that is temporary), they make the tastiest impromptu meal I have eaten since I have started blogging.  I was taken aback of how fried baos can have such a rich broth yet maintain that crunchy texture.  Do take heed in their instructions on how to best eat this morsels of joy - make a small hole, slurp the broth and munch away.  The broth is satisfyingly hot (as in scalding in you just watched them place it in front of you, so take care!).  I think I am going to come back here regularly.  One more addition to my regular list of Yonge&Finch comfort foods :)
