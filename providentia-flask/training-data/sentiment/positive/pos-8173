This place was absolutely delicious. We got a groupon and decided to give it a go. Why more people aren't enjoying the flavors and entertainments are beyond my comprehension. This place was sadly empty. We were the only ones at one of many teppanyaki tables. Wake up people! You get delicious dinner and a show! The chef was super friendly and cooked our seafood perfectly. I couldn't ask for more.
