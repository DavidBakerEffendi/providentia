I can't believe I am looking at a 3 star rating. I have not went there once and been disappointed. Their korma and Maha Yuva AND mango drink was out of this world. 

I really don't have much else to say to make this review help worthy. The waiters were nice. The environment was clean and nice. Yelp wants me to write more. I guess parking is a pain. Do they deserve to lose a star because of parking? I don't think so. If they were not so good, I'd take a star. In my opinion, Yuva India was so good, I would actually consider wrestling with that Pittsburgh auto, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic AND drive around for an hour to find a place to park. 

Me and my family really enjoy going to Yuva India. Maybe we are not  as experienced with Indian food as those giving the low star reviews. I should read and find out what the problem is (other than things out of their control like where to put your car). It would be an absolute dream come true if an Indian place this nice would open up in my area.
