It was a while ago that I heard one of the Lotus of Siam guys had opened his own restaurant, and I still remember the first time I showed up at Chada and recognized Bank right away. Now that I've gone a few times, I'm happy to report that Chada is an easy 5* - fantastic Thai food executed very well. It doesn't need any bonus points, but definitely gets them for being open late night and having very low markup on an extensive selection of wines.

Absolute favorite dish here is the panang duck - it is one of the best duck dishes I have had anywhere, and I love my duck (sorry to all the cute ducklings out there...). Perfectly crispy, fantastic flavor. My other favorites are the tamarind soft shell crab and the spicy fried sea bass. The crab lettuce wraps appetizer is really good too.
