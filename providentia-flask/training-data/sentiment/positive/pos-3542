Decided to check out this place for some lunch and some drinks. Met the owner/chef while sitting at the bar with a friend, friendly guy from Argentina. We started off with some liquor drinks and I went for their 5$ Jameson special. For lunch my friend and I shared the mushroom goat chases bruschetta which was amazing and a must get if you like mushrooms. We split the steak sandwich and avocado egg rolls for the rest of our lunch and enjoyed those as well. A chill environment during the day time when we were there. Not sure about nights or game days though. Will be back for sure.
