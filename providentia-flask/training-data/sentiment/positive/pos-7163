The fountains at Bellagio are one of the best places to relax and enjoy a free show in Las Vegas. 

This is the biggest fountain I've ever seen and it's definitely one of my favorite attractions.I try and make at least 1 show a day in the last 3 years I've been to Vegas.

Honestly, it's free. What more could you ask for. 

It's every 15 minutes from 7pm until midnight on the weekends.
