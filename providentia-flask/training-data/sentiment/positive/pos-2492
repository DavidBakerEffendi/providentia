I went ere for lunch with my husband. He ordered the half club sandwich on flatbread and broccoli cheddar soup. I ordered the half Salami pesto and goat cheese on sourdough with soup. Everything was wonderful. Everything is fresh and tasty. It's a little hidden but definitely worth trying. I'll be going back to try breakfast.
