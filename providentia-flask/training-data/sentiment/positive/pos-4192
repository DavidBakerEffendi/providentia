I have been going here for years and cannot believe I haven't taken the time to write a review yet! So many reasons this place deserves a 5 star rating. I will start with the bathroom. Sometimes bathrooms do not get enough credit. Check this one out, I'll leave it at that. Food = amazing. Drinks = amazing. Service = amazing. Patio = even more amazing. And it's dog friendly! This is a place you do not want to pass up.
