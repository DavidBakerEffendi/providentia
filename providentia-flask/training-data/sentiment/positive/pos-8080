This place is not your ordinary Mexican Food place. It had a concept like Chilis/Applebee's where you order 3 - appetizer, entree, dessert to share. Not sure if it's a regular concept, but it does save money. (Not that I eat at either of those places, but I am familiar. ;)) They make the at the table guacamole which was really tasty and fresh. I'm not sure if this is a chain, but I'm almost certain it's not the owners first restaurant because it was run efficiently and well. They have Sunday Ticket so you can see the games, and plenty of TV's which was great. Whether you're with a group or just a partner, this is a great spot. Lots of drink options as well, the margaritas were good, and their low quality tequila is still 100% agave. As for quality, it's absolutely worth the price. Waitress was attentive and nice, I'd recommend the restaurant.
