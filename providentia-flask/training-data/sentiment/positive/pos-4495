I'm going to keep this simple.: Go

Step inside, take a deep breath.  The heavenly scent is just a preview.  I dined on the carne asada burrito with a side of guacamole.  Great flavors, awesome pico and guac just add a bit more wow.  My only caution would be to take the burrito slow -- I hadn't eaten all day and with the delicousness of this, I ate the whole thing in one sitting.  SO stuffed but I won't need to eat dinner.  

The other awesome thing about dining here was the music.  Songs went from a Mexican disco beat, to the BeeGee's "More Than a Woman", back to a Latin musical number, to a hip~hoppish club song.
