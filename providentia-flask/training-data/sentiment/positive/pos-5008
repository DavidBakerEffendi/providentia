I used to frequent Nova's on my way into work. I haven't been in quite awhile but I stopped this evening for a cup of Java. What made my quick stop even better was the gentleman working behind the counter. There was quite a line in front of me and he was patient, friendly and professional. When it was my turn I embarrassingly didn't have enough cash (who carries cash anymore?!) and didn't want to order other stuff just to meet their debit card minimum and also didn't want to purchase a gift card as I am moving out of Charlotte. He said not to worry, it was on him and told me to enjoy. Any other time I've been to Nova's in the morning the staff is always super friendly. Today topped all of my experiences there and I have to say that on top of the incredibly nice gesture, the coffee was perfectly brewed as usual. I will miss this awesome place when I move. Keep it up - the service, and yummy coffee.
