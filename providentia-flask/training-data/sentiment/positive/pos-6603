Little known fact- Beer Bistro's brunch many years ago was not stellar.  
BUT NOW IT IS!
So good- had the benny- I usually am not a fan of benny's but it seemed to dominate the menu.  So I ordered the mushroom benny.
Comes on a potato hash brown- so SO good, with a pile of delicious sauteed mushrooms, goat cheese and perfectly done eggs.
With a generous side of yummy greens this is like- my PERFECT breakfast.

Some here on the weekends for brunch! It's amazing.
(PS: It's also REALLY competitively priced.... I've spend much  more for much less in DT toronto for brunch.)
