Wow what an experience this breakfast was!!!  We stumbled on this gem while trying to find some food 'close' to our hotel before heading home.  From the minute we stepped inside we were awed by the organized chaos that was happening in every way.  The decor is hilarious and I loved it!  Mirrored ceiling tiles, fake plants everywhere you look, old school upholstery, neon lights, this place has it all.  
We were seated at the counter and as we order our cocktails we were told there would be a cocktail server around to help us.  What?  But sure enough a lady in a floor length black dress came by and quickly took our drink order before disappearing into the kitchen.  Then our food server came by  and did the rest of the work, very unique set up.  The restaurant was VERY busy on a Saturday morning and the staff was buzzing about trying to get everyone fed, paid and out the door.  We ordered the ham and eggs and the steak and eggs, everything was huge and pretty well done.  Unfortunately I had to leave about half of my breakfast since it was so large but now we know to share for next time.
