I have been wanting to try this place for a long time! Nothing says delicious breakfast like a perfectly made egg sandwich. The place is a bit small with limited seating area, I believe that's why the lines are unnecessarily long most of the time, but it is definitely a popular place despite the small size.

I ordered an eggsalad sandwich, for a quick pick me up before heading out for meetings. I had a hard finding an empty seat for just myself , waited for a few minutes for someone else to finish up first. 
The egg salad was creamy , almost melts in my mouth with every bite! Worth every dollar! The pretzel bread adds a bit of a special taste to the sandwich !
Definitely a must try place for the food, and even more so just to try it because why wouldn't you want to try a restaurant named "eggslut"
