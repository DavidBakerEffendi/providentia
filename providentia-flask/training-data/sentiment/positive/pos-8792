I love the small local places! This cozy little restaurant is no exception. I was really craving some korean food in the Madison area and I think I've found my go to place. I'll definitely be coming back to try some more of their food. We had the two person pot thing and the flavor was awesome. Really recommend it to anybody who wants to try some good Korean food.
