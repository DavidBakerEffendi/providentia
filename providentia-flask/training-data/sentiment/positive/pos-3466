I live right between here and Solo Cafe (another nearby coffee shop). I always end up going to Steve's when I need to get work done. They've got bigger tables and a generally more mature clientele. They also play some good music, which unlike Solo, is relaxing and easy to work to.

And not to mention the coffee... it's the best in town. They french press every cup, which I love. The refills are cheap, unlike Solo.
I haven't tried the food, but it looks great and always tempts me.
