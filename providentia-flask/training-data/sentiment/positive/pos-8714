Excellent service, food and atmosphere! Got here on a busy Friday night at 6:30 and it was packed, was told a 50 minute wait...Ouch but they got us seated in about 35 minuets (Yay) Our waitress Mariam was a excellent waitress, very tentative and kept checking on us throughput the evening. We got the Surf and Turf and an order of Lobster Tacos (Lobster Fest) so we had to get Lobster  the food was excellent and their cheddar bay biscuits were great...fresh and hot!!
