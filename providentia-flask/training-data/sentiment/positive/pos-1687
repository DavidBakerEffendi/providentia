The best wings in Madison. Period. Point. That's all.  If you haven't been here I would say find a reason to go ASAP.  Chicken Lips is a hole in the wall far away from Madison and close to Sun Prairie.  The place is totally no frills.  I mean there is literally nothing impressive about the location.  But that doesn't matter because it's the food that you are here for.  They have the smallest menu that I have even seen.  It is literally a few sandwiches, fries, onion rings, and 4 flavors of wings.  

The chicken here are amazing though!  They are perfectly crisp, not too spicy, and have the perfect amount of sauce.  I have been to a ton of other wing places here and they can't hold a flame to this place. I typically order the original because they are best sometimes however when I am feeling a little wild I order the dry rub.  The dry rub is great but the original is where its at.

We rarely leave Sun Prairie without making a pit stop at this place as well!
