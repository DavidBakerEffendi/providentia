I ate here this morning. I had the Roasted Tomato, Pesto Egg Sandwich - it was great. There was a small side of banana slices with some sort of cereal flakes (?) and some honey. Delicious. This was the best breakfast I've had in a while. The iced tea was good, but not great - would probably stick to my usual water next time. I definitely recommend the sandwich.

Service was not terribly swift, but friendly and quite competent. One orders at the counter and then food is brought to your table. The place is cute and set up well. Art on the wall is interesting and good. 

I definitely plan to go back. Lunch looks great. The desserts look terrible - WAY too many calories. If they taste as half as good as they look, I better not try one.
