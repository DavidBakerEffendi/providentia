Korean all you can eat!!!! Located next to Greenland in Korea Town, this Resturant is cute and very clean. They keep a tight ship here... There's three different types of AYCE here...  You can choose which one you want to do. Each one has different types of meat and side dishes you can choose from... The bahn chan are the typical ones you usually get when having Korean food. Service here is great, they come around place your choice of meats and cut up your meat for you...Nice place nice people... Great food, especially because it's Korean food!!!
