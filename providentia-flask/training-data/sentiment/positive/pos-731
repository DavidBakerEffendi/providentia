Okay so I had to come back because my first experience was very good, and I needed to see and taste more of this place.  My second time here was amazing. Maybe it was the sushi chef we had (there are 2) but the rolls we ordered were phenomenal.  Service improved, still had a few hitches but nothing to cry home about.  I recently just moved from the East Side, and I am happy to have found a sushi spot that rival most places I have been to in the valley.  Not just the valley, but even most places from my hometown of San Diego and southern California.

Try the Las Vegas, Maui and Tusy Rolls.  Very fresh, and good portion sizes.

My only concern is that they keep consistent with the great quality sushi and portions,  and with that I will be coming here several times a week.
