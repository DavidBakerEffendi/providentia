Long-time vegetarians have learned to be suspicious of buffets. What's okay for me to eat? Is there any meat lurking in that innocuous-looking pasta? A vegetarian buffet is like a dream come true. A vegetarian buffet (+ entree  + coffee/tea) for 10 bucks is a dream come true for a girl who just finished grad school and needs to find a job.

Zenith, you're a dreamboat. 

The entire store and dining area is super charming with antiques everywhere. Even the water glasses are fancy. Bonus points for having water pitchers on each table. The buffet can be divided into two categories--savory and sweet. On the savory side, there's bread and an array of bean salads, pasta salads, hummus, and other vegetable dishes. Some standouts were the potato salad and the sesame noodle salad. As for the sweet side, there are 10 types of bundt cake, from Earl Grey with blueberries to almond ginger to several kinds of chocolate cake, and 2 kinds of pie.

On top of that, I enjoyed my Tofishy--which was fried and breaded tofu on a bun with lettuce and tomato, and vegan cocktail sauce (vegan tartar sauce was the other option). Oh, cocktail sauce. I haven't had you in a long time, as you often contain Worcestershire sauce, and because I didn't know what else you could go with besides seafood. I didn't realize how much I missed you. 

Even folks less keen on tofu will be happy here--there are always more standard brunch entree options like pancakes, French toast and eggs. While I did visit on a big graduation weekend, which might skew the clientele a little bit, I feel like the mix of young, middle-aged and elderly people eating here shows that everyone will find yummy bliss at Zenith's Sunday brunch.
