I friggin love this place. Great concept! Always a treat for me and my family to come down here. My gf loves the bulgogi carne Asada fries and bugs me to grab them for her when she craves. Lol.
I usually stick to the chili cheese dog because it's great. But every time I order something new to try it's always pretty good! 
The staff always really chill and helpful too.. 
I definitely recommend and tell anybody I meet about it if they are looking for something exciting and interesting when it comes to dogs!
