Food-wise, this place is already at 4, 4 1/2 stars.  Add in the fantastic margaritas and cocktails and it surpasses five stars.  My favorite is the Firestarter which is weird because I don't like ginger beer.  It is made with GB and jalapeno infused tequila and is a kick to your tastebuds.  The one I don't recommend is the one made with 100 year old Cointreau.  Not because it is bad, but it is not worth $16.

My wife always gets the quesedilla.  The chicken is tender and juicy and the tortilla crisp.  The quesedilla comes with guac, sour cream and pico de gallo which are all delicious.  The guac is fresh made (I've been told) and the pico de gallo also seems very fresh.

I have tried a wide variety of things but I always get the stuffed jalapenos.  They are wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cheese.  Sometimes spicier than others, but always good.  I often get the steak or chicken fajitas.  While pricier than your "mom & Pop" places, they are worth it.  You don't get a little pile of steak that looks like shoe leather.  This is real steak, cut well and cooked properly.  It is not tough at all and you can actually bite through it unlike at some places.
