I am a big fan of this place. I love their consistency. It's nice that the owners recognize you, shake your hand, and thank you for coming in. Weekend mornings look like there will be a long wait but they are very efficient, even with 30 people outside it normally doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes to be sat. The food comes out quickly as well so it's always a pleasant experience.

I recommend the 1/2 and 1/2 with a scramble and protein pancakes. Hits the spot every time and plenty of food to leave full.
