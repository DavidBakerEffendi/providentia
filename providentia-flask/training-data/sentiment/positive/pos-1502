I've been wanting to come here for monnnnnnnths but never got around to because brunch is only served sundays but I work sundays... However, I found out certain brunch items such as fried chicken and waffles is served saturdays so I went down the first saturday I was available. FYI, this is the first time I've had fried chicken and waffles in my LIFE. AND I LOVEE IT! As long as it tastes like the ones here or better, I'm good. First of all, the presentation was very instagram-worthy. On top of the fried chicken was a monstrous amount of curly shredded carrots. An amount good enough to justify that eating fried chicken and waffles can't be too bad for you. lol. Moving on to the fried chicken, it was deliciously tasty and flavourful! Although I admit the waffles lacked a biiiit of flavour but that still was not a big enough setback to give them anything less than five stars.
