Had the stone bi bim bop!  It was great!  The stone keeps the food nice and hot and I love how the rice that touches the stone gets that nice crispiness to it.

The pot comes with rice, beef, a fried egg on top, and vegetables (including mushroom, carrots, bean sprouts).  It comes out sizzling and the smell is just appetizing.

We also ordered the special which included rice, salad, and and a variety of meats.  It had the gyoza, meat chun (egg-battered beef), chicken (tasty), kalbi, bulgogi, and beef.   Overall very happy with the food here and would get it again.

They also do to-go which is a plus!
