Within walking distance of my office. 'Nuff said. 

Okay well there is more. I've gotten accustomed to the whole "stay in the care in the drive thru" at places like starbucks, but got tired of doing the same old. Decided to check out Urban Beans...well a meeting brought me here...and was really happy with the experiences. The art is good, the place is a good size and not too overwhelming in sound or furniture, and the folks are nice. Even a nice outside porch for sitting, but that can get a little loud because of the street. I just like plain coffee, and its hot and strong. 

I'm a big iced tea person, and they have great ice tea. The tea isn't too sweet, the large is actually large, and the value is definitely there. Plenty of parking too. I'll keep going.
