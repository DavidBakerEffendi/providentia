YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(315/365) "Brick And Mortar"

Open for just over two weeks now,  Tacos El Buen Pastor has finally opened their restaurant location right across Cardenas on Meadows and Decatur! 

Not only can you feast on the best al pastor tacos in town IMO,  but they have expanded their menu to also include other specialties from Jalisco,  Mexico like Tortas Ahogadas and for those of you who remember Birrieria Jalisco back in the day (where Cornish Pasty now stands) Their Birria de Chivo ( Goat ) Estillo Jalisco is very hearty, delicious and generous in portion size (two sizes, $9 and $15) and comes with freshly made corn tortillas. Perfect for this cold weather!  I've never had a Torta Ahogada before ($6.50) so we got one done classically with Carnitas
(However,  you may choose among their other meat selections, and the bread is said to also come from Mexico) this was also pretty huge, hearty, and good.

One of the great things about TEBP is their ordering system: you walk in and peruse the menu...When you know what you want, place your order with the person behind the counter,  pay,  and go find a seat. The cooks call your name when your order is up, and your food is nice and hot. No having to go to a certain line for a certain item, and when you're finally done paying,  your food is cold like those other places **cough El Gordo, Taco Y Taco cough** 

Very comfy seating and spacious inside, with fresh agua frescas that change every so often (there was Horchata and Guayaba) and a full salsa bar to customize your order as you wish. Come check them out!  ALOHA!!!
