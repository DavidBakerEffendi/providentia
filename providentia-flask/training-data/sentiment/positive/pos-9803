JJ's has the best hotdogs anywhere! I think of myself as a bit of a hotdog aficionado and theirs are fantastic! They use Sahlens and are grilled. They also put plenty of toppings on them. My favorite signature hot dog that they do is the "Char Heel" - chili, onions, coleslaw and yellow mustard. The entire staff was friendly and helpful.
