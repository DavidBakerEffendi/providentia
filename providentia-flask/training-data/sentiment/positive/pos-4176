I might have finally found the Mexican Restaurant I was looking for in Pittsburgh.  I love tacos, and prior to visiting Casa Rasta I only loved Reyna's and the Pittsburgh Taco Truck's tacos.  Well, I have to add a third taquer√≠a to this list, and one that has inside seating!

We started with the avocado fries and the beef tongue tips, both were fantastic.  I easily could have just had two more orders of the avocado fries and went home happy.  However, I came for tacos and tacos I would have.  I had 3 tacos: the Steak, Citrus Marinated Pork, and the Jerk Chicken.  All were fantastic.  There was a lot of meat on each taco, and each was flavored perfectly.  However, why skimp on the avocado cream sauce on the Steak Taco?  That should be on every taco ever, end of story.  

I didn't plan on having dessert, but when I hear homemade nutella cheesecake, I am powerless.  It was even better than it sounds.  Just get it.
