What a unique joint! The uncluttered, clean asthetic, friendly staff, and absolutely mind-blowing food make this a must stop for vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores alike. How can you miss the meat when you have interesting taste combinations overloading your taste buds. We tried the perogies, potato dumplings, and tartines. We chose the dishes based on Yelp reviews. Also, we asked the gentleman working the counter, who took our order (Jack, who was very friendly and knowledgeable), what would go best with our main picks. He was right on point. The cocktails sounded great, but I ended up having the Draai Laag table beer. This place scored major points for having both Roundabout and Draai Laag on tap. 

No doubt we'll be back!!!
