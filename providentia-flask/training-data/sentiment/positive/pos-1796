Best place for sandwiches.  Always served fresh and taste great.  I go here often usually saturday mornings around 9am and always get the Italian night out with extra mayo.  Must try their tuna sandwich from their big sandwich menu, best I've ever had.  Friendly people great you as you enter and leave.
