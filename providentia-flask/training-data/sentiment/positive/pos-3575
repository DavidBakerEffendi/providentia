Amazing service and food!!! I am definitely coming back. I would recommend the tacos, quesadilla, but not the sandwich. The food here is very authentic, it's a small cute intimate place and even though it's not exactly a restaurant - their service is still amazing. They give complimentary home made chips with hot sauce. It is a bit pricey but worth it. All I can say is I was very happy and I am definitely coming back for more.
