Man am I so thrilled that this restaurant is just a few miles away from me. I've bed hitting it on the way home from the gym and the take out buffet tastes just as good at home as it does there, although I love the friendliness and warm vibes while dining in. Today I particularly loved the cabbage. CABBAGE you guys! How often does one say that?
