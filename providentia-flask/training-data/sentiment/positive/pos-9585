This restaurant has been here since I was a little girl. And it is excellent! Always has been! The breakfast is beyond compare! The wait was a little long, but well worth it.

The eggs are made exactly how I like them...every time I am here!  The hash browns are perfection and bacon is crisp yet juicy!  

Coffee...to die for!  I love the sugar-so whimsical!! 

It's hard to mess up breakfast food but it is perfect here,,,every time and with a packed house!
