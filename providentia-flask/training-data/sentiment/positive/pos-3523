Every In-N-Out I've been to has always been accommodating. My friends and I had to grab some orders to go for our flight, so this was our stop. All the workers here had a smile on their face. 

Anyway, I trust this location fully because I forgot to ask them to double bag my burgers and my burgers fell and tumbled on the ground of the airport as I was walking into my gate...but they remained intact and together. A miracle. Needless to say, I was desperate for my fix and I still ate them. Not ashamed because they were still heavenly. 5 second rule, amirite?
