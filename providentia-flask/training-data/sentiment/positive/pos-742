One of the great places to eat good Lebanese grills and shawerma.
I tried their Shawerma plate, and their Shish Tawouk (chicken cubes skewers) and they are both great. Their Fries are also great - which is rare to find for a shawerma place!

Only thing needs to be fixed: Fattouch and Tabouleh - but this is a fast food Lebanese, so shouldnt judge for the salads much.
