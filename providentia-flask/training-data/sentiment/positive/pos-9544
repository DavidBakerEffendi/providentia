We got the smokehouse platter: pulled pork, brisket, ribs & wings w/cornbread. Every single thing on the plate ROCKED. 

If you come here, you MUST get wings. WHOLE wings seasoned, smoked, and then grilled in one of many tasty sauces. Their BBQ sauce is awesome also. 

Had the Savage Stout... Outstanding. Tasted the Smokie Robbins... Even better. 

Sat at the bar, had perfect service. An all-around great experience.
