Happy celebration at Jim Gould with a meal which far exceded my expectations!

I realize that you are in a happy mood when your child graduates from college and so that happiness might spill over to wherever you go to celebrate.  BUT I had also lost a very expensive chocolate diamond earring in the midst of the ceremony and was still in a tearful shocked sadness about that.  And we still had a great time - that's one hell of a good meal!

We were treated very well with superb service from Pierre and three amazing appetizers - Ceviche, Crab cakes and Calamare - I loved all three of them.  Then we all got our meat on and had various steaks with tasty veggies and potatoes.  We even managed to split a delicious strawberry cake and very satisfying lattes.

Great day, great meal and no more tuition payments.  And if you see an errant chocolate diamond earring, send it my way!
