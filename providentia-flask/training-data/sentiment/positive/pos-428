Fantastic food! 
I swear the steak fajitas were made with ribeye steak - no cheap meat here. And the refreid beans - best I've ever had.

The rest of our party had enchilatas - good, rice bowl - good, and a buritto - good. A grand slam. Not often does everyone get a great meal when you try 4 different meals.

The bean dip is also great, had it as part of the dip sampler. Ice tea is solid.

As far a decor, it's not a dive, but a step up. But no one is walking around with their nose in the air (unlike some other Scottsdale joints). Service, well, its not terrible, but you're not coming here for the service. Come for the food! I know we'll be back.
