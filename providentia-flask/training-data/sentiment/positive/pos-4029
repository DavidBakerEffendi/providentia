Hands down, the best buffet in Las Vegas. I don't care what anyone says, this place is amazing. 

Pricey. Yes. $34.00 per person for dinner, but its a buffet! That means, eat until you cant eat anymore! You know? Gluttony: its the American way! 

They were able to accommodate our party of 40 after the wedding. It took about 45 minutes at peak dinner time, but everyone was seated together and happy. That's worth 5 stars all on its own. But the food....... ohhhh the food. I started with a mountain of KING crab legs... no snow crab here, my friends! The next plate I got was an array of foods including: ostrich, Kobe beef, sushi, shrimp, different salads and pastas, etc. The display was incredibly impressive.
