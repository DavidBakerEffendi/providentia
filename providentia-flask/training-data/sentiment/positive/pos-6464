Came here wanting to try a new restaurant and being a huge fan of Thai food.. I'm glad I tried this place. Such a welcoming and clean atmosphere. Definitely has a romantic setting if you're trying to go on a date. Server was very kind and knowledgeable with everything on the menu. I ordered the pineapple fried rice and it was certainly an enjoyable dish with fried rice tucked into a fresh pineapple with shrimp and chicken. I'm usually not a fan of pineapple fried rice but it was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend ordered the choo Chee salmon which had a kick of spiciness to it but indeed it was delicious as well. It also had eggplant which I thought complemented the salmon perfectly. I wish I had room to try the mango sticky rice which seeing other pictures on yelp looked really good but it definitely gives me a reason to come back!
