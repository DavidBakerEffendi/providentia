It's been a few months and a few more visits to Sofra and I have to upgrade my previous review. The service really has improved markedly since my first few visits. The staff are very pleasant and very quick. They've got this neat button system to page your server for certain things. More water, the bill, etc.

Either the quality of the food has improved as well, or I was just ordering the wrong thing the whole time! The chicken shawarma is delicious, but even better in the laffe bread. The portion is massive.... And I mean eat half now and eat the other half later kind of massive. I usually go with the soup and sandwich deal because the chicken lentil soup is absolutely killer. 

This place is quickly becoming a favourite in Richmond Hill....and I only live 5 minutes away....muHAHAHAHA.
