In-N-Out burger is the best.  They are the most consistent hamburger joint ever.  I literally have never had a bad burger!  The employees are always so friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is very clean.  They are always super busy because their product is great.  They have hidden menu items so look it up!!  Animal style is delicious!!  They are also very fast at getting your food out and everything is cooked to order and fresh.  The fries are actually cut by hand and cooked seconds before serving.  Their prices are very reasonable especially for the quality of the meat.  My family loves In-N-Out burger, it's the best!!!
