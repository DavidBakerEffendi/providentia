What an amazing Tapas experience.  We tried several of the standards...Honey Walnut Shrimp, Seared Pork Belly, Beef Tenderloin, Shrimp Ceviche, and Marinated Cucumbers. The highlight was Scallops Under Glass...a glass dome infused with hickory smoke...delicious! As for dessert the Tahitian Pearl is out of this world!  When the hot caramel sauce cracks through the chocolate shell vanilla ice cream it's amazing. The owners Larry and Emily stopped by to say hello!  What a great place! Highly recommended!
