I've been 3 times now, the most recent being tonight, and each time has been a great experience. I've had several different dishes, including the restaurant week chicken sandwich and meatballs, which were delicious. The monkey bread is out of this world and tonight I had kale and white bean soup and the shrimp and linguini. The sauce in the linguini was a little boring and I expected the soup to be thicker and more hearty but the food has always been top notch.

Service today in the lounge was a little aloof, not very engaging.
