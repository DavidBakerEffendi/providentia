Nothing at all to complain about for a business lunch. Great service, the menu has lots of choices. The pork belly tacos are a must have. I might get them for lunch and an appetizer next time. I had the Kobe sliders and it was a perfect lunch. Tons of salty crispy fries. Plenty to share. Love the location and the meal.
