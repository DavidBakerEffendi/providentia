Affordable sashimi that is fresh and reliable. I've had sushi takeout and dine in here for a total of 4 times. 3/4 times the fish was fresh, this is already a big plus considering that one time was lunch. So my advice is order takeout for dinner and sit back and enjoy it in front of your tv. The restaurant is small and gets crowded after working hours.
