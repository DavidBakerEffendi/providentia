This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley (yes, I've been to Lotus of Siam). We always split an order the chicken pad thai ((no bean sprouts)) and chicken satay and typically have enough for lunch the next day. Their satay peanut sauce is BOMB and service is ALWAYS fast.  Takeout is just as good and satisfying as dining in and your order is usually available in under 20 minutes. We've tried the location on Rainbow, but it just didn't seem to be the same- a bummer because we're moving soon and won't be at all close to this location anymore. The corny instrumental versions of popular songs are always entertaining to listen to while waiting for your food!

Great spot for a date before catching a movie in the same shopping center.
