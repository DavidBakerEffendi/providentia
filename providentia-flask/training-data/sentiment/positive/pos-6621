Visited this place about a week ago with my aunt while she was in town. We dropped by on a Wednesday for lunch, they weren't overly busy so we were seated right away. I was a little surprised by the nice table cloths, but pink plastic cups, but the food speaks for itself. I had the tuna melt sandwich which isn't typical at all! It has a nice spicy kick to it, just enough to wake up your tastebuds. I also had May-Ways pasta salad on the side and it is pleasantly Asian inspired with a kick of its own. Service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly. I will definitely be back again soon!
