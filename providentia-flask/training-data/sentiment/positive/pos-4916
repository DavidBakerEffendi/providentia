No surprise, this place never ceases to amaze me. The detail in preparation & quality of food is simply outstanding. It's been almost a year since I've been back but I'm glad I did. I always find my self savoring every bite. Thanks to our waiter Troy! Very friendly staff and awesome service. This place simply can't be beat and I will continue to recommend this place to all my friends and family.
