I love this local sushi restaurant.  They just added a daily happy hour from 3-6, 20% off of everything including alcohol.  The owner is delightful and has a heart of gold.  The fish is fresh.. Yum.  They are only open for dinner starting at 3, until the Fall they will resume lunch . closed Mondays.
