Amazing place to grab a protein filled breakfast.

I ordered the spice rubbed ribeye with the chiliquilles. The ribeye came out super tender and charred nicely. The Nachos on the side with the refried beans, cheese, and egg works so good with the steak. 

This location is the best one I have been to in regards to the service which was top notch the entire time we was in the resturant. 

We also ordered the country ham steak which was a little on the mediocre side. Do your self a favor and stick with the staple this place does. Get da steak and eggs!!!
