Hands down this is the BEST Mexican fusion restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. Located just off the trolley tracks in Beechview, this little storefront venue is an amazing find. Antonio and crew keep it simple but savory. Where else can you get burritos with savory Jerk Chicken? Or tostadas with homemade chorizo and mango? The prices are amazingly inexpensive... and it's BYO... so a meal will not break the bank if the fiscal cliff has put a dent in your finances. If you are in the South Hills, or want to make a little trip just off of Banksville Road: try this gem!
