One thing I Miss about LA is Chinatown and the places that serve fresh noodles. Noodle Asia is a little more upscale but it's got great selection. It's located at the Venetian. But not at the best location. Right next to the Race and Sports book, they got one of them there Chinese places. Actually this restaurant houses some of the best fresh noodle makers here. So I'm here enough times when my family comes into town.
Won Ton soup. Large steaming bowl of freshly made won tons. And they're BIG!
Red Won Tons.... Spicy...Not for white people
Large cantonese BBQ plate Yea I LOVE DUCK --- bbq pork is fresh and doesn't look like it's been sitting. Soy sauce chicken...well it's hard to really f*ck up soy sauce chicken.
Pot stickers are fresh! The Sui Mai and Har Gow are fresh.....popping flavors.
Night Market Fried Rice --- YUMMY!
XO Shrimp Lai Fen --- SPICY and Yummy! 
Well watch out --- if you don't like thick noodles --- make sure you watch what you get. Ask the server. 
But overall --- service is efficient and there are actually asian people working and not mexican in the kitchen....
