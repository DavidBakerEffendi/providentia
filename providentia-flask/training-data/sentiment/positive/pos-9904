One of my favorite Italian restaurants so far! I loved the food and we all left feeling great due to the awesome experience. 

Don't let the pink painted building with bright blue neon lights catch you off guard. The atmosphere is unique with revolvers and swords on the walls. The service is down to earth and very good. But the food...oh the food...I left wondering and hoping the next time I could return was sometime in the very near future..

I had the shrimp dish with mushrooms and spinach. It also came with a bowl of pasta and marinara sauce.  I want going to eat the pasta...but it only took one bite for me to realize how awesome it was. Yum. Others had the Fettuccini Alfredo. It was so creamy and delicious. The bread and olive oil mixture was sooo good! 

I am so looking forward to going back!
