Rolando's rules! It was open at 10:30pm when we'd had a horrific travel day and just wanted to grub on some real Mexican food after always suffering through Seattle "Mexican food." I think I angered and/or confused them by asking for a bean taco instead of beef, but they hooked me up. The cheese enchilada, rice and beans were all bomb, too. I liked their various salsas, and my companions enjoyed their food. Everything was cheap AF and authentic tasting. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town.
