I've picked up take-out here about a dozen times, and the food does not disappoint.  Especially their al pastor with hunks of griddled pineapple!  They've converted me to being a quesadilla lover

And their salsa bar BEST I've ever come across.  Crisp and clean in a covered stainless steel mise en place cart from hot to mild, various kinds in-between, with limes and sliced radish and green onion.  Stellar

I will say though their concept is wonky.  You walk in, and there are purty tables set up for dine-in wait service, but, over the counter is a menu board?  Is it take out?  Is it sit down?  Confusing to say the least.  I'm going to say they'd be better served to just simply focus on being a order at the counter joint.  The wait service kinda scares me away, and I've only ordered takeout but DAMN, the takeout

btw, it's BYOB, and there's a liquor store right next door.  The one time I did eat in, I was given a chilled glass to pour my beer in.  Bonus points
