For the last couple of weeks my coworkers have appeared with hot dogs for lunch.
They smelled and looked pretty good so today I decided to screw the salad and tag along.

Vic met our crew with a smile and joke while we talked through the options for hot dogs. When I go to places like this I usually follow the pack and order what ever the Chef recommends. Growing up in Chicago I have had my share of hot dogs so I was interested on his take of the subject now that I am down here in the south.

The crew decided I needed 4 hot dogs a couple "Life Changers" and "Heroin".
I only got 2, one of each. (I should of got 4)The combination of flavors on the hot dogs were well thought out. The jalapenos actually had a flavor crunch to them. (Most places just throw toppings on). It was obvious to me that a far amount of pre-prep was done before he appears.
