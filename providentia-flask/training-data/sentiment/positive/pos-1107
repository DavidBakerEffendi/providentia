I met a friend for lunch that works in the building next door today and we came in to eat. The food was phenomenal!!! I had a cup of the day's soup and a salmon wrap. Taste, presentation, quality, and price = All fantastic! I'll be in Toronto again on Thursday and am already planning to go back for lunch then.
