I love love this place!!!  

As a child my parents brought us here at least once a week.  As an adult I live a little further away so trips have become few and far between.  Last night my husband suggested we go because I wasn't feeling well and he knows that their sizzling rice soup is my favorite!!! 

It was so awesome to walk thru the doors and feel like I was back to my childhood, nothing has changed and the best part the food hadn't either still it's great flavor!!   Best Chinese food around!!! 

Tonight we enjoyed the sizzling rice soup, egg rolls, cashew shrimp and pork fried rice..

You have to try this place, you won't be disappointed in the food or the service and you will come back for more guaranteed..
