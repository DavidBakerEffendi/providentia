Fourth time here at this place, and I'm going with a winner. I gauge every Mexican place here in the Valley off of their Machaca chimis, and this one has scored each time. Unlike the "other" ones here in the Arrowhead Ranch area, this one delivers a crisp outer layer (guac and sour cream) with moist meat inside. The spice is a bit much at time, and they could add some cheese to the inside, but comparability, this one is the best in the area.

The fam has had the Quesadillas without complaints, and the service is top notch. Although it's order and sit, you get real plates and real silverware, and a few HD televisions to watch while you eat. The owner may be a bit finicky picking things off your table while you're conversing with someone, but I guess it's better than being ignored. The salsa bar is fresh, and the chips were okay, but at times the cashier forgets to give them to you. 

I chalk these up to new opening jitters, and as long as the quality stays, I'll be a regular. Ambiance and politeness is much better than the surrounding 'others' you'll have to deal with here in Arrowhead Ranch.
