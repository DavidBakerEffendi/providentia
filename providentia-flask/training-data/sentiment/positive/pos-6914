Came in for a quick lunch. This place is a true hidden gem. Located on Durango and flamingo same plaza as Albertsons. This place is hip and modern and very clean. Friendly staff. Was greeted by a gentleman named chad. Nice cool guy very knowledgable about the menu. Came here with a buddy he ordered the combination ramen, and I got the pork tenderloin ramen with egg. The broth was amazing. Not so heavy like all the other ramen spots. Also got gyoza as an appetizer, yes they do either pan fried or steam. Definitely recommend.
