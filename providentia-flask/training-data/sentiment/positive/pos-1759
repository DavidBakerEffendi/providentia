We always eat here at least once when in town. Never had a problem walking in and getting a seat right away (with two people). The service is always excellent: quick, efficient and friendly. We eat at the Wynn often because all their restaurants have vegetarian/vegan options. The vegan brunch menu here is especially delicious. Our go-to favorites are the vegan chicken and waffles or the tofu scramble (yum!).
