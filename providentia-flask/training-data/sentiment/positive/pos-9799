Came here last minute for dinner on Thursday.

The place was empty except for another customer. Which I personally enjoyed because it meant a peaceful environment. 

The girl serving was extremely friendly, helpful, and sweet. She helped make the experience that much better. She showed energy and it made me feel happy to eat there.

The garlic knots were amazing! They were soft, buttery, and fluffy. People definitely need to try it if they at Biaggio's Pizzeria!!
We ordered the White Pizza and added chicken. The medium size was more than enough for two people. The pizza was delicious and I will be back for more in the future~

I definitely recommend people check this pizzeria out! (^0^)
