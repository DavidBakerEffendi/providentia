Decided to visit this taco shop today & boy is it yummy...I ordered the carne asada...it's loaded worth meat,  pico, guac, beans, fries... The portions are huge... I'm seriously struggling to finish my meal. Great customer service. Met the owner & talked to him while food was being prepared...will def add this one on my list.
