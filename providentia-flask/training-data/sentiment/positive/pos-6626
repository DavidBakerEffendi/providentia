When I think great steakhouse in Cleveland the Cabin Club is always my first choice.

Great cozy intimate atmosphere.  It's literally a log cabin - hence the name.

Passing by from the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you step through the doors you can tell immediately that you're about to get an amazing meal.

Lobster hush puppies are my favorite starter.  The blacked bleu delmonico is out of this world, too!

After a hard day of work, or to celebrate a special occasion the Cabin Club is in my opinion the best place.  It's been the far westside's best little secret for many many years.
