This is a fabulous place to go for brunch. Upon arriving, we felt we were someplace other than phoenix! The views of the mountains and foliage were great. There's so much room to spread out on the picnic tables and around the lawn. I had the curried chicken salad sandwich. The service was great and they offered me a sample before I tried just to make sure I would like it. I loved sitting outside in the shade and enjoying a nice glass of lemonade! I will definetly be back!
