All Hail Los Dos!

I love this place.... but don't come here if you are looking for service or to get in or out in a prompt manner.  Come here for the food:  The absolute best Mexican in Phoenix.  

Their salsas are great, although the red was a bit salty for my liking.
Highest recommendation to the green chile smothered pork burrito which is a house special probably 3 days a week.  Man it is good.

Most of the food is super super (super) uber spicy.  The Garlic Shrimp over rice is one exception... even the tacos have some heat to them.

During the summer, it is a bit of a pain in the arse to come here... the restaurant is cramped, so you have to wait outside.  Also, don't come here on Sundays, the place is closed.

We've eaten here with a newborn, and the staff treated us very well.... in fact he really enjoyed looking at all of the chili pepper lights on the ceiling.
