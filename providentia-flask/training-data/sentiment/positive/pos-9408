By far one of the BEST Mexican hot spots in the Carolina's!! 

The Margarita's are fabulous, and the table side guacamole has the kind of flavor that is a "close your eyes while you eat good"!!

We love their taco's especially...and always have to have the chipotle ranch.
If I listed all the dishes that are our favorites... I may end up listing the majority of the menu. 

We are not big fans of the dessert selections, but because our meal is so great...we are normally too full to go there anyhow (dessert)

For lunch I really enjoy the "chopped salad"...and talk about great Mexican style  c o r n....roll it a little in the chipotle ranch and you will be in flavor heaven!!

We eat Cantina 3-4 times a month....I would love to suggest frequent patron card..so those of us that are regulars could get a free appetizer every once in a while!! :+)

I do not know Frank (the owner) personally....but what I do know is that he has great restaurants in Charlotte.... 

Mama Ricotta's
Big Daddy's Burger
Cantina 1511 

...and soon to add a Taco spot somewhere near South Park Mall.
