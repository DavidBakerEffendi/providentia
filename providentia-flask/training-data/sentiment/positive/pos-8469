How have I not discovered this gem yet? Highly recommend visiting for lunch!

Within my one hour lunch break, I was able to drive to Thai House, get lost, be seated, be served, and drive back. Service was excellent, complete with complimentary soup. 

I ordered the lunch Pad-See-Ewe special and it was seriously delicious. I asked for medium heat and they NAILED IT. Thick, scrumptious noodles with crispy broccoli and shrimp - YUM. Will definitely be back!
