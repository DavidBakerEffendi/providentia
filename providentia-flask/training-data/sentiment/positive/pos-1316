I love this place! I have been coming here since it opened back in the day so I have always had a soft spot for this place! Not fond of The Vine though. But the new place is great! Yes it has Vegan food! But delicious VEGAN FOOD!! So far I have had the Calabacitas Burrito, lots of good fresh veggies in a yummy tortilla! I did let them know I would prefer if the veggies were cut up smaller. The lady who I told was so nice about listening to me. I have also had the Goat Cheese Quesadilla not my favorite, I love Goat Cheese but it was just too much for me. The Jalapeno Marmalade was excellent though! My absolute favorite is the Black Coffee Chili and Cornbread!!! The Chili is full of yummy beans corn and lots of other veggies! But the spice is PERFECT! It has a nice kick to it! And the Cornbread is outstanding! Who knew Vegan butter was so good! I also love their breakfast and coffee! Now the bakery items are in a category in there own! Everything is displayed by the coffee bar and EVERYTHING is delicious and addicting! I have had the cookies and a Chocolate Cherry Scone! Both are out of this world good! This place is literally steps away from my desk at work so it is very dangerous!! Please give The Coronado a chance! Great friendly people who really care about the food and drinks they are serving! My only complaint is.. I wish they would decorate for Halloween! That old house is perfect for Halloween..my favorite holiday! ;)
