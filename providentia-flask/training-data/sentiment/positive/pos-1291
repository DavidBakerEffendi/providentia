It felt like you combined a rustic cottage with a cathedral, breathtaking interior design. Loved the authentic design and cultural aspects of this pub, which combined with their friendly staff, unique lighting (low lighting in many areas and then BAM has a skylight as well), and raw/real crowd gave it a fantastic atmosphere. Whether you want to go out with family, friends, or dates it's practically great for everyone. Oh and there's three massive bars, a 270 degree bar at the front, a normal 180 bar, and a horseshoe bar outside. There's authentic Irish food, some English food on the menu, as well as more familiar American items if you're not the adventurous type. 

On Friday and Saturday nights on their outdoor patio and horseshoe bar they have live music.
