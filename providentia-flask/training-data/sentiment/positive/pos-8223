I discovered this place about 4 yrs ago. The food is always fresh and top quality.  It is always delivered fast and efficient.  my order is prepared exactly how I request it.  I have ordered the salads, chicken sandwich,  breakfast items and lunch specials, all which I highly recommend to everyone. The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. I would give six stars,  but Yelp only gives five as the highest.  :) I absolutely love this place!
