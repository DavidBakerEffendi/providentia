Absolutely delicious! Went and had the mussels w/ frites as an appetizer. I don't usually even like mussels, and I think I've fallen in love with these. I couldn't stop eating them--and the sauce, oh the sauces was amazing. Ask for some bread to soak up the sauce, you won't regret it. 

I had the ribeye as an entree, and if you like your ribeye with some flavor, char, and a slight caramelization, this is the place. It was tender, juicy, and fantastically scrumptious. 

Lastly, I had the hot chocolate cake. It was good, not great but good. I should have known better, I mean, its chocolate cake--nothing special. 

I will be coming back Arrogant Butcher. You've stolen my heart and wallet.
