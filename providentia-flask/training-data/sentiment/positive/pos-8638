Romados is the BEST place to go if your craving fries and Portugese chicken!  The special blend of spices that they marinate in the chicken are oh so delicious.  Can't get enough of it. Plus, the chicken is always so juicy and tender.  

Price cannot be beat for the amount of food that you get! 1/4 of a chicken, gigantic pile of fries and a tiny side salad is only around $10. They also usually give you a small bun to soak up the juices with.  All this food is put in a nice white takeaway container where you can attempt to find a seat (probably sits max 10 people) or you can just walk to a park close by to enjoy your meal.  Grab some napkins before you go though.

Here's a little insider's tip: Make sure you try one of their natas (Portugese style egg tarts) before you leave.  Absolutely amazing.  

Tip #2:  Call an hour's time ahead if you don't want to wait in line so that when you get there, you can stand in the faster line (there's two lines if you go during rush/dinner hour - one for drop in's and one for pick up's).

Clearly, I should never have left Montreal...
