What kind of bra always comes off for smart people?

Alge-bra!

I made that one up. Could you tell.

What to get: The Guava drinks.
Are you sure: Yes, Guava taste of it and you'll agree.

I've had the guava drink 3 times now, the first 2 times it was pretty awesome. Not like, blows me away and changes my life, but still really enjoyable. The third time, the girl had to look up in the manual how to make it, and didn't do a very good job. It came out pretty average. Nevertheless, the prices of this little tea shop aren't as high as you'd imagine, and that Guava drink is pretty damn imaginative. I'd definitely come here again.

I'm torn between a 4 and 5 star rating for it, but the fact that they use very healthy ingredients, and that the service has been extraordinarily friendly every time I've been here, edges it over to a 5.
