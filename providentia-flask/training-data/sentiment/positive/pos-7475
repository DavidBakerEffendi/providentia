This place was truly amazing! We stopped in for lunch during the week.  From the minute I walked in I was wooed!  The restaurant is tucked inside a shopping center next to Smith store, and although not the ideal place for such a great little authentic place, the inside of the place takes you to another world.  The food was just as amazing!  Let me say the BEST eggplant dish I have ever had! For appetizers we tried the couplets of stuff mushrooms and meatballs, both very delicious!  The meatballs were perfectly spiced!  My other half had the Veal Parmesan with red sauce ...the meat was tender but the wasn't the biggest fan of red sauce. We also had a side of Italian Gnocchi's in a pink sauce...delicious!  The place it's self has pictures of the chef's grandparents and childhood growing up in New York, great touch! Over this was a great experience.
