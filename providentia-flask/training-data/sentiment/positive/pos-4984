This is my new go to comfort spot! Bc it's is such a great fusion Japanese-Thai-Lao flavor dishes with an upscale edge making the dining experience feel more upscale compared to other asian restaurants that offer decent Thai and Lao flavors. Their Laos sausage combo with sticky rice and the spicy dipping sauce is simply just ADDICTING TO EAT! And when it's cold out I always use post mates or eats24 app to get their soups to stay warm indoors, I can't spell the name so I'm not gonna attempt to sound stupid but the soup is made fresh and noodles a hand made hand cut fresh noodles, you don't get FRESH HAND CUT NOODLE soup hardly anywhere  around Charlotte .... actually at the top of my head I can't think of a place that does, even noodle house don't do that. Men let me tell you something. If u ever get into that argument with your lady and can't decide where to eat? We ALL HAVE BEEN THERE there are so many you tube videos of this never ending argument! hibiscus is the answer to your problem, this asian fusion restaurant gives her the choices of her indecisiveness  trust me, she will find something she likes sushi, Thai, soups, great appetizers, great curry , and if she don't? Which I'm sure she will, Grab a custom drink at their bar. I do, just to drown out the noise of the old lady.
