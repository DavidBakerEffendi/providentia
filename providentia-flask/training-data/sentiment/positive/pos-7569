I love the cheese enchiladas and the guacamole and the warm, huge chips and the spicy salsa and the perfect mole sauce and the cold Coronas and the creamy flan and the nice servers and the kitschy decor.  MM's is inexpensive, yummy, and friendly.  It's connected to a bakery so you get the fragrance of all of that good stuff, as well.  Win!
