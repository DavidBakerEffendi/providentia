Having been to both their locations, their Peter street is definitely my favourite. The space here is much bigger, so you're not sitting elbow to elbow with your neighbour. 

They also have more food options from snacks/appetizers to full entrees. You also have the same extensive menu of beers to choose from. 

It's a great place to hangout with friends for a couple hours.
