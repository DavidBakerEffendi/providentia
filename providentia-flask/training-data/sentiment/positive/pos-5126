The food was delicious, the ambiance was ambient and the service was fabulous.
We were on a short time limit because we were heading the do the zip line, and our waitress was super accommodating about being short on time.
The Golden Nugget is a cool place, and we had some difficult finding the restaurant with GPS because nothing really says its in the nugget. So we went around the block a few times, but we were really just working up an appetite.
