This place is what all pubs should be like. Friendly and attentive staff. Great finger food and entr√©es. Extensive beer selection.  Slightly expensive prices, however once in a while I don't mind paying a lextra for excellent quality

 However, you are paying for the quality. The bill was very expensive, but I didn't care since it was comp'd by a client.  Definately a place to bring someone if you want to woo/impress/treat.
