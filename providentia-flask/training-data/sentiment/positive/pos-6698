I have been here over and over so I think it is about time I leave a review for Honey Salt. I have been here at different times of the day- brunch, dinner, Happy Hour, dessert time- it has always been consistently good. As a local, I am always on the look out for a place with a cute non-eccentric vibe that I can sit with some friends, order good food, great cocktails and just have great conversation. Over time I have sat in Honey Salt over a meal and discussed everything from love, travel and where life takes us with some huge laughs for good measure.

Never a dull meal here really and the service is great. New Modern American cuisine has been on the rise the past few years and I do have to say Las Vegas has a great share of restaurants that serve such fare. I have been to several New Modern American restaurants that I just wanted to say out loud "Try again. Next." So it is great to find one that serves wonderful updated versions of food we all grew up on. 

A few of my favorites over time have been the Turkey Meatballs, the flat breads, 
Mac and Cheese, S & P fries, scallops, Scottish salmon, Brussel sprouts and Biloxi fried chicken sandwich. The cocktails are great and do the job! 

Happy Hour is one of the best times to go for great prices on food and cocktails. My friends and I sometimes go here and share plates which is totally acceptable to do! Sometimes you just want a try and this is a great place to try different things. Over time our palates change and It is about time that restaurants updated the food we grew up on. See you next time, Honey Salt!
