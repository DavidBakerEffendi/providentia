Very fun and chic atmosphere.
I went here for my friend's 30th Bday and she had the private function room to celebrate. The servers were very kind and attentive. The atmosphere was different compared to the typical Italian restaurant scene. Their sangria was AMAZING, I would definitely recommend getting a pitcher. The food wasn't so heavy and you can totally taste the freshness in their ingredients. I can't wait to come back.
