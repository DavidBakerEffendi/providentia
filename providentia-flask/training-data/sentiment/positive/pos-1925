I didn't realize this location existed until a couple days ago! I've been going to the one on Trop and the 15 or the one on Blue Diamond thinking those were the closest. Little did I know there was one a couple miles from my house. In-N-Out, without a doubt, has the best fast food burger around. Seriously, a cheeseburger "animal style" can't be beat. Any burger and fast food chain that's good enough for Thomas Keller (http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/thomas-keller and http://fastfood.freedomblogging.com/2009/12/20/thomas-keller-in-n-out-inspires-mcdonalds-a-treat-as-a-kid/45993/) is good enough for me.
