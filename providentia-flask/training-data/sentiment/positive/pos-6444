I went here with a friend during Restaurant Week. We ate lunch in the stable and not the main house (or whatever they call it). I think the main house is for dinner only, but I could be making that up. We shared the burger and the fried fish. I was absolutely blown away. After basking in the golden glow of this exquisite beer-battered fish soaked in malt vinegar (because how else would you do it?!), I had some of the burger. Any burger with barbecue sauce and onion rings on it is sure to be good, but this one was phenomenal. They make the barbecue sauce in-house (as well as everything else, far as I can tell) and lay it on thick. Dessert was a blur of sugary bliss. Their turtle pie is amazing!

If you haven't been to Quivey's, I strongly encourage you to go because it's really a gem.
