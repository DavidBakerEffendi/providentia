Hands down best hot sauce in the world! Warning highly addictive! Never a bad meal and I've had about everything.. which is a LOT! Menu is extensive right down to the tea choices. A once a week meal for me, so many healthy guilt-free choices to eat. Service can be meh at times but I like the managers. Generally prices are fair... even when they charge for extra dressings and hot sauce it's still worth it!
