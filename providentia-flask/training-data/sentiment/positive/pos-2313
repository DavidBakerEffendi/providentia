This is another place that my son and I went with a friend and her son. We loved it because we got to sit down and eat lunch at one of the restaurants, then go in to do some grocery shopping. The atmosphere was busy but pleasant. My son had teriyaki chicken and steamed rice. I had one of the specials that had so much food which included kimchi, soup, and much more. The food was GREAT. Then as we walked around the grocery store to let the food digest, we saw a lot of foods that we liked that did not have in a long time since our family is in another state. I got mangos that were 99 cents a pound (got $4 worth), sushi, and a few other for items. My son got chop sticks for beginners and a packet of stainless steel chop sticks. The place is a great place to get out Asian food. We will coming back when our family comes out for Thanksgiving week.
