Located inside Chinatown Montreal. 

Small little shop that sells cute buns, pastries and bubble tea. They are probably most well known for their adorable cartoon buns. All their buns are fresh and hot right out of the oven when your order them. 

All the buns are adorable and the fillings are tasty.  
I love the hello kitty custard buns here! It's soft and delicious. Buns are relatively cheap around $2 each. I've also tried the melting custard bun. This was actually melting inside. But I prefer the regular custard one better. 

I bought a total of 9 bun at once one time and they stuffed them into the boxes. In one box they put 4 buns. All the buns ended squished and deformed looking. Be careful when you buy multiple buns. You should ask them to bag then separately instead. That might be better than boxing them. 

Overall, decent place. Nice presentation of buns. 

There is limited seating. The shop has only a few chairs. Can probably sit up to 5 people.
