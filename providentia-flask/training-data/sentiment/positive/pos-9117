Wow!  What a pleasant surprise!

As a KCBS certified BBQ judge, I am very picky about my BBQ.  Campfire Bistro has it figured out.  This place is a must.  Just opened @ Tom Thumb's gas station @ 9393 E. Bell Road in Scottsdale.  Haven't even had their grand opening yet (weekend of 4/28-4/29).  Got the 2 meat platter of with pork and brisket.  Both were perfectly tender and a nice punch of smoke flavor.  For the side I had the shoestring fries.  Warning: They are highly addictive.  They have a counter with a wide variety of sauces.  I didn't put any on the meat because when the meat is that good, sauce can only ruin it in my mind.  However, I did use them to dip the fries in and they really had some interesting unique flavors.  Try the Low Country, the Texas, and regular sauces.
