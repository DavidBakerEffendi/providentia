I'll be honest, when I opened my front door and saw their menu laying on the ground I figured this was just another run of the mill pizza joint that would only cater to my late night drunk escapades when my taste buds have no sense of right or wrong.

To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. I mean you can't have high expectations for a place named Express Pizza. Another confession, I"ve never tried the pizza (next on my list of things). 

So here's how much I like this place...I tried one of their lunch specials on a Saturday, seven days later I've eaten them two additional times. That's how friggin good it was. 

This place has a variety of lunch specials available 7 days a week. Major points their for not limiting their deals to midweek. First time up I tried the Lasagna lunch special after asking the lady taking my order if that was a good choice. She advised me that I "wouldn't be disappointed." I wasn't. The sauce was terrific, pasta cooked perfect, just the right amount of cheese. And for $6.50 it included a canned soda and piece of garlic bread (which was great for dipping). Next time out I ordered the Gyro (since my wife said it was amazeballs when she ordered it for lunch). Outstanding. PIta was so fresh, meat was filled with flavor. Tuh-zee-kee sauce, because I have no friggin clue how to spell that mess of a word, was awesome! I'm not a french fry guy, but theirs were seasoned perfectly and I ate a load of those. Third time up I ordered the Lasagna for dinner which included a salad. 

Had I ordered the food when I was drunk I probably would have wrote Mr. Michelin himself and requested he consider this place. Instead, I'll just call it an outstanding hole in the wall delivery joint located inside the Bounty Hunter bar. Two giant thumbs up.
