Happy Dog is a real game changer for the "bar dog".... it's the standard! Happy Dog is absolutely my favorite bar in Cleveland and they serve up the best hot dogs ever!  

Now I have to say...I'm more of a burger and fries person. I had a lot of bad hot dogs experiences so before Happy Dog, if I had to choose between burger or dog, I was always going with the burger. Not. Any. More. Happy Dog has shown me that not all hot dogs are created equal and I can be the master of that creation.

I love that you can go into the bar and design your dog with unlimited toppings for FREE! How awesome is that? They even have a half-off happy hour. 

My favorite creation so far with the dog topped with beans cheddar cheese, fried egg, onions, and pickles. I also get the tots with 5 different dipping sauces (sorry I can't remember the names). 

You have to try it. It's always a great time!
