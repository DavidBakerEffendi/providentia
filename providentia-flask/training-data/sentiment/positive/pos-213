Went here for the first time on Valentine's Day and we were very impressed.

My husband and I went to Vietnam for our honeymoon, so we are constantly on the lookout for the best Vietnamese places.

There was a tiny wait when we got there, but it was to be expected on Valentine's Day. The staff was very kind and got us seated as quickly as they could. And everyone is right, they do not let your water Get Low ever.

We ordered an appetizer that I haven't been able to find since our trip to Vietnam. It is a pork dish where you assemble spring rolls yourself and top it with peanut sauce. It is delicious. I felt it was a bit pricey at $15, but so worth it.

My husband ordered pho and I had Curry. The pho was the obvious winner. Large portion for the price. 

Not Vietnamese prices unfortunately, haha. Everything was very good. Our new Vietnamese staple.
