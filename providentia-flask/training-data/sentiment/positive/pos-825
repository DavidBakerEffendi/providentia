I loved every single moment! There was nothing I would change absolutely nothing. If you want a delightful meal and peaceful dining experience. Grab a bottle of wine and go!!! There is nothing on the menu I wouldn't suggest or order myself but I will say you have lost your mind if you don't order the muscles in red sauce. Even if you don't like muscles, order them and you might find yourself a new food to crave!
