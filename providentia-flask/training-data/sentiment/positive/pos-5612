The customer service here is awesome! They were very patient with me while I was deciding what to order... Which seems to be a big problem with me :) 

The mango smoothie here is to die for! I think they use a combination of real mangos and the mango flavouring. The ratio they use is amazing since the real mango flavour is there and its not overwhelmed with sweetness.

The mini koo koo chicken bites are the best thing I ever had in Canada. The flavour reminds me of Taiwan's night markets but much cleaner and obviously more expensive since it's not in Asia. 

The chicken steak is almost identical to the ones in Taiwan's night markets too. 

Tl;Dr: customer service , check. Mango smoothie is awesome! Chicken steak and bites taste like authentic Taiwanese night market food!
