We love wood fired pizza restaurants and this one was quaint.  The owner and staff were great. We were asking the owner a ton of questions about the place, food, etc and he was very generous with his time. The pizzas were really good, sausage good, cheese was yummy. The bread, also made from the pizza dough was nice and crusty with a chewy center. The caprese salad was grape tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and a nice surprise, burrata. Very fresh and good.  He grows his own herbs too.  This is a must try!
