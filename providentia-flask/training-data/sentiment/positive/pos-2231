Just came here for the first time since I was in the neighborhood and I'm so glad I did! I was helped by the owner, Lenny, himself! What a nice and friendly guy! He was so helpful. I didn't know what to get so he suggested the classic burger that came with onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes and a sauce of your choice. The Lenny's sauce is the bees knees! Definitely get that to dip your fries in. The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were hot and crispy. A huge portion for just over $8! Definitely recommend this place to all burger lovers.
