This restaurant is nestled in a little shopping center, but don't let the locale deceive you. The food here is outstanding - I got a musashi bento box (probably should have went lighter on the soup and salad I had beforehand) with some sort of citrusy wine. Everything was excellent - it looks to be a family-owned business as well, and it shows with the excellent and courteous service (of course, the place is usually busy, so don't come here expecting fast food, but our order arrived within reasonable time). Do check this place out!
