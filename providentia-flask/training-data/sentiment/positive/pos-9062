If I could shop here all the time, I would. I love everything from the hot and cold side dishes, fresh seafood, noodle/rice/dumpling selection, snacks, marinated meats to the kitchen gadgets at the back. 

The food court is really delicious as well. I forgot the names of the vendors but I have had the pleasure to enjoy hot tofu soup, spicy tuna rolls, kalbi and tons of delicious side dishes. The food court serves the food in dishes as if you were dining in at a restaurant so don't expect your typical styrofoam and plastic utensils that you would get in most US food courts. They have a counter all the way inside next to the boba tea shop to drop off your used dishes and utensils.
