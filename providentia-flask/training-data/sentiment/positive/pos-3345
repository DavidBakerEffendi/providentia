Great food fast service..that's Chicago style at tasty dogs that what I got great place to eat...and if you where anything Chicago you get a discount
very nice faces when you walk in. Many people miss that Chicago feel and great taste. Pictures on the wall represent the city and the culture well. If you ever in Vegas you have to stop by and grab a dog and dress it the way you want.
