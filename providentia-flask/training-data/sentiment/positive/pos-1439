My boyfriend and I went here for the first time last night and enjoyed two great drinks and pizzas. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have an extremely allergy-friendly menu and our server (Caroline) was super patient in explaining all the ingredients. There were a few things I wasn't sure about because of my long list of allergies and she happily brought out the book from the back with the full list so I could check. Also, we found it quite impressive that she was handling the register, running food, making drinks at the bar, and serving tables... wow!

There was a little miscommunication about my order, but Caroline was quick to make it right. We're excited to come back again, this is probably the best gluten-free vegan pizza I've had in the valley!
