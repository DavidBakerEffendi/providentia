Overall: Impressive first experience with Korean food.

Food: The recommended dishes were all well marinated and bursting with salty, sweet, and umami flavors. We ordered the Mandu dumplings, Combo (Kalbi, Meat Jun, and Chicken Teriyaki), and Spicy Squid. The complimentary appetizers were polarizing; I did not care for the Kim chee or radishes.

Atmosphere: Very friendly atmosphere. The waitress was eager to help with menu suggestions and describing each dish as it came out. The owner would also stop by frequently to chat, check on how we were doing, and to make sure we knew how to eat each dish because we were new. It was clear that the owner got a lot of enjoyment out of feeding his customers; he even brought us complimentary iced tea and hot tea to make sure we had the full experience and helped us cut up our meat because my boyfriend's wrist was in a cast. Service couldn't have been better.
