Not sure if it was the long hours shopping at IKEA.. but we decided to stop here for dinner. My wife and I both enjoyed our plates. Don't recall what they are called to be exact.. but eggplant dish was on point. It wasn't a mushy or hard.. perfectly cooked and seasoned/sauced.
Only thing is, i wish it was tad bit spicier.. but I'll take it.

The wait staff was nice and friendly. We got white rice and wanted brown and they changed it without any argument. 

The restaurant decor was interesting. None of Thai restaurant I had was like that. Not saying if it's better or worse but different environment.
