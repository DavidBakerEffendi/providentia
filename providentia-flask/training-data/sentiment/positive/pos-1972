Party of 12 coming here for the first time. Very lucky to have seats available. Paper Menu is very self explanatory to order your meal. Simple asian theme restaurant with every staff greeting you. The ramein is cook on a timer after all the topping, it is very flavorful. It is a nice steady but fast past, after seeing the 2 gentlemen get seated next to me, i wouldn't mind recommending this place if you're on the go. The 2 guys sat, ordered their meal, paid and left less than 15 minutes. The macaroons are THICK and not tiny like most places. The music is modern and a mixed genre.
I definitely would want all my friends and family to dine in this establishment. If I had to be picky, the only complaint I have is to add mini tables and seats as this place is only a bar style dinning, just so they could accommodate more customers. Overall excellent from food to service.
