This has to be the best Pizza & Fries ever!  They are right across the street from where I work so it's always pretty easy to order from them to either deliver to work or order ahead of time to take home some dinner. They have a good variety of what they carry, but I am one of those who always gets the same thing over and over again!  It is super greasy though! I, am not one to complain.
