Went here on a whim for breakfast and it was amazing! Fried Eggs sandwich with cheese on pretzel bread was phenomenal! Coffee is decently strong too. It was so good I went back the very next day with a friend and had the salmon and cucumber sandwich. 

If you have a little extra time in your morning visit your local downtown pittsburgh coffee shop its worth the adventure! My only quip is that it probably took around 10 minutes for them to make my sandwich when nobody was in the shop. Kind of dissapointing considering they have like 3 or 4 people in the kitchen and all i wanted was eggs. 

I will be returning soon to try their lunch menu. Im sure I wont be disappointed.
