Ok, this is an update to my original review.

Went there for Mother's day dinner.  Wanted to book their brunch, however my illustrious Wife decided to run the Sporting Life 10k that day..

I'll cut to the chase.  Dinner was outstanding!

I had the 16oz porterhouse.  Cooked to a perfect medium-rare (both the tenderloin and striploin part of the porterhouse - which is a feat unto itself and shows attention to detail).  Honestly, I've been to high-end steak places all over Canada and the US, and this ranked up there with the best of them.  It was served with amazing crispy fingerling potatoes.  I want to jump head first into a Mr. Turtle pool filled with those potatoes. 

My wife had the beef short rib, which is always outstanding.  Once again, they treated my little guy to a mini grilled cheese to keep him occupied (a really nice touch).  The food came out at a perfect pace.

One thing I do want to mention is the service.  Our Server (Sarah) was the perfect balance between attentive (but not too attentive), and friendly.  Some of the best service I've had in a long time.

You know, I'm reading all I wrote above, and it sounds OVERLY positive.  But in all honesty, there isn't anything I can fault them for.  I will say that it's not the most inexpensive place around, but it's WELL worth it.  Certainly the best place in the area to eat, and one of the best in the GTA.
