A great local neighborhood spot with a nice atmosphere. Coffee, food, beer, and wine; they got you any time of day. Eat on the patio if the weather is nice; it is enclosed and has a misting system. Inside is small with a coffee bar and tables for 2 and 4 people.Delicious menu with a daily special that is always outstanding. Whoever chooses the music has great taste.
