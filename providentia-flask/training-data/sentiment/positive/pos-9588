"Ho!, Bread and Butter!?!?"

I point to Rudy as I step inside..."Yup!" He says....You may have reconoticed Rudy at Bread and Butter before, also a Bouchon Alumni as well as a also a local boy from Oahu as well. He was the man behind the Malassadas @Bread and Butter, and now he's off on his own adventure with the rest of his ohana.

Aside from Malassadas made to orderS($1.25 each, or 6/$7...sugar, Chantilly, Guava, or Chocolate available), 808 Island Craves, you can also pick up other local sweets-
Cocoa Puffs, Kona Coffee Mac Nut, Guava, and Dobash Cakes, poi mochi and also Poke made to order and cheaper than Poke Express, Poi, Lomi Salmon, Taegu, and other local snacks.

Rudy also has sweet BOB MARLEY beverages which aren't even on the market !?!?
One Drop-Iced Coffee
Mellow Mood-OPPOSITE of an energy drink
and Mellow Mood flavored tea...

We were on a time crunch before church, so we got some spicy ahi poke and half a dozen malassadas which was ONOLICIOUS, and gone in no time!

Future plans include plate lunches, manapua, and sprucing up the breakfast and dessert menu at Islander's Grill. Congrats to Rudy and the rest of the 808 Ohana!
We will most definitely be back!...ALOHA!!!
