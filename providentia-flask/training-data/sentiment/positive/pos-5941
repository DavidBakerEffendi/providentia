This was a great hotel experience. In the future, I won't be back here during a main event (I was here during the Mayweather / Pacquiao fight) but other than that it was awesome. I love the toiletries and the decor of this place. This is one of the only 3 hotels I am willing to stay at in Vegas !  I have no complaints.!
