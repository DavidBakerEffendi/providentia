Congratulations on the best wine list award. We sat at the bar, and he (shame on me, writing this review 1 month after and forgot his name... Gabriel?) knows his stuff. He has passion, and it's contagious. Good food, even better wine and great service. What a pleasant experience. It was not our first time, and definitely not the last. This kind of local place can be proud of their establishment, and the well deserved awards they gain. They will see us again, and again.
