I visited Cibo today for lunch with a coworker. We ordered the gnocchi and the fig/arugula/prosciutto pizza to share. Both were off the charts delicious. Gnocchi is one of those things that I'm afraid to order b/c when it is good....it's great but when it's bad....ick. Well, this was good...no, great. It is pan seared so you don't get any of the gloopiness that gnocchi can sometimes have. Served with garlic, spinach and cherry tomatoes, it was fresh and light and delicious.  The pizza was also very good with the crust done perfectly. No floppy, half done crust here!

Our server was knowledgable and attentive. All in all, we had a great meal. I will definitely be back.
