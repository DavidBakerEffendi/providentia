I'm seven months away from the magical world of breakfast tacos and salsa on every corner (i.e. Austin) and taking my annualish pilgrimage to Las Vegas to party it up with my family when I have a serious craving for some southern style noms. With my favorite Mexican restaurant closed and only mediocre experiences at others in the area, I turned to Yelp to see what was new. 

Juan's was sort of on the way to the Orleans Arena, so I talked Mom into stopping there for lunch on the way to the Wranglers game. We parked right out front and headed in. Mom immediately noticed a giant jar of peppermints--a sure sign of a restaurant that cares about its patrons. We were seated promptly in a booth (always my favorite) and delivered chips, salsa and bean dip. YUM. Shortly after, complimentary vegetable soup with a tomato base. TWO YUMS. 

As far as options go, there's something for everyone. Several vegetarian dishes were offered. Mom picked the tamale and I ordered the enchiladas, which came with your standard delicious rice and refried beans. It all seemed pretty healthy, my enchiladas stuffed with zucchini, broccoli and bell peppers--unusual fillings, but I liked the mix. 

Everything was clean, including the bathrooms, and large screen TVs were scattered throughout the dining area featuring sporting events. The manager (owner?) stopped by our table for a chat and gave us the history of the restaurant and the building (formerly a BBQ place--my father would be crushed.) 

Service? Super important to me, and spot on. All in all, an excellent experience. Can't wait to go back!!

Edit: totally forgot about the onion/green pepper relish. SO GOOD. I don't usually like onions, but I ate as many as I could stuff in my mouth. They also appear to have wifi for guests, but I don't know how to get the password.
