Excellent place for a simple and casual meal. The place is take-out style but has a few tables to sit at. Mexican beverages and beers are available. Very clean and spacious. While we were there, we had a lovely conversation with Karen, who works at/owns the place. We talked about Latin American travels, languages, foods etc. She was so warm and friendly and walked us through the menu. We had 7 tacos in total along with their house made tamarind juice. Flavours of the meat were fantastic. Only con is the tacos are pretty small for its price ($5 for 1; $12 for 3) but they do deliver.
