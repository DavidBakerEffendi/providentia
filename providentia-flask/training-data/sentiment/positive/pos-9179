Not sure why the mediocre reviews. First time here, large group, and we loved it. Gotta love the western decor and ambiance. The staff was AWESOME, especially the young woman who operated the bull for us, KJ our server extraordinaire and the manager who kept checking in on us. The bull ride was a ton of fun. The outdoor patio was shaded and comfortable and overlooked the water fountain in the plaza. I was slightly disappointed that the breakfast/egg menu didn't go past 11 am on a Sunday, but our lunch food was all really good. Alcoholic beverages were huge and delicious and the bread basked before lunch, go carefully because you can really get filled up. We don't live nearby so this was a special drive for us to try it and we are all super excited to go back soon.
