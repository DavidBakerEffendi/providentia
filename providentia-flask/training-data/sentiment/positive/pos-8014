Bluebird Kitchen is an upscale cafe serving breakfast, lunch, and an assortment of desserts. On this specific visit I ordered the Local Fried Eggs on a homemade pretzel bun. I ate the entire thing without putting the breakfast sandwich down. I think that speaks for itself - it was delicious! 

Did you know they offer half priced yesterday pastries? It's a first come first served basis with those pastries. So, go see if you can score a sweet deal!
