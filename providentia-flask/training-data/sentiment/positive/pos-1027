The employees were excellent.  You are greeted and felt welcomed right away.  They are very attentive and helpful.  This was our first visit and I received many kudos for ordering and polishing off the dragon dog.  My husband ordered the carne asada dog and he loved it!

The hot dogs were very good.  I would like to point out that I do not like hot dogs, especially cheap hot dogs.  These hot dogs were very good and I would definitely go back.  The dogs served here are truly good quality.

My husband and I walked out of there spending less that 20 dollars.  That is ordering two dogs, a large order of fries and two small drinks.
