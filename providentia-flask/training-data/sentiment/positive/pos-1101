We always love coming to Luna's! This is my wife's favorite place when we go out. I am always getting new people try Luna's and everyone always raves about it. When you ask someone who is not accustomed to raw vegan food you get some odd looks; once they taste it nothing but smiles! It so nice to feel good about what you are eating and drinking.
