Ru San's gets 5 stars for 3 outstanding reasons in the world of sushi restaurants:

1. AFFORDABLE! You can order a ton of food and still not go broke. Sushi as cheap as $1 and $2!

2. QUALITY!  I've been here countless times and  I've never ever had a bad meal. Everything is top notch and high quality. Sushi bar reinforces this: you see all the sushi chefs preparing rolls in plain sight.

3. VEGETARIAN SUSHI!!! Yep, that's right. Ru San's has a huge menu, but my favorite part is the big vegetarian section. Big list to choose from, anything from fried cream cheese maki rolls to tamago egg maki rolls to kimchi cabbage maki rolls. And basically most vegetables you can think of, all prepared in a perfect little roll... heaven! This is such a relief from most sushi restaurants who have ONE vegetarian sushi option (which is usually way overpriced). Most of the veg options are between $2 and $3... awesome! 

I really love the Eggplant Sesame Yaki. I usually order this as an appetizer and reserve the leftover sauce as a dip for some of my maki rolls. This dish has cubes of eggplant, seared perfectly, tender inside, light crisp outside. The wow factor here though is the sauce, it's a thick, peanut butter like sauce, tart and sweet and nutty, with sesame seeds.  You've gotta try this! 

If you have room for dessert, make sure you order some Tempura Ice Cream. This is basically a block of vanilla ice cream, covered in sweet tempura batter and deep fried. Then drizzled with a strawberry (and sometimes chocolate ) sauce. I'm not sure how they keep the ice cream from totally melting, but this dessert will make your day... heck, it'll make your week. Hands down my favorite dessert of all time.

Cocktails? Order the Lady Killer... kiwi juice and sake. mmm!

Kudos for being open a little later than most places.
