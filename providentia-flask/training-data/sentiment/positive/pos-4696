This is my new favorite brunch place and I am telling anyone and everyone who will listen! This exquisitely decorated and bright space is exceptionally inviting and oozes class without being pretentious. The large vaulted skylights give a certain 'je ne sais quoi' to the space and makes one feel good about the world. The servers are attentive and professional, and I appreciate the use of proper cloth napkins, good solid cutlery, quality glasses and dishes, and an elegant menu display.

I found the food to be reasonably priced for the quality and portion size, as well as keeping in mind the atmosphere of Royale. Two of us had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict; it came with 2 eggs, a generous amount of smoked salmon, fresh crusty bread as the base, a lovely mild hollandaise sauce and capers, sides were house made pan fries and salad. For $16, I though that was a pretty good deal, in fact nothing on the brunch menu was over $16. The latte I had was also delicious!

All in all, I was very impressed! For roughly $20-$25 per person for brunch and a coffee, including tax and tip, I am happy to pay that given this is a higher class restaurant that has done it right! Can't say that about many "high class wanna-be" places in this city. 

I will be back and I highly recommend you spend some time in this beautiful space; enjoy the ambiance while catching up with friends or family, or just sit and soak it all up  while savoring a lovely cup of coffee waiting for your meal.
