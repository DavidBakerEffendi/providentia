We really went all out to try this place. We got the assorted appetizers, two entree's, and bread. Every single thing was even more delicious then the next. Everything had a very unique flavor. 

Usually Indian food leaves me feeling heavy, and full. This place I left full and satisfied, but it didn't have a heavy feel to it. Very light, and delicious. 

The sauces were great, the appetizers were to die for, the rice was well cooked, and everything was so full of flavor that I often of dreams of the delicious food. I can't wait to go back over and over and over again! Some of the best Indian food I've ever had!
