I really enjoyed Chada Street and was excited when my friend wanted to try Chada for dinner the other week.

We were greeted and seated moments after walking in the restaurant. The ambiance reminds me of Chada Street - quaint, inviting, and dimly lit. Quite the intimate setting.

My friend that I went with is a very proud certified Som so I let him order the bottle of wine, a Viognier. I've never tried this white wine before but it tasted like what would be if Pinot Grigio and Riesling had a child. Very crisp and refreshing, pairing nicely with the Thai dishes we ordered.

APPS:
- Peak Kai Tod (Spicy fried chicken wings)
Delicious large wings (5 pieces) drenched in a zesty spicy brown sauce. My friend wasn't impressed but I really enjoyed! I am an abnormally large fan of chicken wings though...
- Shrimp Satay (Charbroiled Shrimp Skewers)
There were 3 skewers total and the shrimp seasoning was just a tad salty. I love sodium so I didn't mind. Came with a peanut dipping sauce and a small side of cucumber salad

ENTREES:
- Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle stir fried with garlic, basil, and spices)
I added Rib Eye Steak as my protein and asked for medium spice. The portion was huge and this noodle dish was SO tasty! The heat was just right and I inhaled the whole plate
- Duck Panang
Crispy duck in Panang curry. The curry tasted on point and the duck was cooked to perfection!

I wish I remembered our server's name. He was soft spoken and a little quirky. We enjoyed his company... He was very polite and filled our wine glasses and waters frequently.

The only con was that the food took a while to come out. Granted we went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was full. Both the apps and main entrees took longer than the typical restaurant but we luckily had wine to enjoy while we waited.

The food was very delicious and I look forward to coming back!!
