The people, the food, the everything is amazing!! My boyfriend and I will be back always. A small hidden gem, worth going out of the way for. So much food, for amazing prices. The staff is super friendly and a free gift on your birthday

So I got home and went to eat my tacos... I don't eat much especially since I'm trying to lose weight, but... ya know tacos. The mini tacos Ben, the fantastic owner, suggested were PERFECT for me. The minimum order is three and you can mix and match (I did chicken, AL pastor, and Carne asada,  so damn good) and they're perfect I got the rice and beans. The beans don't look like much but holy heck they were good and we'll seasoned. I'm for sure happy with them. Not overly greasy like Roberto's or Don Tortaco. Super fresh. (So people who complain they are closed Sunday and Monday thays because the ingredients are hand chosen and fresh) I'm not displeased at all. The green sauce is the perfect amount of spicy the red is definitely for the more adventurous spicy lovers, but my boyfriend loves it. All 5s from the 2 of us
