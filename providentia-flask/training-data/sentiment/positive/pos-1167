Very good! Thin crust brick oven pizza. We were told the "Italian Stallion" is their best seller and you can see why. Meaty but not overwhelming, sausage is good. The Margheurita is also good. Lots of chewy mozzarella and very tasty sauce. Coke comes in a 500 ml glass bottle. The ingredients say sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. Would definitely go back for more!
