Why did I wait so long? I can't look back but now the future seems just a bit brighter.

It was beautiful evening. Spring at its best. I was driving down Willy St and I heard the Siren's call. BBQ take out was in order. I called a friend who eats little meat. She immediately jumped at the idea of trying the chicken. I, of course, was headed for the ribs. The Muslim boyfriend was elsewhere so pork was calling my name.
 
I had the 3 rib dinner with greens and baked beans. My friend had the half chicken with greens and vinegar slaw. The only disappointing item were the greens. Neither of us liked them and both of us usually love them. That said, the rest of the meal was spectacular. My ribs were perfectly cooked, no fat to be seen, tender and oh so flavorful. The chicken was moist and seasoned well. The skin was a beautiful mahogany color and the meat fell off the bone. The baked beans and slaw complemented the meats. Couldn't have been better.

To top it off, we dined al fresco on my little condo porch. Perfect!

It appears that this establishment is moving but I don't know where it is going. If you do, send me a message. I can only hope they stay in the neighborhood.
