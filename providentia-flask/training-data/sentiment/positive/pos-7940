Awesome... just like Rock Hill. My staple meal is the French Dip and it was amazing as always. This location is set back behind the salon with lots of parking which is nice. It's new and big, it can fit the crowd which is really great. They absolutely needed this location, it came at the perfect time! The bar space is great, I can't wait to spend a few happy hours there. I'm happy to see that there have a nice outdoors area that's enclosed plus an open outdoor area. This spot is perfectly placed. 

I must say it was nice to see some familiar faces from Rock Hill, the owner/chef was there as well as our very first waiter we had from Rock Hill. I'm sure they were helping run everything as smooth as possible. We will definitely be back here to try the new additions to the menu. I posted some pics of the menu so everyone can see!
