Had a great night here. Ate at the bar because the place was full on a Friday night at 2130. We were offered a table soon after arriving but we were getting great service at the bar so stayed. 

Great food. Husband had buffalo tartar. I had the mushroom bolognese sauce with spaghetti. Shared a cob of corn and sticky toffee pudding. 

Good drinks, friendly and quick service. Had a great time.
