Hands down the best sushi in phoenix. Smaller spot but the wait isn't usually too long. First timers must get the "oh my god" roll. Not only for the taste but the experience. The only negative thing I can say is the bathroom is like something out of a horror film. So pee before you leave the house or hold it till the next bar.
