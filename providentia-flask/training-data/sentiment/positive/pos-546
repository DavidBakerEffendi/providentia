I've visited 87 West a few times over the years and recently returned for a light lunch with my family. We were shopping and catching a movie at Crocker Park so this was a convenient option for us. The location is central to the shopping center, located in the middle of the grassy area near the splash pad and Dick's Sporting Goods. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. The entire restaurant is surrounded by windows so on a nice day it's sunny and airy. There is also an outdoor patio for those that do want to dine in the fresh air. Seating includes a variety of tables and comfortable seating areas with booths and chairs. 

A few of us enjoyed wine while the rest opted for beer. I chose a glass of white wine from a Washington winery that was really good. My mom and sister-in-law went with the seasonal red and they both enjoyed it. I like that they offer beer for those that prefer beer to wine.

We shared the Cheese & Salumi Plate, Bruschetta, and Baked Brie. All three were delicious and perfect for sharing. The Cheese & Salumi plate had a nice amount of cheese and meat on the board with some jam and nuts for variety. Everything on the board was delicious. The Baked Brie was good, but it would have been even better if the fig preserve had been over the entire piece of bread instead of just on one corner. The Bruschetta was a twist on the traditional bruschetta, but was very good. There was plenty of the topping to be spread on the toasted bread that was covered in balsamic. My brother enjoyed his Crispy Chicken Sliders and the tots on the side were really good.

There was only one server the day we visited, but she didn't miss a thing. We were well taken care of and didn't have a long wait for food.
