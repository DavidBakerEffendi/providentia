I am stuck in Independence, OH Monday through Friday because of work. I eat at Aladdin's out of necessity and it is one of the only places that is not a complete corporate joint. I was driving to the West Side Market the other day and decided to get off by Metro Health and stop at Maha's Cafe instead. It was just as good as the stand at the market and is a perfectly spiced falafel. I prefer Cafe Falafel over by Fairview Hospital for meat platters. Falafel Cafe by Case Western is just not good.
