Great spot, great people watching and AMAZING for vegans. 

This place is nestled right in the centre of the hustle & bustle of Lebo. An upscale neighbourhood that has a lot of walkable districts and the one Piccadilly is located in, in particular actually has TWO competitors across the street. 

What's the best part? Well, there are usually at least 2 vegan options for soft serve AND there are a tonne of fresh fruit toppings...while I wish that there were more vegan toppings this actually helps keep the calorie count down. 

Love that it's all organic and the staff is supper friendly. The only thing I can complain about is that the self serve/buffet topping area is made super messy by young kids and I wish that there wasn't cross contamination due to that. When the dairy mixes in with the fruit etc...it's kind of annoying/rude.

But all in all, as a vegan option for PGH, I love it.
