I've been on the hunt for a closer decent coffee shop. I've lived in the area for years and finally decided to give it a try- wish we would have come years ago!!! Delicious food- delicious coffee (cartel by far is he best ever!) and I will be visiting frequently. Super cute interior... Awesome menu for allergy sensitive customers!! My only complaint is that I wish they were open earlier so I could stop on my way to work and later so I could visit after :)
