By far my favourite place to have Wonton Noodles! I've tried them all in Markham, and some are really good, but here, they got it all together. It's literally just a tiny place inside the Market Village. Might not even notice it walking by since it's so beaten down looking, but it's actually very spacious inside! You can easily park in the back alley of the plaza since there's an exit right next to the restaurant.

The wontons are packed full of shrimp and still has that "Bouncy" texture that chinese people really love in their wontons/ shrimp balls. The noodles are a great chewy texture too and not all stuck together from being pre-cooked or anything. Honestly, most of us had to get a second bowl. I love that they let you choose 3 toppings in a bowl so you can try a bit of everything with your noodles. 

This is the place to go everytime you got a craving for wonton noodles! Great price, great food!! be sure you try the chilli oil and the red vinegar with the wontons. It really makes the dish taste all the better!

Arh!! Now I want wonton noodles. Really shouldn't Yelp if you're hungry. haha!
