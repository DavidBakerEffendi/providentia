We came here late night, right before closing.  The owner was super friendly and welcomed us to stay and eat past closing.

The service was excellent, and the food was good.
I really liked how the side dishes were large in portion.
The food also tasted quite fresh and good, even though their Ja Jang Myun could have been a bit more flavourful.

We didn't have the time to try the Shabu Shabu, but we will try and come back next time to try it out :)
