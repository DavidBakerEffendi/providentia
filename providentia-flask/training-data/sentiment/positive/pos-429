This is the best Mexican food truck in the Charlotte area I have eaten at. And they have a grade-A sanitation score! Food is always good, I've eaten here over a dozen times and never been let down!
Most employees here do not speak much or any English, but the menu is written in English on the side of the truck and they understand well.
