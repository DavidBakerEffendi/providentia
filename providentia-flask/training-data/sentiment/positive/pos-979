We have been driving by this place since it opened and finally decided to stop in for some appetizers and a cocktail.  When we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised with the interior.  It was well decorated and what we would consider a modern eatery.  Our server, Brett, suggested a bourbon cocktail for me and my wife had a glass of wine.  Both were amazing.  We then ordered the crab cake and the beet and goat cheese salad.  The kitchen gets kudos because when they deliver the salad, they split it in two for us and the presentation was world class and it tasted just as good as it looks.   The crab cake was delicious too but we wish it would have been a little thicker with more lump crab in it.  Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be back to try the entrees.  The ambiance and vibe was fun as well.  If you haven't been here yet, give it a try!
