The fountains are my very favorite thing in Vegas! During peak hours they do a show every 15 minutes. When I go I usually stick around for 2 or 3 shows because why not?! The best place to park to see them is in the Bellagio self park lot. When you walk through the Bellagio exit through the doors by Herm√®s and just follow the sidewalk to the left outside. Literally the best thing to see in Vegas and it's FREE!
