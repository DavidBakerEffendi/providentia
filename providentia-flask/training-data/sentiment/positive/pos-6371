The "downtown" location of The Pie Commission is open and it is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. There are a few pot-pie places in the city right now but TPC is the best. 

Honestly - this place is a gem. The frozen/or freshly made pies are a must have in your freezer. 45 minutes and you've got a piping hot and delicious meal (impress your guests!). The baked to order ones in the shop are delicious. The ingredient combinations are always exciting and the specials keep me coming back regularly. The crust is unbeatable. 

Yesterday I picked up (average pot pie price is $8): 

Beef rib (braised beef, veal stock, mushroom, sweet potato)
Sweet potato malasa (chickpeas, kale, onion, tomato)
Butter chicken
Meatball (this one tastes like an Italian restaurant baked inside a pie crust)

The big difference between this TPC and the original on the Queensway is that this new spot has indoor seating and a liquor license. So now you can dine in and get drunk on pie-crust and Great Lakes Brewery beer (looks like that is currently the only option).

PS

The sausage rolls ($4.50) make an excellent appetizer to share (try it with the banana ketchup). 

Currently closed Sunday but open the rest of the week from 11-8pm.
