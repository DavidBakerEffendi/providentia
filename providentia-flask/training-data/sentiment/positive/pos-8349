We decided to go to Grotto again for dinner prior to another show at the Smith Center. This time it gets five stars. We arrived about 20 minutes late because of parking and traffic. We were sat quickly and told our server we were running behind. She was super nice took out full order and promised to help us make our show. Thirty minutes later we were on our way to the show. We had the lasagne which was very good. We have another show to see in about a month and we will definitely choose Grotto again.
