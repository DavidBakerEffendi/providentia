A wonderful restaurant in every sense possible! The chef uses only fresh produce. The home made pasta is simply delicious. The salmon and chicken dishes are so flavoursome. They have just opened so will be adding to the menu soon but don't miss out on their daily special. Very reasonably priced especially for the quality. 
This will become a regular destination...and the blueberry or coffee beer is a must!v You
