Came in here between running errands for a quick bite to eat....ended up getting the steak and eggs. My steak was cooked perfectly as well as my eggs. The home potatoes are seasoned with some kind of special season they have....awesome.  

Bathrooms were super clean.

My server was Kat...she was excellent!!
