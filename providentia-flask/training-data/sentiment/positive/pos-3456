I've always heard great things & it did not disappoint! :) The prices are insanely reasonable for the amount of food you get. Banchans differ everyday & they're quite generous. The combo is the mister's go-to meal. For around $12, you get so much food for the combo. I opted for the Hot Rock Bibimbap. OHMYGOODNESS! Love at first bite. And it was around $10. We also ordered Mandu because we couldn't resist. A lady was making them a few tables away so I definitely wanted to try home-made Mandu.

All in all, this is such a great spot to eat. Definitely felt like we were back home in Oahu. With its name, Island Style, you'll most definitely notice the warm, Aloha spirit from the workers and the delicious food they serve. ONO!
