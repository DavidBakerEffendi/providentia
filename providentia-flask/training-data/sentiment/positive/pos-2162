New fave place - made reservations weeks ago for a Thursday lunch for 4. Received a reconfirmation text day before. Arrived and had the sweetest waitress and she was accommodating to one of our friends "cilantro aversion" without judgment. Had the guac and ceviche apps, then each of us had 2 tacos - varying between shrimp, beef, chorizo, fish and chicken. Everything was amazing and well proportioned. And at the end our waitress asked how we would like the bill - for King Street regulars this is essential for work lunches and so appreciated. Can't wait to return and work our way through the rest of the menu.
