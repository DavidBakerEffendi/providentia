HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Los Cucos opened recently opened and the entire family enjoys going for brunch, lunch and dinner! Their menu has an usually wide variety on food selection, price is good and customer service is truly a step above the norm. 

The restaurant has three sections all with very unique feels...outdoor that is glassed in, low ceiling quaint  section and lastly a large high ceiling well lit  area with a bar. Entire restaurant is kid friendly.

They even hold the door when you enter and leave!
