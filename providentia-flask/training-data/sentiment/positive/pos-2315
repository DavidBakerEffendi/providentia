Came here on a Saturday afternoon and was told it would be approximately a 2 hour wait so we decided to browse around the store for furniture. After an hour, they texted us saying they would hold a table for us for 10 minutes. Luckily we were nearby and not in the middle of checking out on the other side of the mall! Overall, lovely atmosphere, great service and delicious food! For a restaurant inside the mall, it was a nice change to be dining somewhere nice and relaxing. I would definitely come back!
