I would have never thought there would be any worthwhile food to be had at a gas station aside from the Oreo's.  Boy was I wrong!  This little food shop is hiding inside one and I've gone to lunch here a few times now with great results.

You'll order your food at the counter and they'll bring it to you in the dining area.  I'm a big fan of the baked macaroni and cheese and it is again what I got on my most recent trip.  Coming with a slice of Texas toast it is deliciously cheesy, I just wish they gave you more!

They also have a variety of BBQ options here, which is the real draw of the place.  I've sampled a few options such as the pulled pork and they were all quite good.  Sweet potato fries are also excellent.

Service was decent, although as with most places, Friday lunch hour will get pretty busy.  My meal came out quick, but if you're getting one of the meat options, you may be waiting a little longer while they process the rush.

I'll definitely be back for more, I'm especially interested in trying their breakfast options.  One of these days I'll have to wake up in time to do so, as it's only until 11am.
