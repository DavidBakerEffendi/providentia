Big fan of Rolando's Mexican Food. I grew up around these neighborhoods until my parents moved. Anyways, this was a place that my friends and I would always go to. My parents would also buy us breakfast burritos or one of their various dinner meals. 

My breakfast burrito of choice is a bacon egg, and cheese. I load up on their red and green salse (which has a bite to it) and I am in heaven. 

For dinner, I usually stick with the cheese enchilada rice and beans.

Now that I don't live around this place anymore, I have to go to another place and I personally don't think it is the same. There is something different about this place that I just love. Highly recommended if you are a looking for a fast food type mexican food restraurant around these parts.
