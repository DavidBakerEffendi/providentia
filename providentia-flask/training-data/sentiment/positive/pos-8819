These hand pulled noodles are a gift from the noodle gods, they're firm, very slippery and have a good chew to them. Each bowl contains noodles freshly stretched to your liking and make to order.

The broth is almost pho-like.  Fresh aromas of beef, cilantro, green onions and scallions come through and ooze that asian comfort food feel.  The chili oil has a nice toasted, nutty flavour and really complements the soup and noodles.  The oil is not too spicy.

See me there because this is my new favourite spot for soup noodles and I would eat here everyday if possible.
