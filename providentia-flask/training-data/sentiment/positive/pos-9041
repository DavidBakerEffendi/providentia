Great breakfast spot!  If you are dropping someone off at Sky Harbor Airport, stop by for breakfast or brunch.

We had about 9 people altogether.  So, instead of having to have everyone stand at a walk up order, my Mom and I ordered what we thought they would like instead.  Here is the list:

Breakfast chorizo burrito-Must have been that good, none left to try.

Croque monsieur actually a madame, with a couple of fried eggs topped a crusty bread.  (My meal)

Eggs Bennie-I had to have a bite of this perfect hollandaise topped creation.  Will be ordering that next time.

Banana foster french toast- the two little cutie pies finished off the sweet topping confection confection of caramelized bananas and whipped cream.  The toast had enough custardy texture inside.

Strawberry and cream french toast- Same French toast as above but covered with strawberries and whipped cream.

Farmer's breakfast-eggs, multi grain toast, bacon (or sausage) and breakfast potatoes.

The coffee, fresh squeezed OJ and choco milk were all good.

Of course, we're looking forward to dining here again!!!
