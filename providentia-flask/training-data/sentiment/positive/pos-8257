My neighbors were raving about this place... and insisted in treating me to their favorite dish and a margarita. I am always a bit nervous about how these can turn out, but I thought what the heck go for it! A really good Mexican restaurant is tough to find... not quite sure why, but even in vegas I was struggling. They had me order a burrito with pork and a side of "verde sauce" in a bowl. I think it is the same thing that was in the burrito..... I recall them saying it was #60 on the menu. You pour the sauce over the burrito. I have to admit, that I would have never ordered this on my own... but I have to tell you that this was the best Mexican Dishes I have ever had... it was absolutely delicious! The pork fell apart and the juice was phenomenal! Not a scrap left on the plate. They also ordered me a large margarita that was very good as well. And of course for dessert deep fried ice cream... also tasty. Their spicy salsa had a bit of a kick to it, but was not over the top and was quite good. Wow... I will be back to explore other items on the menu... give this place a try!!
