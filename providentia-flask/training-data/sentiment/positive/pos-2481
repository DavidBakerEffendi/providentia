Polka Happy Hour, people!

On some Fridays, DJ Kishka spins traditional polkas like there's no tomorrow. Freakin' genius! This was the most fun I've had at a bar in a long time. 

A place called the Happy Dog that serves dogs... how apropos. I'm a big fan of toppings and dipping sauces. I love building my own (sometimes scary) hotdog masterpiece. I haven't really had a topping or sauce I didn't like. They are all great. And tots rule.

The beer selection is amazing. If you're feeling particularly hipsterish, you can get your Genny Cream on draft. But be prepared for a massive headache the next day.

Ice cubes and beer!
