My family was very happy with the quality and the variety offered at the Mirage Buffet. We went for early dinner on  Monday and it was quite vacant; however, from what I could see the Mirage did not hold back on their offerings. I pricked up discount tickets from tix2night that worked very smoothly. Had sushi, prime rib, bbq ribs, pork tamale, prepared to order pasta that was excellent,  wine was so-so, but that was not my reason for going. Their deserts were excellent as well. The creme brule and the bread pudding with vanilla sauce were delicious. 

We plan to return again in a few days as the Mirage offered us dome 2 for 1 tickets as well. That is a testimonial as well.
