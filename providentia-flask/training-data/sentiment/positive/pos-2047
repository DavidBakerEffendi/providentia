Just stopped by again to try the lasagna and was waited on by a young man named Alex who I now know to be the owner son, and I was treated as if I was at the Ritz-Carlton and enjoyed my delicious lasagna very much. This has quickly become one of my favorite places as their Pizza is outstanding and the prices are extremely reasonable. The menu has just enough variety to make anybody happy and if you want good pizza stop throwing your money away elsewhere and just come here.
