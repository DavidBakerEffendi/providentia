My one (and likely only) experience at The Arrogant Butcher was for happy hour, and it was one of the best mixes of food, drink, and value I have ever had. My friend and I were in town for a WWE event at the US Airways Arena, and decided to stop in here for food and drinks beforehand. We took a spot at the bar and was pleased to see a great selection of Happy Hour specials - both food and drink.

We ordered the house soft pretzels with cheese dip ($5) and the Antipasti plate ($8) to share, and each ordered one of their toasts ($4) - my friend went with the roasted peppers and boursin cheese, and I opted for the chicken liver pate. The soft pretzel order was HUGE - I've seen portions half the size for much more at brewpubs - and were DELICIOUS. The toasts were a nice surprise - ample portions, and great quality ingredients. The chicken liver pate was divine - so smooth and creamy. The Antipasti plate provided an ample portion of meats and cheeses, all great quality. At $11/person, we were happily stuffed with bar munchies of the highest caliber.

Beer selection here is limited, but they do offer some decent options. Guinness, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, an IPA from Deschutes, and their local selection was the famous Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, that seemed to be everywhere I went in Phoenix. (They also had a Hefeweizen, but I don't remember where from.) At $3 for the local brew and $4 for the others, this is a great Happy Hour option. 

I'd love to try them for dinner, but I can't imagine when/if I will be in Phoenix again. For happy hour, I give them my highest of recommendations.
