I can't tell you enough how much I love this place. I love the scenery, it's like you're not in Phoenix anymore. The farm has three places to eat, I am more of a picnic girl, specifically because I know I can get sweet potato salad and a portobello sandwich and frolick in the grass. Okay, so I don't frolick, but I do sit on a cute bench. Everytime I'm there they have a new soup! It's like a birthday present midweek I swear. The weddings are beautiful there and morning glory is good for company in town.
