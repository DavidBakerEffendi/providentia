This place was everything I wanted for breakfast yesterday. I got the standard eggs, peameal, rye and latkes and my wannabe Jewish heart was over the moon. The service was fantastic, the tunes were exceptional and it really just seemed like everyone was having a great time in there.

The vegan menu at Cardinal rule is also awesome. I wish we lived closer to this spot because it merges my constant desire for Jewish deli/diner food with my partner's vegan needs. I seriously appreciate how these guys don't just do the standard tofu scramble but have a bunch of things for the v-inclined amongst us.

Additionally, I highly recommend the Prix-fixe option if you can: the mimosas are available with pineapple, orange, or grapefruit juice and are perfectly sized for a good diner breakie. As well, the coffee is far beyond the standard-issue crap bottomless coffee that diners serve (not that I don't love crappy bottomless coffee).

A solid breakfast with ALL the fixings cost us $20 each. You can't beat it.
