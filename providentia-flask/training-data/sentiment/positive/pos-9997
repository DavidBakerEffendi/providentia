Spectacular! Absolutely the closest to an authentic Italian restaurant you will find in Charlotte. Trust me, I know because I am married to someone from Italy. We took his parents there and they were so impressed. They are extremely picky when it comes to eating out but loved their experience here. Wonderful authentic dining experience.
