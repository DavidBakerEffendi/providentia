I was in the area visiting a family member and we decided that pizza sounded good. She mentioned the typical chain restaurants, but I'm more of the hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop place kind of guy. That being said, I turned to Yelp for help. Biaggio's one of the top rated places in the area and she had never even heard of it! Needless to say, an extra large pepperoni pizza later we were both sold on it and are pretty sure it's one of the best pizza's we have ever had.  Can't wait to be back again! I might even take a trip from Henderson to have it anyway! Side note, I did have an order of wings. You can get them individually, so you aren't forced to get 12 or 8. At .99 cents each, I felt that was too expensive for wings. They also are not tossed in sauce, it is on the side. Kind of weird. But you go to a pizza place for PIZZA, not wings.
