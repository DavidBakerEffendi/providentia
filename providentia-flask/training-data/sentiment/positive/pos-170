First time sitting down here with my family and we were instantly greeted with a welcoming smile by the hostess. Our server (Kyle) was one of the most genuine, polite attentive we have had in Las Vegas in over 3 years. It made us feel very welcome and at home. The food was good and the pricing was great for two people. We will definitely recommend people to come here and enjoy a good meal. Nice atmosphere in Henderson and I'm happy its close to home.
