I love this place!!!  We go their every year for restaurant week and for their AWESOME HAPPY HOUR!  

If you order all the small plates on their Aloha Hour (430P-630P) it come to $30.00 plus $5.00 drink specials, which is very eloborate and you will find something for everyone.  Everytime I have been to their Aloha Hour (aka Happy Hour) I get full by order all 6 small plates and it is shared!  Now that I have been a few times to Aloha Hour, I know what I really love and will just order those.  I can't seem to think anything negative about Roy's and their Aloha Hours.  So instead of reading me happily raging about them, especially their Aloha Hour....GO!!!

But if you do work a 8a-5p job, perhaps choose a day and leave the office early to make it to the HH.  That is the only thing I have a critic about.
