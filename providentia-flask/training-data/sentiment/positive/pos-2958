*drool* I love how they have sides for dayssssssssss!!! I suggest you EAT IN because you can get endless amounts of sides. The pickled veggies, kim chee, spicy diakon. Mmmmm, my mouth is watering as I yelp.

They have a great stone pot bi bim bop. (snap crackle pop lol I couldn't resist) which is veggies, beef, and crispy rice....yummm, textures galore equals party in my mouth.

Also, yumm @ Jun's is their meat chun which is thin slices of beef that are egg battered and fried. It's dipped in a sauce similar to ponzu. Ugggh, I'm getting hungry!!! It's definitely the best kbbq (Korean bbq) spot I've samps here in Vegas.

Ttyl. I need a Jun's kbbq fix.
