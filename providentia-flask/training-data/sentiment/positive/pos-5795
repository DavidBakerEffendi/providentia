This is the best Pita Jungle I have been to.

The service at this location is outstanding.  We have never had issue with delayed food or attitude & the servers go above and beyond.

The food at this location is consistently good & the portions are generous.  I am a huge fan of the cilantro hummus topped with pico de gallo.  The garlic potatoes are simply awesome!  If they don't come with your dish, order a side of them.

Pita Jungle has a TON of vegetarian options.  The Macro Platter is a great choice.  I think I would sell a kidney for their mixed bean recipe.
