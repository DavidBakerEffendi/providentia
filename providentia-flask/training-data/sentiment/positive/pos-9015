I was actually really impressed by this place.
I was expecting just a regular burger joint but was pleasanlty surprised  to find that they have  all kinds of different flavours and toppings.
This is like the Wvurst of burgers.
I had the "Hog Wild" with fronions. This burger has a FRIED EGG in it! do I need to say more?  
Our waitress was super nice and friendly and highly recommended the Wiki Wiki. I will be back to try it soon.
