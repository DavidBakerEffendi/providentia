It was a pleasant experience. We visited them last night and we had the following:

1. Rare Beef Pho
2. Deep Fried Calamari
3. Stir fired beef, king oyster mushrooms with broccoli.

First I did not want to take the Pho and the waitress insisted that I try. I am glad that I did, it was one of the best Pho's I have tried. It was packed with flavour with just about the right amount of seasoning. 

The deep fried calamari was also top-class as it was perfectly cooked. It was not chewy at all and the crispy coating was tasty.

Finally came the Stir fried beef and let me tell you I was blown away with the taste. It was so tasty that I could not stop eating even after getting filled with the Pho. It kind of tasted like kalbi beef as they pack it with green onions and the mushroom was nicely done as well. If you love kalbi beef you are gonna love it as it comes loaded with sauce. I am drooling as I am typing...yum....

I have to visit them soon to try their other dishes.
