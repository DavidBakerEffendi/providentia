Very healthy, good wholesome food.  Love the Baba Gannouj! Typically, I get the Vegetarian Combo appetizer as my entree---can't pass up on the Dawali .  The mint tea is wonderful.  The kids menu great---even my picky eater found something.  The prices are a bit high, but you really do get what you pay for here.
