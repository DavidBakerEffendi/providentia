My only complaint about Art of Flavors is that it's so far away for me!

I love the service.
I love the unique flavors.
I love it all.

Desyree is the sweetest lady and I love how she is so generous with the samples, especially when it's during your very first visit. She lets you try it all and you don't feel bad about trying it.  The hard part is trying to decide on which ones you want to order.  

I love that she goes all out and makes some crazy concoctions!  I've been fortunate to try the Foie one, but have yet to try some of her other wild mixes.  Nonetheless, I'm sure they are all wonderful.  This is an easy place to recommend to visitors!  Follow them on Instagram to get the latest flavors of the day!

* Note of caution: Be careful parking here as the limos that belong to that bridal store down the road are not careful drivers.  They pulled out quickly and almost hit our car, and of course, didn't even notice (or care) that they did that.  Good thing we saw them coming!
