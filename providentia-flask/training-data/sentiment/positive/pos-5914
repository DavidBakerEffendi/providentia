Excellent service: fast and friendly. The later crew seems to be more on top their game. I always get great service with a smile - even though you know they've probably been up longer than we all have. Some of the kids are better than others, that's why like to go later - better service. Some of their marketing strategies and pre-packaging could improve. My orders are always right and coffee is always hot! Overall, no complaints here. I do think some of the morning staff could use more training - I get better service later. Maybe that's where some of the negative reviews come in? Food for thought!
