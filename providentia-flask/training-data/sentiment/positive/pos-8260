We stopped back in to pickup some coffee beans. Believe they were their "5 star blend". DELICIOUS !!!! Great dark roast beans, comparable price to everywhere else, but made locally! Now if it would just cool off a bit more will try stopping in for hot coffee, and have yet to make it for lunch. Hopefully someday soon!
