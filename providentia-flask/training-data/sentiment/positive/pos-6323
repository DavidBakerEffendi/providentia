Im really glad this location is close to my work place I really enjoy hero burgers. The service is wonderful and during lunchtime it's not too busy. As a creature of habit I usually stick to the basic hero burger with the hero sauce and basic toppings but I'm never disappointed. You can't really go wrong with any burger you order here. Also the fries at hero burger are always delicious. Highly reckoned to any and all in the area.
