After experiencing The Living Room downtown Phoenix, I decided to try the one in Chandler. If I gave the one in Phoenix 5 stars, this one deserves 6!
The food is the same - excellent, although the menu has a few substitutions to the Phoenix one.
The ambiance is amazing! The curtains remind you of the Taj Mahal, the music is perfect, the crowd - higher quality than other places.
I hope to go back often.
