Went this afternoon not expecting too much as I am not real fond of sushi. All I can say is WOW! From the time we walked in the staff was very attentive to us going over some menu items. The place is gorgeous, open air and really looks excellent. We had shrimp cerveche verde and it was very good. Then came The calamari by SUPRISE and it was amazing. Excellent quality rings only (which is how it should come). Didn't even need dippin sauce yet Had a horseradish based sauce that was good but could have been spiced up with a touch of Siracha sauce. MGR Sara and Josh made our visit with a brief history of Smokin Fin. They are both great at what they do and with staff like that and food like we had this place is a sure winner.
