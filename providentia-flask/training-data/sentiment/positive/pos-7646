This has always been my favorite buffet in Las Vegas and my recent trip reinforced this! The price is reasonable and the food is more than you pay for, for sure! The variety of fancy yummies is endless! From the little baby mozzarella pearls rolled in pesto, to the juiciest little sliders in the world, to the full-on carved turkey/mashed potato/sweet potato/cranberry sauce holiday meal experience, I loved every bite! The whole family agreed. Next time we will make it a point to take more meals at the Bellagio buffet instead of opting for the convenient at the hotel we stay at!

Best dessert? The chocolate and vanilla dome with the little raspberry on top. Lovely!
