One of my favourite Brunch restaurants and I've only been here once. I got the Spanish hash that was hearty and delightful, my best friend got the fork scram with smoked salmon that too, was delicious but took some time to come out. We hard the fancy shorts pancakes, and oh my god. I've never had pancakes like that and it was so good; so fluffy and sweet but tangy and creamy because of the cheese. Server was so sweet and recommended great stuff. I need to come back to try their red velvet pancakes and chicken pot pie!!
