We mad it over to Olives after my aspiring foodie daughter decided we would eat Mediterranean last night.  What a pleasant surprise!  The layout is a bit like Zoe's but the food is anything but.  I like Zoe's but this place is all fresh all prepared and cooked there.  

The highlights were the chicken shawarma and gyros.  I wish I could tell you about all the different offerings but we had samples of the chicken shawarma and the seasoning was amazing, so much so that 3 of our four ordered it.  I had the chicken shawarma and gyros combo so I can report the gyros was excellent as well.

Finally the house made hummus and salads were very fresh and flavorful.  

I have no complaints but if asked for suggestions I would offer real plates instead of takeout trays.  It just has a different feel to it when eating from proper plates...  it that won't keep me from returning!
