This place has character. Filled with hubcaps and only stools for sitting on, it feels like a real dude's place. The employees wear mechanic uniforms as if they were working on a car instead of smoking the heck out of the meat. The Barnyard has every type of smoked meat in it and is loaded. Really worth the money. There's also delicious milkshakes that are nice and thick that you can turn it upside down. I think I might have clogged a few arteries here, but it was worth it while it lasted.
