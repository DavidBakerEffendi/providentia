I have tried many pho restaurants in the valley and every time I try a new place I am dissapointed, because they don't match up to Jenni Pho. The restaurant itself has an amazing smell to it... that I can't quite put my finger too but I love it! I always get the Pho Tai Nam. I love it! The broth has so much flavor to it. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.
