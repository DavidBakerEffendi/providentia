Let me preference this by saying I'm super picky about Pad Thai. It is my favorite noodle dish of all time, therefore, I have some pretty hefty requirements out of love for the dish. This restaurant serves up the BEST in town. Most importantly, the flavors are rich and developed. The portion is generous and well priced-can I get a hell yeah? Plus, they're really fast at getting orders out. Lastly, coming here makes me feel good. Spending money at a small bistro versus a large chain is way better for our local economy.
