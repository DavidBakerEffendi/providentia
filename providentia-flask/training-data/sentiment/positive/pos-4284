I am so glad to have a good hand-pull Chinese Ramen place near me now. The noodle is pretty authentic to my taste. The chewiness of the noodle is just right, and the ingredients all taste fresh. 

The soup is supposed to taste lighter authentically. If you like the thick Japanese ramen soups and was hoping for something similar, note that these are two completely different types of noodle dishes. 

The service is great even when they get quite busy during dinner hours. I can definitely see myself being a regular here.
