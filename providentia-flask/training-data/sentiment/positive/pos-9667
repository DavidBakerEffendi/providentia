We love it here!!!!!!
Some servers are better than others, this is true of any restaurant. Food is consistently good. Nothing crazy special but always comes out relatively quickly and tastes good. 
The restaurant is CLEAN and the management is always present. Everyone is really nice and friendly. 
They have a stamp card program... Buy 10 get one free kind of thing. 
Won't break the bank. 
It's just a really good spot for a quick, easy breakfast in a comfortable environment.
