Yum yum yum! I am remembering the chicken and fries right now and I just want to salivate! We came here based on Anthony Bourdain's visit and I was determined to try. So tender, so flavorful! The chicken and fries were fully drenched with that "crack sauce." When I say crack sauce, I mean it is so addicting you don't want to stop eating. I don't recall the exact price of the meal but I shared with my boyfriend and it was more than enough food! There was a long line but it moved quickly and especially so when you know what you order. The seating is really small but you can easily take it to go at a nearby parks (seems to be parks are a plenty in Montreal). Luckily we found a table and chowed down! There isn't much space but you begin to forget about it once you eat. It is definitely chicken and fries to try and I can see myself coming here again!
