I love this place. When I saw that they opened up the Danforth location, I thanked the pizza gods. I came by here with my bf and a friend. We decided to make reservations as the place does fill up pretty quickly. (I made the mistake of coming without a reservation once while I was starving so I decided to pass up on the 45 minute wait)

We had the buttermilk fried calamari to start and then the Ontario proscuitto and arugula pizza to share. The buttermilk fried calamari was amazing! It came with a red pepper, almond romesco sauce and it was just a great touch. Really brightened up the flavors of the calamari. The coating on the calamari was light and crisp... perfect! As for the pizza, you really can't go wrong with a wood fire oven pizza. The crust is crisp, but still soft and the toppings are amazing. Proscuitto makes anything taste better. We also ordered a bottle of red (can't remember which one) that was suggested by the waiter to pair with our meal. 

At the end of the night, the bill was a bit much for 3, but you really do get what you pay for at this place. The wine was great and the waiter made a great suggestion for our meals. All the food was yummy and the service was great as well. Food didn't take too long to come out and we were well entertained. 

Give this place a try if you're looking for some great eats on the Danforth. Not your usual pizza toppings, but they're delicious either way!
