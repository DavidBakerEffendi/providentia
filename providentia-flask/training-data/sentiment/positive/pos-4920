I am not big on eating tacos, but the tacos here are so good. My husband and I came in today and ordered the paleo bowl with shrimp, 2 fish tacos, 1 beef taco, and the taquitos. It was all delicious and filling. The paleo bowl is so good with lots of veggies and a good and generous portion of shrimp. I ended up eating half of it and letting hubby eat the rest because I got full.
The taquitos were nice and crispy, not oily like other places have. There was a really nice man, I wish I got his name. :/ He was very acommodating with lowering the volume of the music outside so hubby and I can talk to each other. He checked on us a couple times and made sure that everything was to our liking. He even brought some delicoous cinnamon chip dessert-like thing. It was a kind gesture and made my experience quite the positive one. :)
