This is hands down one of the best and authentic Chinese/Taiwanese places in Arizona.

Believe you me when I tell you that I almost gave up looking for a Chinese restaurant and was just waiting for my next trip to Vegas, NYC, Los Angeles or overseas to get a good Chinese meal. 

We have dined here more times than I can admit since moving to Chandler and we're so excited to have found this gem. Finally!

Let me start by saying that this is a no frills but extremely maintained kinda of place with a great team of ladies working and serving you. The staff is always happy to walk you through their extensive menu.

Here's the lowdown...

Get one of everything.

From the green onion pancakes, to the delicious eggplant, orange chicken, fried rice and shrimp pork dumplings, you will be more than satisfied with the flavors and the healthy serving of each entree they make fresh for you. Whatever you order, you will not be disappointed, everything like I mentioned is made fresh and comes out steaming, piping hot.

If you've been to Asia and appreciate Taiwanese cuisine, let me tell you about the AMAZING dumplings.

This is a family owned restaurant and their top Chef Mother, hand makes the dumplings every single day. You can see them making it while you're in the restaurant. The dumplings are beyond delicious they have a nice size amount of filling and have just enough juiciness in them that they explode in your mouth. While the flavor is subtle, the dumplings are lovingly made and I just can't get enough of them because not only are they priced right but I always have enough to take home for the next day.

I cannot say enough good things about this place, from the staff to the food because if I had my way this would be my Friday, Saturday, Sunday go to place to eat. That's how much I love Chinese food.

If you're in Chandler, make this a must stop for lunch or dinner and make sure you have a big appetite as there's always enough food to take home.
