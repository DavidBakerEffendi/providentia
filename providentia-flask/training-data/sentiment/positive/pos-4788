If you are one of the poor souls who has suffered from the likes of Chobani or Fage Greek yogurts, now is the time to treat yourself to the real deal: Labneh. It is rich and creamy, so you will eat less and feel more satisfied. Amena's Labneh is less bitter than Greek yogurt available in grocery stores. So I pick up a tub of it along with fresh hummus or tabouli or baba ghanoush as part of my regular shopping routine after leaving Trader Joe's. 

Amena also serves a delicious and abundant Falafel plate that would feed me for two to three days--the plate is a healthy, fulfilling lunch or dinner. 

The date pasties are handmade by mom. And so even though I don't like dates (or pastries, really), I had to try them and thought, "Oh, these were the inspiration for the Fig Newton." They're worth trying.

The pita bread is exceptional. Overall, high quality foods, reasonable prices, nice people, great service. Amena caters, too.
