I really like this place, the atmosphere was so relaxing I was able to hear my friend talk from across the table. Usually late night the only place to eat Thai is krung Siam but they're so expensive and so loud. 
This restaurant is so authentic, real Thai food. Less msg than Krung I can just taste the difference. Not trying to say bad stuff about other businesses but I always compare and honestly late night if u want good priced Thai food, and a relaxing place to dine I'd recommend this little spot. 
The service was also really amazing! 5/5 Our server was really nice and very attentive to our needs. Didn't rush us out the door when it was near closing and I really appreciate that. 
Their tom yum was the perfect amount of spicy and sour I loved it, and they gave more shrimp than krung does. I also ordered the yellow curry and the portions are big enough to fill you up! Their Thai tea is also really delicious by the way. They do grub hub so you can also order online if you don't feel like going out. 
Honestly I'm probably going to start coming here on my late night meals and I'd DEFINITELY recommend this place if you like a relaxing place to eat good priced Thai food late at night. And im not sure if I mentioned this earlier but their Thai tea is REALLY GOOD
