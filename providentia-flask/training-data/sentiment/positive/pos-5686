OK, I (we) have been to all the crawfish places in town and will have to say this place is about a tie with Boiling Crab.

Pluses:
VERY friendly and attentive staff.
Corn was better than other joints.
Potatoes were cook just right and not mushy.
Had bread available for 'cutting the heat' or dipping in the sauce.
Crawfish were slightly better cooked than competition

Minuses:
Small napkins instead of rolls of paper towels.
Crawfish and especially the shrimp were smaller than competitors.
Smaller capacity seating.
Not as much garlic in their signature sauce (Boiling Crab has awesome amounts with larger chunks in theirs)

My strongest endorsement is that we will most definitely will be back.  Good job Smokin' Crawfish.  Address the minus issues and you guys will be the King Crab of the crawfish restaurants in Vegas.  Cheers!
