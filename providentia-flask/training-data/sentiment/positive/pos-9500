My Favourite restaurant in Canada!!! 
I would travel Montreal for a dinner here. I crave to eat here.

Being a Vegetarian, I adored the concept of Vegan meat that they are trying to simulate. Mind blowing food.
Pick any dish from the menu, no risk!!!
Not to be missed ones are: Crispy Seaweed, Panang Beef Curry, Crispy Duck, Pad kee Mao
At times we take their 50 $ tasting menu, which is awesome.

None of the Thai Restaurants around the world can beat its flavourful food!!! Every dish is a delicacy and with your first bite, there would be explosion of flavours, perfectly blended.... Every item is better than the other.. 

Gosh! This place turns me on!! 

Heavenly food, their servers are smart and hospitality is best in Montreal. 
Location St. Dennis again great! But parking would be a fight, do make a reservation, its always full; even on weekdays. 
Best for special occasions.. Bit expensive but worth it. Must go and try. 
No trip to Montreal for me is complete without a visit to Chu Chai.
