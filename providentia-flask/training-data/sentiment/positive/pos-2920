I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  It is small and dark and has great wine list. The food is always good and frankly I'm addicted to a few things. Fresh spring roll is ridiculously good have it twice! Duck panang or drunken duck noodles also a favorite. The short rib beef rice super spicy and pork Larb. Those are my everyday items.  It's open late which is great.
