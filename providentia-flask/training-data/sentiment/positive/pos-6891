went here for lunch and ordered the vegetarian dumpling soup, panang curry with tofu over rice noodles, and a thai iced tea. the thai iced to was delicious and creamy. the soup came in a small bowl with three dumplings. the broth was deliciously full of msg and the dumplings were filled with yummy hearty stuffing, not just cabbage or onions. when the panang curry came out i was a little disappointed with the small portion size, but i realized as i was eating it that this was an illusion with the large plate or something because i barely ate half before i was stuffed. of course, i did have the dumpling soup before though.
the panang curry was 2 out of 3 stars spicy and i asked if i could have it just mild. it came out quite spicy, more than i comfortably like eating, so i'm not sure if that was their 1 or 2 star. definitely lots of flavor and spiciness.
all in all it was super tasty, great service, and very reasonable price! i took the rest of my curry home and it was just as delicious for dinner.
