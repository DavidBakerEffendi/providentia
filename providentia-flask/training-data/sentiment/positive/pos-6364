My new favourite Brunch resto! What can I say...I'm a big fan of their fried chicken! So the fact that they had a fried chicken Benny made me super excited! 

This Diner is a jackpot! Fast and kind service, old school/hip diner ambiance, and bomb diggity food made this an easy 5/5 stars for me! 

It is definitely busy on Brunch days but the food is worth the wait! They do not take any reservations !

Now let's talk about the Fried Chicken! Hot, fresh, crispy and not oily! I loved and enjoyed every part of it. The flavour is complex yet easy to love. The coating isn't too thick, the meat is juicy and fresh! It's everything u want in a fried chicken. 

Talking about this place is really getting me hungry. Also, I encourage you to try their waffles!!!! Pls and thank you! And don't skimp out of the waffles sauce... just pay the extra fee and get the damn maple syrup!
