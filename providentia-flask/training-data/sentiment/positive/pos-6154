Ordered takeout last night and wasn't disappointed. You can tell a lot about a place when you order to go. The way everything was packaged and separated shows real care and attention to detail. The same goes for the quality of the food. We had cerviche, tacos, fish tacos, guacamole, and the chicharrones which is so good you can't stop eating it.  Great atmosphere inside the restaurant too. It's a winner.
