Service was great! Atmosphere feels a little like a chain cafe, but still pleasant.

The best part is the food. We had a larger party so we got a pretty diverse spread. The group I was with was also all about sharing! In the end I tried 6 different entries and a few appetizers. The stand outs were the cauliflower appetizer, and the pear mule. In the end I didn't have a single thing there that I wouldn't mind ordering again. I have gone back once after the initial visit and it was the same thing... great food. If you want something a step of from your Panera Vera equivalent you're well overdue to try the perfect pear!
