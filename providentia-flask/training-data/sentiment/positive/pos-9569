Have (amazing) tacos, will travel. Another interesting place that has been featured on Guy Fieri's show and totally worth the exposure.
Like other Yelpers have said, it's in a quite unassuming small space off the 51 and McDowell. Forewarning, parking is definitely a premium. 

The menu is simple and perfect- tacos, burritos, quesadillas, horchata and a pretty good salsa/toppings bar. Unfortunately when I came with friends they were out of saut√©ed onions, but the salsas were a-plenty. Just maybe a little too spicy for my pref. Because I had worked out before, I was uber hungry and easily ate 5 tacos.

With #BestWeatherEverSeason upon us, we sat outside on one of their big patio tables. All but a few went with a variety of tacos. The consensus for favorites were Tacos Chiwas & Lengua. I love cabeza tacos, so one of my girlfriends convinced me I would probably like Lengua equally. And actually it's much better especially at Tacos Chiwas! The Al Pastor was ok, just a little too heated spicy for personal pref. Add in a large $3 horchata and it was a fab meal. I basically spent $15 and left a full and happy taco-lover.
