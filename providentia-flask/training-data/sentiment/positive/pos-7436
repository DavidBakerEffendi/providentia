It's been less than a year and what was once a tiny coffee shop sharing a space with a convenience store has blossomed into a full fledged cafe/event space. 

I hosted a small, intimate event here and had them cater. Justin and Sophia were an absolute pleasure to work with. They gave us different options and worked within our group's budget. 

We were allowed to move the furniture to accommodate our guests. We asked for the lights to be dimmed, we decorated the tables with candles and asked for the faux fireplace to be turned on; it was a very cozy atmosphere.

The food was delicious and the service superb. I appreciated that they treated our guests as warmly as they treat their regular customers: like old friends. Everyone in our party had an excellent time. We would not hesitate doing another event here.

Keep an eye on their Facebook page for events showcasing local artists and musicians.
