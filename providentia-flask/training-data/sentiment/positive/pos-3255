I remember Lenny's from 2003 on 27ave & Glendale. One of the first places in AZ that reminded me of some good burgers back home in L.A. I heard they opened one in central Phoenix so I had to stop by. I noticed they have a new look and their menu has so much stuff compare to the first place. Wtf?! holding out on us on the west of Phoenix? Well it's okay I forgive you guys, I seen they are remodeling the one on 27ave & Glendale same look and menu better be the same :)
