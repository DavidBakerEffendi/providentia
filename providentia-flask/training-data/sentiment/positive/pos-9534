Went here for a special birthday dinner for my Extreme Seafood Loving Mom, and we were all quite excited. My mother because my dad hates fish, and therefore she never gets to go out to eat anywhere where that's the specialty. My husband and I, because we are the sort of losers that love watching cooking shows on TV and have been perpetually drooling over Rick Moonen's foods for years. Okay, so I lied. 3 of us were thrilled, my dad was a stick in the mud.

We each ordered a different dish; I had Sturgeon, my husband Scallops, my mom Turbot, and my dad some sort of steak thing, which is all the man ever eats.

The food was wonderful. Everything was beautiful, and perfectly prepared. On top of that, every dish seemed to have some little extra special something; a side you'd never think of, or a sauce, or just a flavor. All of it was simply sublime. 

The service, though, was even better than the food. My parents are "shy" and "simple" people by their own description, and don't "need any fancy food. Its too good for us." And they can be made to feel stupid at some nice restaurants. Our server was so wonderfully good to them. They treated my mom like she was some restaurant critic and not a nervous tourist from Minnesota. He explained the menu, helped her pick, and did it all without a drop of condescension. And so she actually had fun. And so we stayed for probably way too long, and had desert and wine and cocktails and....

Yeah, everything you hope for on a fancy night out. "Once in a Lifetime" experience for my mom, and a place I'll be happy to go back to soon.
