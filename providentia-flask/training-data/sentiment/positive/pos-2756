Great place to get some rest, the restaurant is not that great but is ran separately from the hotel. The hotel staff are very friendly, the room was clean and there's a coup free bottles of water in the rooms. Couldn't ask for more in a comfortable hotel stay. We have stayed here twice and both experiences were great.
