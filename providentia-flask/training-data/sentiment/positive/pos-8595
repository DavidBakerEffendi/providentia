I really like when hotels have these kinds of shows outside for people to watch for free.

I really like seeing the water dancing before my eyes to the music that is playing through the speakers surrounding the lake of the Bellagio. I love how it looks at night and hearing the pitter patter of water falling back into the lake after being shot out into the air. There is plenty of space along the lake as well as restaurants across the street that allow people to watch while eating. It's definitely relaxing watching the water keep up with the music and having the hotel in the background makes such a pretty sight to see and a lot of picture opportunities to be had.

There are characters, girls in their skimpy costumes, and vendors along the sidewalk as well for you to check out once the water show is done.
