We are so glad my dad took us here! We played work hookie on a Tuesday and decided to take a day trip out to the Hoover Dam. On the way to the Dam you pass through Boulder City (if coming from Las Vegas) and the Pit Stop!

The menu is simple, well priced and sensible. We all got pit burgers, with cheese and a side of fries. The buns are soft and fresh and when you bite into the burger, just a slight amount of grease comes out so you know...it's delicious. We finished with a strawberry shake and really it all couldn't have been better. $30 for the three of us. 

We can't wait to come back and try the fish and chips.
