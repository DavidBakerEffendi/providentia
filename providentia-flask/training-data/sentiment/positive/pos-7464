Fantastic steakhouse with impeccable service. Had dinner here during a conference last year and was completely impressed by the quality of the food. 

Ambiance is nice, though it can take you a while wandering through the maze-like layout to get to your table. Still, it's a nice place for a date or any kind of celebratory get-together.

Prime rib was perfectly cooked and seasoned, mashed potatoes were heavenly. Price is on the higher side, but worth it.
