I love everything about this place, the atmosphere the vibe, and the food. We have had drinks here several times before but never eaten. We recently purchased a Groupon deal and really enjoyed our experience. The place was very crowed for a wednesday night and we were glad we had reservations. Service was very good, despite the fact that our server was very busy. Our food was really good, though I must spotlight the salmon dish. It truly was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Marinaded in lemongrass with coconut rice. Everything was paired perfectly!
