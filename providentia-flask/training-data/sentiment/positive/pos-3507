This is a place if you haven't made the trek over, you are surely missing out! Low prices for a boatload of food! Flavorful, robust, and hot! It never takes to long as they having it rolling in the back. The red or green Chile Burro's are delish. Tacos, crispy and like momma used to make. They are cranking out fresh made tortilla to buy. Salsa several choices all really good! You have to go!!
