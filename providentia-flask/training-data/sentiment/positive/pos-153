This place is super new, so don't be put off by the lack of reviews! This particular bit of Jean Talon was in need of another lunch place - March√© Soupson and McDonalds were about all I could manage before!

The decor is minimalist, focusing on concrete & plants for an industrial but fresh look. It's a little cold as a result, but it seems so clean and bright that it perks up your soul anyway.

The menu is a little confusing for anyone who's not super familiar with korean food - it can be hard to know what you'd like since they're all made with similar ingredients of meat + rice/noodle + mushroom + vegetables. Maybe photos would be helpful!

The crockery is beautiful though. It's all either traditional plates and spoons or hand-made pottery, which adds to the trendy feel of the place. 

As for the food - I usually get the bibimbap, which comes in a hot stone bowl. It's not the best bibimbap I've ever had but it's still exceptionally good, I just really like bibimbap!

It also comes with sides that change every day. Today it was melon & broccoli (separately!) which are both quite nice - and, I think, make the bibimbap worth $14 in total. 

All in all, a clean, quiet and refreshing place to have lunch!
