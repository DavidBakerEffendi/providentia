I've been to all four locations at Sahara, 2-15, Flamingo, and Green Valley.  Never got bad service at any of them.  They do tend to get really swamped during lunch time at the Sahara and Flamingo location by businessmen.  They have amazing happy hour pricing between 3pm- 6pm.  

I'm just gonna lay out a list of good tapas there.  The mini duck tacos,  the coconut shrimp skewers, chicken lettuce cups, mac & cheese, and the hummus is yum!

My favorite pizza is the truffle & brie pizza.  It's crispy, thin crusted, layered with melted brie cheese and mushrooms and truffle oil.  It's a nice change in taste compared to the usual mozarella cheeses used in pizza.  I added prociutto to it sometimes if I'm feeling a little carnivorous. 

The salads are always ice cold and fresh.  You can't go wrong with the Caesar Salad served with grilled chicken breast.  The romaine lettuce is always ice cold all the times I've had it, and its's served with dressing is savory & tangy.  The Chilled Roasted Vegatable Salad is definitely is my favorite guilt-free salad.  It has edamame, tomatoes, mozarella pearls, spinach, drizzled with olive oil and balsalmic vinegar. 

If you haven't tried this place out...you're missing out.
