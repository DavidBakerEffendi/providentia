This place has everything I want from what I would call an upscale diner; comfort food (including some all day breakfast items), fast and friendly service, good music, and of course a relaxed atmosphere. 

My friend and I stopped into White Brick for a quick early dinner before heading to a class at Annex Improv around the corner. We arrived well before any kind of dinner rush (around 4:30) and needed to be in and out in about 40 mins, so asked the server if that was doable. "Absolutely", she said. "Awesome", we said. 

We made our decisions - mac and cheese for my friend and rarebit with a side of mashed potatoes for me, and a side spinach salad to share - and they arrived within I'd say 10-15 mins. Everything was delicious. Both our dishes featured a tangy creamy cheese sauce, the side mashed potatoes tasted like homemade in the best way, and the simple salad with its lightly acidic vinaigrette was the perfect thing to cut through all the carbs and dairy we were consuming. 

STUFFED, but satisfied, we happy campers were done and out the door in under 40 mins.  Suffice it to say: I'll be back.
