This is a wonderful coffee place! The coffee and the food that we ordered were all delicious, and the baristas were so nice and attentive. They really did go above and beyond with their service. We ordered a few cold trench press coffees, some iced green teas,a dessert plate (apples, honey, walnut and Brie - so good!) and a hummus plate(cucumbers, pita bread, and three types of hummus). They even came outside to check on us a few times and refilled our cucumbers and water glasses! Overall, it was a really great place to sit and chat for a few hours.
