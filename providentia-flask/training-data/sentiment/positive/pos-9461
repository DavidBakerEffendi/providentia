Wow.... has this corner of Sunnyslope changed!

10 years ago I worked in an office building across the street, at an Internet startup. The day we moved in, there was a double homicide at the Circle K on Dunlap and Central. After that, I brought my baseball bat to work every day, because I usually didn't leave until late at night when crack zombies congregated in the parking garage below the building. I called it 
"Louis," my coworker called it (very Un-PC) the Ethnic Cleanser. 

Now.... the ghetto elements are gone, and there is a wonderful wine bar with an even better patio.

We put down a bottle of the Rose - it was very, very tasty and drinkable. We went on a Sunday, all they serve then is their breakfast menu. Well... it rocked. I had the veggie and cheese omelette, my guest had the chorizo wrap. Both were superb! The service was attentive, the ambiance was awesome both indoors and outdoors. The patio is shaded by some giant mesquites, with comfortable couch and chair seating. 

I'll be back! Especially for the goat and sheep cheese plate, and to try some of the rest of their fantastic wine selection. Ole!
