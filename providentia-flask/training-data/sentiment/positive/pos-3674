Som Tum salad. Yum. 

It is the very best thing I've ever eaten in my whole, entire life. It's spicy. It's fruity. It's crunchy and salty and sweet and amazing. 

I've eaten it so many times lately that the waiters know I'm the Som Tum salad girl. 

I am also a fan of the mango sticky rice. 

I love Thai, but I think this is my favorite Thai restaurant in the whole world.
