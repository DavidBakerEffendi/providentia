I've been here more than a dozen times, I can't remember a trip to Vegas where we didn't go to the Pepper Mill at least once, if not twice.

The decor makes me think of a 1970's airport lounge.Its very retro, fun, and casual.

There is always a wait, if you don't appreciate that, get over yourself and go somewhere else. 

It always seems to be a madhouse and the wait staff is always busy. Be patient. 

I've never felt rushed here, nor have I ever sent my food back for any reason. (but I don't generally do that anyhow.)

The portions are HUGE. (This is my only issue with the place, my sister actually asked them if they could give her a 1/2 portion on a TEN EGG OMELET and she'd pay full price (she just didn't want to waste food) and was told no, they won't cut portions, even if your paying full price.)

I read a bunch of the reviews here before writing mine... Some of the complaints are really unfounded, like "one dimensional" Whats that about? Someone else said "over priced" Are you serious? Apparently we didn't eat at the same place. The food is very reasonably priced and I can't ever finish what I order.

The only thing I don't like? The Sausage gravy, but that's a personal preference, my guy really likes it.

The spicy bloody mary's are TO DIE FOR! I recommend going and getting one in the fire side lounge, they taste better when the bartender makes them for you rather than the cocktail waitress ordering them for you en mass. The bartender asks what kind of vodka, and how spicy and if we wanted salt, where as the cocktail waitress just asks if you want it spicy or not.
