It really pains me so to see this place so empty even though I've only been there twice and both times were take out. If I were super popular, I'd invite all my friends to this place. 
From the exterior, it looks pretty rundown. The interior isn't much prettier but it's cozy. The service is very polite and friendly. My Japanese isn't the greatest but I could hear the language of my distant roots being spoken in the back. 
I didn't feel guilty for ordering solely vegetarian sushi (unlike a particular sushi snob chef in Newmarket, there is no shame in ordering vegetables). They have a good selection of vegetarian rolls and appetizers. I had to order the kinpira gobo since it's one of my all-time favourites! I know that it's pretty difficult to prepare (or my mom's a liar) so I appreciate when a place has this! It was sliced thinner than tiny matchsticks and tasted oh so good! 
I've ordered the vegetable tempura roll, shiitake roll and probably something else but my memory is like a sieve.  All had a nice flavour to the rice though it fell apart when I tried to stuff it into my big mouth (I'm not the most graceful sushi-eater). I think maybe a tiny bit less rice would be better. 
I was originally going to give this place 4 stars but I think their friendly staff, the good prices and the fact that this place seems to desperately need more customers, I'm giving it the 5-star treatment (for those who just look at stars and don't like to read my babbling review).
