I discovered this restaurant via a random yelp search for Chinese food, and wow - I'm very glad I tried it!  I think this unassuming little place at CSU might have just become my newest go-to spot in the city for authentic Chinese and Taiwanese food, particularly beef noodle soup and bubble tea!

So first of all, the bubble tea. Those from the coasts might be familiar with a couple of very large bubble tea chains.  This restaurant is the first place in Cleveland to partner with one of these chains.  This means that they are following a recipe specified by the chain store - thus, it is a bit formulaic, but also tried-and-true.  We tried both warm and cold bubble tea here.  The consistency of the boba was perfect, and the warm tea was made very well.  The cold bubble tea was on the sweet side but still better than anything else I've had in Cleveland.

As for food, we had Taiwanese minced meat over rice (rou zao fan), Taiwanese beef noodle soup (niu rou mian), and salt and pepper fish fillets (jiao yan yu pian).  The minced meat dish was not perfectly authentic - the consistency of the meat was a little different - but it still tasted pretty good.  The beef and the broth in the noodle soup were flavorful and authentic and I loved it!  Though I do admit they used a different noodle from what I am used to.  The fish fillets were also spot on - fried well with just the right amount of spice. 

The atmosphere is crisp and open and feels sort of like a coffee shop, designed as a place for students to hang out.  As someone else mentioned they also have games - that is - playing cards, Uno, Chinese Chess, Go, and a couple of Chinese games that I have never heard of.  The owner is very friendly and chatted with us a bit, and the prices are pretty fair.

I'll definitely be back here for more bubble tea and to try a couple more dishes.  Might even come back next week.
