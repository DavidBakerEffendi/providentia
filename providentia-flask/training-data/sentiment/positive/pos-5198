This place is a cute mom and pop's shop. Good is excellent. The Pad See Iw is my all time favorite and always get the chili on the side. Also, I always get the Thai Tea which is perfectly sweetened. I wished they had boba tapioca balls in it!  The yellow chicken curry is pretty good as well. 

The place gets busy during lunch but they get you in as quick as possible. Good customer service and good good!
