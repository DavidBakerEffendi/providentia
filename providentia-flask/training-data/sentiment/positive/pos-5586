Review #094 - 2017

Not sure if my review will add any more to what everyone else has already written, but I'll throw in my two cents and see if my review gets noticed.

I've been here countless numbers of times and I still come back almost every trip.  It's always so beautiful and fascinating.  I've honestly never seen a repeat or maybe I just have really bad memory that I can't tell that it's a repeat.

No matter the case, I don't think it ever gets boring for me to just enjoy the song and watch the water dance in synchronization to the music.  It's definitely an experience worth repeating no matter how often you make it to Vegas.

If you ever decide to propose to a girl, I'd highly recommend doing it here...I don't think any girl could say no to such a romantic guy--just make sure the diamond is of significant size ;)
