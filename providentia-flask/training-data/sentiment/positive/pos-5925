Absolutely loved the food! We tried the Barbacoa, Asada, Pastor and Lengua. All of the meat were hearty and not greasy at all! The rice and beans combo was a smaller portion than other restaurants but the quality and flavor made up for it. Anyway, you really shouldn't have so much rice and beans ;)

We loved the variety of sauces. I fell in love with the avocado sauce and they preferred the spicy habanero. 

The sodas were cold and the place was clean. It's a fast food place not a fancy diner so don't expect a chandelier...lol 

Their service was great. Both the cashier and the cook interacted with us and asked for our feedback. I took some stuff home and it traveled well. Just wish I had asked for more salsa in the bag. It was really tasty.

Definitely recommend! The barbacoa was my favorite meat but I did enjoy the quality of all the meats we tried. I can't wait to go back and try the Chicago spacial and the fries.

Thanks for a great experience!
