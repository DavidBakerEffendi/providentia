This used to be called Star Burger but that's all that changed. Still great food, service and prices. Usually stop in to eat here when I am visiting Kinsley Ornamental Iron. My favorite burger I have been getting is the Red, White and Bleu. The Egg Burger is another great one. Their crinkle-cut fries are awesome, especially with their fry sauce.
