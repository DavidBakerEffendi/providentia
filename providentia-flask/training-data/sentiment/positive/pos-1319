OH. MY. BIG. FAT. GREEK. WEDDING.

The Greek Grill is FAN-Tsatziki-TIC! 

Seriously, this is the most wonderful tzatziki I have ever tasted. Mr. Rosie S. agrees. 

We ordered catering for dinner after rehearsals. They delivered to the rehearsal hall downtown (Queen & Yonge) and everything was hot and delicious, even after sitting for 15 minutes after being delivered. 

*Round of Applause*

We had:
- Tzatziki
- Hummus
- Village Salad
- SO MUCH PITA
- Chicken Souvlaki Sticks
- Pork Gyros
- RICE GALORE
- Lemon Roasted Potatoes

*burp*

Everyone loved it. I will dream of this tzatziki for life.
