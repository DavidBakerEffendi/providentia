GOODNESS...
What a hidden gem! I've driven by this location numerous times and never thought to drop in but I sure am I glad I did today!

I ordered online using the yelp EAT app and headed to the North Hills Grill. So convenient. Only word of caution: the EAT app is not most up to date on what delicious items they have to offer.

The establishment is so clean and the lady behind the counter was very nice. She made sure my food to go wouldn't leak or spill by double checking for me. Such attention to detail!

Now to the food...

Wow wow wow. Honestly, I didn't expect such a high quality gourmet salad. (I got the berry salad with blue cheese, grilled chicken and almonds) it was delightful. The berries were fresh and plentiful. Not haphazardly thrown in just for color... A true generous amount. And the dressing tasted homemade and was a perfect blend of sweet, tart and savory. I also got the stuffed pepper soup which was so hearty but not gross-greasy if you know what I mean. Very flavorful. I ate every last morsel. 

Check this place out. It is one of those places where you will see hard working people putting out high quality food with lots of attention and pride.
