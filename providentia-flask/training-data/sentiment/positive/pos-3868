New owner, refurbished with new floors, layout, and tables, booths, chairs.  Great looking inside and very comfortable.  Couple of large flat screens for sports lovers. One of the best Japanese restaurants in town.  Curry is unbelievably delicious and you get lots.  The prices are reasonable.  Ramen is to die for.  For those who like Okinawan food, keep your eye out for Okinawa soba coming soon.  Fried rice is the best.  Will be eating here as much as my wallet will let me!
