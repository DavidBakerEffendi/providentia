Still love this place!  My favorite spot for gelato in town, even though it is a drive for me and not in the best of neighborhoods.  The flavor combinations are always changing and very original. The other night I tasted both spaghetti & meatball and roasted red pepper which were both surprisingly good!  I settled on a pretty classic combination of the dark chocolate sorbetto with peanut butter gelato.  The dark chocolate sorbetto is a chocolate purists dream flavor.  It is pure, unadulterated chocolate goodness!  Heaven on a spoon!!  Having lost 100 pounds over the last few years I now pay more attention to how I "spend" my calories --- this is definitely worth the indulgence both in calories and $.
