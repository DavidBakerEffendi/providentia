Forget your diet when you come here. Your initial thought when seeing any of their hot dogs is how am I going to finish this? It's too big! Once you devour the last bite, you want more. It is that good and not as big as it looks or I'm a fatty. I tried a few of their hot dogs- Bulgogi hot dog, West Coast dog, angry dog, etc. Their angry kimchi fries are wonderful as well. There's a hangover chicken soup and bulgogi bibimbap that was OK at the time but I wouldn't order it again. I think I'll just stick with their hot dogs and fries. Not only do they serve delicious fusion hot dogs, the employees are quick to greet you, always professional, the restaurant is in a casual setting, and it doesn't take long to get your order.
