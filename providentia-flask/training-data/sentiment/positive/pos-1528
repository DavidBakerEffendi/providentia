If I had any weight in telling you where to consume your caffeine, I would tell you that Analog is  THE coffee shop along 17th Ave in Calgary. Here's why as concise as I can:

It's not a place to get your work done. 
It is a place to meet up with friends as long as you're looking for a social environment. 
It is not a place to go for job interview, or to interview someone for a job.
It is a great spot for incredible coffee.
It's a good place for pour over.
The espresso is damn fine.
It's social.
It's too social for intimate interactions.
It's fun.
It's got a vintage, damn well 'analog' feel.
Get your coffee here.
Hang out, have fun, but dont' spend the day.
