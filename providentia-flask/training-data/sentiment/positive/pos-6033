New to Henderson and got so Lucky choosing this salon. I have hair extensions and when I moved to town I desperately needed them redone.  Vanessa was quick to get me in, fix the poor work the stylist before her did on my extensions (at a different salon), and did an amazing color and cut! My hair was so matted from being behind on my appt and not being told how to properly take care of my extensions. She got through all the mats with minimal damage. She did an amazing job. 3 weeks later I haven't lost one extension and they look and feel great. Heather waxed my eyebrows better than I have had in years! I got exactly what I asked for in a waxing. Last Tiffany rocked at my nails! Perfect length, the design I wanted exactly, and again 3 weeks later still haven't lost or broke one. Thanks ladies!!!
