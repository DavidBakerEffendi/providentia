I've eaten different In-N Out places. This location is probably the busiest I've been to so far and this location has a gift shop. 

To me, this place is the best burger place with speedy service and consistency. I love places with few things on the menu and they make it to perfection. I'm a simple kind of person so I don't need nothing fancy but excellent food and service. Every person who works here work to their fullest. I haven't met anyone who are lazy or mess up my orders like the other fast food chains. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to eat another meal here on Christmas day because they were closed. Although I was disappointed, I'm happy for the workers who are able to spend Christmas with their families. 

Lastly, I like to clarify a rumor, In-N-Out will never come to Hawaii. The gift shop person tells me that's like building a bridge between Hawaii to California. Their quality control is that strict.
