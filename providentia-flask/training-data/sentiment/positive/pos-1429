What's not to love about the Fountains of Bellagio? It's free. It's beautiful. It's captivating. It's the only thing in Vegas that never seems to get old for me. The entertainment from the combination of dancing water, lights, and music is mesmerizing. With 30 plus songs, hearing/seeing the same performance is few and far between which helps make the Fountains one of the most dynamic entertainment options in Las Vegas.

The schedule varies by day, but basically they occur every 30 minutes during the afternoon and early evening and then from 6:00, 7:00, or 8:00 (depending on the day) every 15 minutes until midnight. My recommendation is to visit the fountains at least three times. See power of the water in the daytime. See the beauty of the Bellagio, sky, and lake at sunset. See the majesty and mystery of the lights and water at night.

The variety of songs range from classical to pop. You'll find Faith Hill's kitchy "This Kiss" or the Sin City anthem of Elvis belting "Viva Las Vegas" just as likely as you are to hear Sarah Brightman & Andrea Bocelli's inspirational "Time to Say Goodbye." The water is choreographed in complex patterns from 4 different types of water fountains that spray water in spherical motions or shoot water straight upwards. The tall blasts of 240 or 460 feet in the air are true crowd pleasers while the smaller jets appear to be truly dancing to the music.

It all takes place in the 8-acre lake directly in front of the Bellagio. The firm WET Design was the mastermind behind the $40 million water show that features more than 1,200 spouts and 4,500 lights. Kudos to them and the Bellagio. 

The Fountains of Bellagio stand out in a city full of temptations and entertainment as a simple, timeless, and beautiful way to spend a few minutes letting your heart and spirit be a kid again.
