This place is incredible. We booked our rehearsal dinner here a few weeks back based on a previous experience we had had here for a friends bday. 

The service was incredible, the food beyond amazing and the portions were insane. They were kind enough to box up leftovers for us which served us well the next day before the wedding. Some of my favorites were the pizza, mussels, vodka penne and the pesto spaghetti OMG.... i unfortunately have a gluten allergy so after a few bites i started to feel a bit woozy and couldnt have any dessert. Though from all the guests i heard that the chocolate bombe was litterally out of this world. Wish i had taken some home! 

One thing that i wanted to mention... at the end of the night one of my bridal party accidentally lost her phone behind the cushion. It became mission impossible trying to get this phone out.  THe staff were beyond incredible...they use plyers, brooms, scotch tape,...masking tape... everything you could imagine to get this phone out. It took them 1.5 hours of waving an ipod flashlight and using crazy contraptions and 1 server's tiny hand to get the phone out. I honestly couldnt believe how much time they took into trying to get the phone out. Thank you guys so much on behalf of myself, my husband and the owner of the phone. 

We will definately come back and im definately going to have that chocolate bombe.
