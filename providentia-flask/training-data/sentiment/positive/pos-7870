We were in the mood of looking a Carribean restaurant near our hotel and we found this place in yelp. This is a fairly new business.  We went there Sunday night so it's not busy at all. The restaurant is clean and has a good vibes. The owner greeted us and and asked for our orders. He's really friendly. We had jerk chicken and pork. We did not wait too long for our order. It was really really good and the price is really affordable. Will definitely visit again if we are around the area!
