Nacho cheese on everything? YES PLEASE =)

I've been here several times & I still love this place! I was first intrigued when my coworker said they serve warm chips & salsa! What in the world...?
So, I had to try it!

Their warm Chips & Salsa is delicious! The green dip it comes with is even more delicious!!!

I've also tried their Chimichanga Plate & the Deep Fried Avocado Plate.

The Chimichanga is my fav!!!! The best part? They drench it with nacho cheese!!!! They also drench their other dishes with nacho cheese (enchilada, burritos, etc).

The restaurant has a warm & welcoming feeling, like I'm dining at a friend's home. 

I'd definitely recommend this place!
