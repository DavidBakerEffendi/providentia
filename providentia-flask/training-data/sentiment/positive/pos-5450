Alright, 2nd time ordering with them through DinerDash and still 5 stars!! My husband ordered the same pizza and this time I ordered the fish and chips. I must say, the fish and chips is probably my favorite item from there so far. My husband also got the white chocolate pretzel cheesecake (I was trying to take a picture before my husband got his hands on it, but he beat me to it - obviously it was delicious lol) and we also ordered the white chocolate brownie which was still so good.
