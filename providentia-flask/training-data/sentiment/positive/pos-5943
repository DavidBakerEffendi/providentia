I've driven past JJ's dozens of times, and it's always seemed incredibly busy. It was such a beautiful day on Saturday I decided to take my dog for a walk through nearby Freedom Park and walk up from the park to grab some lunch. I'm glad we finally decided to try this place! 

My wife got the Dirty Jerz (pickled relish, onions, mustard, & sauerkraut) combo with a side salad. Hers was good (more of a traditional" hot dog to me), and the balsamic dressing was good! I opted for the Quarter Hounder (queso, bacon, lettuce, secret sauce) with the onion rings. My dog was phenomenal, the sauce/queso had a fantastic taste... The onion rings were okay, but nothing I would call "infamous" like they claim. Next time I'll probably opt for the cheese fries. 

Besides the awesome food, probably my favorite things are the cheap prices ($6.99 for any dog, side and drink) and their awesome rooftop seating. We were able to lounge up there with our little pooch and soak up the sun while we chowed down. Definitely a must stop during a jaunt down East Blvd.
