Hi. My name is Drew and I have lactose intolerance. Why should you care? Bc I NEVER eat ice cream or gelato... besides AOF. Given, the above statement means I don't have much experience judging gelato, I still think it means a lot that I roll the dice to eat the lovely creamy goodness from AOF. 

From my first time here, a blind tasting, to subsequent visits ordering specialties like cinnamon toast crunch and blueberry pancake, I always leave wanting more. The price is right. The owners are on hand and friendly. What else can you ask for? Then again, I can see how it can be hit or miss, bc your fave flavor from last time might not be there on your next visit, but I've always found a nice substitute. Do it.
