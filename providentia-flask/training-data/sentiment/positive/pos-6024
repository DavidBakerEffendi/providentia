I think it's funny that for any given bagel place in the south, you'll have a handful of northerners be like "This is the real thing!!" and then another handful of northerners be like "What are you talking about, this is NOTHING like the real thing". Makes me wonder if there is such a thing as a New York/New Jersey bagel, or if it's just pride...

I work right across the street from Bagel Bin, so it's by far the most convenient bagel place for me. I will always, 100% of the time, choose Bagel Bin over Panera or Bruggers if I have the chance because of the quality of the bagels. Not coming from up north, I've never really experienced the true NJ/NY bagel experience so I've grown up blissfully unaware of what makes a good bagel, and why northerners always yell at me that I'm wrong about asiago being a real bagel flavor.

Whatever. I like asiago.

But you won't find that here (except on rare occasion). You'll find your staples, and probably the best everything bagel in Charlotte, if not NC. If you want CC, you'll get a massive amount of it. If you have too much, wipe if off, fuhgeddaboudit. They have a good Boars Head meat/cheese selection that they use to make a lot of sandwiches, but I haven't personally experienced this yet. Maybe next time I forget my lunch at home....

Bottom line, with the owners coming straight from NY and a line that says "you better know what you want by the time we can talk to you", Bagel Bin is legit and delicious.
