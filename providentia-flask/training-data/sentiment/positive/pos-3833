Short and sweet - a great place for wine (ding) down.  They have expanded the beverage list to include martini's and other good cocktails. The "red" pizza is perfect with a red wine or good white. Burgers are just right with a good selection. The menu while limited, covers the hunger factor when drinking a good wine. 

Tell Rich you like his bar!  Nice job at making a great place!!
