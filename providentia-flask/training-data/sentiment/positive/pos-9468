Im here to change my review.  I love how this place is not a hassle to get bbt anymore.  No line ups for an hour.  They have different bbt now to compete.  They moved their counter to the front for more efficiency.
We even got a free sample today.

The food here is not something to pass up on either.  Fried pork with rice is amazing.

Renos made the place feel cleaner.

Would be nice to have more exotic drinks and even fresh fruit shakes.

Will be back again for food for sure.

Dont trust peoples low star reviews and try it out for yourself.  Dont just take my word for it.
