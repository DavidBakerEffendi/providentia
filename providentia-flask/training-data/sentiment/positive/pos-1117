Delicious!!! This is my new place for sandwiches. Da Gouda is my favorite. I love the crusty bread. We also tried the Sprang Chicken. It was good, A bit dry. The Bahn Belly was yummy too. I tried that one last and by the time I got to it, The bread was a bit soggy from the  slaw but it was still good. There is Sriracha  on it that added a nice kick. 
I ordered at the register at the side when I entered , got my drink and sat down and then the server brought out the food pretty quickly.  Service was friendly and prompt.
