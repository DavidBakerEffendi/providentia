Gorgeous restaurant, delicious food, excellent service. Prices are a little high but hey, it's Vegas. The stuffed dates are sweet and savory but could use a little more sauce (just a tad bit dry), the french onion soup was very cheesy and savory and the steak (we got filet mignons) had wonderful flavor and tenderness. Get the merlot sauce, it is to die for!
Service was very attentive and our drinks were always full. This is a great restaurant on the far side of town!
