I love this place. The yellow door is my favorite. I don't know why but it is. Just appreciate it. 

The food is fantastic, the drinks are awesome (half price wine on sundays and mondays), and I love the overall atmosphere. I've been taking people here that have never been and they love it. This was a perfect concept for this location and I see it thriving for a long time.

Andrea at the bar is awesome. She is so nice, smiles at everyone and gives attentive and great service. She makes sure that everyone is taken care of and has a great work ethic, you can tell. As simple as this is, the grilled cheese and tomato soup was actually pretty dang good. I recently had the salad with ahi and it was perfect and as always I get extra sauce. 

Check my pics out but everything I have had here was great. Definitely be coming back and trying new things.
