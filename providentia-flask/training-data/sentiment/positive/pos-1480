Quaint, local and great service! We all get cravings and sushi is one of them!! Centrally located in Downtown Phoenix is a spot that will fulfill that craving! From entering on a Friday night it was busy inside. Not a huge place which I prefer it being the size it is. We were greeted immediately and sat right away. No wait for anything from our drinks to getting our starters. 

Of course I have to get the typical edameme and also ordered the crab salad. Edameme was warm, and the crab salad was in roll form! Delicious! Real crab not the fake krab btw...Anyways my dinner date ordered a platter of sashimi including albacore tuna,salmon and yellowtail. I ordered a combo plate with 3 different rolls for only $15.00!! They all were fresh and tasty! They do use purple rice, do not be afraid it is perfectly fine! They also do not skimp on the portions of filling and the rice is not overwheming like most places. 
I don't appreciate when I get a roll and most of it is rice and small amount of filling.

The overall experience was fulfilling and I felt very satisfied! Please go and visit and support our wonderful downtown! I will most definitely be returning to satisfy future cravings!
