I love local businesses who love their customers. This is not a big restaurant, but the plates come prepared full of love! You can just tell when people care. 

We came during restaurant week, it really wasn't too busy (which worried me a little bit) but the food was actually pretty good! I had the baked apple stuffed with BBQ pork to start, which were an interesting combo of flavors, but they seemed to work together. For the main course I had the grilled salmon with rice.... it was perfect, not overdone, and the rice was so good! It was kind of a sweet and savory dish. Dessert was simple, a wine poached pear with a fruit sauce. I think the whole meal was an A+.

What was especially impressive for me were the wine pairings. I honestly think that the wine was what really made the whole meal. Which makes perfect sense to me, as the restaurant has the word "Winery" in it's name before the word "Eatery". The owner was really nice, apparently, they do make their own wines! (much of the grapes coming from California) 
He took us back into is wine cellar where they have quite a few wine casks brewing up some magic inside them......

Service was great, as I said, even the owner took time to talk to us and show us around. This is definitely a great local spot, and definitely a perfect place for an excellent glass of wine and some good grub to go with!
