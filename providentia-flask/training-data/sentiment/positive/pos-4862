I went with a big group of friends on a Saturday night. There was a band playing, and the atmosphere is pretty typical bar atmosphere. A few of my friends got drinks, a few got hot dogs, a few got tater tots. I love the hot dogs, because you can get whatever toppings you want, and there are a LOT of choices, and its $5. I've gotten tater tots before and those are good too ($3). Their service is pretty fast as well.
