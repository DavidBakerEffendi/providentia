I have to admit, living in Hawaii and visiting downtown Phoenix, my expectations for ono sushi were floor level at best. I knew we had something good going when we walked in and were greeted by a Japanese waiter with a Japanese cooking show playing on the big screen. We ordered the OMG, Sex in the City, and H3 rolls, all prepared perfectly. Love this place!
