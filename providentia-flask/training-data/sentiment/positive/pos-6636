Perfect place for a girls night. This cute and homey bar is owned by two super cool looking sisters. I immediately give props to them as they both work on the floor six days of the week. 

The bar includes a mix of vintage furniture, modern drinks, comfort food menu - there's definitely something for everyone. They also have a stack of old school board games available to play.  

We ordered the Ceasar salad, wings and Mac and cheese. I assumed the plates would be appetizer size but boy we're we wrong. The Ceasar salad was serving plate size and it was decent. The Mac and cheese came in a hot cast iron skillet. While the skillet looked small, that skillet was 2-3 inches deep. The macaroni could have been a little bit softer but that's more a personal preference, this was more al dente. The cheese was gooey, creamy and was a nice homemade dish. 

Now the wings... These are the best wings. They are baked but these taste fried so if you're worried about a lack of crunchy breading, no need to worry. The best part of the wings are the sauces! We got BBQ and Honey I'm Hot and it was a perfect blend of heat and sweetness. The coleslaw that came with the wings was really good as well. 

This is a great place to grab drinks with the girls and enjoy some shareable bites. It's refreshing to see a place like this thrive.
