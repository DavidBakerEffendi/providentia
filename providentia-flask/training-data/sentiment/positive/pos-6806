This establishment receives 5 stars for a lunch venue for the filling reasons Relatively inexpensive, good food and excellent service 

I ordered the turkey salad and turkey sandwich.  The ciabattas bread was so fresh and the crunch on the crust was great.   The tomato was sliced thick enough that you could actually taste the yumminess of it. 

The salad was presented well. I love the slivers of pear, although there could have been a little more   

The server, Bobby, was efficient and friendly.
