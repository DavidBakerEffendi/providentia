I was quite impressed with the cleanliness of the supermarket. I've been to others and was put off by the cloying fishy smell and general dinginess of other places. OK, the fish section may have a little smell but it's only confined to that area. For all you 9th Islanders there is an aisle containing all kinds of products normally only available in Hawaii. And an aisle for Mexican and Latin American products. I don't speak nor read Korean, but all the products are clearly labeled on the shelves in English.

Outside the supermarket is a food court and mini-mall, so you could do all your shopping there and grab a bite as well. I highly recommend a visit if you need Asian or Korean specialties for your next home-cooked meal!
