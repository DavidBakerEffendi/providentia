I must admit that Ling and Louie's was a good dining surprise. We came starving and ready to eat not expecting much - expecting something like a Pei Wei. We walked in and the restaurant was pretty busy on a Monday night. There was a cute bar on the left and a hostess to seat us. It was loud, really loud but such a cool modern Asian American restaurant. The menu was extensive so we needed some time to review. 

We finally decided on sharing the Asian seafood hot pot with fried rice and miso soup. Our server was awesome! He was so friendly and because we decided to share, he made sure the kitchen split the dishes for us. The miso soup I wasn't a big fan of but the hot pot made up for it. The flavors of the hot pot was superb with the coconut broth, fried rice, mussels, salmon, shrimp and scallops. Oh my it was so good!! 

The portions were generous because I couldn't finish my half of the entree. Kind of like a frequent flyer program, they have a dining loyalty program where you earn a free meal after ten visits. They also offer happy hour M-F from 3-7p, Sat 11a-3p, and 9p-close. 

If I'm in the area again, I will come back for sure!
