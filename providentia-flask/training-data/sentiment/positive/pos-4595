Spending our Saturday regrouting  countertops is not necessarily the best idea when you have a whole family to feed. With this in mind we were on the outlook for healthy good lunch. Northhills Grill has been on my radar for quite a while and we took this opportunity to have a nice sitdown lunch. 
The location is easily accessible to the North Hills by Rochester Road and Route 19. The Decour is simple very IKEA-ish with bright colors and fun food pictures. The menu is written on a whiteboard wall and supports vegetarians to carnivores.
You order at a station, they prepare your food and bring it to the table. Food is prepared expertly but served in to go boxes. I assume this is because most of their orders are to go. 
I ordered the Santa Fe chicken salad in the seasoning on the chicken was perfect. My darling husband ordered the chicken Apple wrap with quinoa salad. The wrap was very flavorful with the Chrisp sweet apples and chicken. We also ordered two kids meals both of them had the one dollar upgrade to change a soda to a smoothie. My kids really love the smoothies and I love the fact that they were not drinking soda. One kids meal was grilled chicken tenders with fresh-cut sweet potato fries. The other kids meal was a homemade hamburger with cheese and wedding soup. I swear my kid could live off of wedding soup. 
My only wish for this place was that it was a little bit more sit down friendly. The floors were a bit sticky and I made sticky shoe notice  walking all the way across the restaurant. We will be going again and ordering out, I found the food to be much better than Panera's and a lot fresher.
