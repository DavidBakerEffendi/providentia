Nothing too exciting on the outside, I probably wouldn't have given Kabuto a shot  if it wasn't a UNCC hot stop for its half off sushi. Every Wednesday & Thursday they offer half off all the sushi/rolls- an awesome steal, it was the only thing ever getting me through my night class! Everything is always fresh-double points for fresh sushi. 
I'll explain my 5 star rating in a quick second! I live right down the road from this place and It is weekly staple for my friends and I- even though I always forget to 'check in'.I think I just don't want my yelp friends to see how much I eat here! Since Yelp prides itself on local business- the two owners alone deserve 5 stars. Every night you will find both owners socializing with guests, filling drinks and even making rolls behind the bar- talk about hands on! 
I can only review on the sushi portion since I haven't made it past the sushi bar in years. 
If you're an adventurous sushi eater you must order off the specialty roll menu go for the Jackpot,Carolina , Harris or Arizona rolls- they won't disappoint! If you're looking for  something simple, spicy tuna always hits the spot. 
If you're going to eat on a Wednesday or Thursday service my be a little slow- any other night, the sushi bar has always been speedy. 
You can't pass up a sushi meal for 10-15 bucks!  Always a satisfying, fun and easy night out. Nothing too fancy! 
See you next week...
