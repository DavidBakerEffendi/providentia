Really good! I read the yelp reviews before going and saw that the seafood steamer pots were getting praises. Soooooo good!
We started with A Baker's dozen oysters which were heavenly. We then ordered the Bouillabase and New England steamer pots: Full of lobster, shrimp, clams, fish, potatoes, corn, vegetables... The first had a saffron/fennel base and the second had a buttery base. Both were absolutely delicious. It was obvious that the seafood was fresh.
The service was pleasant and quick. We also ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. 
Overall, our dining experience was very nice. I am very impressed with this restaurant and do plan on going back.
The price is reasonable. It is not cheap but it is reasonable. Attire is business casual.
