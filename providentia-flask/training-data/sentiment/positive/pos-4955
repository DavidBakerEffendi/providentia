"Merci beaucoup from the Americans." That's what we wrote on our receipt...We went here for breakfast during vacation and the staff was very welcoming and friendly. Our waiter went along with teaching us a bit of French from the menu!  Food portions were decently large. My breakfast included a half waffle with Nutella chocolate, bananas, strawberries, and English cream-- it was delicious.
