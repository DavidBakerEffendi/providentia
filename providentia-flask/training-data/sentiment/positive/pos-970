What a nice little find at Wynn Hotel! This place not only serves ice cream by also, lunch selections such as sandwiches, soups, salads. Prices are naturally what one would expect to find in an upscale hotel, but then when you think about it, it's not THAT much when you consider how much everything else is in comparison.

One scoop of ice cream was $4.50 and a grilled cheese sandwich with a bowl of tomato soup was $8.50 (just to give you an idea).

Service wasn't bad, it is counter service and then you go sit down and they are supposed to bring your food out (they give you a number) but then I noticed most people went up to the counter and got their own food.

There is a waterfall right outside on the patio area which creates lovely background scenery if you like that sort of stuff. It was way too hot to sit outside so we enjoyed it from within. 

The ice cream was really good though, creamy and rich. Reminded me of Piccomolo in Irvine. Can't review the other stuff because we only ate the ice cream.
