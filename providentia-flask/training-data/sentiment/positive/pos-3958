Love this place. Reminds me of home and how good bagels are. Everything comes in  a huge portion and its always delicious. They have a great selection of break fast and lunch items to choose from so no issues here with variety. 

My favorite things here are the huge sandwiches and the home made desserts. Their fries are good too and I'm not even a fry person.  They have home made should everyday as well as gravy which I get sometimes.  Also the Challah French toast is thick and awesome if that's your thing. Make sure you get fruit on it because it doesn't cone with it. 

For their desserts you cannot miss the home made cheese cake our tiramisu. Seriously too die for. I come here maybe once a month but I'd come  more often if it was closer to where I am all the time. This place is a must try.
