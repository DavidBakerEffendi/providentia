This place is so cute and chic inside. Love the decors from the entrance up to the inside. Some tables have marble table tops (which I love). Our server greeted us as soon as we got in. He offered many wine selections and was very knowledgeable with the menu. He made great recommendations and informed us about the $1 oyster special of the day. Also, if you check in with yelp.. you'll get a free glass of wine (you're welcome).  
Came here because of the 50% off all pasta during the month of November. 

What I ordered: 
Krab lemon pasta (it was delicious!)  
Lots of oysters! ($1 on tuesdays) 
Pinot Grigio (free w/ check in) 

The lemon pasta was so good and filling. It had just the right hint of lemon and cream taste to it. Light and yet satisfying. I highly recommend it. 
Oysters tasted so fresh, I just wanted to keep eating more of it hehe
Overall, our experience was great. Our server was so attentive and our water was always refilled.
