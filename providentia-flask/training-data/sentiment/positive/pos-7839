Lunch here again~
    The steak salad, really really wonderful! I hate the word Excellent, but that word does describe it.
     Flavorful medium cooked steak served warm with chilled lightly dressed greens quite a good combination.
     Perfect for lunch not to heavy add an Arnold Palmer = wonderful  luncheon 
     Never have been disappointed when dining at Honey Salt, and neither will you!
