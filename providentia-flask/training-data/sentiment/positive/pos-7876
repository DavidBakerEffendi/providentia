Took the wife here to try it out. I had past experiences with other claim jumper locations in the past, where the food was really good.
 Service was very proffessional, and food was really great. Not many customers, which was also pretty good too. The only drawback was the bums in the parking lot as you get into youre car to leave. 
Overall I would probably be returning as a regular.
