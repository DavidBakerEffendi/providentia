GO PACK GO!!!!!
I can't believe we have a Packers bar in Phoenix Arizona!!!
We love it!!!!!
Food is a wide mix of variety...from Hot Wings to Greek Gyros...its got it all!
Love the memorabilia here!! Great food, fun times and it's actually quite large with 3 different sitting areas and a off betting area with pool tables and darts!!
Fun place to visit if you are a Packers fan!!
