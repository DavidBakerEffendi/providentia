Charming French restaurant located next to the lake at Lake Las Vegas.  
The portions are quite large so easy does it on the ordering. The presentation is unique and loved the goat cheese and beet salad. 

My biggest compliment to Bernard's has to be for their service. They were incredibly patient has me a 3 friends occupied a table for just about 7 hours. We showed up for lunch, drank 8 bottles of wine and stayed for dinner. That's got to tell you something! 

I'm even having them cater a work event we are holding out at the lake in a few weeks too.
