My friend who recommended this place was my guest for Dinner.  Being a Friday we went with two Fish Plate. I choose Sea Bass (great flavor and texture) he his the Salmon.  I got to taste that as well. Very Good service from Theresa was on Point and the prices are reasonable for the quality of food you get. 

Tip.    Table side Guacamole
