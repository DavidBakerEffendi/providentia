Had the Green chicken curry and the chicken and shrimp pad thai and asked them to make it as spicy as they could. They did not disappoint! Soooo good! Chicken is all white meat and cooked perfectly and the flavours and veggies complemented each other. One of my new favourite thai restaurants in the village! Will come again!
