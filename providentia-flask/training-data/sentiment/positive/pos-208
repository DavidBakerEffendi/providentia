We went here the other night to celebrate my hubby's birthday. We started with Happy Hour where the appetizers were just half price from 5pm to 7pm nightly. The shrimp cocktail is fabulous. 
Our reservation was for 6pm and we went into the dining room. There we were greeted by Fabio who came highly recommend to us from someone at Southwest Airlines and he really took care of us. We will return often for the Happy Hour.
Although the food and service was very good my favorite steak house in the valley is the Golden Steer. They are just over the top! It's the place that The Rat Pack frequented and it's very old school Vegas. But Anthony's is very good and served well for the occasion.
