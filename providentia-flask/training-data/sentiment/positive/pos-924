The first time that I came here was when my parents were in town. The waiter messed up the order between the craziness of my family and another family of one of my dad's golfing buddies. It was not really an inconvenience with it being a relaxed meal for us, but the waiter went out of his way to try to make it right. They bought a round of drinks, brought a couple extra sides out and a big plate of bite sized desserts. Even with a little mistake, it was a great experience. I have been back regularly since and my absolute favorite thing on the menu was the heirloom tomato and burrata salad. They made a change to the salad from burrata to buffalo mozzarella and I was honestly a little skeptical at first, but it was just as fantastic! The steaks are quality and perfectly cooked. The only thing that I have not been a fan of was the massive tots they have. I will continue to take people here and tell people about this place and that heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad!
