Wow where to start. We came on a Thursday night during the last hour of happy hour 6:00 pm. The wait was 40 minutes. I asked if the bar was open seating and they said it was. We got there and were so lucky to have gotten a spot at the bar. The bartender Juan greeted us right away. He offered chips and salsa. The other bartender Javier came by and got our drink order. The server assistant was younger and walking around the bar he asked if we needed chips and salsa. All within 10 minutes of sitting down I had three people come and greet me! I was already sold! Great service is hard to find, next we ordered appetizers that were on the happy hour menu (shrimp ceviche, and shrimp cocktail) they came fast and were delicious. They served the cocktail with saltines and the ceviche with tostada. The bean dip and salsa they serve with the chips are really good. They taste like authentic salsa. We were so impressed we wanted to try more food! We ordered the two combo plate with Chile rellenos and an enchilada with chicken and red sauce. It also was served with fideo. The fideo is a light tomato based soup served before the main entree. This one at this location is so good! The food was great and I feel like I'm really picky when it comes to Mexican food. The service, the food, the ambience. They have it all. There is a reason there was a 40 minute wait! I love it I will be returning to try their specialty the Flaming Fajitas!
