Authentic wood fired pizza and Italian food! The restaurant is somewhat unassuming, dark, not a lot of photos of sun bleached plazas or gondolas on the walls. The hours were odd, we had to wait as they close from 3pm-5pm. There is a small patio on the street. The background music was pretty good rock n roll but personally I prefer ethnic music- at least Dean Martin crooning Vallar√©. We ordered an appetizer, mussels and calamari, cooked perfectly in (I think) white wine with a touch of marinara. The mussels were plump but light and the calamari was not rubbery. We ordered American beer- Budweiser, sorry, should have gotten a proper red wine, they have an excellent wine list, several Italian beirs, not a full bar but some mixed drinks available. The pizza was amazing! Prosciutto with mozzarella, marinara, red peppers and a shaved hard white cheese- not Parmesan. Wood fired pizza is the best! The crust is perfect! The ingredients are cooked as they should be. We ordered Zeppo for desert which was deep fried pizza dough in powdered sugar. Pizza dough has a lot of gluten- perfect for pizza- not zeppo! One should use cake flour- less gluten, lighter. This is a downtown Glendale gem! Enjoy
