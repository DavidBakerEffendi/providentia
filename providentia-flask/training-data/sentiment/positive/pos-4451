What can I say that hasn't already been said? They hot dogs are incredible and the toppings are top-notch (pun intended). I had the all beef dog with chunky peanut butter, Saracha and applewood smoked bacon. It was awesome. I also had the vegan sausage with Jamaican Jerk Mustard sauce, Cramini mushrooms and saut√©ed onions. It was just as excellent. The atmosphere is laid back and has a dive bar feel to it, especially when there's a live band playing. All in all, it's a great time and I highly recommend it.
