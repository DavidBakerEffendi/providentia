Took a friend here for brunch to kill time before dropping her off to work and we received the best Customer Service from Aaron. He seated us with a genuine smile like all servers from most places. When he came back to take our orders we weren't really looking at the menu cuz instead we were just talking. Aaron just said politely that he'll come back when we are. So when we were finally ready to order, I ordered the sticky bun pancakes which were delicious! I didn't know it had pecans tho haha it's fine. Also I was just joking when I asked if they had rice to substitute my hashbrown. I wasn't really joking. Aaron says we have rice and nothing wrong with that (I think he only said that to make me feel better). My friend Nikki's order came with 2 drinks - a drink of ur choice and a coffee. I asked if he can make the coffee like a frappacino and he was more than willing to do that for me. To be honest I think we were giving Aaron a hard time but not intentionally sorry Aaron! He continued to smile everytime we called for him. I tipped him $10 and told him to take a selfie with us...of course!! Hands down we need more people like Aaron!!
