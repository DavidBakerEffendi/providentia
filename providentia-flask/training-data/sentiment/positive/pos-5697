On a whim on Saturday evening, my husband and I decided to try our luck at getting a table at Pizzeria Bianco. We didn't have reservations, we just walked in on a Saturday night at dinner time. We didn't think we would really be able to be sat without a very long wait. We were originally told a 20 minute wait, but then the host said that if we wanted to, we could just sit at the bar, as it is full service, so we did that. We couldn't believe that we were sat right away! 
The female bartender that was taking care of us was absolutely wonderful. She was being bombarded with drink orders from the servers and patrons at the bar, but never seemed stressed at all, and checked on us at frequent intervals. 
Our pizzas were dropped off by the same guy that was at the host stand when we walked in, and he asked if we needed anything else, and within one minute, he brought us back the condiments we asked for, as well as a plate of bread and olive oil. The place was absolutely packed and crazy, but all of the staff maintained friendly attitudes and were very quick with everything. 
Of course, our food and drinks were excellent, and we left stuffed!
I'm sure this review will get buried under the hundreds of other reviews for Pizzeria Bianco, but I was just so incredibly pleased with the level of service that I received this past weekend and I wanted to pass along the compliment!
