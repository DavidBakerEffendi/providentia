I love this place. Our server was kind, quick, and friendly. Helpful with questions and made sure we were happy but not annoying. The food is without a doubt delicious. I am a vegetarian and you have options after options here of all flavorful delicious food. My boyfriend and son get the pita wraps and love them. My boyfriend has to stay gluten free and there are many options for him to eat as well as dessert! That never happens. We will be back per the usual we had a great night here at pita...
