Well if i ever moved to Vegas this would definitely be my go to store.....especially this location....because some of the other locations are not that great and don't have the selection this one does. Fry's Food Stores are the equivalent in AZ so they have exactly the same deals and quality products and that is why Smith's would be my grocery store of choice here in Vegas. One huge issue with grocery stores is that the don't always have or never seem to have those few particular items you really want. A couple of those examples are Sweet Chili Doritos (yes they are the only VEGAN Doritos that exist) and Grape Crush (because who doesn't like Grape Crush). Well we found both at this Smith's location and we were extremely excited. Now don't get me wrong we don't eat this kind of Junk Food often....even though it is VEGAN....but we would like to purchase these items from time to time but NO ONE ever has them. Smith's like Fry's also has Kale (Organic at that) for 98 cents a pound EVERYDAY.....no other store ANYWHERE can make that claim. Smith's Like Fry's also has the "FRIDAY FREE ITEM" and who doesn't like something for free? They are the only grocery store that has this promotion and  it has been in existence for YEARS now. 

I could go on and on.....but you get my drift.....you could shop at other grocery stores.....but why? Pay Smith's a visit and I promise you won't regret it.....Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!
