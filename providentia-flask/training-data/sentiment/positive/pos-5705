I was taken by surprise when I first found this place a few months ago and now I stop by at least once a week! The ladies working there are so sweet and they remember me and what I like. 

The fresh pita bread is so delicious with the hummus and the beef kebab is one of my favorites.  If Im not looking for a meal I usually stop by to get some fresh pita bread packets, mint lemonade and walnut kanaffe. You will not regret it! 

They've definitely gained a loyal customer!
