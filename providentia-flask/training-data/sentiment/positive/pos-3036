I LOVE it here! This place blew my taste buds away!

I came here with the Supper Club and I would say there were about 10 of us and the service was fantastic! They gave us 2 waiters for the entire time we were there. Also, the woman who works the front of the house (I'm assuming she is the co-owner) was awesome! She came to our table every time we had a new course come out making sure everything was on point. One of the guests at my table ordered the Blue Cheese Molten Encrusted Beef Tenderloin and it came out way over-cooked and he wasn't going to complain but the Manager was over at our table right away when she noticed he did not seem happy and had them fire up a new one right away. That is excellent Management and Customer Service in my opinion!

The other fantastic part of my fantastic experience besides the amazing food was that they let us have happy hour at what I would call the "communal table" that sits next to the bar. Usually you only can have happy hour at the bar so I found this to be a wonderful gesture!

Now to the food...the awesome taste bud explosion! Our table mostly focused on trying all of the appetizers or what they call on their menu "this" and "that". We ordered 2 of the 3 navajo fry breads (this is a must order item), calamari, mussels, cast iron cornbread, pizettes and the special of the night for apps included a duck dish of some sort (I just remember it being to die for) a butternut squash pierogi (I think there were 4 orders of those at our table) and I saw a few salads and a few entrees. All the specials of the night we were there sounded so amazing! I have not been to a restaurant in a long time in which I wanted to order ALL the specials!!

Shout out to Chef Romano for his incredible flavors and for making Sarita a neighborhood place that I want to keep coming back to and try everything on the menu!
