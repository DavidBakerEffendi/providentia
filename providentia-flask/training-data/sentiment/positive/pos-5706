Absolutely amazing! I found this place a while back while working up in the area. I was super excited to find out it was featured on triple D. I tell EVERYONE about this place. The food is awesome! They have a bunch of cool little trinkets to shop through while you wait. They have a car wash, I've never used it but it's nice to have all these amenities in one spot. One of the coolest things I just found out is that they have RACING FUEL at the palms. 95 and 100 octane!!!! they just redid the restaurant portion so there's way more room to handle the crazy crowds that this place brings my favorite is the full stack and the pig grits. Good luck!
