Greenland market!

One of the few familiar grocery stores I see in Las Vegas.
This Greenland Market is alot bigger, more well maintained, and at least have fresh items - unlike most other asian grocers.

Bought most of my korean snacks here, and they have everything from fruits/veggies, meats, seafood, hair dye, and home goods like rice cookers! (Just in case anyone needs a rice cooker)

They have a bakery right outside the registers, and a small food court. The outside is a row full of eateries! Will def come back for all my asian foods.
