First time I've had ramen noodles other than what I make at home--a fancy version out of shin ramyun package that I buy at Asiana market. I always put egg and green onion! Was a pleasant surprise to taste these noodles. They were delicious! I added medium spice, which was perfect. No runny nose or watery eyes. Chicken gyoza was perfectly fried and the dipping sauce was not too salty. Great service and a small, friendly atmosphere. Space is limited, so I'm not sure how dinner is, as I was there during lunch with no wait, but it was almost full. I told my mom that it was both a good and bad thing that I found this place; good that I loved it, bad that it makes me want to cheat on my low carb diet haha. Definitely try it if you are craving a gourmet ramen bowl!!!
