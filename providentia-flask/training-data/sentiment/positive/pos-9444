This place was amazing! I have no idea what they put in their bread that tasted like jalape√±o but, as a foodie myself the food overall and AMAZING SERVICE and conversation from Tai, made our short visit all worthwhile!  I had forgotten about this place but was happily reminded of why I loved it before! I will be back!
