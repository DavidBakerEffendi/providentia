Love this spot!!!!! the twice cooked pork belly is amazing as well as the hunan fried rice, green beans and the stir fried lamb. The staff does not speak much english but they are very nice and understand everything. Also the Chef/Owner comes out and talks to the tables and checks up on everything, Again, his english is def a 2nd language but you can tell these people really care about their guests and appreciate your business. I try to go here at least once every couple weeks :)
