This is hands down my favorite restaurant on the face of the planet (and I eat out 5 days a week). I used to live in Montreal and whenever I go home for a visit, I try and eat it daily. It's that good! I never get sick of the chicken gyro platter, it's out of this world. The food is consistently good, the service is always quick and friendly and delivery is also quick. The prices are beyond reasonable and the food is fantastic... I recommend this place to every person I meet. Marathon, Souvlaki George and other Montreal eateries, don't even compare to Estiatorio Yiasou! You will not be disappointed!
