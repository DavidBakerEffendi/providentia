$7 chicken Pho is a good price in Scottsdale!  The Pho was delicious and I am a bit of a Pho snob as I eat it every week.  They even added Bok Choy to my chicken pho for 75 cents more and it was excellent.  Good service and atmosphere.  Family run business....mom and dad at the counter and looks like a daughter waiting tables.  Very friendly...definitely going back here next week!
