This was a hidden find after our trip in newmarket! The owners really went BEYOND laying out our utensils and meticulously preparing our food. I have never seen such Michelin star perfectionism! The daily specials were jaw dropping good deal! Don't let that scare turn you away!

The fish was coated lightly and fried well and the fries were done right. Anyone living or happening nearby should give this unpretentious neighborhood place a chance. I know I might have turned my nose up and walked away by hiding at the exterior but I do not regret giving this shop a try! I'll be back with my dad at some point!
