This place, without a doubt, offers the best and biggest slices in the Valley. Delicious pizza, chicken wings even better than those at chicken wing places (GET THEM WITH JOE'S SAUCE) and home made salads, too.

We've been to all three of their locations, including the newest one in Ahwatukee (unbelievable Coke machine!!) and always look forward to going back again.
