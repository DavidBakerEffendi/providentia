Don't let the location of this restaurant fool you! I have been to Golden Thai Kitchen numerous times and they always seem to impress me. The waitress is extremely friendly, and the food doesn't take long to get out to your table. 

I had the Green Curry w/shrimp, and it is hands down one of the best ,if not the best that I have had. The size of the dish isn't too big, but just enough to fill you up. I also had the Thai tea which was great as well. 

Don't judge a book by its cover. TRY THIS PLACE!
