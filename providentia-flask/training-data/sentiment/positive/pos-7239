After seeing this place being instagrammed so many times, it's been on my devour list.  The one I always hear about is the one in LA but I made enough time to go visit so when I heard about there being one in Las Vegas, I had to try it out!

The shop is on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, near where Milk is.  There isn't much seating, so you might have to stand and eat or sit somewhere nearby. 

The most popular items are the Fairfax and the Slut. I decided to get the sausage egg and cheese one with added avocado because I didn't feel like getting scrambled eggs. 
The brioche bun was arguably the best part of the sandwich. It was toasted or pan-fried and is slight crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The other best part was the sausage! It's a little different from the ones I have had at other breakfast places. It has plenty of flavor and grease (which is great for the morning after a night out!)
I can't wait to go again and try out other items!
