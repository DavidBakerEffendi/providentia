Just discovered this place even existed. I was a little hesitant to try it but I'm glad I did. The service was fast and the Greek salad was delicious. I added chicken and it was the perfect portion and real. I'm always skeptical about fast food salads because of the fake over processed chicken. I'm glad this place offers the real thing!
