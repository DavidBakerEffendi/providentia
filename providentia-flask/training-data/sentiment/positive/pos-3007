How much fun is this place! They have beer taps at the table! Totally awesome. It weird reading others reviews about a country bar being here, like no ones heard of country?  Its not that unusual. It not like they opened an opera bar or something.  Im not a huge country music fan, but i do enjoy some, and i had a blast here.

 You must order the chicken wings! !!!!!!!! Holy smokes, these are good. Not the traditional small party wings like most places, but the big ones. You know, like the size of real chickens. Anyway, their twist on buffalo sauce was amazing. Not to spicy at all and full of flavor, almost a hint of a tomato base. Absolutely delicious. 

 The beer on tap is awesome,  you serve yourself. Genius! They charge by the oz. And you never wait for a refill or have to wait for a waitress.  I've never seen this before and think its extremely brilliant. Wait staff is awesome and the service was great, even on a packed Friday night
