First time here and mostly definitely not our last. We had the grilled squid. Actually we had 3 of them!!  The dish is delicious!!  We also had the shrimp tempura roll, Vegas roll, tsunami roll, salmon nigiri, and spicy tuna hand rolls. All were fresh and so yummy. We tried the Thai chicken fried rice. Also tasty.   We finished with a Hawaiian bread pudding which was warm sweet and a great way to end our great meal. Service was super friendly and the place is chic and contemporary.
