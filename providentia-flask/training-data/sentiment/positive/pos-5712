Friendly and funny bar staff! Really comfortable atmosphere and seating. Interesting variety of beer on tap that is familiar enough to not be weird tasting and different enough to not just be "Molson/Budweiser" ! They take the idea of "pub grub" and class it up so that you could bring a date and not feel like a cheap skate and you could still come with your buddies and have a comfortably good time!
