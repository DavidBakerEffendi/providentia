When coming to Vegas, especially in big groups we always stay in the Venetian. For the $$, it's the best bang for your buck for a nice big room. 

The room comfortable sleeps 5-6 as there are two full size beds with a full pull out couch. The rooms are huge at a whopping 700+ square feet. We had four in our room and it came out to about $850 for 4 nights after resort fees.

There are 3 TVs, one in the living room area, one in front of the two beds and a small one in the bathroom. The bathroom has two sinks, a separate tub and stall, and a private room for the toilet. 

The hotel gym is nicer than the 24 hour fitness that I go to. It includes a rock climbing wall which is $25 if you want to use it. There's a spa which is $300 for 80 minutes. 

The pool is pretty average, there's two main pools and a shallow 1 ft pool. There's also the private area for Tao Beach club that costs money. 

We didn't venture over to the Palazzo area, but I believe the two pools areas are connected. 

We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back again.
