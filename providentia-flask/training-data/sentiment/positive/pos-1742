Even though we live within walking distance of several great coffee houses we have been consistently thrilled with the service and coffee at Urban Bean.

I have been ordering from the menu and the made fresh egg dishes have all come out fluffy and done to perfection. An extensive list of "add in" vegetables means never really ordering the same thing twice! They have yet to decline my request for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes that  normally come with this selection.

The cold brew, which I always order, is always smooth and clean. Never over boiled or burnt, never bitter.

There are receptacles and power strips available for charging computers etc. A nice atmosphere with different seating options and music that charms without being intrusive.

Service is always solicitous and at the same time friendly, genuine and warm.
