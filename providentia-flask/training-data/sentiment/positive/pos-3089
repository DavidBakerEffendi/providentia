I love Lula Lounge! It's a
Great place for beginner salsa dancers to go and take someone for a spin! Not sure if they have the $55 special still! 3
Course meal with salsa lesson and live band on Saturday nights only! It's so old school the decor and I love the mismatched tables and chairs... so fun! The food is excellent! But you must book in advance your reservation! This place is busy! If your a light eater I'd suggest having dinner early!
