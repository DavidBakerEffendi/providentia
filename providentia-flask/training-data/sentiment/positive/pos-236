We went on a Thursday night since it's a restaurant we drive by all the time.  The interior is cute with a large chandelier in the middle and tables with comfy chairs all around.  A bar is on the other side of the restaurant and there were two big screen tvs.

The host greeted us and let us choose our table.  He was very attentive to us and a few other groups he was waiting on.

We got our menus and glasses of ice water and perused our menus.  We ordered a few appetizers; Parmesan Truffle fries and the Crispy Gnochhi.  My boyfriend ordered the Jambalaya and I ordered the braised short ribs.

The appetizers were yummy.  The gnocchi was really flavorful and the fries were crisp and topped with tons of Parmesan.

My boyfriend liked his Jambalaya, but it was a little salty.  My braised ribs were so tender the meat fell off the bones.  And the sauce was fantastic!

The food and service was excellent.  The best part is they are located not far from our house, so we will definitely go again!
