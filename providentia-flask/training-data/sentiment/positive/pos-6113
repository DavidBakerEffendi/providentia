Love this neighborhood restaurant. Perfect place to chill and try new wines. They just celebrated their one year anniversary. Food is delicious and has a good Wine selection. Desserts are fresh and fabulous. Great place for a date night or with other couples. Good idea to make a reservation. It's a small but cozy place. They have wine events monthly. The owners are very knowledgeable and attentive. I highly recommend Boteco !
