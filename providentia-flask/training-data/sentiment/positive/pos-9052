This restaurant has a love/hate relationship with its yelpers....wasn't sure what to expect....so we headed over with our Groupon in hand and....I loved it! 

It's located in City North....a quiet ghost town/pseudo city scape, dotted with a handful of trendy bars and interesting restaurants...

When you walk into Modern Margarita, you feel like you're walking right into the patio. There isn't a bad seat in the house. Huge double sided bar is about 40% of the seating, then a few tables inside and the rest outside. 

Great atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon, beautiful weather to be sitting outside...music wasn't loud at all...opposed to what I have read elsewhere, may have been time of day. 

Service wasn't outstanding, but it was consistent and pretty good. 

Started off with a Sonora Margarita...pretty strong, and my husband had a pomegranate cosmo, which I liked better...very refreshing.

We ordered the salsa trio and chips, free refills :) and an order of guac, which was yum! I really liked the green salsa and fresh pico de gallo...wasn't thrilled with the red salsa, had a lot of cumin, which I'm not a fan of. 

For lunch I had the steak street tacos on flour tortillas which I really liked. Well marinated and tender steak with slices of avocado. Came with three street tacos which was plenty. 

My husband had the chili burger with cheese and garlic fries. He said it was really good, and the beef was very tasty. He especially enjoyed the garlic fries.

The prices weren't that bad. I thought for the nice relaxed atmosphere, good food and service, the prices were spot on. The serving sizes aren't huge, but they are definitely sufficient to fill you up.

I enjoyed my lunch, really liked the atmosphere....next time we might try sitting at the bar for a different experience. Nice place, we'll be back!
