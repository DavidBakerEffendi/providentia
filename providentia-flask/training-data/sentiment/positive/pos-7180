The reason you spend $ here is because it's just that good. Service is excellent! The food melts in your mouth and is totally worth the wait to get to your table! Oh and I bet you didn't know this.... they order that bread from a special bakery that only makes it for them! My husband and I first discovered this place about 5 years ago and always go here for our anniversary and special occasions. 

I always order the lobster tails roasted with the loaded mashed potatoes. The salads are very fresh. My husband loves the crab cakes with their spicy sauce (I think it's jalapeno) drizzled on top. If you get a mixed drink from the bar they don't skimp on the liqueur and water it down with ice like some places. Quality = Micky and Mooch!

We usually sit in a booth near the bar but have also gotten a booth in the dining room and a table in the room with the lake view. Lisa mentioned it's a great ambiance and I could not agree more! A perfect meal and a great place to enjoy a romantic evening with a loved one.
