I've been to Hogtown a few times, most recently for Saturday brunch with 2 friends. It's conveniently located a couple blocks east of Dufferin Station.

We got the 5 pc wings in BBQ sauce ($9), they taste like boneless chicken tenders *drool*. The Fried French Toast Sliders ($12) were 2 mini french toast sandwiches stacked high with PB, banana, and tofu bacon - very good. The un-Chicken and Waffles ($14) never fails to disappoint and is my go-to for brunch there - but beware: order this with a size of homefries and you will have a HUGE portion on your hands. The Tofu Rancheros ($13) is also a generous portion if you want a more colourful/healthy option for brunch. All the mains we ordered came with a side of homefries or chef salad. 

Service is super friendly and the interior is cozy. Prepare to wait a bit for a table if you come during a rush hour period - it's worth it. And if you're like me and aren't a huge fan of dressing, you might want to order it on the side because they are heavy handed with dressing on their chef salad.

Definitely come here if you want a huge choice of vegan comfort food options and generous portions - this place never fails to impress.
