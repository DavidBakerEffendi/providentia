Wonderful place! Especially for someone with food allergies. They have a book with what ingredients are in what food item like a crust, sauce, etc. The gluten free pizza is also soy free, but they do have a strict allergy menu as well. They make their own ranch dressing in house which is incredible. I love this place because of the choices that fit in with my diet and also the staff are extremely friendly as well.
