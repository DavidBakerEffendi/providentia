Great Place that is hidden in a busy strip mall area. Cute quiet cafe inside with a few chairs and a table outside.

Celiac review: They carry monin syrups and the very nice barista had no problem making my drink directly in the cup skipping any cross-contamination issues. Nima tested safe for a large iced vanilla latte.
