So.friggin.delicious. 
Mark was our chef and I can't speak highly enough of him. We ordered the lobster grilled cheese sandwich and the ciopinno and they were both SO good! You can get the ciopinno spicy, with white sauce (it's served in a nice red sauce), or a combo of red & white. You can't go wrong.

Seriously the best shrimp we've ever had on the seafood platter appetizer. Huge, thick and meaty (just the way us girls like 'em!). 

Mark served us a sample of the clam chowder and it's the best I've ever had. Can't wait for a big bowl of that next time. Winter is upon us y'all! I need good soup!

We will definitely be back.
