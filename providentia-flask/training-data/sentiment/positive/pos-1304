Izakaya, the traditional Japanese tapas concept, explodes with bona-fide flavour at this charming pub. Fans gather for after-work delight in the form of such sweet small dishes as black cod and noodles,  fried brie, all of it washed down with deep swallows of sake and Sapporo beer. Guests share bench-style seating and an appreciation for the authenticity of the place. 
Went for dinner and had the noodle soup. The food was amazing. Fantastic taste, great service, cool and modern atmosphere. Would highly recommend. 
Beautiful flavors, fresh ingredients, lots of variety, including some good vegetarian options. Good atmosphere. Excellent place overall.
