Reviews for Origin India are all over the map -- from gut-busting to orgasmic. I suppose consistency is important, but the restaurant is only 2 years old, and they've gone through a number of adjustments which may account for the fluctuations in quality. All I can speak to is what I ate, which was superb -- the best Indian I've had in Las Vegas, everything tasted fresh and not too heavy, like some Indian food. I suppose it helps that I was dining with one of the owners, who talked to me about the idea behind the restaurant: to mimic the Indian restaurants in England (2 of which they own) and use fresh, high-quality organic ingredients. She'd kinda hyped it up so much that I was dubious until the food came and spoke for itself. 

We had some mussels seasoned with Indian spices and coconut milk. I don't usually like mussels, but these were delectable. Everything else surpassed expectations. Naan was piping hot, doughy, and fresh out of the oven. Chicken makhani, the crowd favorite, pleased my palate like a good Indian curry should. The garlic shrimp curry, fish kabob, and lamb curry were equally fantastic. Kinda expensive, but helps when you're not paying! Also very dark inside, but who needs to see when the food is so kick ass?
