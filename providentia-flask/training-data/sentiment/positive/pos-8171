This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations.   The baristas are always sweet and friendly.  And patient.  Twice I've come in wanting to try something new, and they have recommended new drinks for me to try.  One, I didn't care for and they tossed it for me and made me my normal frappuccino that I love for free.
