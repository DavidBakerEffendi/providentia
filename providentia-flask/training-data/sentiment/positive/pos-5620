Starbucks coffee is historically my go to place when I need a bit of energy. This particular location is fast, friendly and makes it enjoyable to either enjoy in or take your beverage away. 

Only draw back is the parking. It's absolutely a destination for a walk or you will loose the battle to the parking ticket agents.
