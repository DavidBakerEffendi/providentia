I've been visiting Putter's for over seven years now and the service has always been excellent!  

They have great food which is always served in a timely manner and the bartenders always take care of you.  

You can shoot pool, play darts, or play those video golf and that new video dart game.  

Want to relax?  I visit with my friends from the Hawaiian Golf group every week and they have been coming into this location for almost 10 years!

Highly recommended and I'll see you there!
