There is no place like Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs in Las Vegas!!!!!
When it comes to hot dogs, these guys bring serious competition to the valley.

They serve quarter pound all beef hot dogs with Asian flare!! 
Homemade kimchi is used as toppings among other unique condiments to enhance the flavor of the food. The Bulgogi they use was marinated to perfection, it was slightly sweet, salty (from the soy sauce), and savory.

The hot dogs are unbelievably delicious, just by looking at the pictures it makes my mouth water.

My favorite hot dogs that stood out was the "Sante Fe Dog", "Angry Kimchi Dog w/Sriracha Sauce" and "Banh Mi Dog". 

This place is definitely worth the checking out, I highly recommend it!
