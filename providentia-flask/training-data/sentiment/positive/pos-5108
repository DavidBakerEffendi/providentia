I love their potstickers - the thin kind.  We've tried a lot of dishes from BW and have not been disappointed.  Chicken Lo Mein noodles are tasty. The broccoli and garlic sauce is spicy and will wake you up.  Cashew Chicken is a frequent choice.

Lots of seating if you want to dine-in and well worth the effort to drive over here for take-out.
