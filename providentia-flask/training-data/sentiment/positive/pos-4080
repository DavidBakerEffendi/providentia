This place is always the late night go to spot after any event, party, concert, anything...
The food is good the cocktails are good.
Old school fun stuff. 
This is also where you take a date when you're just trying to chill, makeout, and chat. (Lol)
The food is good and  he drinks are awesome. Also everything is reasonably priced. 
Like I said, it's a local hotspot for when you're ending the night. (And sobering up before going home) 
Parking is awesome because they have a massive lot. 
The place is split between the restaurant and the lounge the lounge has that fire pit that's also pretty cool, if you can snag a spot there you'll get the full peppermill experience. Haha. 

I highly recommend.
