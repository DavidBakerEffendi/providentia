This review is based solely on food quality/taste, menu and pricing as I have only had take-out.  The prior restaurant was not very good, also Indian, so I was very hesitant to try Curry Bowl.  However, that turned out to be a huge mistake because the food taste was exceptional!  I had chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo with garlic naan and basmati rice.  The portions were good and the flavor was fantastic (ordered both dishes hot).  The menu was extensive and prices were very reasonable.  They also have a lunch buffet that will be updated in this review as well.
