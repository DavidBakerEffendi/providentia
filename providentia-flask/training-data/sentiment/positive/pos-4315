I don't know if anyone has been to the new Market Square restaurant named Bluebird Kitchen, but it is a lovely addition to Market Square.  Previously, if you wanted something other than a donut, bagel or Egg McMuffin, you were pretty hard pressed to find something else.  However, with the opening of the Bluebird Kitchen you will be able to find much more than those breakfast staples.   

Recently, I had the opportunity to indulge my southern hankerings for an old fashioned breakfast of grits and eggs.  Boy oh boy, were they delicious!  The stone ground grits were creamy and had flecks of cheddar cheese mixed into the grits along with little nuggets of bacon.  Topped by sunny-side up eggs, this was a breakfast took me back to Columbia, SC where my mother was born.

On another visit, the pastrami cured salmon on a toasted bagel made me believe that beef pastrami may be eliminated as my favorite type of pastrami.  With the addition of cucumber and oven dried tomato, this let me know that this restaurant gets all of the little details right.

You also want to try this restaurant for lunch where the house roast turkey sandwich with bacon jam, that's right bacon jam, is smack your mama good!
