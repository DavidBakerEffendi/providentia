Easily a 5/5. The renovation made this place perfect. The food is consistent, and much higher quality than other Indian spots in Scottsdale/Phoenix. Service has always been excellent, Gabe (I believe that's his name) at the bar is very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.

Tikka masala is really good, saag is also great. 

Highly recommend any of the chai/tea/lassi's as well.
