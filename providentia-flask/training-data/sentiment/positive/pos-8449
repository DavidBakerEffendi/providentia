Love! Always have a great time! They start out by giving you free chips and salsa which is fresh. Their house Margarita is one of the best I've had (I take it on the rocks with no salt.)  I always try to get the chorizo queso. It's an awesome white cheese dip with chorizo sausage in it. The mix of spicy sausage in the cheese with a salty chip is amazing! My husband is a huge fan of the shrimp fajitas. He gets them everytime! The shrimp is always perfectly cooked and the toppings are fresh! I enjoy the quesadilla. Either beef or chicken it doesn't matter both are delicious.  The beef is not ground beef it's almost like a beef roast. Very tender and juicy with an awesome flavor. I've had many different items I  their menu and to be perfectly honest, I have yet to be disappointed.  If there is ever an issue with the food, tell them. They are all very nice and have no problem fixing a mistake. All the of staff work well together and stay very busy! We are regulars here and looks like we will be for a long time! Sum up- authentic Mexican dishes that always please and a wonderful staff who take pride in their jobs!
