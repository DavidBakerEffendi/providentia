Great place!!! Have tried the Vermonter, Chicken Coop, Italian Stallion and the french onion soup. OMG! Fabulous! Meat piled sky high, fresh breads, great condiments, awesome combinations. Good cookies too. Haven't tried salads yet but if they're made anything like the sandwiches, yummy yummy in the tummy! Try it, you'll like it! 

Try the lemonade! Fresh squeezed and oooohhhh so addictive. If you've never tried an Arnold Palmer (fresh squeezed lemonade and fresh brewed ice tea together), please try it. The best ever tasted. If I could have a bottomless glass or buy it by the gallon, I would. 

Have known one of the owners for 5+ years, funny guy that Toby. What a personality. Met Jodi, other owner, she seems like a great gal. 

Best of luck to them both on this venture and hope the future is bright!
