Had a business lunch at high noon. Made a reservation but probably didn't need to. It was busy but not packed. Service was exceptional. Plenty of non seafood options on the menu but went with the crab cake BLT sandwich as did my guest. It was awesome. The crab cake stayed together nicely when you chomped into it. The bacon the sandwich was a good smokey addition. The BLT comes with a side apple salad which also has a little bacon it which made the salad. Perfect size for lunch. Hope to come back for dinner and try more.
