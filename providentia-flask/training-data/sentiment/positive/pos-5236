I got the whiskey burger with grilled broccolini and an Alaskan ale! The server Michelle was fantastic and very helpful. She even came by to make sure I liked my beer that she recommended for me! You get carded coming in so make sure you have your id. There's tv's everywhere which are all hd and the sound is booming!
