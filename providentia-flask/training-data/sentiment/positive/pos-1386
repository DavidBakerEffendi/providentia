Of all the Vegas hotel buffets I have had this is the best... As my friend once said this is the epitome of high end gluttony. At about $40 dollars it's not cheap but if u were going to go out to eat at a restaurant in Vegas you would spend twice that.

Staff is always awesome quick to refill your drinks.  Food is amazing like a high end restaurant... Definitely feels like a place where the cost of the food you eat could be more than the amount u pay.

Deserts for daaaayyyyys... I have at least one of every one. 

If nothing else you will eat enough so you don't have to eat again...

Never heard anyone not like this place... If ur in Vegas u should give it a try
