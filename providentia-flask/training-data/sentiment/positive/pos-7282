This was my third time coming here. The first time was nothing out of the ordinary. Second time was bad on all levels but since there was an event taking place, everyone might've been overwhelmed which is understandable.
The third time truly great. Service was fantastic, all servers, cashiers were smiling and handling everything in a timely fashion.
I met with Michael the GM and we chatted for a bit about the business and how the services are performed. He mentioned I order the "Chopped Brisket" since it wasn't on the menu. I'm glad he did cause it was the best brisket I've had in years. Strongly recommend everyone to order it with a side of sweet frys.

While eating Kara my gf had her car detailed.
When the detail was finished the car looked fantastic. She kept raving about how flawless her paint and interior was. I wanted to have my Bmw washed except I was too embarrassed since I traveled a lot that thus my car being dirty. Michael covered our meal plus wash which we are truly thankful for. 

We will be coming back in the upcoming week for breakfast.
