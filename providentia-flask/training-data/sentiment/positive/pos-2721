I am several days late writing this review...but I couldn't forget.  Now, Jewel's is ridiculously close to my house, in the same shopping center as my pet store and hair stylist, and has ample parking.  So major bonus points for a super location.  And the cafe itself is comfy, cozy, relaxed.  And the weekday menu includes cheesy grits.  I repeat, cheesy grits.  Takes me back to college days and these are good.  The crumbled pancetta doesn't hurt it either :-)  They have a fun menu - some classics, some twists on classics.  Great pastries, cupcakes, etc.  And they use Cartel coffee.  And they are friendly. 

They do seem to have a different menu on weekdays vs. weekends...so be prepared to be flexible and enjoy!
