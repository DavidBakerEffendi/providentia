I'm surprised by the low ratings that Tandoori Times has received. We really enjoy coming here, and will often come for family dinners when people come into town. 

We really enjoy the Belly Dancing. The women are talented, balancing candles, swords, etc. It's something different and it's always fun when someone at our table gets up and dances too!

We also enjoy the Hookah Lounge on the Patio. The Patio is a really nice private spot. They have tons of different flavors and the staff is always helpful and attentive. 

The free Chai is also quite delicious.

I love the House Salad, the dressing is really delicious. It is a yogurt based dressing with very delicious spices. I really could eat it with a spoon, but I keep it classy and refrain.
I also order the Vegetable Biryani- it's perfectly seasoned and absolutely amazing. It is delicate, a little spicy and really shows perfect restraint. 

We love getting the Naan. My favorites are:
Garlic (Mmmm so well seasoned)
Onion
Aloo (Stuffed with potato)
Chii Naan with Cilantro and and Green Chili (Just the right amont of kick)
AND
My husband loves the Keema Naan (minced Lamb)

Dishes that are notable (so says my family):
Chicken Tikka Masala
Chicken Saag
Tandoori Fish (My discerning Father in Law called it one of the best dishes he's ever had. Many at the table agreed)
Also, I forget which but a few of the Lamb dishes are a hit (sorry not that helpful)

Tandoori Times isn't a cheap Indian joint, but we don't mind paying for the quality of food and the experience.
