Our favorite thing to do is try these hidden little places in funky little shopping plazas. You can really be surprised and find someplace amazing.

Chada Thai is just that kind of place! The thai food is really excellent! Every dish we had brought to the table was impressive, full of flavor and beautifully plated!

Definitely make reservations, it is a tiny dining room. 
But worth it.
