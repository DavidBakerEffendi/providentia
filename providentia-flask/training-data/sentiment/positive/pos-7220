This was my surprise of the week! I am not sure what I expected....no I expected deep fried stuff I cant eat because of gluten intolerance and all the food I stay away from. My Mom loves deep fried tenders so I went with her to watch her eat.

Surprise surprise, they have grilled tenders, salads, fresh lemonade, hand cut fried, zucchini to die for, and so many sauces to choose from. I really like what they have done with fast food gone healthy or you can choose some delicious fried food! Any way you go, you will win.

I know my friends will say 5 stars? It is good! The employees were all very nice! The food was great! The place was immaculate! Tasty! There were nice touches to the packaging like metal baskets, the prices are great!
