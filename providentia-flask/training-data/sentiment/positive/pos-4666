Sammy's is my new happy hour spot! 3-6 Daily with half off tapas and $2 of wines by the glass. Everything that Mike or Emily recommended was delicious! The service was engaging, fun, and welcoming. I'm going back today after making sure I write my review to go with the pics I took a couple days ago ;) thank you guys!
