I still remember the day I first fell in love with their pizza. It was January 2012 and I had just started training for my first job at the trampoline park next door. 

Since the beginning I've pretty much just ordered the Lunch Special. My order is always the same: 1 slice of cheese, 1 slice of bacon, ranch, and a drink and it comes out to about $4.50. 

I was devastated when they close. I know that may sound like I'm overreacting, but I'm serious. Anyone who knows me knows I love this place and I even had a few friends and family message me letting me know Mama Mia's had closed and when they announced the new opening as Pizza on 40th. I don't know if Pizza on 40th has a different owner, but I do know that a lot of the staff is the same. Most importantly the pizza has not changed one bit :D
