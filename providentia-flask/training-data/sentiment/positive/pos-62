This is my new favorite taco joint.  Very good food, authentic and I always leave wishing I would have ordered more!  Been here on two separate occasions now and food was great both times.  The restaurant is extremely spacious not a small hole in the wall like most other places.  Plenty of choices for drinks as well, including a pineapple, horchata or house version of fruit punch.  I literally am willing to sneak away from the office even though it's a 10 minute drive.

I've ordered shredded beef tacos, chicken tacos and the rice n' beans.  Never leaves an empty plate and it's shocking to me, because most Mexican restaurants can't get the rice right.  All homemade ingredients and what a bargain for the prices.  Definitely bookmarked for when I'm in the area or need a taco fix.
