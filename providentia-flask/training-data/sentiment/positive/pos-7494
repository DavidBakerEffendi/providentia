We held our post-wedding dinner here in June for about 25 people, and after worrying a bit because we were planning this from across the country and had never been to Battista's, they knocked it out of the park!  

It was perfect!  We had a reservation from 6-8 and because of the photos taking longer than expected, the bride and groom did not arrive until almost 7.  The wedding party hung out in the bar until then (and were having a blast I might add), and they seated us and extended our reservation with no problem.

Service was perfect, the food was great, and the night could not have been better!  We even got a few songs by the guy on the accordian, and an ovation by the entire restaurant when my bride and I walked in!

Simply great, and we will DEFINITELY return on our next trip to Vegas!

Thank you to a few of the reviewers on here who I spoke with about this place!
