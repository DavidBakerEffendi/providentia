I recently moved to the west side of town, and I went exploring for Mexican food one afternoon. My google search brought me here, and it was just as good as I'd hoped. 

For starters, Juan's replaces the mundane chips and salsa from every other restaurant with a medium salsa roja, salsa verde, and bean dip. Both salsas had an appetizing kick, but the verde was my personal favorite. 

As I wandered in around 12:30, I found their lunch specials for $9.99 chicken fajitas. Served with the typical accoutrement of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo, the fajitas were incredible! And as the name implies, they are indeed "flaming" when they finish it off at your table flamb√© style! 

Overall, this place now tops my list of Mexican eateries in the area, and located within just a few minutes of the 215, I will DEFINITELY be back again soon!
