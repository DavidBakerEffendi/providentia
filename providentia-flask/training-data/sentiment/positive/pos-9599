This is the latest Popeye to pop up in the hood.  Great timing with KFC just around the corner so one can satisfy their chicken craving no matter what they want.

I prefer Popeye's over KFC.  The chicken is always juicy yet crispy and those biscuits.  Those biscuits!!!  And a great range of sides to boot!

Just go for it when the mood strikes.  And then eat salad for 2 weeks to compensate for the gluttony....
