Kindest wait staff. Quickest service. So many vegetarian options. Awesome food. If I could give this place six stars, I would happily! 

For a table of five, we were served our food about fifteen minutes after ordering. Our waiter was the sweetest and was so incredibly attentive. My drink was hardly half gone before he was refilling it. 

I ordered the #8 (or #7?) vegetarian option, which was a mushroom and spinach quesadilla. I don't know what they put in there, but it was sinful how good this $8 dish tasted. 

Total bill for five people was $66. And my dad drank two beers! Great place for a quick, tasty meal!
