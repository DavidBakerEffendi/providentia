Man, I love Egg Works.  It's not fancy.  In fact, it's not even going for that.  It's the old flannel shirt of the Las Vegas breakfast scene.  Sometimes, that's just what you need.  There's something refreshing about a non-hipster breakfast joint that is not trying too hard.  From the country chic decor to the consistently good breakfast food and strong coffee, this place earns a regular spot in my breakfast rotation.  

I've had a number of good dishes, but my go to is the South of the Border skillet, half size, because the regular portion is humongous.  It's off menu but worth the hassle of asking for it, because it's just that good.  Chicken, potatoes, jalapenos, onions, green peppers cooked together and topped with tons of cheese and an egg any style.  With food this good, there is no need to "deconstruct" it, give it a fancy name and slap a $19 price tag on it.
