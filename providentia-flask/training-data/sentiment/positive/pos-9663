I have to give it up to this place, it really impressed.  It has a good vibe and a great atmosphere.  Wife and I met another couple for a double date and everyone was impressed.  We ordered a sampler and everyone got a bit, very good.  I ordered the meatloaf and I have to say it blew me away, so good. 

If you want a fresh experience and have some coin to drop I would recommend highly.
