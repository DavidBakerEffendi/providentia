This will be my new  fav sushi with a twist place .Nom noms for sure! nice ambiance, great food and good service. I would recommend reservation because it can be a hit and miss on the place being crowded or not. Just to be sure call in to reserve so you don't have to wait. After you eat here you'll be coming back and mark this as one of your local hang out place for chow and drink and ...........that makes you a LUCKY FOO! :) I will come back
