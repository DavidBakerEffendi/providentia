And so the battle of the best crispy duck in Las Vegas begins....

I thought Lotus of Siam was my #1 spot for spicy thai food with their never disappointing deep-fried crispy duck curry, but wait....Chada makes an equally AMAZING but not as deep-fried crispy duck pad kee mao that has this amazing flavor and is topped with fried basil. 

I can't decide which I like more, so it's a tie!

I also got the Thai iced tea (which was a little overly sweet, but still delicious), and the pork larb (which was tasty but definitely more than just "1 chili" spicy).  The number of chilis next to an item supposedly demarcates how spicy that item is...you can ask for spice level mild, medium, or hot as well. 

Ambiance was very modern and romantic. It's a small restaurant, and it's dark in here! Bring a flashlight to read the menu. They also have a huge wine selection :)

Service was efficient and friendly.
