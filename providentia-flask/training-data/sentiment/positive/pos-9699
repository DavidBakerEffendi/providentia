I was first introduced to L'Orignal earlier this year at Table of Hope, an annual fundraiser for a local charity called Share the Warmth. L'Orignal was there serving, amoungst other things, a killer chocolate dessert. I immediately grabbed their card and made a point to visit their restaurant. Ok to be honest I grabbed two more of the desserts then I grabbed their card! 

Since then I've had the opportunity to eat at L'Orignial twice and have thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The atmosphere and service is top notch. The restaurant is small and cozy and the design naturally breaks the space into a few even smaller areas so it feels even more intimate. 

As their name suggests the main thrust of L'orignal's menu is gamey, but as a person who does not eat meat (I do eat fish and seafood) I'm always able to find something scrumptious on the menu. Also, they are oyster experts, so it is a mistake not to start a meal without at least a few fresh oysters on your plate.  

And of course don't forget dessert!
