I'm a huge Sinatra fan but think anyone can truly appreciate the fountains of the Bellagio. I could sit there and watch them for hours. This is a must stop when in Las Vegas and one of the most romantic spots in my opinion. Whether it's Bocelli or Sinatra, every 15 minutes at night you'll be able to catch this spectacular show!
