Upscale and classic. The perfect place for a date or family gathering. The decor is so modern and clean. The happy hour specials are usually quite good.  I like to order the Portabello fries, Ribeye Steak, and Scallops. I have never been disappointed with their food or service. I have even taken their food as takeout and it is still just as delicious!
