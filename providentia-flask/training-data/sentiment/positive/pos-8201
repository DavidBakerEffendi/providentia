I love an Italian place that can dish out fresh pasta.. and phenomenal service! We decided to try Dolce on their famous handmade Gnocchi nights, every Tuesday night, today. And wow what a gem! Our server was amazing! I was dd, but the bf ordered a red blend for $8.5 while we munched on the awesome, complimentary cannelloni bean and bread app. I seriously could eat this bean app by itself without anything. We ordered the Serrento a little pricey at $23 as well as the 4 cheese gnocchi dish, $18, but, it is handmade every Tuesday. The food didn't take too long and I was so glad because it was awesome. The pink Alfredo had quite the bite! The shrimp in this dish was cooked to perfection. I did notice that the 4 cheese sauce was extremely Gorgonzola heavy, I could only eat a couple of gnocchi pieces at a time. The gnocchi though. woah, so fluffy and airy. I casually mentioned this to our server, and he gave us some great tips for next time. Go with a lighter sauce like pesto or tomato, gnocchi is already decadent. 

We will definitely be back for more. Everything was great!
