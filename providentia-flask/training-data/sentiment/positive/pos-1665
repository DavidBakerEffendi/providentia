They've expanded! Now double the board gaming! Double the fun! They just need to double the baristas and it'll be good to go.

Stopped by Snakes and Lattes yesterday with a few friends. We called ahead and were told it'd be an hour before we could get a table, so we did a few other things first. Always call ahead! This place is like a super fancy restaurant -- you always need reservations.

As soon as we sat down, a staff member came up and asked us what kind of game we'd like to play. Something silly! But not too silly as we only have three people... He pulled out three games for us, described them all, and walked us through the rules and first round of play after we chose our game. Most amazing service ever. This guy knows his stuff like you would not believe. And he just loves playing board games!

I didn't really look at their menu except to see that you can buy a bowl of candy here for $4. Yummy gummy candies are the perfect sugar high for hours of gaming. My friend ordered an americano and had to wait awhile as they get super busy, but the time flies by when you're having fun.

They also sell board games now! In case you need to bring the fun home.

Seriously, somebody please import this place to Vancouver? I'll come all the time!
