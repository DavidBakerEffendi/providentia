It is no secret that I love Ancora coffee. I have always visited their University Ave location, and only recently discovered that they have another shop downtown on King Street. The King Street location is much larger and sells the full range of Ancora coffees, plus alcohol (bottled local craft beers). The hours are much better there as well, and the whole place shines like a palace of coffee culture. 

Take it from a coffee connoisseur, Ancora is without a doubt, some of the finest coffee this side of Chicago (and I can't think of a better cafe in Chicago come to mention it). It's always fresh, properly strong, and wonderfully complex. Forget Intelligencia, Ancora is far fresher and better crafted. 

About me: I've roasted coffee at home for the last 7 years and own two professional espresso machines along with two pro grinders and a lot of other equipment, so it's rare that I find cafes that can prepare coffee on par with what I make at home. In fact, I've only ever found a handful that can--Ancora is one of them!
