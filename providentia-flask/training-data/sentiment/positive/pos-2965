Let's get one thing straight. I love Willy Street Co-op East like a child. A child who is older than me, feeds me, gives me good locally grown and produced products and has friendly and helpful people who work in them... Okay, this analogy is admittedly not so good. Moving on. 

Positive commentary about the original Co-op aside, going to West is a whole other level of co-opy awesome. They've got a huuuuuge selection of produce (lots more exotic, gorgeous, fresh stuff than at East). They've got more cool vegan stuff (curry lentil hummus wiggity what?) and more fermented drinks ('cuz I know you all sprint out for kombucha and kvass on the daily). They have some really nice, big freezer space and lots of samples! I went there to get lunch and basically filled up on samples alone. I mean I took just one or two, because I'm not a little kid or anything....

The hot bar area is enormous and they have loads of pre-packaged grab-and-go stuff. Oh... and did I mention...

BOOOOOZE. Beer and wine! Lots of good stuff. A+ in my book!
