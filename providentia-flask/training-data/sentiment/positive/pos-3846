As I write this I feel like I'm telling you a secret. I'm mostly afraid that it will get so popular that I won't be able to even get in. If the rest of Pittsburgh only knew about this adorable little restaurant. It is the epitome of a "hidden gem" in the North Hills. I frequently find myself wishing for the Pad See Ew, which was amazing. I'm looking forward to trying everything on the menu, but the memory of the Pad See Ew will probably drive me to order it every time. It's that good. My husband got a vegetable curry, and I was impressed by it, but I was so busy scarfing down the Pad See Ew that I didn't even care how good his was.
