I'm usually not big on thin crust pizza but Geno's is so tasty! And the prices can't be beat! 

I odered a slice with only cheese and somehow it was like biting into a triangle of heaven. I saw God. "Pizza God". 

They are right in line behind my beloved Spinatos, as far as the tastiness factor goes.

The night I visited, my girlfriend and I were being total hogs and we both ordered pizza as well as french fries. I do not recall which fries she ordered (hers came with pepperoni and I don't eat meat), but she raved about them incessantly.

I ordered the greek fries to go with my pizza and OH EM GEE- they were SO BOMB! I cannot even describe the greasy, cheesy scrumptiouness in exact terms, but trust me, if you wanna break your diet (and I mean REALLY BREAK IT), come to Geno's for pizza & fries!!
