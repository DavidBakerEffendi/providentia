The Buffet at Bellagio is nestled in the back of Bellagio Resort and Casino. It's not very hard to find. Signs point to it easily. The lines can be long but it is well worth it. Tip for being first in line....DON'T EAT FAST. Take your time and enjoy the flavors. I had friends from LA in town and I took them to this place. Unfortunately I have a Ruth Chris Budget and they were Sizzler. So it was pretty expensive for them. They have a wide spread from a raw bar, to a carving station, dessert stations. Typical buffet style. However the night we went we had some rare kobe beef round. Mmmm the redder the better....I also enjoyed the different asian flair and italian entrees. We stayed there for 3 hours because my friends wanted to get more than 40 dollar's worth. One of them actually took a crap - to make room for more food. Yes...yes...I have cheap friends. 
After seeing the Bellagio Buffet on Rachel Ray's $40 a Day and it showcased their real crabmeat at the omelette station. I had to go back. The crab was sweet and very fresh. Bellagio prides themselves with fresh ingredients. This is definitely one of the top 5 buffets of Vegas.
