I went to Captain's Boil to throw a surprise party for my friend, and I must say, the service we received this time was amazing.  I went early to set up decorations, and the waitress helped me put up streamers as well as provided me with tape and candles for the cake we had.  She also took the cake in the back so that when we asked her to, she would bring it out to surprise our friend.  The service the entire time was friendly and helpful!

The food, as always, was great.  I recommend adding corn to your bag of seafood next time, because the sauce makes the corn taste amazing.  I also recommend trying the new lobster roll.  Although the portion is small, (as with most lobster rolls), it tastes soooo good.  It comes with a side of fries as well as a lobster bisque.  

And of course, one can't go to Captain's Boil without getting the Cajun rice.  Tip: put the Captain's Boil sauce from your seafood bag onto your Cajun Rice.  It makes it taste so much better!
