Simply the BEST fresh, middle eastern food in Cleveland! The fattoush salad is beyond delicious, I have been known to make an hour long round trip just to get one. I order mine with the pita chips on the side in the event that I want to take the rest of the salad home, plus it's fun eating the salad atop crisp pita chips. I highly recommend trying this lunch place, you won't be disappointed!
