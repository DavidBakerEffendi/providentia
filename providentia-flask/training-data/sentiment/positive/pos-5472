"Everything taste good, It just had to be prepared correctly." - Grisamentum A.

See, I'm not huge on pizza, and then, I'm not even big on Italian food; it's all too much heavy sauce and boring noodles covering flavors. 

I think this place might of just change my perception. 

At Piazza al Forno, I ate my words. It was so frickin' good I didn't stop until I ate through 30 to 50% of the dictionaries words too. 

I can admit when I've wronged.

I am however bashful to say that I've lived in Glendale (C'mon, everybody throw up your favorite gang sign West Siiiide) all this time and I've never tried this place. 

I'm even more embarrassed to say that A Guy that looks like platinum haired Pork-U-Pine from So-Cal, who's apparently is famous for his Triple D's--beat me here. 

Un-bal'eva-ball. 

Don't make the same mistake I did.
