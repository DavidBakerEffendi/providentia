Loved this place. First off, the service was awesome. Mr. Biaggio was so kind to us. 
We had a slice of pepperoni and Hawaiian pizza, chicken wings (plain with medium on the side) and a house salad. Everything was soooo delicious. Wings were super crunchy, the pizza was awesome. I would prefer a little More sauce on the pizza and perhaps romaine lettuce instead of iceberg, but that doesn't change the fact that this place is great. I can't even explain how well we were treated.
Check them out when you have a chance~
