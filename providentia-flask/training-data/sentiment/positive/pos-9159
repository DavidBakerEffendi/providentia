What a non descript fine restaurant dining location in Bridgeland.  I have driven down Edmonton Trail countless of times and have even walked down on it only to have discovered just that other day that this very old building actually houses one of the best dining places in Calgary.

A brother of Kensington Wine Market and the Muse restaurant AKA finds its way to decay beauty in an unassuming building on the Edmonton Trail.  A small spoonery of maybe thirty five tables, the low mood lighting and darker sultry furnishings promises culinary delights. 

I ordered a dish that wasn't on their menu which was a delicious steak with pesto and bakchoy highlights.  I crescendoed my meal with a delightful banana parfait with bits of banana bread and banana covered in crispy caramel.  My meal came under $40 but it was well worth it.

The server/manager was extremely personable and pleasant and gave me the most personable of service and care.  I will definitely return to this location again perhaps for the nice breakfast menu that they serve up on the weekends. AKA now belongs to my 5 star foodie favourite category.
