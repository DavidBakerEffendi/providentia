I enjoyed the atmosphere at the time I ate. I am looking forward to digging through the rest of the menu. I am very happy with the Mongolian Beef, and I'm almost positive already I'll order the spring rolls on my next visit. I was also very pleased that I was offered tea as I sat down! I also tore through a small bowl of rice kinda as a dessert.
