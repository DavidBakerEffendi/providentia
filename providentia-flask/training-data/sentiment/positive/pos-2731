Ordered online for the first time - WHAT A GREAT SITE.  Awesome.  You can see everything on the menu - add or take items off - it's all there.  

The BEST PART~~~  the Chardon Taco Bell was ready when I picked it up and EVERYTHING - I mean EVERYTHING was exactly right.  

BEST SITE I'VE EVER ORDERED FROM....  You got it going on Taco Bell!!!!!
