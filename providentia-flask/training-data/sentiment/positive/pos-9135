My first time here was yesterday and it will NOT be my last!  I love New Mexico style food and this place satisfies my craving for it.  This is close to home, too so it will become a regular stop for me.  Had the machaca beef burrito and the meat was tender and seasoned so well.  Love the green and regular salsa, too.  So glad my friend found you!
