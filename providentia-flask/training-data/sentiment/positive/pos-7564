My family has made this our one and only chinese restaurant since we moved to AZ. We wouldn't think of going anywhere else. The servers know us now and we feel like they are a part of our family. The food is fantastic and the prices are more than reasonable. It's a large dining room yet even when it's full we get our food super quickly. Wong's has us for life.
