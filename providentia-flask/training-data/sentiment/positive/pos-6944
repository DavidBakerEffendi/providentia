This is a newer Madison hot spot -- this is their second summer in the city. The food is pretty good and the tequila options are aplenty -- I've never seen so much tequila in one place honestly.

The tacos are light, not doused in grease or overloaded with rice -- the guacamole is fantastic. Our favorite server is Ellen -- she's the best, full of energy, all smiles and checks in on tables the perfect amount without being overbearing. She recommended her favorites to us and we tried the Sweet Potato Dorados and the Mexican Street Corn, both of which were amazing. 

We will be back!
