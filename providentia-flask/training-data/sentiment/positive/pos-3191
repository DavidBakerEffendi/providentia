Hot DAWG!  This place has the best hot dogs I've ever tasted.  

JJ's Red Hots is a fast casual restaurant for Hot dog, sausage and chili lovers.  Oh yeah, they also have salads but if you come here for a salad without trying the dogs first, there's something wrong.

I thought that when I ordered, they would take an already cooked dog and just add my desired toppings but no you get a freshly cooked dog which is why it takes a little longer.  They have various names for their dogs with various toppings including the standard, ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, chili and more.  And put them in any combo.

But it's not the toppings that stand out, it's the dog itself.  They are cooked long enough to give them a nice brown color and a great smoky flavor.  Toppings for the Carolina and Jersey dogs were good.  For the Jersey dog, I should have added some hot sauce to cut the sweetness of the relish a bit.  But otherwise it was quite tasty.

If you order the combo, your meal comes with a drink and your choice of 4 sides.  I went with the onion rings which were thin and had a nice kick to them.

They also sell beer, both bottled and local drafts and have a few wine selections.  

Around the restaurant, the decor is black and red.  There is an old drum set turned into a light fixture in the dining room.  There's 2 TV's, several booths, tables and a 12 seater pub table.  They also have a small patio out back and the deck on top of the restaurant.   The staff is super friendly here and seemed to go out of their way to help you understand the menu and bring you things that you may have forgotten, like napkins.

In a space that has been so many restaurants in a short time, I think this might be the one that sticks around for a while.  At least I hope they do!
