Like a slice of Route 66 nostalgia in your tummy! My family happened upon this gem after an all-day drive through Arizona. Nestled in the quaint downtown Boulder City downtown district, this small, red building houses a fantastic classic dinner, complete with soft-serve ice cream and a jar of peanut butter (for impromptu Elvis classics, perhaps?). My four-year-old loved sitting at the counter and getting her real-cheese macaroni-and-cheese. My husband became giddy when he found out there was house-made "fry sauce" to go with his hand-cut fries and blue cheese and bacon burger. I felt joy with every bite of my old-school grilled cheese sandwich made on buttered Texas toast! Americana menu at reasonable prices, made to order with wonderful service!
