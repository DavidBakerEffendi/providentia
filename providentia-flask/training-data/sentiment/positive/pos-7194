I went to Maizies after a Sunday hike up camelback mountain. Their bucket mimosas and eggs Benedict were perfect post-hiking. I sat on the patio and it was a wonderful area. Great atmosphere,  great staff! I don't remember our  waitresses name but she was brunette with tattoos and she was awesome! She did and excellent job. I would absolutely recommend this place to others and I'll be going there again soon.
