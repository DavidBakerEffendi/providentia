New location, same great burger!! Still hands down the best burger town. I'll be perfectly honest...it's the BEST burger I've ever had. My usual is the Tamago with bacon but will venture off sometimes. Either way I've never had a bad burger. I do highly recommend getting the Tamago with Bacon 
The staff is always really friendly.  The locations are always clean...the downtown food truck is tucked around the corner from the crowd across from Common Wealth.  Which ever location you'll get a great burger.
