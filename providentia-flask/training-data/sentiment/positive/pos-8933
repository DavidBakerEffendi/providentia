My first experience at Happy Dog was not just just an ordinary experience, it was a Polka Happy Hour experience! I walked into a very busy restaurant with a warm welcome over the microphone to the 'pretty ladies in pink'.  And the Polka music played all night! 

Luckily a friend of mine was there first so he snagged us a spot at the bar so we each had our own stool which was perfect.  We were promptly served and asked what we wanted to drink, and from then on my glass was never empty - unless I chose for it to be! 

My friend explained to me that I just take the piece of paper and fill out what I want.  A lot of times in these instances I get very overwhelmed and either end up putting too much stuff on top or not enough, but when my dog came I was EXTREMELY satisfied and will probably never change my order. 

I topped mine with, onions, hot sauce, nacho cheese and a fried egg and I felt like I had went to heaven.  It was definitely an eat it with a fork and a knife kind of hot dog, but I wouldn't have had it any other way.  

A friend and I shared the tatter tots and several dipping sauces (which may have been my favorite part that I could have as many as I wanted).  I am not the biggest tatter tot fan, so I think I should of went with fries instead but they were good.  One thing I would not recommend would be their house ketchup - it is not good and will ruin anything you put it on.  Their 'special sauce' is a keeper though. 

If you plan to attend for Polka Happy Hour, expect a wait or to be holding your dog while you eat it.  

I will definitely be back!
