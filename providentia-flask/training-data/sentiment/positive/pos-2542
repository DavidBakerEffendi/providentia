I love living in Arizona. Everything you need is within 10 minutes of each other. We were looking for a good pizza place and this little gem just might be it. It's cute and quaint and offers excellent wood fired pizza! It was cooked perfectly and had that delicious wood fired taste to it. Delicious home made pizza sauce as well. 

The owner was incredibly kind and welcoming as well. He spent a lot of time talking to us and making lovely suggestions for us to explore our new city.  He really knows how to run a business and make his patrons feel comfortable. 

I can't wait to come back.
