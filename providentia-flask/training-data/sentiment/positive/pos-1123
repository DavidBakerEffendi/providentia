Yes to all of the above.  Woodlands is simply fantastic.

Though we'd been wanting to try it for a while, we hadn't trekked out to Woodlands simply because it was (in our eyes) all the way out in the boonies off Albemarle Road.  Despite growing up in the CLT, I can count on one hand the times I have actually driven on Albemarle Road (imagine my surprise then, when we passed the old Eastland Mall, and I was all, "OHHHH... THIS is where Eastland used to be").  ANYWAY.

Last night, however, searching for a restaurant that wasn't participating in Restaurant Week, we decided to head out to Woodlands, and we were pleasantly surprised when it took us less than 15 minutes to get out there.  Excellent.  Despite previous reviews, the exterior and decor weren't particularly off-putting... it seems to me that almost every great Indian place I've eaten at has a very similar set-up (Udipi in Cary, anyone?), so it felt like home.

I do love opening a menu and knowing I can order anything off it.  This time, I settled on the chef's specialty of chana batura, and husband ordered aloo gobi and garlic naan.  The puffy bread with my dish was like a light, unsweetened funnel cake - fried, indulgent deliciousness - and it sopped up the chana so very well.  The chana were perfect.  Husband's aloo gobi was so delicate and tasty, and the garlic naan just blew me away.  Yum to absolutely everything.  We also ordered a couple samosas, which were also perfect... just the right amount of spice, and flaky beyond belief.

The service was excellent, for what it's worth. 

Although we've got Maharani around the corner (which I like very much), as well as Copper (which underwhelms me, despite all its hoopla), I imagine we'll be making the well-worth-it drive out to Woodlands when we're in the mood for particularly fabulous Indian food.  Love this place.
