Love to shop there! They have everything from pre made sides to marinated Kalbi, Bulgogi, Chicken, Pork belly and Cutlets. And if you would like to make your own, they have all the ingredients you'll need there. I also love their Food Court. Sushi, some Hawaiian and Korean foods at decent price compared to DJK and some other Korean restaurants.
