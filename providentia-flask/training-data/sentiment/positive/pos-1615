Finally found a good restaurant in Toronto! Being from LA and NYC I have always been so disappointed in the restaurant choices. Well this place does not disappoint! It is everything fabulous. Full of flavor and love! The service was amazing, the atmosphere was amazing and the food was just as good. After 10 years of eating my way through Toronto, I've finally found a place that meets  my standards! Get the muscles  and the Moscow mules.
