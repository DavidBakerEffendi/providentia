Yum yum Acai bowl... On this particular day, I came to try Pitaya bowl. Dragonfruit at the bottom (pink one you see on the picture). 

Who doesn't like Nekter Juice Bar? I try to eat lots of veggies and fruits but I can't always eat as much as recommend. Nekter Juice Bar is a perfect solution for a day I feel like I not eating enough fruits and vegetables.

If It's during lunch hour, I order acai bowl, it's quite filling and feel good when I finished eating.

This particular location has a friendly staff and she takes time and answers any questions you may have. She doesn't rush you and her knowledge is helpful to decide what to eat/drink.

I would definitely stop by here again for more healthy and yummy drink next time I am in the area.
