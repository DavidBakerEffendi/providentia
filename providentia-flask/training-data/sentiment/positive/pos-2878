We were so very happy that our favorite taco-truck opened a physical location in Henderson!  Completely authentic Mexican food isn't that easy to come by in these parts, but here you will find it.  The Al Pastor tacos are to die for!  Note that on Wednesdays, tacos are half priced!  Even though this is about 5 miles from my work, I make the trek here at least once a week.  Funny that this replaced a failed Baja Fresh, but one visit and you'll know why.  If you like genuine Mexican fast food I don't think you can find a better place in Henderson.
