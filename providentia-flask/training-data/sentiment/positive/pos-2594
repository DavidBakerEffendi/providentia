I love coming to Vegas I love the shows I love the food and I love gambling! My favorite hotel is the palazzo however this time stayed at the Venetian everything was booked at palazzo. I believe we stayed at the piazza suite it was nice. Two restrooms, a nice great big jacuzzi and a wonderful view.  Room service was also great! Thanks Venetian
