I took pity on The Bellagio.  You see, I am the king of buffets around the country.  King R, the Inhaler.  I've closed more buffet lines than there are stars in the sky.  My photo is posted at most of the Chinese buffets around Chicago; they see me enter their restaurants, and they say, "WE CLOSED.  GO AWAY."  Because I can eat some buffet, and if it's an all you can eat buffet, well...count your day's profit goodbye.  See me, and you better get on the phone to your wholesaler for next day's delivery.

And The Bellagio opened the next day because I didn't eat every damn morsel of food they have.  I witnessed and gently sampled their scrumptious array of fabulous food.  Heavy on seafood (the Bellagio is known for a large Asian gambling clientele), two full display cases of beautiful desserts, and service that rivaled even some of the best restaurants I've eaten at (thank you Eljon!).

My only complaint, and thank you Paul A. who mentioned this, is that for a supposedly smoke-free restaurant, I smelled more nasty air blasting in from the casino than some of the other restaurants in casinos I visited.  For a place like the Bellagio, I was very surprised.  Alas, no star deductions for excess, errant carcinogens.  It's not the chef, waiter or food prep people's faults.

A piece of advice for those who complain about the long-ass line/wait queue: if you want to dine here, make sure you GO BEFORE 6pm.  I went just before 6pm on a weekday, and by 6:45, the line was insane.  But it's like that at most other buffets, so quit bitching.
