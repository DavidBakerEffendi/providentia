i always pass this place and have been meaning to try it. Their menu looks so good, I was torn between a lot of choices. i finally settled on the perfectly grilled cheese- brie, four cheese blend, arugula, bacon on spiced pear bread. I love the sweetness of the bread, which is reminiscent of cinnamon raisin toast, it compliments the saltiness of the bacon and the bold flavor of brie. I also got the seasonal side which was broccoli tossed with red onions and cranberries in a sweet vinaigrette. The broccoli was crisp and refreshing but the vinaigrette made it a little too sweet for my taste. My boyfriend got the Chicken Marsala sandwich which was huge with delicious sweet potato fries. 

I love the fact that their happy hour drinks starts at 11am and goes to 6pm, but its only about fifty cents off regular price. I will definitely be back to try some of their happy hour tapas (2pm-6pm) and pear blossom salad and green chili mac that I was eyeing last time.
