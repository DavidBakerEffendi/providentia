This place is the definition of a hole in the wall. With that being said, expect to be embraced with exceptional above and beyond service and the feeling that you've just been accepted into the family!

Cecelia, the owner, is so joyful and goes out of her way to learn your name and address you by it throughout your visit. Basically, the atmosphere and staff earn this place a 5 star rating alone.

Then comes the food... the food is a whole other story. Talk about an incredible food explosion in your mouth! Seriously, I didn't know that Jamaican was my favorite food. The meat is slow cooked and tender, with delicious spices and seasonings that will make you already plan your next trip before you finish your dish. I had the jerk chicken and my fiance has the brown stewed chicken. Both were served with sides of rice and beans, cabbage, and plantains. Seriously, amazing including a ton of food (despite being the small portion) for only $10.75 each!

We will definitely be back for the amazing food and incredible hospitality.
