I found this place on the Local First Arizona website and 32 Shea is quickly becoming both my local hangout and my stop for an afterwork cocktail.
I really love this place - especially their outdoor patio. The way that the owners have worked to convert an old photomat into a spot of relaxation and good vibe is amazing. It's small but I've always been able to get a table and their outdoor patio is dog friendly.

I've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and all three have been a good experience. They even have a drive-thru for coffee in the mornings. For breakfast, I like the egg-white bites. Their flatbreads change daily and they also do some specials during the week that my family enjoys like burgers and milkshakes.

Their cocktails are innovative and delicious and its a great relaxing spot for connecting with friends after work.

There was recently a fundraising campaign for an elderly gentleman in the area and when I went on the website to make a donation, I saw that 32Shea had made a generous contribution for this man. This is the type of business that I want to support.
