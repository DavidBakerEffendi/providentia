This place continues to impress me!  Been here for breakfast but today is the first time here for dinner.  They had a great happy hour special on appetizers.   But one get one free.   Fried potato and cheddar bacon balls and onion rings were really good.   For dinner we had the chicken piccotta which was our of this world!  Best I've ever had. I'll keep coming and trying new menu items.   This is a must for south Chandler!
