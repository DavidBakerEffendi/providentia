Amble into this establishment after a quick review of what was in Strongsville. I'm not from the area and was looking for something casual. Pizza's as casual as it gets.

Anyhoo. I'm greeted in a prompt and friendly manner. I place my order and ask if I might be able to eat at the lone adult table with chairs in the front of the store (there's a very tiny table with chairs for toddlers across the room). I'm told I could and I have a seat. 

The side salad was tasty and the pepperoni bacon bombs were delectable. My BBQ chicken pizza was brought fresh from the oven with the promise it would burn my face off if I didn't let it rest for a few minutes. Desiring my face to remain as is, I let it sit for a bit. It was every bit as scrumptious as I hoped it would be. 

I'm not sure when I'll be back this way, but this will be the place to go if I'm peckish for pizza.
