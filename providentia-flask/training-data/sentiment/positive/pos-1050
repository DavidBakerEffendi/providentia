I been here many times and the pastries are always fresh and delicious. Today I had a craving for a homemade pie. I purchased a blueberry pie. They didn't disappoint. The pie had the perfect amount of sweetness. The crust was browned to perfection. Recommend the pie. All the goodies I've purchased on numerous times have been wonderful.
