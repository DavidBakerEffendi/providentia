Love the downtown location and the ownership, so I have made an effort to visit #2 whenever in Summerlin. I went about a month ago and it was not a good experience. But, today was a complete 180. Server greeted us quickly, drinks rapidly arrived and were delicious, and the food came out within 15 minutes. We enjoyed the chicken Tonga chilaquiles and a queso empanada. I noticed a lot more families visiting this location and I know they will continue to grow as a family friendly spot. 

Job well done!!
