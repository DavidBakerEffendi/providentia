Very impressed! Coffee was delicious, staff was delightful, patio seating was refreshing. Overall, great experience. The pancakes were to die for and their syrup really made the dish. The chorizo bowl was very flavorful and perfectly put together. The atmosphere has a very clean relaxed feel. I definitely plan to come back next time I'm in Phoenix!
