Eating/drinking on styrofoam and eating with plastic utensils needs to be your mindset since this is what you will be doing.  The food is worth it.  I consider it some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix.  Take some tortillas home and order a side of chips and salsa with your meal.  The salsa is a bit hot for some of my friends but I think it is perfect.  All the food I have even had here has been awesome!
