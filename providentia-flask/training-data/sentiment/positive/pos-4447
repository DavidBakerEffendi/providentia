Hidden gem!!! I had never heard of this place but stumbled across it via yelp. Came on a Sunday morning, and were taken care of immediately. The inside is decorated really cute & beachy. Our server was so friendly and really took the time to explain the menu and catering/delivery options. I ordered a 2 egg breakfast and it was amazing. The potatoes were my favorite - they were red potatoes and had a garlic taste. The toast and eggs were also good. I will definitely return!
