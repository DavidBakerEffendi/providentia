So great. Meat is cooked perfectly, not over greasy or too salty. I've been twice and had a pita with fries and a dinner combo with rice. Loved both. Fries are extra crispy, which is awesome. Our first visit we ordered dinner combos to go and got a drink to wait, dinners came out in under 10 minutes. Owner brought us complimentary hummus, which was so nice. My new favorite pita joint!
