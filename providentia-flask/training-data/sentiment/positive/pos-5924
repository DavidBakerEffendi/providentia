I am here at least once a week, it's only fair I give this place the credit!! Chef Desyree, thank you for opening this gelato spot, especially between the two places I work, with the most amazing gelato I have ever had in life EVER!!
I use to bartend at a well known gelato place on the strip, and I am Sicilian, my thoughts on gelato are very particular. When I heard of this place that everyone was raving about, and they're raving about flavors like Pear and Gorgonzola and Red Chile chocolate, of course I had my doubts. It only took one trip, with about 20 samples, to make my mind up that this is by far the best gelato in Las Vegas!! 
Not to mention she won over the 16 and 11 year old. Love it!
My two favorite flavors thus far are Cassata Siciliana, a pannetone style gelato with cannoli cream and chocolate chips. Basically a bunch of Italian desserts, made into a gelato. HEAVEN!! And Cr√®me brulee. She actually puts the burned sugar in it, so as you are pretending to have this melt in your mouth pudding, it's like the real thing when you get a chunk of sugar. 
A few other yummy ones are Mango, cookies and cream, Spumoni, and surprisingly enough, the avocado. 
For the record, I don't even like ice cream. I am in love with this place and eat it at least once a week. Chef always remembers me, and she works so hard. She truly must enjoy what she does, which makes the flavors even better.
