My first experience at Rush was for an Xmas party and it was fabulous. Fabulous because 1. My boss paid for everything 2. The service is outstanding 3. The food is fantastic. 
While perusing the drink menu, the server who approached me asked what I was in the mood for. I told him something fresh and  I was served exactly that: grey goose pear vodka ( who knew there was such a flavour?!) with lime, water and a splash of ginger ale.
The service during our main meal was done by stealth like servers, that we barely noticed. They seem to not want to get in the way of your dining experience, but are on hand at the exact right moment if need be. Rush may seem like another boys club meeting place for downtown corporates, but if you can get past that, your in for a real treat.
