Taco Bell is Taco Bell you get what you pay for. However I have to leave a review because every time I come here there's the same girl working the drive thru. She's just so nice and does a great job at getting all the orders done. Honestly, sometimes it seems like she's on her own! Idk if she enjoys her job but her personality just shines through! She's just so genuinely kind! I tried to see what her name was but didn't catch it.
