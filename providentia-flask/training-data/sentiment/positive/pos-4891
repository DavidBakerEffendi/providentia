What a nice furniture sto....oh wait it's a restaurant. 
There are 2 surprising things about this place:

1) it's very spacious, I definitely expected it to be smaller
2) Everything was absolutely worth my money.

I absolutely loved everything about this place, from the decorations, the atmosphere, and of course the food.

I came here knowing I just wanted a salad. I sat down, looked at the menu and decided I had to get their anniversary special! $20 for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. They also added a nice little grass juice in the beginning. 

Squash soup: A little thick, good taste, not too flavorful but I still liked it. I was scared to finish it because I wanted to be able to try everything.

Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich: "winner winner chicken dinner!" When this line was created, I'm pretty sure this sandwich is what they had in mind. At first I thought this sandwich would be a little too much, but it wasn't overly fried so it didn't make me feel like I would die from a heart attack. The salad it came with was addicting, they put kale. It was a nice balance with the fat sandwich.

Brown bag apple pie: The presentation was adorable. I wasn't super impressed with the dessert, but it was a solid 7. I really liked the crust and the vanilla bean ice cream was a nice touch.

I don't use the word favorite often, but this restaurant definitely goes in my top 10!
