Ah breaded eggplant never goes wrong! With having a semi vegan diet this is one dish I'll recommend if you come to Olive Garden. It's well portioned and it will surely fill you up. Not a fan of chain food restaurants but must admit this is my exception. Glad to know there's all you can eat soup or salad not to mention that really good bread of theirs. Makes you feel at home.
