This place is absolutely phenomenal. The service is excellent everyone really does seem like they enjoy their jobs there, so that always helps make the overall vibe/ feel a lot better. Drink selections  were very wide which is always a perk. Lots of juices housemaid drinks and plenty of alcohol. But the thing that I was thoroughly impressed with was the great selection of delicious foods that were in the buffet. You get everything from pan Thai noodles, blue cheese stuffed tortellini with pork sausage,or even get pan seared salmon. Now it's one thing to have a wide selection of great foods but it's another for them to taste good as well because sometimes when you get quantity you really sacrifice quality. And this place break that rule there's a wide variety of things you can get, and each of them taste like he was personally made for you!
