I live nearby and go here pretty often.  I've always had excellent service and very tasty food, no matter what I order or what time of day I go in.  I love the casual environment and the relaxing music that's always playing.  I've never tried anything from the breakfast menu, but all of their sandwiches and burgers are top notch in taste and quality and come in really generous portions.  Their smoothies are yummy too.  Yes, they're made from a mix, but they're good, so who cares.  

Just because a place offers smoothies and has "cafe" in the name, doesn't mean it's a health food place.  I think people are being way too picky in their expectations.  This place is a local gem!
