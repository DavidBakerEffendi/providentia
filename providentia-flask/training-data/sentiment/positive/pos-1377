So freaking yummy!!!

I got the single scoop sundae October every cone--with espressoreo ice cream!!!-(coffee ice cream with Oreos cookie bits) and my husband got the hazelnut ice cream  banana crepe. They were both amazing!!! HUGEEEEEEEEE portions!

The names of the desserts are very clever and the desserts are all very tasty.

I look forward to going back soon one day! I can't wait to take my friends from Texas here when they come visit!

Nice big place but reservations are needed for bigger groups because they're always busy so that's kinda lame or else you have to wait for quite a bit!
