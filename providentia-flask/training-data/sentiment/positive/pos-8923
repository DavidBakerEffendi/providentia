i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner. 

i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week. 

i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting) 
my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. 

mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.

the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.

the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. 

and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount! 

today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.


i love this place!
