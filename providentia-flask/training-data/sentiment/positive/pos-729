Very amazing experience, friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Egg rolls were excellent, remind me of the kind I used to get in Chicago's Chinatown. Ordered the Beef & Shrimp Combo, it was delicious, everything was fresh and the presentation was very nice with good portion sizes. Highly Recommended, plan on going back next time I'm in Las Vegas.
