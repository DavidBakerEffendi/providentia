First I want to give kudos for the great service. Usually Korean restaurants have terrible service, but Little Piggy's had excellent service.

We had the pork table bbq combo for two ($40). Came with 3 different cuts of pork including pork belly. The meat seasoning and marinade was well done. Delicious stuff. The induction tabletop is crazy. Tech is pretty cool. 

Also had the seafood pancake ($10). Probably the best pancake I ever had. Could have ate another of these, and it was quite large. Big chunks of seafood and a spicy sauce to dip in.

Yelp Check in for the free soft serve ice cream. It was really good.

We did smell after eating here, not sure how people came out not smelling like meat. 

Overall, I could probably eat this everyday.
