Tasty tacos, homemade tortillas, non-hipster atmosphere and reasonable prices. 

Reminds me of Empellon in NYC more than any other Mexican place here. The set-up is equally conducive to dinner with friends or dropping in late night at the bar (once they get their license).

 I hope it does well so I'm giving 5 stars.
