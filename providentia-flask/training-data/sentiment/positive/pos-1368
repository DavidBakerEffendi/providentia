Very cool space, nice staff, and a lovely americano on a rainy day.  It's not very clear when you walk in, but you order and pay at the counter first and then pick a seat. It's a small space, not sure if it's tough to get a seat on a weekend, but on a week night it was not busy at all.  I'll be back to try out the food menu, which looks very delicious!
