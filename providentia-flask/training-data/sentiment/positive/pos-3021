Best damn patty melt ever.  Place is super friendly with a green Shape of Water movie lighting theme.  The soda glasses are the red ones I use to see at Midwest steakhouses.   Crowd is crunchy friendly and eclectic.  My patty melt was on real rye bread and the meat was not the frozen brick but real ground beef.  The onions were the perfect amount and the cheese was super yummy.  They also have daily burger specials and the onion rings taste hand made.  

I'm eager to swing back to this tasty nearby dive soon.   Really soon!
