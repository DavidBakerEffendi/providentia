First time here and bummed we didn't come earlier.  All we had were macaroons and beignets and a baguette but all were amazing!  We want to go back and try their sandwiches and wines!!  Everything is a moderately priced.  It's quaint and sweet.  Great place to hang out for a cup of wine, coffee, and just talk.
