Preparing to get beach fit ready I figured the best way to start is with a cleanse. To feel refreshed and brand new I chose Nekter to feed my body with the essential vitamins needed since I would be skipping toxic meals. What a better way to cleanse then with raw veggies and fruits. With the help of the super friendly staff I choose the 3 day detox which was on special for $99.00. The Classic Cleanse worked best for me as I am more of a fruity flavored person. The deliciousness of each pre-marked bottle that I sipped on throughout the day gave me a big boost of energy.  The cold pressed juices taste amazing. You even get a really cool bag to transport them from home to work. This gave me the opportunity to make sure I stayed hydrated. I am surprised that I did not feel hungry. If anything I felt full because it was suggested by the lady who rang me up to stay hydrated with water. So I incorporated at least 2 quarts of water throughout the day. 

The hip juice bar is located in colonnade mall. A chill atmosphere like Starbucks with plenty of seating and dining options. The whole crew enjoys what they do and are willing to help you. Since the juice bar offers more than juice this is the perfect health bar to hangout.
