i've gone here three times since it first opened, and it is now my go-to place for a california burrito while in pittsburgh.

summary:
1. tacos are OK. i wouldn't go out of my way to grab the tacos here. 
2. california burritos and other burritos are packed with meat. while the guacamole may be mixed with some type of sour cream to help keep costs low, i don't mind TOO much. 
3. they have the red and green sauces. green seems to provide more of a kick than the red sauces, but either way, they're both not very spicy.
4. their carne asada fries are not as messy (read: unhealthy) as the carne asada fries seem back home. that said, they're not completely smothered in toppings, which some people may find more manageable.

i'll definitely be back, as I've bought this yelp deal, and I have to use it!
