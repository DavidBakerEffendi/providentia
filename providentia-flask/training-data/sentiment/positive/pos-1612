My family went to Grinders for the first time a week ago and loved it so much we came back again today for dinner.  They use quality ingredients and the prices are very affordable.  Even my picky-ish 4 year old who eats like a bird stuffed herself full.  Their subs have a unique flavor that really puts them a step above the rest.

Definitely the best sub shop in the East Valley!!
