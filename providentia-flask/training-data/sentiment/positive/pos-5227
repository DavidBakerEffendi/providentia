Came from LA on a bachelor party and this was our first spot to grub as soon as we came off the plane. And OMGGGG I'm so happy we did. 

Bianco is a very unique and quality Neapolitan pizza joint. All their pizzas have that char on the crust which you will only get on a wood fire oven. Excellent. 

Highly recommend the pistachio pie and and the arugula pizza.
