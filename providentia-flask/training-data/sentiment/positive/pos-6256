Serious about sandwiches? I highly recommend this locally owned little lunch spot...

I don't know why it took me so long to try this place, but it was worth the wait... I ended up meeting a friend here for a spontaneous lunch, and it was delicious!

The large menu offers something for everyone and it's all super fresh and moderately priced.  I went with the The Green Monster (veggie wrap) but had them add tuna and change out the garden spinach wrap for a honey whole wheat one.  For my side, I chose their homemade coleslaw... loved every bite!  I washed it all down with fresh squeezed lemonade (just 99 cents with the Yelp check-in offer at the moment).  

VSC is hiding behind Andreoli Italian Grocer just off the 101 and Via Linda... as it says on their website, they may be "Outta Sight... but (they are definitely not) Outta Mind!"  As a matter of fact, they are going to be fresh in my mind for awhile.  I can't wait to return!
