I think I'm obsessed. I've made it a Saturday Farmers Market tradition to grab a smoothie and a spring roll then leisurely peruse the stalls.
Everything is amazing- I've had the avocado mango peach smoothie and the avocado carrot coconut smoothie. Both of which were delicious, I was admittedly a little skeptical about how the later would taste because I love fruit smoothies but I was very pleasantly surprised.
As for the spring rolls, a picture is worth a thousand words. They are massive and filled with super fresh delicious ingredients. She doesn't skimp on the avocado or try to fill it with excessive amounts of rice noodles.
Be prepared to wait if you come around lunch time because there will be a line but it is oh so worth it.
