Forgot to write this review yesterday night. Called in the order so I could just get there and pick up my food and go. The lady said it would be ten min, so ten min later(probably more) I was there and paid and sat down because my food wasn't ready. Long story short I waiting longer then I should have...but I have to give it to the 2 cooks that went out their ways to come out and apologize for the wait. One came out and gave me a drink for the wait and apologized and then a few min later the other cook came out and sincerely apologize and explained why they took so long. I did have to wait a bit too long but because the way they handled the situation it made it okay and I left with a smile. Great job on customer service!!!(I've been Having some horrilbe experiences)great food also of course!
