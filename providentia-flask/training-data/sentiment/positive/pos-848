Since I am a regular customer I felt that I need to put an update to the review to answer to the various reviews that seem not to the understand what "authentic Turkish " means. 

For vegetarians : there's no such thing as vegetarian in Turkish culture. It doesn't exist. There are several pides that don't have meat , but they do not cater to vegetarians but simply to regular meat eaters who would like a change of pace once in a while.  No. 14, 15, 17 are all vegetarian. They will do. 

For vegans: go to another restaurant. Vegan is non existent concept in Turkish culture. 

For the Gluten-free crowd: no, just no. Celiac disease affects less than 0.01% of the population and the rest are just faking it.

Substitutions: don't bother. These Pides were served with the same ingredient for the last six centuries, so to think they would substitute for you is just unrealistic

The stereo pumps Turkish popular music which is a Great addition to the authenticity. If you're looking for the crapman Bieber or raggaethon- you're out of luck. 

In conclusion : this is the most authentic Turkish cuisine place on toronto. If you're looking for "fusion" - keep looking
