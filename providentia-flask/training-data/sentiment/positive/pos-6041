YUMMY, This was my first (but by far, not my last) visit to Pincus Bakery.  I LOVE a small neighborhood bakery and this place fits the bill.  I stopped in yesterday and purchased the most delicious Kolachky cookies that I've ever eaten.  I am an avid baker and a bit of a snob when it comes to baked goods, so I know my Kolachky cookies!  These cookies came in various flavors.  I opted for a mix of raspberry, cheese, apricot and walnut.  The pastry, which I'm sure was cream cheese, was flaky and delicate.  The cookies had just the right amount of filling and the sweetness level was just right.   They were not uniform in size, which means they were definitely homemade.  The staff was great, very friendly.   I can't wait to return to try some of their other offerings.
