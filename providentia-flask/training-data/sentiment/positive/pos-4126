came out with a happy stomach and super full, (that's for the 1/3 lb burger) LOL Awesome staff, manager asks around tables how your dining experience is, the selection of items for the burgers are FRESH AND plenty, of course the have the new Free-Style Coca Cola machines, good beer selections as well. Xavier (manager) is very friendly. Really clean and open area space to hang out and relax with a beer and SUPER MOIST DELICIOUS BURGER on the side. They have renovated the restaurant and it has been a thumbs up for my husband and I. Will be back many times, keep it up!  Restaurant is huge for parties too. Great access to this location as it is right at the I-17 exit. Free WiFi...
