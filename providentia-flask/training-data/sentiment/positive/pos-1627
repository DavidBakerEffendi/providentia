Located in food court of Greenland Supermarket. This place is so conveniently close to work, love coming here to get our Korean food fix on lunch breaks! Especially love coming for the meat jun & fried saimin. Russel is so welcoming, spreads aloha & provides the best service! You won't be disappointed!
