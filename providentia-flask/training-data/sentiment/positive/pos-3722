Harumi is one of the better sushi restaurants in Downtown Phoenix.  The staff is always friendly, no matter how busy they are and no matter how rowdy their  customers get.

They are great at making recommendations from their menu.  My new favorite is the Ahi Tower.  It's beautiful and packed with flavor!  

If you are in the downtown area I would recommend Harumi.  It's not as swanky as some of their competition, but the fish here tastes fresher and service is more attentive.  One thing to note: the rice they use is purple-colored.  If you read the explanation on the monitor you learn that it's a super-food.  I love this concept!  I have taken visitors here on several occasions and they've all ended up loving Harumi!
