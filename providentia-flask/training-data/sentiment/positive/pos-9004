My son (AKA the 10 Year Old Gourmand) and I enjoyed lunch here today and enjoyed it thoroughly! We were pleasantly surprised by the trendy, upscale decor that was without a hint of tacky typical Asian restaurant flair. The room was open and bright and not a hint of fushia in sight. :) 

We enjoyed the pork eggrolls as our appetizer. They came out piping hot with an accompaniment of mint leaves and lettuce to roll the egg rolls in. The viniagrette dipping sauce was sweet without taking away from the flavor of the egg rolls. Probably the best egg rolls we've had in quite a long time.

I enjoyed the Meatball Pho for my entree. I enjoy Pho very much and this was excellent. I was told by our server that they steep the broth for over 10 hours and it was very nicely done. I ordered a small serving which I couldn't finish but not because it wasn't amazing. I just got full. :)

My son had the shrimp fried rice. It had a very generous portion of shrimp in it...and not diced up and spread throughout...these were larger size shrimp with the tails still on. I counted at least 8 shrimp which is a pretty generous portion. The rice was perfectly cooked and while it could easily have fed us both, my son gobbled it up like it was his last meal. It came with a side of scallion soup which was also delicious  as well. 

The service was attentive while not being intrusive and they were kind enough to explain about the side dish of condiments for the Pho to ensure that even the most novice of Pho-eaters were sure to find a way to make their Pho exactly how they like it. 

All in all, an excellent new restaurant hidden among the chains that surround this area of Bell rd and a new treasure to Surprise. Can't wait to go back!
