Update on July 7th, 2015: Monty's you never disappoint. Still in love with this place! :)

Vegetarian's/ Vegan's Eden ~ Many options to select from!
I don't know why I haven't written a review for Monty's even after being here so many times but finally here it is...
What we have eaten here so far:
Vegetarian Hash, Vegetarian Chili, Chicken in a Pie, German's Chocolate and all of their pies! (my favorite the Key Lime)
Tofu Scrambler - The BEST DISH in house. The best tofu scramble I have ever eaten. This is definitely on our every order.
And their potatoes are one of the best I have ever had! What do you put in your seasoning?!
I don't even have to rate each and every item because they are all so good!
Service: 5
Servers are always friendly, helpful, and fast!
Price: Absolutely reasonable.
