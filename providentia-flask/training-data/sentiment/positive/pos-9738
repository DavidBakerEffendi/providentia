Yummy yummy is probably our go-to Chinese food. We love the food, our favorite dishes so far have to be the wonton soup, chicken low mien, egg fu young(any kind), orange chicken and the egg drop soup. It's close to our home which is nice, they also deliver but you can call in and pick up as well. If your looking for decent Chinese food, go here, they don't disappoint.
