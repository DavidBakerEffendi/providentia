This is my go to spot for dine in Thai food. Food is always good but the atmosphere is great as well. Can get a little busy prior to movies so I try to avoid those times. Service is pretty basic but is always fast. The food is always fresh and tastes very authentic. We always start out with the Thai Egg Rolls. Really crispy and the noodles inside are delicious. Have had many of the entrees and am always happy with every one of them. Highly recommend this location.
