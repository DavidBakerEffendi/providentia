I've come here for coffee, lunch to go, happy hour and dinner for a large group. All have been great experiences. I love how this little place has transformed over the years. When the weather is nice you have to sit in their outdoor area. The staff is always attentive and friendly. I don't live in the area but whenever I am nearby I always make a point to go. Bonus points for being dog friendly!
