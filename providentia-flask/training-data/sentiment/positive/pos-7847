I absolutely love this place! It is quaint, cute, farm to table and good priced. 

I went with 5 moms for a brunch. We had a reservation and were seated right away. The food was amazing, 
Monkey bread cinnamon rolls, berry ricotta, breakfast pizza and corned beef hash. I also had a coffee and a blood orange bottomless mimosa. 

I'll say my mimosa saw the bottom too many times. Service was pretty good though I got the feeling at the end the server wanted her table back so they purposely dried us out of water and mimosas.
