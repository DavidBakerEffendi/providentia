Tosh is was a DDD so we had high expectations and they came right through.  Our waitress was super cool, food was great turkey Tom and the wife had roasted pork with stuffing, only cow that was good.  We got stuffed so we could not have any of those divine desserts in the case, all made on premises.  We'll probably go back today to par-take.  Worth the trip and scarf it down!!!
