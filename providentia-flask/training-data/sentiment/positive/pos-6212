My god so good mmmmmphsddj

The holy grail of sweet meat au jus coupled with mushrooms and onions transcended me into an experience akin to a stoner and a late night Taco Bell run~ 

I planned on saving half for later but that failed... Also eating and driving with this beast was a challenge as the juices dripped everywhere, BUT THATS OK CUZ I LOVE YOU MR. JUICE (Most cheesesteak places have dry beef :'( )

And with the summer buy one get half off deal its even better, for the price of subway I can get a Philly cheese x deux

Staff was bickering and apologized but I barely noticed, with a sandwich this good you could burn down my house for all I care.

Just a warning - you might have to change yo pants after eating here

*Almost as good as Jin's Grill in SD
