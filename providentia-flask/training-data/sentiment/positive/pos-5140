This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte.  The staff is very attentive and after only a few visits the manager recognizes us and knows what we like to drink and knows our appetizer. We love the spring rolls with the peanut sauce.  I have tried  quite a few of the many dishes they offer, including the specialties, but I seem to always prefer the vermicelli dishes with mint. It is light and refreshing.
