I absolutely LOVE this place! I am originally from Chicago and am relatively new to Cleveland, so I find myself missing home-cooking Indian food quite often. While the food here isn't quite what I would make at home, the ingredients are fresh and I feel like I am eating high-quality Indian comfort food! I am vegetarian and I think the quality of the paneer, in particular, is stellar. The channa masala is perfectly seasoned which I think is very rare for an Indian restaurant. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a filling, healthy, and quality Indian meal!!
