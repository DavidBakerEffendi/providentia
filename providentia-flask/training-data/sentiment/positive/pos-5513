I love this place! I came here yesterday night for my 20th birthday with my parents and my friend (my brother was in Waterloo, so she replaced him for the night hahaha). My parents chose this place in Scarborough because it was in the area I was born 20 years ago & they used to go there. Also, I love Italian food! Anyway, the host and the wait staff was so cordial, kind & professional. They answered our questions accordingly greeted us with a smile, and checked in regularly. The food came in a timely manner and everything was on point: from aesthetics/plating to the dish itself. My taste buds were satisfied. :) I got the linguine di mare for $14.99 and was quite satisfied with the portion - just right. I would definitely recommend this place - it's spacious and accommodates for big groups with main floor tables & side booths for smaller groups or for pairs. The interior has a rustic yet classy, with a cozy feel to it, like a neighborhood or family favourite. The prices are quite reasonable for an Italian bistro - entrees range from $11-30 & they have a good drink menu of red wines, white wines, cocktails & beers.
