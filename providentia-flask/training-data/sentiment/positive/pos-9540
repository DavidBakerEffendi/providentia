OH EM GEE. Fuego, I love everything you do.

My journey with Fuego began at last year's taco festival in October. Their offerings were so moist and juicy that I knew I was going to be a repeat customer. Then, much to my dismay. Fuego Tacos did not open until January 2011. I had to content myself with its delicious but pricer older sister, Fuego Bistro (where I would dine every day if I could afford it).

Finally, fast forward a few more months and I got to try the amazingness that is Fuego Tacos again and my palate sang with delight.

So, enough with story time. Let's move on to the review.

The menu is fairly simple. It's mostly taco plates or à la carte tacos, with a few side items. They also have the same legendary mojitos as Fuego Bistro in about a billionty tongue-pleasing flavors. Alright, it's more like thirty, but it is still a lot.

The server will bring complimentary homemade chips and salsa to your table. The taco plates come with two tacos, rice, and beans with a price tag ranging from $9 to $12. But, on Mondays and Tuesdays, taco plates are half off if you buy a drink so have a mojito too. If you go during happy hour (3-7pm), drink prices are $3-$4. So, you can score both for less than the price of a normal taco plate. Win-Win. 

The spicy margarita made with jalapeño-infused tequila that is made of the devil's spittle, I assure you. It is rimmed with crack-tastic cumin salt. However, it is not a drink for the timid as a few sips from my date's drink and I felt like I gained a half dozen ulcers. I love spicy, so this is a dangerous combination. Stomach lining won over palate in this case.

In my experience, service at Fuego restaurants is always friendly and attentive without smothering you. I found this to be the case at Fuego Tacos as well. We received attention from both our server and the bartender. They wanted to make sure that we were taken care of and that we were happy with our selections. Spoiler alert: We were.

Pros:
- Delicious
- Good value for the money
- Friendly, attentive service

Cons:
- Parking (Your best bet is  to leave your car across the street at the Biltmore Fashion Park and walk through the tunnel underneath Camelback.)
- Closed Sundays
