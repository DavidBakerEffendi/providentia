Ommgggg today was the first day I had ever came to Ncounter and omg I was sleeping big time they are always busy and very close to my house and driving down mill I decided to go on my lunch break to get some to go and I ordered the chopped salad, its colorful and I def looks as good as it tastes it is amazing, some people may think $10.25 is high for salad and i agree it is somewhat pricey but Its truly worth it you get a little bit of everything I would suggest asking for it on a bed of kale or romaine lettuce if your a big leaf eater like me because the arugula amount is not much and I love lettuce so I had to get a side but I forsure will be backprobably tomorrow
