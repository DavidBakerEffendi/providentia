Had dinner yesterday with my hubby & my toddler. It was fantastic experience from beginning to end! We started off with the trio de picos which was perfect since my daughter loved the silver dollar corn mass bites & plantain chips. My husband ordered a few specialty cocktails by recommendation of the waitress ( she was so attentive!) we had the 3 course chef meal & finished off with the yummy chocolate cake dessert.
