Decided to go to Gal's Sushi for the first time today at lunch time. When we entered, we saw that the place was busy (a good sign), luckily there was space for us. My wife and I both decided to have the lunch specials ( Bento boxes for 8,99$).   I had the sushi, sashimi, roll Bento box. There was a good variety and good amount in the box. Everything tasted good. Both of us were full when we finished. They even offer 10% off if you pay by cash. Will certainly return to try some of the Korean dishes on the menu.
