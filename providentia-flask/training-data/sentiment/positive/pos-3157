I was really surprised by this place. It is unassuming, tucked into a plaza at the Pittsburgh end of Mcknight. My BF actually didn't want to go and gave me a hard time about it because he thought there was no way the food would be good. I wish I would have read more reviews before going though, because I didn't know they made their own soup and didn't get any :(

I got a veggie sandwich and the BF got pizza (he picked his own toppings) both were surprisingly good. The decor and heating in the restaurant leave something to be desired... We were pretty cold inside, and the booths/tables were a little aged. The drinks/beer menu were also surprisingly diverse and tasty. We got a ginger beer concoction and a craft brew that were both tasty.

I'm glad to have discovered this place.
