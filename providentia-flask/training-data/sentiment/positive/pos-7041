My husband and I have been eating at Los Olivos for the last 15 years.  This restaurant is authentic Mexican cuisine.  The place is run by family.  
Sometimes you do have to wait awhile for the food.  The wait staff is usually pretty good.  
The food is always fresh and served hot.  Today I ordered the Chimichanga plate.  The shredded beef is always delicious.  There homemade salsa is so delicious.  

I'm not sure exactly what restaurant a previous reviewer ate at stating they ate garbage.  Maybe they were at Taco Bell.  

You won't be disappointed with Los Olivio's but be patient.  Authentic food that's fresh takes time so enjoy visiting with friends and family while you wait.
