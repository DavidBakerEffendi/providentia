The Peppermill is by far the best place to eat breakfast in all of Nevada. The portions are very genrous and the food is outstanding. The fireside lounge is a wonderful place to relax and have a drink while waiting for a table. The atmosphere in the lounge has to be experienced to fully grasp just how wonderful it is. Overall, no trip to Vegas is complete without breakfast at the Peppermill
