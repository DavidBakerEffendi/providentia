If you like Quartier General, you will like this one as it's the same owner.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated, great food, good service and it's a BYOW!

Had a group reservation at 6 for a birthday and they said we had to leave at 9 which was very reasonable considering that most places will only give you 2 hours.

All the dishes we had were very well executed in terms of presentation and flavour. The menu was very diversified and the chef was able to accommodate my friend who's a vegetarian.

Took the short rib as an entree and it was fall off the bone tender! 

As a main, I had the piglet which was very moist and flavourful...no intense flavour there but well balanced with the vegetables which accompanied the dish. 

Friends also took the fish and duck magret also said that their dish were yummy.

The dessert was the best part, homemade donut with ice cream and caramel sauce. The donut was fluffy and crispy. The caramel sauce wasn't too sweet and the ice cream was refreshing.

Definitely recommend it. The table d'h√¥te was about $40...a bargain considering that I went to Europea the day before and didn't even come close to the excellent meal I had at Etat Major.

Will be back for sure!
