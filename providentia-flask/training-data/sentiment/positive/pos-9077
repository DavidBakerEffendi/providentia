Yesssss! Made to order pizza and great service! I love the dough used at this spot. Even their double dough is still thin and crispy. Toppings are super fresh and service is friendly and fast. I can totally dig going here for pizza and beer, but until I'm no longer pregnant I'll settle for pigging out on some delicious pizza. They have their own combinations to choose from or you can make your own. The kids meals come with a smaller personal pizza, a dessert, and a drink. Great spot for the whole fam!
