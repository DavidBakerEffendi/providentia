Le Cheese Casee-Croute is a food truck-turned-brick-and-mortar establishment that offers a variety of different types of mac & cheeses, poutines, sandwiches, and tator tots, highlighting local Quebec-ian cheeses.  This place was a little out of the way, but I was determined to stop by while on my trip!  It was freezing, raining, and windy, but I felt victorious, finally making it.  I ordered their famous mac and cheese, which I got it to-go, which came in a small Chinese take-out box - I can hear the guys cooking it up, with some bacon sizzling, with some ingredients being pan-fried, and all the ingredients just coming together.  The macaroni was cooked perfectly al dente - there was so much cheese, but it wasn't salty; the generous amount of bacon gave it that nice salty factor, but just enough to season the mac & cheese perfectly.  There were also roasted cauliflower, sweet green peas, breadcrumbs, some sriracha for a kick, as well as an addition of a homemade bechamel sauce that just made everything come together quite well.  The stop was totally worth it for me, as I love mac and cheese, and I think Le Cheese does it well!  The leftovers even tasted great the next day, so don't fret if you can't finish it (those take-out boxes are deceiving, as a lot can be jampacked in there!).  Staff were super friendly, and there are some seats inside to dine-in.
