Came here for a birthday dinner with family and everyone was pretty impressed! We made a reservation in advance (not sure if that even mattered). There was a huge lineup that kept growing as the evening went on but luckily there was a table for our party size. 

Overall service was quick and food was delicious. Our favourites included the Empress Fried Rice, Mixed Fungus & Fried Gluten hot pot, and the Spice & Pepper Salt Squid. It was a bit of a drive for everyone but we were all full and content with the meal. Would definitely come back again!
