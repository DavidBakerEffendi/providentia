Let's just say Jenni-Pho is the perfect place to get a bowl of Pho after a night of hard core partying on the Strip.  Their beef in their pho is fresh compared to other pho places in Vegas that I had came across before, and a order of Jenni's Cha Gio or Crab Rangoon totally completes the my Pho filling.  On the plus side service is amazing for an Asian spot! Jenni-Pho definitely rates high on my pho list, and totally as good and authentic like places in OC or San Jose.  Jenni-Pho, you're definitely getting this Cali- Girl Pho Blessings :)
