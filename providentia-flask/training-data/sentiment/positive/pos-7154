If you live in Northeast Ohio, or your just passing through Swenson's is a must! The signs says America's Best Burger, and they would be right. Even if you take away all the awards and acknowledgements, this is the best burger around. Get the double cheeseburger with everything (mustard, pickle, onion), some potato tweezers (jalape√±os poppers), and a California (Grape soda) to wash it down with....DELICIOUS! Curb staff is nice and you gotta love the old school drive in style. Sun, rain, sleet, snow this place stays packed! Give it shot if you never have, they even have a veggie burger (salad boy), chicken sandwiches, and salads so everyone is happy! Also, try a hot fudge shake...yum!!
