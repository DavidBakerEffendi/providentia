I stumbled upon Jasmine Buffet when I was running an errand nearby. I was not disappointed at Jasmine Buffet. I feel they have better quality and tastier food than other Chinese buffets. This buffet just opened five months ago. They do have hibachi grill and sushi bar. I love the hibachi grill. The price is about 8.59. I didn't get a chance to taste its sushi but my dad said it was pretty good. If you happen to be near there please give them a try. They do have plenty of parking lot and easy to park there.
