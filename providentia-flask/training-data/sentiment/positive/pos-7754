After riding low from the disappointment of Original Motorcycle Burger, I decided to dine in at my next stop, Gourmet Burger Co. I sprint limped* from my work and steeled against the cold. I felt relieved when I walked up the tiny stairs to the restaurant.

I ordered a 6 oz beef burger (toppings: tomato, lettuce, pickles, caramelized onions, tangy BBQ sauce and smokey chipotle & honey mayo) with fries & drink. It was around $12. I liked that I was able to get a pretty good assortment of complimentary toppings. I sat down to wait for my order & within a few minutes I was being called up to collect. That was around 2:45.

My burger orgasm occurred at 2:50pm.

The burger was so delicious! The meat was juicy and the bun was almost like a soft kaiser bun. The combination of the two was heaven. I couldn't put the burger--even when my phone started ringing and I knew it was my sis; the burger was just too good. My burger toppings were all great especially the mayo and the lettuce. You know sometimes you'll get a sorry excuse for lettuce on your burger? The puny kind that was chosen last for the soccer baseball team because it was the only one left over? Well not at Gourmet. My lettuce seemed fresh, a deep green colour. Made me enjoy my burger even more. Plus the juiciness of the burger made for a messy burger. Near the end, the toppings started to slide out & juice drizzled down my fingers. But I loved every minute of it. Like most Big O's though, it ended all too soon.

The fries were good fries. They're crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and went down great after the stellar burger. 

Gourmet Burger Co. definitely redeemed my Faith in Decemburger after OMB.

The place is small though & wouldn't be great for groups  It's really a takeout kind of joint. But that's okay. I don't need a group of people to come here often *insert sly wink & Borat grin*

* Long story short, I bruised the skin around my knee and it has been slow going in the walking department
