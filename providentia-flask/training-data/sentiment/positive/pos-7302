Not really sure why I have taken so long to finally make it into Honeysalt for a meal. A friend of mine was visiting in town this week and she had her PR gal set her up with reservations for one night and asked me if I wanted to join her. We got to try many items on the menu and all were incredibly delicious there was not one thing we didn't love. The grilled octopus is quite possibly my most favorite dish I have eaten in a long time. The scallops were cooked to perfection, the ahi tuna was so good and the Brookie and apple pie desserts are amazing as well. Service was impeccable and not just because we were there for a comped meal, my friend and I are both food photographers and bloggers and shared lots of pics of our meals on social media,  but you can tell they really put emphasis on service.  The meal was so amazing I made reservations for two nights  later for my husband and I to have a late night date night.  I got to try several other dishes on the menu that I hadn't had two nights before I got the grilled octopus again I tried the trout which was cooked so perfectly and we have the orange chocolate bread putting for dessert.  The maple bourbon cocktail was so good too.  The menu is reasonably priced, definitely a lot cheaper than the restaurants on the strip, perfect for a date night. I want to try brunch,  happy hour and even come in for lunch and this will probably happen soon since this is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas.
