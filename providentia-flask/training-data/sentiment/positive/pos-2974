Yes!  I think most people eat out for food alone. However, I look for the total package, wrapped  up with a pretty bow.  This was our experience today.  A day that we needed it. 
Celebrating my daughters debut at Symphony Hall I made reservations for a party of 9 which included 3 under 14.  
They were very accommodating, tho I was put on hold twice to make sure it was okay to take the 9 top reservation.  They didn't wait to have us all there before we were seated.  A plus as we had my 99 year old grandfather with us and also had to wait for my daughter to change and arrive.  
The food was from good to stellar, as we all ordered very different things.  Well three of us ordered the chicken stroganoff, which sounded fantastic but seemed to be missing something.  Still quite edible.  We also had the beef stew (I don't know how good it was because my grandfather wouldn't share), meatloaf (delicious) the smashed potatoes and gravy were perfect. I had the scallops, which were exactly what I needed as they were light and complemented my Arrogant 75(s) perfectly.
We ordered each of the desserts to taste them all.  The peanut butter mouse (aka melted peanut butter cup) went VERY well with the hot chocolate cake. I don't know how the blueberry cheesecake was as my grandfather, again, didn't share.  But the salted caramel pudding was hands down MY FAVORITE!!! I'd come back just for that.
You know what else I'd come back for? The service!! Tony was amazing!!! I love to ask questions, and he never once hesitated. His recommendations were spot on. He listened and was so much fun.  I eat out for the total package and Tony was the the perfectly tied bow on top!
Can NOT wait to come back.
