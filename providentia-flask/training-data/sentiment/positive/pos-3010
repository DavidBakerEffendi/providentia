I've been wanting to try this place for a while (yes bc of ddd) and I'm glad I did! I loved it!! I practically inhaled the jerk rice, black beans, jerk chicken and emerald chicken in a quesadilla! to top it off the snickerdoodle is the best!! I will definitely be back! I bring every out of town guest the 40 minute drive (please consider reopening another chandler location, maybe in an easier to find, less smelly location) and every single person loves it. I pretty much went once a week when pregnant.. and then whenever I'm hungover haha
