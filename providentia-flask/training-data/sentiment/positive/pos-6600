The service here is always so warm and welcoming. Last time I was in I tried their massaman curry, which had avocado, sweet potato, onion, cashews, and coconut milk. The sweetness of the curry really balanced out the spiciness. 

My latest visit I got their pad see-yew with shrimp. I do have to say it was sodium packed for my liking but my thai iced helped mellow out the saltiness. I'll have to come back to check out more of their dishes.
