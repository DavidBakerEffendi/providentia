Service - 5, Food - 4

Came here on a Wednesday night at almost closing time after going to the Third Eye Blind Concert. A bunch of items were sold out but we still managed to get a regular (bigger) sized layered poutine (extra layer of cheese in the middle) with bacon and maple syrup on the side. Shout out to MONA for being so patient with all our questions and being hilarious. It was quiet when we arrived but a bunch of people came after us and she was still great even if there was annoying/weird guy in line. The poutine was satisfying but great service knocked the experience of the park!
