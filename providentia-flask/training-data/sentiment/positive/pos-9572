＼(^o^)／ "Best Free Show In Vegas Hands Down" ＼(^o^)／

Bellagio Fountain Show is easily the best free attraction in Las Vegas Strip.  The fountain is a whopping 8-acres manmade lake.  It cost as much as 40 million to build; the fountain created by WET.  I think the fountain has something to do with the cost of the Bellagio high room rate.  The fountain had help Bellagio putting itself above most other 5 stars hotel in the strip.  Vehicles and pedestrians pass by the strip will notice the huge fountain plus its famous water show.

Other the size, the water blast is also remarkable.  It shoots as high as 460 feet, which is over 40 stories high!  At top of that, it got great lighting and music to make a perfect harmony. People of all age would enjoy this fountain, at first it appear this would be a great for romantic setting.  But kids would love this since the water blast is so cool.  

You can great view from the Paris Hotel, few of the outdoor restaurant in Bellagio, and of course the room in the Bellagio themselves. A Las Vegas trip is not completed without a visit to the Fountain Show in Bellagio; I think if they added more recent music would be a nice refresh or color led.  The show run every 15 minutes from 3pm or earlier depend if weekend or holiday is. Which is a good crowd control.
