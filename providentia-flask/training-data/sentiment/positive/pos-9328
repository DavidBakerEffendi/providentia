Joe's San Francisco Special @ Peppermill Las Vegas. Scrambled Eggs, Spinach, Sausage, Ground Beef, Onion, over Hash Browns, and topped with Cheese Sauce. Heard about Peppermill from a few different sources and it definitely lives up to the hype. It's super old school Vegas feel and you get the best bang for your buck. This scramble was very good and it came with a Bran Muffin. Huge portion and it was only $13.75. The place was packed and I could see why. Great food, large portions, attentive service, cool decor, and great value. This is a must when in Vegas.
