I was very impressed by National which I visited on a Monday evening. I had a Mill Street Cobblestone stout and the Prime Rib sandwich. I also shared the chicken pot pie.

I really enjoyed the Cobblestone. It was my first time trying it and it is on par with my favourite beer Boddingtons. The Prime Rib was great as it came with hot mustard with arugula inside. I love a sandwhich that makes me almost cry and give me arugula as a treat. The Chicken pot pie was excellent though hardy. I would suggest not biting into it right away though because it was very hot when we received it. Burned my tongue a bit. 

I really love the space that the National has developed. Save one white pillar in the middle everything is open here with communal seating in the middle. The large screen with airport-style of beer display behind the bar make it possible to not need to open your menu. It is fitting that this place be next door to the ship because really they are opposites. Though sometimes I prefer a place with more nooks and crannies, the national is place where I could spend a lot of money. Loved my experience!
