WOW! This place is fantastic! A home renovated into a cute mom and pop cafe, complete with an outdoor patio. The food was amazing, I ordered the hearty breakfast skillet, biscuits and gravy on top of hasbrowns and eggs - YUMMMM! The hubs ordered (some catchy breakfast name that I can't remember)-platter with a three egg omlete, country potatoes, and bacon - I wasn't a fan of the country potatoes (mostly because I have a stub nose to anyone's country potatoes except for my grandmothers) yet the omelete was perfectly cooked, the added veggies burst with favor! Bacon....everyone loves bacon, it is very hard to mess up so it was, as expected delicious. Moving forward, we noticed a table next to us being served with big fluffy French toast. Obviously, we were forced to flag down our waitress and order that as well. Our waitress was attentive, kind and always on the ball. On two occasions I was finishing my drink as she brought my replacement to the table. (In my option every restaurant should be taught this) Let's get back to that french toast, HOLY FRENCH TOAST! Crispy on the outside, fluffy and decadent on the inside. This place is served so simply, yet packed full of flavor.

After our meal, we were just getting up to leave and a woman, who has been working the register all morning and chatting with whomever was walking by, adding laughter to the atmosphere. She introduced herself as Yoli the owner then asked us how our meal was, where we are from, what we do for a living, she seemed to generally care about what we were saying. We stayed and talked for a few minutes and left with a hug! You can't get that at Denny's! I felt as though I was leaving my sisters place after brunch. I would definitely recommend this place! Its been about a month since I visited and I have not stop talking about it....I think its time to revisit!
