Every once in a while I begin salivating at the thought of a nice, big, juicy slab of beef... and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse certainly knew how to deliver.

I was lucky enough to be taken here on a date with my boyfriend, who also craves the odd steak.  Well, we were definitely pleased with the decor of the place.  It was classy, but not uncomfortable.  It had very nice ambiance for an intimate date setting.  The decorations were fitting to the menu and atmosphere.  The interior gets 5 out of 5 from me.

And the food, oh,the food.  Both mine and my boyfriends steaks were cooked to perfection; mine med-rare, his blue-rare.  The meat was delicious and succulent, with a flame-grilled taste to it.  And we were able to get a couple of delicious sides to go with the steaks.  This is one restaurant that really knows how to saut√© a mushroom; not crunchy and overcooked, instead juicy and blackened nicely.  My boyfriend was cute enough to order us a bottle of wine, which was probably way to expensive, but a nice little touch.  I was honestly shocked and pleased with how nice and delicious our meal was.  The food gets 5 out of 5 too.

Actually, everything gets 5 out of 5... which is why I gave it 5 stars!  Our waiter was super nice, funny, but professional all at the same time.  It was such an enjoyable time I would recommend Ruth's Chris to anyone.  Sadly, my boyfriend was able to snag the bill before I could have a look at it, but I'm sure it was up there.
