If you've never had Capriotti's food, drop whatever you're doing right now, and get some. I'm a huge fan of the cheese steak with mushrooms, but the Bobby is worth the trip. 

Sandwiches range from "I'm on a diet, tee hee" seven inches up to "I'm filling the void in my life with food" twenty inch monsters. Warning: buying the big one to have lunch for tomorrow, too, does not work. One you start eating one of their sandwiches, you will keep packing it into your face until it is all gone, and then you'll be sad that it's gone. I had a dream I was eating a Capriotti's sandwich, woke up from the dream, and was depressed the rest of the morning because I didn't have a sandwich. It's that good.
