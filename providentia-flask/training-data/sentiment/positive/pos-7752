Been going here for 30 years and it's consistently gr8.  Classic steakhouse w/a filet to die for.  Salad on a chilled plate w/homemade dressing.  Twice baked potatoes are delicious.  Desserts are the bomb.  Friendly and fast service and you can can watch 'em cook.  Ambience is ranch style.  Suggest reservations on weekends.  Tough to find in urban sprawl but worth it.
