This place is a new favorite for date night. GREAT and personable owner. Love the posh decor and vibe of the place. The fiancé and I want to have our rehearsal dinner here. Still loving the food and the short ribs are still my favorite. Tried the honey flatbread appetizer, meatballs, and creme brûlée last time I visited. I have yet to be disappointed by anything I try.
