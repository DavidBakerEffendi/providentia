So I bookmarked this place because I heard from my friends that this is the go-to place for mexican food. Then.... my work got catered food from here and oh my golly gosh. Hello! The best. You will not be disappointed. Their rice, beans, tortillas, chicken fajitas and beef enchiladas are delicious. The flavor on their beef enchiladas are to dream about. The guacamole and pico de gallo was on point. Their chips are perfectly salted, not too much but enough to get addicted and eat it all. I definitely will try to eat at the restaurant. But if you need catering, this the place to order. They have a friendly delivery staff... and ... they set it up for you!
