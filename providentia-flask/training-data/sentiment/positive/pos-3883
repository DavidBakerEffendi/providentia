Eating at Metro right now, for the first time! This place is fantastic! Food, service, and cleanliness top notch! If you come here ask for Patience she is the best!!!! We had a cup of tomato bisque, chicken and waffles, All American burger and onion rings. Everything was so tasty!  We were treated amazing. All that for less than $40.
