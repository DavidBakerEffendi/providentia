Got to see them participate in the Scottsdale Spice Event and they had again some authentic artfully crafted dishes!  It reminded me of how much I really enjoyed Thai food!  That following day it compelled me to have dinner with my Husband and order some Tom Kha Gai( coconut chicken soup). Omg ridiculously good!  We also got some extra spicy Panang Chicken.  We love this place and tell everyone about it.  Quality of food is amazing and prices for most dishes hovers around 10$. For 1st timers get the Pad Thai Noodles they are amazeballs!
