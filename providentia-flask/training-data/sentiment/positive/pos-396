Love, love, love Desyree and all her flavors.  I don't know how she keeps thinking them up.  But boy am I glad she does.  She has me trying and loving flavors I would have never tried on my own.  I am still partial to the sweeter dessert flavors but will always try her newest creation regardless.  From the purest to the most complex flavors this is by far the best gelato I have ever had.
