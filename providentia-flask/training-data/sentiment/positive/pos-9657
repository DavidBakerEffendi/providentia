It was Sunday before the Christmas and the waiting line was ridiculously long. We waited about a hour before we were seated. After we were seated, our waiter immediately took our drink orders. Once we had our drinks, we were ready to chow down the whole buffet! 

Price: Holiday dinner was $47.99. 

Dining atmosphere wasn't as fancy as the Wicked Spoon; however, I like the food here better than the Wicked Spoon's. What do you get for $47.99? Smoked salmon, Chinese duck, Chinese broccoli, lamb chops, prime ribs, goose meat, sushi, nigiri, gnocchi bolognese, beef wellington, and tasty desserts. Oh, they also had the taco station and shrimp cocktail!

The good: Lamb chops were simply amazing! Not only the seasoning was just right, lambs were tender and juicy! Chinese duck and broccoli were actually pretty good. As for the dessert, pecan pie tasted soooooo good! 

The Bad: Miso soup was fairly salty. 

Disappointment: They ran out of creme brulee =(

Other than the long waiting line, it was definitely an amazing buffet experience. The food at the Bellagio is definitely far more superior than the Wicked Spoon's. Would I come back here if I get another chance? Hell yea!
