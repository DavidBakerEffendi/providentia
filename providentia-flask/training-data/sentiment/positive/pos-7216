wowzers!! Celebrated a girl friend's bday here with 10 people so we got connecting rooms which made it really convenient (boys side and girls side). The bathrooms were huuuuuge and perfect for getting ready for a night out. There was even a vanity table. The only bad thing was there were no locks on the doors! And if someone was showering, noone else would be able to use the toilet or sinks. The beds were ultra comfortable, the pull out sofa bed, not so much as you can feel the springs.. Sleeping on the actual sofa would've been more comfortable. The room came with two huge flat screens, hair dryer, iron and table, robes, a printer, coffee table, and another round table to sit around. Had remote controlled curtains and a beautiful view. 
There's a gym on some level I forget. Shopping here was nice, there were a lot of workers strolling around in costume offering to help with directions. And a couple friends saw a couple celebrities gambling/buying coffee bean and tea leaf. We came super late to the lounge downstairs and got in for free. Didn't even have to buy drinks since we prepartied hard. Ate at Grand Luxe Cafe for breakfast and didn't have to wait in line ( no clue what my friends did or said). I would have to say that this trip was the best one yet. :]
