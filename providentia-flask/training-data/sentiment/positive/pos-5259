Just amazing.  Went here after a nice night on the town, we came In for a drink or two, and ended up hanging out and getting some of the best sushi I've ever had, but got the coolest service and sushi bar experience of my life.  
I agree, it's pricey on the menu, but we sat next to the sushi bar, and just BS'ing with the sushi chef for a few, we ended up in some amazing sushi tower just by telling him what we liked, and he took it to the next level.  We DEFINATLY got super hooked up, and I'll leave it at that.
I know that it's expensive, but the ambiance and food take it.
