Awesome service! We sat down and were served chips and salsa within thirty seconds. Julie, the bartender, was so nice and knowledgable. She made fantastic margaritas and helped us pick out which tacos to order (also fantastic). Julie was obviously very busy, but took the time with us to make sure we had everything we needed. We had a great experience!
