OMG!! Can we say delicious??? So I
Saw a fellow yelper's review and decided to give this place a try(thank you Joe M). I'm so glad that we did. So I decided on the rice bowl cashu don which is braised pork with seaweed and egg. Kind of like a teriyaki style bowl full of flavor. I just couldn't get enough of this stuff! My husband had the shio original ramen. Another great item, a chicken based broth seasoned with salt. I loved the simplicity of this bowl. It wasn't full of extra items like corn and all that stuff. Just a few basic items but extremely delicious! My husband and I ended up swapping back and forth with each other. The layout of this place is simple and classic Japanese style which I loved. I love the in house noodle making machine. Noodles that are made fresh are the best! Then to top it off... the manager spent some time with us explaining the thoughts and concepts of the owner with this place which both my husband and I really enjoyed and appreciated. But the best part was when I eyed the macaron's on the way out the door!!!! I'm totally hooked on this place and I'm definitely making a trip back baby'
