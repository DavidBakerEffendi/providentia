Just about everything I want in a sports bar!

-A VERY comfortable viewing experience. 

-Ample seating

-Big patio

-Good bar food. The wings are legit. Awesome, even. I tried the nuclear sauce. It kept my friend writhing in agony for a minute, but I thought they were delicious. Tastes like a hotter sriracha. 

-Awesome mixed drinks at reasonable prices. And the bartenders, who are great at their jobs, really seem to enjoy using their creativity. 

-The beer selection had a couple of unique choices in the seasonal New Belgium collaboration, but was otherwise mediocre. 

I'd come back here to eat, drink, and watch the game. Even when there's not a game going on, people can chillax and socialize as if it's just a pub. That right there elevates this into five star territory. 

Staff and atmosphere make a huge difference!
