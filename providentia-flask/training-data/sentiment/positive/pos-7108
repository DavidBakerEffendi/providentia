Always my favorite getaway. It was a little noisy. But as always the food was great. the menu has change over time but it has changed for the better I could say. more variety of small plates which I love. I enjoy the sharable portions. the staff is friendly I wasn't wowed but I was ok. I'm hardly ever disappointed when I spot by.
