Wow! Where to begin.  I must admit this has been in my bookmarks list for over a year, but after I heard that this was a Top 100 2015 Open Table Restaurant in the ENTIRE United States, I Immediately made reservations for this past Saturday.   I was surprised to see only about 8 tables in total an a very small " bar" seating area.   As expected, service and the food was stellar.  We did the six course price fix of $130 per person not including Sake.  My wife and I were full by the fourth course.  A full review of the approximately 15 items we had are way beyond the scope of this review, but reading other Yelpers reviews gives an accurate description of the type of food to expect.  Additionally, it is my understanding that the menu changes daily depending on the availability of the seafood.  The whole dinner took approximately two hours.  With tip, two bottles of Sake, bottled water, the bill was a bit over $400 dollars.  I will probably return once or twice a year as a destination.
