Fresh, cheap and always busy. My family often calls in for takeout which is their niche. No other place can beat their price along with the quality. It's a Chinese owned restaurant that's nothing spectacular but I often believe, with Sushi restaurants, the busier they are, the less chance their fish can sit.
Keep in mind, they are often very busy so call a day ahead if you can. We have called in a few times around noon and could only get an order at 7pm. Crazy
