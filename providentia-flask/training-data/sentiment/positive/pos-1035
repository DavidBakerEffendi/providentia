We started the evening with delicious egg rolls, complimentary for checking in on Yelp! They were crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside and the sweet and sour sauce is a perfect compliment. The salt & pepper wings were perfectly seasoned with the right amount of heat from the grilled jalape√±os. The Chinese sausage fried rice had a great balance of sweet and savory and was perfect with the shrimp and black bean sauce. The emperors chicken was delicious fried white meat with a savory sauce with just a touch of spice. The service is super friendly and perfectly attentive while not being overbearing. Very consistent over the years!
