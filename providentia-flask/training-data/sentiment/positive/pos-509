Wow. A cool, sophisticated sake bar right in my neighborhood. I've seen many pubs open and close at this location, sometimes within a few short weeks of opening! This one looks like a keeper. 

Looking for an after movie spot to take your date for a few libations? Maru provides an intimate yet fun atmosphere. Dark woods, low lights, purplish/indigo lighting accents. Add in a sophisticated sake menu and a menu featuring some exotic bar foods that won't break the bank, you've got a winner of an establishment here. 

Service is attentive and the staff is fluent in English. Not a given here in K-Town North, especially for some of the drinking establishments that cater to the Korean students that make up the majority of patrons. Don't be shy, whitey. 

Food wise, we sampled the sashimi. Loved the generous, thick cut salmon and the rich, meaty red tuna (not that white tuna crap). Great presentation too.

I'm certainly going to be back, probably for the  spicy taco platter.

I'd love to see some more Korea drink choices, notably some Korean beers. There are some Japanese beers and Korean beers won't win any awards but if you've lived in Korea, you do develop a fond taste for OB, Hite, and Cass. And get some makkoli on the menu too, although I do realize current LCBO import rules seems to make makkoli (Korea's version of Boones http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boone%27s%20farm) ridiculously expensive.
