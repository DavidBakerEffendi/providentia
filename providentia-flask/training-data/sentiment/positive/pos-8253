I often visit little Korea to eat at Korean Village, always passing by and never noticing how fabulous this place is. Went here with some of my girlfriends for brunch on a Sunday a couple weeks ago.

Although we had to wait for about an hour, we didn't mind because we read reviews that it is often packed. It is a small restaurant but it's cozy. There's still enough leg room to enjoy a meal. 

My girlfriends and I were in brunch bliss after taking our first bites into our meals. The service was fast and the waitress was efficient and knowledgable about the menu. They did run out of the "scotch-ish" eggs but we understood seeing that we did arrive pretty late for lunch (it was around 3 when we were seated). I still enjoyed my heavenly beef sausage sandwich. Since my girlfriends and I love to dine, we ordered the Strawberries n Cream waffles for dessert - also fantastic.

The prices were very reasonable (12 for the sandwich and 10 for the waffles). Definitely a delicious and great brunch place in the city. Can't wait to back to try something else.
