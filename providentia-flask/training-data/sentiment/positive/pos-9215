Excellent and authentic Italian pizza from a wood fired oven. The crust is very thin and has to be eaten with a fork and knife like they do in Italy. It isn't crispy like American thin crust pizza. Only the crust is crispy and chewy. Don't expect American style pizzas where you can hold a slice and eat it. We loved our pizzas and it brought us back to our memories of eating pizza in Italy. They also make calamari right and tasty! Perfectly fried with a light batter (tentacles and rings)! We also ordered my all-time favorite pasta dish, clams with linguini in red sauce and it was to DIE FOR!! Next time I am trying the seafood pasta dish since I couldn't stop staring at our patrons eating it next to us. We go so excited when we heard our waiter speaking Italin to the cook. This is the real deal Italian food run by Italians!! We will definitely return very soon.
