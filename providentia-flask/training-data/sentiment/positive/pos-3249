I am obsessed with this place!  I'm not even a vegetarian, and I would choose The Coronado's Jackfruit Sliders over a pulled pork sandwich any day!  All of the food I have tried has been amazing, but I am also impressed with their unique drink menu. I have tried the Palm and the Almeria, both were great,  and nothing like anything I've ever had before. There is also a full bar,  if you aren't about the specialty drinks (although you should be,  because they are awesome). The pastries are the perfect way to end your meal, or you can take one to-go.  They are seriously works of art. 

Service has been great whenever I'm there. Everyone is friendly and easy to strike up conversation with. Staff is knowledgeable about the menu,  and genuinely cares about how everything tastes. I just can't say enough good things!
