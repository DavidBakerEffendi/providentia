Wonderful and engaging service with excellent food!  I wish that I didn't have to crow about this restaurant because YOU will find it and make it difficult for ME to get a table.  But, I have to crow about it!  We enjoyed the vegetable and wonton soup which was enough for three people.  The vegetables were crispy, the wontons were very delicate and quite good, and the broth was perfect - not too salty and not watery.  The mini pork soup buns are really good.  They are not as good as Everyday Noodles, but they are not to be passed up - because they are quite tasty.  The pan fried dumplings were lightly fried and very delicate.  My husband had the beef over Chinese watercress - the greens were perfectly al dente, the beef was tender and very lean.  My daughter and I had the stir fried rice cakes with tofu and chicken.  The rice cakes were appropriately chewy and the veggies were fresh, crisp and delicious.  The sauce was bit oilier than I would have liked, but the taste was so good that I was able to finish the whole plate.  

Cafe 33 has only been open since September!  To have things together this quickly is quite a feat.  I am looking forward to having this wonderful Taiwanese restaurant in Squirrel Hill for years to come.
