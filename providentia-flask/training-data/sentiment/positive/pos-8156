I've been to a few places like this most recently bring kung fu noodle in Markham and GB came through on the noodles!

The options are simple, in beef broth or with a pork based sauce. If you go with one other person do yourself a favour and get one of each! Share it, love it. The best part was choosing the noodle thickness (obviously went with the thickest). They were so chewy and soaked up all the flavour. This place did not disappoint! 

We also had the house made kimchi and that was surprisingly tasty. Don't expect the traditional Korean kimchi though, this version is much more vinegary (I happen to like it that way )
