JJ's is not a restaurant.  It's not a hot dog joint.  It's a culinary experience - designed to tickle your taste buds, and key into your other senses in pretty surprising ways.  

Before even getting into the food, it's worth mentioning that everything about the restaurant is well-designed, and gorgeous.  The menus are creative and fun, interior decoration is clever and well-themed, and the layout of the restaurant is stellar -- especially if the weather is nice and you can sit on the rooftop deck!

I LOVE the hot dogs at JJ's.  Truly.  I've had several different combinations of hot dog type and toppings, including some of their crazy dog-of-the-days (The Elvis, for example, had peanut butter, honey, and banana chips on it!).  They're well made, and delicious.  even when there's a line to order, food never takes long.

I will admit that the one thing that's lacking for me is the sides - I've had the beans, fries, onion rings, and chips, and they're all relatively forgettable.  I usually stick to 2 dogs and a drink.  

My favorite hot dog? Rocket sauce, bacon bits, and cole slaw.  Yum.
