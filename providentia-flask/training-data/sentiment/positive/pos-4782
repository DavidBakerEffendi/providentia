Love this place!  When you first walk in it is open and specious--lots of light.  Both communal seating and tables for groups or individuals.  The food, so many choices and healthy as well.  My fave is: Half spring mix, half rice noodles, roasted edamame and lemongrass corn, chili lime shrimp and coconut curry tofu, sauces with peanut sauce and Penang curry and finally topped with pickled veggie, crispy shallots, roasted sesame seeds, crushed peanuts, Sriracha Spiced Pumpkin Seeds, and finished with Thai chilis!

Cutlery and box are biodegradable which is amazing! Love love love, maybe I will try the drinks one day...there are two house made sofas and a thai milk tea inspired drink as well.

At least twice a week this place is my go to for lunch! Located off Yonge, just north of the Eaton Centre by Ryerson campus--so worth the walk
