This is my favorite restaurant! 

My favorite entree is something that I don't see on the menu anymore. It was a med rare pan seared salmon that was so delicious, and flavorful that it melt in your mouth and got you coming back for more! I used to come here often to order the same thing even when the menu has so much to choose from. 

This Hawaiian Japanese fusion restaurant has tons of mouthwatering creations. I have tried the Misoyaki Butterfish, and I know a lot of people that like it, so i would recommend it.


I have also tried a roll that had wagyu beef, snow crab, tempura asparagus, avocado, and truffle greens which was really interesting. 

I have tried the Lobster California Roll during happy hour once. But for $5, you definitely need two orders to be completely satisfied, it is NOT enough to share, especially if you came to eat!

All the food is perfectly portioned and full of flavor. I don't want to say rich to deter anyone health conscious.

The service is perfect. They have well trained servers and hosts that make sure that your experience is special. All the dishes come out moist, fresh, and decadent!
