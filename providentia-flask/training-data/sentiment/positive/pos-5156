First time in this gem of a local diner. Had a wonderful experience, service was excellent and staff very friendly and appreciative. Food was exactly what you'd expect from an old school diner. The corn beef hash is as good as what you'd find in the South. Their home made preserves are phenomenal. We ordered one pancake to see what they can do on the griddle - their batter needs a little work compared to other local pancake houses. Everything else was nothing short of perfect. Will make this our regular breakfast place.
