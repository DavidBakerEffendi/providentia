Look, I'm Asian alright? I mean, just barely, as I'm only 1/2 Japanese and I'm 3rd generation but still, I grew up eating my Grandma's sushi so I feel I know way more than you trendy white people when it comes to evaluating sushi. Then again, maybe I don't. 

Anyway, in my less than humble opinion, quality in sushi comes down to many things, but only one thing seems to be different from place to place here in the GTA - the rice. The rice is key. To me, that's the difference between good sushi and bad sushi and the rice at Sushi Island is always quality. Sweet, sticky and fresh, this place rocks because of the rice. 

I usually go for the all-you-can-eat special. If you're a maki fan like myself there's no need to go for the more expensive options 2 or 3, there's enough variety in option 1 for $13.99 ($2 more Friday-Sunday). Start off basic with a crunchy roll and a spicy tuna handroll to appreciate the rice and then go nuts, there literally are no bad options. 

Other than the AYCE specials, I remember the bento boxes being good value and quite substantial and the tempura is always nice as well.

A great place to eat basic, fresh, cheap sushi.
