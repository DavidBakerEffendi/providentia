Everything about this place is nice. It's nicely located, nicely decorated, very nice portions. They only thing not nice, is the flavors, and that's only cause they're amazing. This place somehow never dissapoints me. I don't know why I don't get there more often though. Today i ordered the gyro meal, and it was right on point. It's gyro meat, with rice, salad, and even the gyro bread on the side. They give you butter, tzatziki sauce and Italian dressing. All fresh and delicious. I'm not a fan of tzatziki, because to me it's always just so blah... But not here though. This sauce is exploding with dill and lemon flavors. Really good. At $9 this dish is good value, so high score today. Service is done just right and I didn't have to wait long for my meal. I asked for an extra dressing  no fuzz about it, so just an easy going way to do Mediterranean
