Ellen and I recently ate lunch for the first time at Nonna Urban Eatery, but certainly not the last. It is one of the very best new additions to Old Town Scottsdale!

She had the veggie omelette with mozzarella, available only on weekends, and I had the chicken Milanese. Upon arrival at our table, the dishes looked so good that I took pictures of them, posted with this review. 

Our superb server was Valentina, a smart and enthusiastic lady who told us about appealing upcoming additions to their offerings. She is a great representative of Nonna Urban Eatery. The  owner and chef, Gian Franco Brugaletta, graciously came around to check on our experience. His passion for food is infectious and we're lucky to be among his diners. 

Nona Urban Eatery is warm and inviting. Their food is excellent. Service is terrific. We're looking forward to returning to this gem!
