Where am I?  Broadview Heights?  I could just as easily be in trendy spots like E. 4th, Tremont or Ohio City.

Cork and Cleaver is a MUCH needed addition to the bland suburban offerings that surround it.  

We first started our with the Whiskey Fizz and their version of the Moscow Mule.  The whiskey had been aged in house with spices and herbs, and everyone was amazed at the smooth, yet strong taste.  My Mule was great.  Having just gotten one at Society Lounge for exactly twice the price, I was more than pleased with my mule!  I thought it tasted similar, if not better to the expensive mule in the "trendier" spot.

We started out with the frites with gravy - a glorious poutine with sausage and savoryness.  There was plenty to share, so much so that we could have halfed the order and still had a good appetizer.  For our entrees, we had the fancy omelet, the Gnocchi with Lamb and the Fried Chicken with Mac/Cheese.  Yum!  Everything was top notch!  The omelets was one of the best, I think I'd ever had (I know, an Omelet usually just tastes like an omelets!), the Mac/Cheese was to die for and who knew a fancy gyro would be so satisfying!  It was excellent food, hand-made and obviously very fresh!  As I was leaving, I saw a whole pig being broken apart in the kitchen - this stuff is done right!

For desert we had the pear cassolute with brie ice cream and the apple pierogies.  Yum!  Nothing was too sweet, but the flavors married so well with one another. 
 
Overall, I was blown away!  Great drinks, fresh food.  Very fork to table, and who would have thought you'd find that in Broadview Heights?!?!
