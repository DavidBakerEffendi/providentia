Came in from PHX to give Shabu Shabu Paradise a try based on the recommendation of a local friend. 

In a word....fantastic. The food was delish and the service was wonderful. It takes some time to get your food after you order because everything is cut fresh that day so be prepared to wait a bit. However, it is SO worth the wait! We had both Shabu-Shabu and sukiyaki and omg...yum.  The dipping sauces were good accompaniments and overall I can't say enough great things about this place!

The service was attentive, kind, and very helpful as for some of us, it was our first time. 

Can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas! :)
