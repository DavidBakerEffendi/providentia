We had to stop by the Apple store to replace my phone so we decided to head to CPK for lunch. It's been quite sometime since my boyfriend and I both had been to one so it sounded like a good idea.

We got seated right away as it was just lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't to busy. We were instantly helped and our server took our drink orders. He also asked if we wanted bread and oli which we declined (as we knew we'd be eating enough carbs). He promptly brought us our drinks and what I loved about it I ordered a flavored ice tea to which he suggested me trying before adding any sweetener in it as they use syrup to make the flavors. It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did. 

The manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect! About 1/4 of the way down on my ice tea our server brought me another one. 

The server asked if we wanted any desert which we were stuffed anyways. My boyfriend and I both said this was one of the best service we had received from any restaurant in a long time. As we left my boyfriend mad a point to tell the manager how great the service was.
