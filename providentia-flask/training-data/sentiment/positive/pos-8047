Ok this place is AMAZING! Dream come true for ice cream lovers, not only they have tons of flavors to choose from, you get to sample them all for free if you wish. Desyrre the owner is beyond nice and will go out of her way to make sure you have an awesome visit.
 They have something for every palate, from traditional chocolate, that is anything but traditional (mousse consistency that for those chocolate lovers like me is pure heaven) to the more adventourous pear and gorgonzolla that is to die for, the corn one is delicious as well. Everything is made fresh daily and on site and is priced well.
So next time you're Downtown check them out! you won't regret it and I can assure you, you will be hooked.
