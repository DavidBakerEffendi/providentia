I enjoy so many things from here. My go-to dishes are: jajangmyeon or ganjajang, oxtail soup, soondubu, and combo plate (meat jun + teriyaki chicken + kalbi ribs). As soon as you enter, they'll greet you and ask how many people. If you're by yourself or party of two, you can choose wherever you want to sit. If you're a large group, finding a table shouldn't take too long either.

The restaurant is owned by husband and wife from Hawaii and Korea, respectively. Hence, the Hawaiian and Korean fusion (although the Hawaiian food here is the Asian part of Hawaiian cuisine).

The menu is divided into three parts: Hawaiian/local favorites, Korean, and Chinese. Anything from any of these menus is yummy! I have never had a bad experience here. Oh, and they have a good selection of Hawaiian Sun, for all you kama'aina peeps.

EDIT: Another fave of mine is the sweet and sour pork from the Korean menu. It's a large portion so bring family and friends!
