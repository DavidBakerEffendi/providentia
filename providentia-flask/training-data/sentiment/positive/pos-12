Even though it's a small shop hidden in Circus Circus, they serve the best crepe ever...and that's saying a lot considering I've had a lot of crepes during my lifetime. It's $10 for a huge crepe and you get to pick two toppings of your choice. Add another dollar to put yogurt on the crepe. This is my second time here, and I feel like I'm going to come here every time I go to Vegas from now on!
