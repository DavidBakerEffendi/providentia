Ultra feast at its finest!!
After viewing an option for breakfast pizza on their brunch menu online, we just had to go.  Nobody can deny that the 2 most delicious and important meals of the day are breakfast and pizza meal.  Combine the 2, AMAZING!!
We also had the French toast with blueberry cream cheese and maple syrup.  Did I mention the bread was French with raisins and pecans?  Oh yes, you should be jealous of my Sunday brunch.
We also shared some yummy potatoes and giant pieces of crispy bacon.  I couldn't properly review this establishment without trying half the menu.  I would be doing you Yelpers a disservice.
The $3 mimosas and bloody Maris were a fabulous deal to accompany our ultra feast.
We had stragglers in our party, all women, but they didn't make us wait until everyone arrived to seat us.  (I hate that.  Let me sit down and drink).  Our server was fantastic, friendly, and on top of everything.  He was also friendly to the baby in our party.  Servers normally hate children.  
It's just off the light rail route.  There isn't anything negative I can say about this place.  My stomach is so happy I took it here!!
