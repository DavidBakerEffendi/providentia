Easily one of the best cheaper lunches I've ever had! Since the bulk on Montreal restaurants are on the pricey side, we needed a few lunch options on the lower cost side to balance things out and this was one of the places I had bookmarked. And it did NOT disappoint. it's a short simple menu. it's literally chicken and fries, some poutiness and a few sandwiches. that's it! We split a half chicken with fries, rice and salad, a small poutine classic and this beef sandwich. Total bill was maybe $30. I can't explain how much food it was, will add pics to this review soon! the quality was insane., the chicken and fries were out of this world. The gravy in the poutine was just perfect and the beef sandwich was one of the best things I ate the whole weekend!
