Was eating here was an excellent experience? Chile it is the best soul food in Vegas. I'm from the dirty south trust this is a must buy eat & yelp.
However the food is a tid bit over priced. It's great home cooking that you can title soul food. But the over all price just does not sit that well with me. From the pictures I posted you can see I got the catfish. The sweet potatoes were not sweet enough they had tons of strings. Not everyone can fix candy yams or sweet potatoes yet overall...
 It was so good I had it two days in a row. Minus the sweet potatoes...
On the menu they have ribs catfish black eyed peas cornbread & a host of other southern items such as caramel cake. If u ask me this is the only place that has soul food in Vegas. Other places fall short & disappoint but this place is on point.
