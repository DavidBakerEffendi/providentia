Carl's was awesome from start to finish! We decided on a pirate themed wedding and wanted a fun cake for it.

My wife and I didn't know what to expect at the cake tasting. We are the first among our social group to get married. After meeting Josie, we realized she knew exactly what she was doing and gave us some fantastic ideas and prospects. We decided on a treasure chest cake after getting some fun options. All of the flavor samples were amazing but we couldn't resist ordering the hazelnut apricot cake. We happily dropped a deposit.

We stayed in touch mostly by email, except to pay over the phone with our credit card. It was a snap.

On our big day, Josie herself delivered the cake and gave us pointers on how to cut it. We were awful people and didn't quite get our timing right. She graciously waited for us while we scrambled to let her into the public park location we had rented for the day. Make sure someone is available to receive the cake! The delivery was punctual!

To be honest, I think there were more pictures of the cake than of the wedding. We were relieved that our guests were as pleased with the cake as we were.
