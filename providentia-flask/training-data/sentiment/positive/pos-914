Really really liked this place.  A needed edition to New York New York's dining options.  Especially for breakfast options as I do not like any of the others.  The portions were extremely large and there were many interesting and enjoyable things on the menu.  The truffled lobster roll was relish as were the crispy brussel sprouts and fries two ways.  In fact we like this place so much we went there four times during our stay.   I guarantee you will not go hungry here and the quality and service are worth the price.  Speaking of the price this is one of the more reasonable options on the strip!
