i love, love, love Ling & Louie's. we live close by and visit somewhat frequently and we've never had a disappointing meal or less-than stellar service. if you like seared tuna, the black orchid ahi tuna dish is super delicious and filling (the portion is huge!). i always have a tough time deciding between that, the monsoon chicken and shrimp, wango mango shrimp and drunken shrimp (i like my seafood!). oh, i will say this - the starters are pretty good but we were a little less than impressed with the ahi lettuce wraps - really wasn't our thing but i'm sure it's quite tasty to someone else. we actually brought the boyfriend's mom here when she was in town for 5 days - on her last night she insisted on going back to L&L for a second time in her 5 day visit! the cocktails are decently priced even not during happy hour. i think the thai mai is around $5 and it's a pretty sizable glass with a good pour.
