If you want fresh, homemade, and absolutely delicious pizzas and entrees, this is the spot! The pizzas are the best I've had in Phoenix and even, yes, in New York! To top it off, it's locally owned and operated with kind and passionate staff!  This place has something for everyone and for me, they have VEGAN!  And get this my VEGAN and allergic friends, if any are reading this, no fear to eat out here ---- they have a notebook with all ingredients listed for your review!  Hands down Italian vegan food!  Very unique dishes and it's not plane Jane food!  Flavors will pop in your mouth and you will quickly become addicted!  Homemade breads and crusts that you won't believe!  I want to eat everything at once!  From the pizzas, to the calzones, the meatballs, the pastas, everything is amazing here!  If you haven't been, I strongly encourage you to drop by and then you will for sure be a regular!  Oh, I left out the yummy desserts too!! Amongst the non-vegan desserts, they also have homemade vegan cheesecake and doughnuts!  Absolutely the best restaurant I've found in town, seriously!  I want to call out Sean that has been so welcoming and is friendly and kind when I'm asking for special requests on my pizza!
