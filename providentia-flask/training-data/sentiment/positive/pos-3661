I had the peanut soup with the rice balls and goat meat. Everything was so fresh and delicious (unlike most American food), the soup was exceptionally seasoned, the goat was nice and juicy and tender. When I arrived, DJ Moe was playing some good ol classic music that reminded me of home and many times I was tempted to get up and start dancing! The suya was soft and juicy as well. The food was amazing, the service was amazing, and the atmosphere was amazing. Overall 10/10 experience, would definitely eat here again.
