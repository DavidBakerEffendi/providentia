This is my fave Thai place, but it has recently let me down a little. Like always, I crave Thai food and I always always always come here. I am in a very committed relationship with this place because the food is divine. I called for takeout the other night and called 10+ times and no one picked up. It was a normal day and it had to be open. I'm still going to give it 5 stars though, because I have been coming here for years and have yet to find a Thai place on a higher level than here. The duck is key, the coconut soup is key, and the Pad Thai will always be key. Their Thai tea is the best, no argument there. If you like fish, get the fish in the chili sauce. Prices always range, but it's worth it. The shrimp wrapped in rice paper and chicken skewers are delicious appetizers also! The Yum Neur is a delicious steak salad and I highly recommend. Overall delicious! Service can be slow but it's worth it for good food.
