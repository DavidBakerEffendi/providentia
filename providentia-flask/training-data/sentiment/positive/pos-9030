We had been to Savoy for brunch many moons ago. We opted to try dinner. I made reservations. We were there a few minutes early and we were greeted by a friendly hostess who told us it would be just a few minutes until our table was ready. It was only a few minutes and the hostess came and got us. The vibe at Savoy is modern and chic, very relaxing. We were waited on promptly by our waitress, Nikki, who was friendly, knowledgeable, & attentive our entire dinner. She was there but not noticeable. Our water glasses were full and she was quick with the offer of additional rounds of drinks.  She was terrific! We were given a bread basket and then a refill. The bread was warm and delicious and consisted od four kinds. The jalape√±o cheese bread was the right amount of heat and cheese. There was an olive bread. I am not an olive fan but, wow! There was one with sesame seeds on it, more plain but still great and then there was an herby bun, awesome....salty yet herby tasting. We ordered apps. I got the chocolate butternut squash raviolis with lobster. OMG! Who would have thought that chocolate raviolis filled with a butternut squash filling covered in a cheese cream sauce with lobster works yet somehow it is just, wow! It works...boy, does it work! The hubby got the fried zucchini. The zucchini was lightly breaded and not at all greasy and fresh. On to entrees... the hubby got the Delmonico steak cooked medium rare and served with green beans and mashed potatoes. It was so good. The steak was phenomenal and the potatoes were herby and awesome! I got the lobster risotto. Creamy, cheesy goodness chalked full of big chunks of lobster and cooked perfectly. And then dessert...the caramel chocolate torte with cappuccino ice cream. Geez! It doesn't get any better! The ice cream was just loaded with a cappuccino flavor that many try to get right but do not. They got it here! From beginning to end just perfection all the way, 5 stars indeed!
