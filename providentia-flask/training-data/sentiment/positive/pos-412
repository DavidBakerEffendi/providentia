This small corner restaurant wasn't busy,  but it should be.  Just like the title of the place, it has a variety of dishes from different parts of Asia.  It does have some interesting dishes like the Malaysian roti.  Crispy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside, it is hard to beat dipping an Indian based bread into a Malaysian (like a Thai based) yellow curry.  I then moved on to the Pad See-Yew with shrimp which was really good and like many of the dishes you can pick which protein you want (tofu, chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or fish).  I like flavor more than spicy so I enjoyed both dishes.  Wash it down with a Thai iced tea.  What I liked about this place is it can cater to both spicy and non spicy personalities.  This would be a good option if someone was vegetarian or pescatarian (not sure about vegan). The staff were friendly and can guide you to a dish if you are not sure of what you may like.  No military discount. Prices are not cheap but fair for the quality and amount of food you get. Conclusion:  All these delicious carbs put me in a food coma.
