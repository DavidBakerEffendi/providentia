I visit this place randomly when seeing a friend in the area. 

What I love is that the staff is bare and family owned. It's a house and the food is decent, though nothing special. 

The staff is incredibly friendly. The coffee is good from what I hear and I cannot stop looking at all the things in the house (the different rooms). Seriously.

It's peaceful and enjoyable. Now if only they would multiply because I'm nowhere near there on a regular basis.
