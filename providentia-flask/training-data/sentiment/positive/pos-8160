Located in the part of the shopping plaza near Gander Mountain, MOD Pizza is a neat concept. It's "Chipotle" meets pizza, but they don't charge extra for the "guacamole." Yes, they have a handful of set pizzas on the menu board but as they move your pie along the assembly line, you can add as many toppings as you like. No extra charges!

I looked over the menu board and settled on the "Season's Mod" which had roasted Brussels Sprouts, red onions, gorgonzola and a balsamic glaze. And while that probably would have been enough, I also took the recommendation of one of the Mod Squad and added chicken. Good idea!

A few minutes later, my name was shouted and I stepped up to pick up my pie. Sliced into four neat quarters, the thin crust pizza base was nice and crunchy. Plenty of toppings and it tasted absolutely amazing. Full of great flavors. Very enjoyable.

Neat vibe in this fast casual restaurant. It's not a date night place, more the sort that you can bring the whole family.
