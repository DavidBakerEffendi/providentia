I didn't even want to give it fine stars so people do not find this cute place full of cuteness. Small very small but awesome. The Asian bartender was awesome, nice and funny and knew his beer. Then there was an Amazon man bartender who was hilariously out of place..... but somehow fit.  So many beers to pick from, you can also buy to go. The bottles of wine are also to go. They have games to play and some food but not dinner style only snacks. Very nice place
