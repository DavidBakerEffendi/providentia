808 tapas is wonderful. Nice simple interior....tons of options to choose from on the menu with simple descriptions. 

I came here for lunch with some friends starving and left happy as can be...
Staff is great...I love Hawaiian hospitality. So friendly and bubbly. 

I got the following... 

Spicy tuna cracker 
Chef suggestion...I was craving a spicy tuna with crispy rice but they didn't have that...
Amazing. So delicious. Spicy tuna on top of a fried seaweed wasabi flavored cracker.  Probably my favorite from the entire meal.
** liked it so much I ordered 2 :P 

Yellowtail sashimi 
Buttery.  Fresh. 
Thumbs up

808 ceviche 
Sweeter than your average ceviche because of the mango. Served with taro chips.  Not my favorite but not bad.  I just love ceviche and this wasn't what I expected.  

Adegeshi tofu 
Lightly fried with Japanese mushrooms and a nice teriyaki sauce. Very good. 

Beef tataki
Served with garlic ponzu. Thumbs up.  Yum. 

Yellowtail jalapeño 
Served with a yuzu cilantro sauce with cucumber and a piece of jalapeño. Obviously I'm a fan of their yellowtail. *-*

Chicken katsu 
Very nicely done. Thumbs up.  

Buta hara sautee 
Pork belly and asparagus sauteed in a garlic soy sauce.  The pork belly was cut up in cubes, personally a bit to salty for me but my friend loved it.  

Id come here more often of it was closer to where I live...but if ever in the area Id definitely stop in.  Try them out *-*
