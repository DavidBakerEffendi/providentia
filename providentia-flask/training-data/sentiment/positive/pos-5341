The dynamic duo working here impress me with their food, attitude and zest for cooking up tacos and burritos. These are solid lunch items, guaranteed to keep you going through your day, not some cutesy bar snack. A nice big chunk of fish, lean and well-seasoned chorizo, and pastor full of flavour these double shelled tacos are bursting out of the tray which barely holds the two of them.
The sauces are a must-try! You need to go alongside the counter and grab a plastic cup to take to your seat at the back of this incredible culinary experience of a food court. There are three sauces and they are all worth a taste.
I need to come back to try one of their burritos, if the tacos are any indication, the burrito will be the best I've ever tried, and blow everything else out of the Mexi-To landscape.
