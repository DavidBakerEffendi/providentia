Our fingertips brushed together ever so slightly as I gave her my card. "I'll take The Slut." Coy smiles were exchanged, a heated gaze was met with anticipation, and I went to go find a seat, eager to get my hands on the beauty known as The Slut. 

Okay, it didn't happen quite like that but I imagine that's how Chris Tucker felt when he was at the massage parlor in Rush Hour 2.

Ever since I saw my California friends posting about Eggslut, I've been wanting to give them a try. Now that they found a home at The Cosmopolitan, I figured why the heck not! 

After a 25ish minute wait, which goes by fast when you have great company, I got The Slut and The Gaucho Sandwich. The Slut was super buttery and creamy! Just mix your potato puree and coddled eggs together and slap it onto a slice of baguette. It was more enjoyable than I thought it would be. The  baguette gives it a crunchy element it really needs. I wish they gave one more slice of baguette though because I was left with some potato and eggs mixture that I ate by itself. It was reminiscent of buttery baby food. As for The Gaucho, oh my. The wagyu tri-tip was juicy, the egg was cooked perfect, I love the arugula, and the chimichurri was also flavorful. All this was washed down with an overpriced orange juice and a tiny overpriced coffee. I was energized for the rest of the day though. Coffee + food = Instant humanized Joyce W. 

All in all, I really enjoyed my lunch at Eggslut and wouldn't mind stopping by again. Good on Cosmo for bringing in more great eateries! 

Dat price doe: $37.85 for the Gaucho Sandwich ($15), cold brew ($5), The Slut ($10), and OJ ($5). At least you can use your food money to earn Identity Points.
