Super fun! Took my 3 year old and we had a blast. Place is super clean and well thought out. So nice it feels like it should be in Scottsdale. We live in the area and it's great to finally have something to do with our kid that isn't Peter Piper. I was also really surprised how much fun I had in the laser tag. I think I had more fun than my daughter ha. Oh and they have thrifty ice cream! That definitely brought back some great memories of my childhood. Definitely recommend and great to have such a nice facility in our neighborhood.
