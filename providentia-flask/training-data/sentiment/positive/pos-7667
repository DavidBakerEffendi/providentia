The service here is excellent. Prompt. Courteous. Helpful. The restaurant is clean. 

And the food was downright tasty!! I arrived with a group of 18. The servers were so friendly and fast. I ordered the southwest biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. It was delicious. The syrup was offered warm to the pancake/waffle orders.
