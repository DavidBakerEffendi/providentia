This is probably an over rating but this was my one experience here. I really wanted ice cream and desided to walk in here. Saw ice cream cookie sandwich for $4.95 and was sold. 

I got a red velvet and white chip macadamia cookie with pistachio ice cream between. This was probably one of the best ice cream sandwiches I've had. So good!!!
