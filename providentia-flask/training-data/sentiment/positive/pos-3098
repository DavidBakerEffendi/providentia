Ding ding ding, we have a winner here! At long last, an Indian restaurant that manages to marry good food, large-ish portions, and cheap prices with a clean, balanced airy atmosphere. 

The restaurant itself is breezy and has wood floors with tablecloths. The waitstaff is very friendly and jovial, and the food is really delicious, albeit predictable (all the usual suspects are on the menu, nothing really experimental). Portions are unusually large, bucking the trend of soupbowls full of sauce and maybe a piece of meat or two at most other Indian restaurants.

This has become my new go-to place for Indian, and that's saying a lot since I live around the corner from Dev and am 5 minutes from Jean Talon, a.k.a. Little Delhi, or whatever the euphemism is for Indiantown these days. Enjoy!
