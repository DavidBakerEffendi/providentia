Second time here and its confirmed, I love it.  Service this morning was fantastic.  Granted you order at the counter but the fellow who took my order and manned the til was awake, smiling and and made very a very pleasant transaction.  This is not always the case at coffee bars and is often commented on (at other establishments of course)  No superior barrista attitude here, just a group of folks who look like they enjoy what they do and working with each other.  It was also nice to see a fair number of regulars that have a rapport with the staff.  Especially noting that it appears to be the last day for someone who is departing for a European adventure.  The coffee was delicious, Ameriano Misto with a pretty design that I unfortunately smudged before taking my photo.  Oh well the photograh cannot relay the taste.   Hot, strong and just the right amount of steamed milk.  The Chocolate Croissant, well actually a Pain Au Chocolate was perfect.  Dark chocolate that has the right amount of bite and sweet and a lovely light flakey pastery.  All in all I felt very French with my petite dejeuner this morning as I dawdled over my pastery and coffee.  Watching the other customers and getting a giggle over the variety of morning moods.  The spectrum runs from "don't talk to me before I have my morning coffee" and "I am a morning person and really happy to be here".  Look forward to the occassional morning relaxation here again.
