The homemade gnocchi is absolutely delightful! Such an easy dish to mess up - so easily gummy or chewy. These gnocchi are so soft and pillowy - like clouds! I've tried four of the sauce options for gnocchi and the four cheese sauce is my favorite. I could eat that on any type of pasta. Have a glass of Riesling and enjoy this hidden gem in Charlotte!
