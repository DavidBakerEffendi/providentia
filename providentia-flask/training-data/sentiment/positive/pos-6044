This has been my go to coffee shop for about ten years if my memory is correct.  Its local. I love that.  Its in my hood. I really love that.  

There will be days when I have a thirty minute break and I am ten minutes away and ill drive out of my way for my Steve's fix.  The convenience Steve's Espresso being in my neighborhood is just one of the reasons I go there.  They have great tasting coffee. 

There Cappuccinos are spot on.  My regular drink is the Red Eye with vanilla which has enough caffeine to keep me hyped up all more.  There vanilla lattes are amazing.  As for there food I haven't  tried everything I am kind of a creature of habit.  But I can recommend the greek frittata, the breakfast brioche, and there chocolate chip scones.  

Long live Steves Espresso.
