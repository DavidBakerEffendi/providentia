This is such a hidden gem!! Came in for a coffee only to find they have SO many incredible combinations of drinks, and you can customize with so many flavors. Did I mention they are half of the price of a Starbucks coffee, and so much tastier. It was so good we came back yesterday for coffee and had lunch - homemade tuna salad is DELICIOUS, and the staff is so friendly. This is an absolute gem, I can't wait to come when it's warm and enjoy a tea and lunch!! Huge drink menu, even bigger breakfast and lunch menu. Thank you ladies for being so personable & for my favorite new coffee shop!
