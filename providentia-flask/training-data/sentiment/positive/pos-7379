The go to Thai restaurant now has a cool sounding name.  Come on people -- Thailicious.  Thailicious has all of the standard fare in varying degrees of spiciness.  We usually order our food to go.  I can attest to the Green Curry and Drunken Noodles being good.  The location is in a strip mall with ample parking near Walgreens and Fresh and Easy.
