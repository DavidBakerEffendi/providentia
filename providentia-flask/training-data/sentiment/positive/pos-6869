This is a wonderful little grocery! I had a French dip sandwich and it was amazing! The bread was fresh and moist! The meat was super tender and filled with delicious flavors! After the sandwich I could not resist trying some of their crembrule and it was FANTASTIC!!! It was nice and creamy but not to sweet. And the staff was very courteous and friendly.
