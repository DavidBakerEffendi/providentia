This tiny little breakfast spot in the cosmopolitan makes probably the best breakfast sandwich I've had in a while and at a great price. I ordered the sausage breakfast sandwich and loved every last bite , From The fresh  bread to the delicious house made sausage inside with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg etc! It's a generous sized sandwich and does get messy if you choose sunny side or over easy egg inside BUT you can also get your egg scrambled. The staff was also very efficient and friendly. Their specialty is breakfast sandwiches and the location itself Is not huge so it's not really a sit down restaurant, although There is some seating but very limited , most people take their orders to go . If you're hungry make sure you get there a little early because there is usually a lineup but I can't say we waited overly long to be served. All in all I wish they had a location in my city so I could enjoy one of their sandwiches any time !
