I think this is the best restaurant in Charlotte.
Think of it as a seafood restaurant and raw bar plus imaginative sushi.
You can either sit at formal tables or at high tops in the bar area.
I've done both but this time we were in the formal dining room.
Their signature dish is sake marinated Chilean sea bass and as always it didn't disappoint.
I had a steamed lobster, very nice we also had sushi bento box, salmon sashimi and calamari.
Well enough about the food, the service was great, informative, friendly and efficient.
If you are in Charlotte have a fair bit of credit on your credit card I recommend trying this fine restaurant.
