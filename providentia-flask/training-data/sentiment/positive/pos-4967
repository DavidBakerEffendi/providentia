The food is great here, for a price.  Though if you look hard enough, you can find a decent priced meal.  I came for a holiday meal with some friends this past weekend.  There are many new restaurants and businesses in the area, so it was fairly packed (not to mention all of the out-of-towners for the bowl games).

As usual the soft pretzel appetizer was amazing, a double order for the 5 of us was sufficient.  I got the BBQ chicken sandwich (which was about $10).  It was well worth it on delicious tomato/cheesy bread that was roughly the size of a frisbee.  

Though we were all stuffed, we splurged on the "I Declaire" Eclaire dessert.  It was a good choice to split among the 5 of us, though there was still some left over at the end it was not due to taste but due to limitations of the human body...
