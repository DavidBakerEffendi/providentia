The Bagel Cafe is the premier breakfast/brunch destination in Las Vegas.  The service, (while at times very busy), is always friendly and the food is great.  The feeling going there is just like an old school Jewish deli back on the East Coast.  Get there before 10 in the morning on the weekends because it gets really busy.  Fantastic place and I would recommend it to anyone.
