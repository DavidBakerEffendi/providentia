Very good flavor and attentive staff! My wife and I had a couple of our favorite dishes and were pleased with the taste. Our water glasses were filled multiple times by the waitresses.

The hostess was very personable and stopped by the table a couple times. 

The portion size was good for the price and entres came with a pot with rice for the table to share.

Overall, great dining experience and we will be back.
