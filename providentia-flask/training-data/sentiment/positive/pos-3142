Let me say this, I have searched my entire life for a burger as delicious as the one I recently enjoyed at Harvey's Wineburger.  This burger had more flavor than any that I have ever tasted in my entire life.  I had the garlic patty melt, with a side of onion rings.  The patty melt included this amazing garlic parmesan sauce, along with the crispiest bacon I have seen.  The only potential drawback to their burgers is that they are so juicy that they are messy and soak through the bun.  However, that does not matter to me because the flavor was unreal.  My only regret is that I have lived in Phoenix for 13 years and this was the first time I visited. Needless to say, this will not be the last. This has now become my go-to restaurant that I will be taking out of town visiters to.
