This place is unbelievable! The design the cleanliness the staff the owner the food "ALL ON POINT!" That louie and anna sauce is unlike anything I've ever had and have craved it since me and my daughter stopped in! Along with the salt and vinigar dry rub I live for! The texas toast, would be on my tray at my last meal! It's been over a week and I need to make it back! I should have listened when the owner said,"I'll see ya tomorrow!"... Yes my friend! I WILL see you tomorrow! Get your tummies in here and try this food you'll come in a stranger and leave as part of a family, you'll see what I mean when you do.
