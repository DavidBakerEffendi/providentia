So I was feeling a little blue today, it was gloomy and cold in Vegas and needed something to pick me up. Great food always helps to get me in the mood, LOL so I drove 15 miles to have a late lunch here. 

This time I had the Grilled mango salad, Basil fried rice and Chicken Red curry.
Excellent choices. The red curry was exceptional. Since Pan Asian is not close to where I live, I ordered all 3 dishes with the intent of taking home the rice and curry. David was wondering if someone else was joining me because I ordered a lot of food for 1 person, LOL. 

I love the food and love the personal service. The owners - David and Lisa remember you and make you feel at home. That's very rare when you dine at Asian restaurants so they deserve a 5 star rating.
