As good as it gets for fine-dining sushi on the Las Vegas Strip. 
Actually my fav for strip sushi..

Service is excellent while food is exquisite. 

This place is pricey but worth it for the quality and environment, every now and then.

They do have a decent little happy hour that is worth checking out too!
