This place is awesome. I make it a point to try the tonkatsu ramen at every ramen joint I eat at. Their Stamina Tonkatsu ranks up there with some of the best I've tried outside of Japan. We also had the karaage with rice. The flavor is good and the meat is juicy. We'll definitely be back as we saw a couple sizzling dishes go by to other tables as we were leaving. One was a gyoza and I'm not sure about the other. 

Service was very attentive. Always made sure our drinks were full and made it a point to check on us periodically throughout our meal. Many more dishes to try so we'll see you again soon!
