When I get a touch of the homesick, I head to The Root. Actually, when I get a touch of the travel-sick, I should say. It reminds me of a small handful of shops in Chicago but also a few that I've encountered throughout the country. It feels familiar because it has everything I want in a great coffee shop - excellent music, lots of outlets, no pressure to finish up and get out, friendly counter help (but for one time and I chalk that up to a fluke), delicious coffee and the strange ability to suck me in, force my watch forward by three hours and not make me feel like I've wasted my time.

The last sandwich I had involved beets so how could it be bad? The side of potatoes were a little underdone but everything else made up for it. I do wish they had some non-pastry breakfast options but for all the things I love about the place, that's not a detraction. 

Did I mention the music? Ok, good.
