Blown away by the food and atmosphere of the place. I hate finding parking on Mill, but will definitely make another trip back to this place. The potatoes were DELICIOUS. They looked sort of plain, but they made up in flavor and taste. I like these potatoes more then Snooze hash browns 

Highly Recommend:
-Chipotle Burrito 
-Red velvet waffles
