This place is truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh. Lydiah's is serving up authentic Kenyan cuisine in downtown Pittsburgh. 

She has assigned dishes to each day and it comes small or large. Nice portion size and very tasty food nonetheless. Today is Thursday, which is the curry spaghetti, green beans, and rib. Random combination but absolutely delicious.

She serves an authentic dish on Monday's, Wednesday is chicken, and Fish in Friday. If your looking for something different than your normal go to for lunch I recommend trying this place out.
