Lumiere? C'est manifique! What a truly enjoyable experience it was dining at Lumiere. Admittedly, this was a place I'd never heard of until a fellow yelp friend suggested trying it for restaurant week so I was completely unsure of what to expect.

Lumiere is literally tucked into the shopping center that's directly across the lot from the Myers Park Harris Teeter. Upon walking in, I was greeted by the hostess and led directly back to the table. The interior is not exactly big on space but that lends to the general ambiance and intimacy of the place.

We were greeted by our waiter for the night, Joey, who was AWESOME. He provided useful suggestions and was not shy in giving his opinions and personal menu favorites. I went with a rose champagne and gave my order from the restaurant week menu:

For the starter, rather amuse-bouche, we were presented with a mini roll and sweet corn bisque. So fresh and good to the last drop.

1st course- jumbo shrimp bouillabaisse. Jumbo piece of shrimp, jumbo punch of flavor. The broth was down right drinkable.

2nd course - pork with lobster mac & cheese. So flavorful and the mac & cheese was perfectly cooked.

3rd (dessert) course - chocolate torte. This was soooo rich but it was exactly what I was craving. I enjoyed every last bite!

Definitely a five star dining experience from start to finish. I cannot recommend Lumiere highly enough.
