There seem to be two kinds of Vietnamese places in the U.S.:  Those that have some truly authentic dishes made with weird animal organs and very little vegetables, and those -- like Noodles Ranch -- which are all about very fresh veggies and "clean" preparation.  Noodles Ranch represents the best of this type of Vietnamese restaurant and I consider it a real find.

Upon entry you can feel that there is a "lightness" to the energy here.  Refreshingly quiet, there is no television.  The staff appear to be family and are efficient, professional and peaceful people.  

My girlfriend is celiac so this means she not only has to avoid wheat but is also physically sensitive to food quality in general.  Noodles Ranch passes with flying colors for her.  

I highly recommend a visit to Noodles Ranch.
