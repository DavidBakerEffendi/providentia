I don't give many 5stars but this place is well deserving.  I had the grilled cheese with Brie and bacon on pear bread.  We also had a green chilli Mac and cheese.  If you like Mac and cheese, do yourself a favor and get it....you will not be disappointed.  Kudos to this restaurant, wished they had one in Gilbert.   Will be back though.
