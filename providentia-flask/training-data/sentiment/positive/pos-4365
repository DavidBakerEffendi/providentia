In case you were wondering, my lunch consisted of the best damn veggie hotdog, with a toasted bun, a layer of grilled ghost pepper cheese, spicy mustard and veggie chili.  
To say I'm full and happy is an understatement.

Vic has awesome food, great prices and some funny conversations to keep you entertained while you wait for heaven on a bun topped with your choice of flavored. 
My lunch was so great yesterday with the vinegar bomb that I had to go back for another today.  He's friendly and remembers everything!  You gotta have a dog here!
