One of my favourite ayce sushi places. If it wasn't so far from where I lived it would be my go to place. Whenever it's my mom or my birthday, we come here for dinner.

So food wise, everything I've had is good. The sashimi is so fresh and cut thick. They give salmon belly which a lot of places don't usually. They have herring sashimi and octopus sashimi which is rare for ayce. If they had squid too I would probably live here. The salmon roses are just salmon, Japanese mayo and tobiko which is perfect since other places put rice in it to fill you up. 

The all time favourite for my mom and I is the fusion roll. It's like a California roll with butterfish on top then Japanese mayo torched and sauce poured on top. Idk what it is but it's the best. Try it!!!

The service is good, there's always different servers but Carmen is very friendly and always checking up. There's also another guy that idk the name of but he's pretty funny in a deadpan kinda way haha. 

Out of all the ayce sushi places I've been to this is the best for me.
