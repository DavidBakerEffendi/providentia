Thank you Juan and Alex.  The service at this Subway store is friendly and fast.  I appreciate dining here.  I am a frequent diner here.  I am pleased to say everyone seems comfortable here.  It's easy to stay and chat even if it's past midnight.  I have brought friends and family here after picking them up from the airport with late night flights.  I can count on this stor.  I will be returning again and again as usual.  Thank you, Subway.  Thank you, Juan and Alex.
