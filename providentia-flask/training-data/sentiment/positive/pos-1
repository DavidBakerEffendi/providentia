Had my eye on this place since their opening day. Went with a large group of eleven people late Saturday night. Our group took up majority of the 'communal' table so the wait was a little longer as expected.  We had a range of people who had no idea what ramen was to hardcore fans. Each one of them really enjoyed the entire experience.

Had the Rice Kristy treat appetizers which was amazing! The perfect amount of crunch, tuna, and heat make it a great starter.

I ordered the Miso (Hungry) with the upgraded $2 spicy pork. Wow... I've been to some great ramen places across the US and this was easily the best bowl I've ever had. Writing this right now makes me want to go back right now.. 

Glad to have a place like this in South End. Looking forward to my next visit.
