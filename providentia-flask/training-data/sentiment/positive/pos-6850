Holly Molly! I'm so excited 
The decor is beautiful!
The service was GREAT!
The dessert selection was fantastic!
And most importantly it tastes AMAZING!!

Nough said!

P.s 1 question; why isn't there a massive gluten free and vegan sign with confetti and balloons outside?? I don't get it! EVERYONE MUST KNOW! (For example family and friends of those who don't have these allergies and want to provide a very thoughtful   But don't know what you specialize inn )
