3rd time to Vegas, but first time staying at The Venetian.  

We arrived around 1pm and of course our suite wasn't ready (to be expected) but we were somewhat impatient and really wanted to get into a room, so we went over some of the upgrade options and eventually got sucked into a 2 bedroom (4 bathroom!) penthouse suite.  The suite was a pretty good deal upon checkin (I think we got it for half of what it was online when we booked our room a few months ago) so I'd definitely suggest booking a cheaper room to secure your spot ahead of time, and then going over the upgrade options when you get on the property.

The Venetian has always been one of my favorite properties as the whole Venice vibe is quite cute, but after seeing our room, I was sold! 

The Penthouse suites are on the top floor (36) and our room boasted two master bedrooms, two master baths (with one have 2 separate toilet areas), steam showers, impressive dining and living room, powder room, baby grand piano etc.  Truly a spectacular room!! 

We did order quite a bit from room service and found the staff to be more than amazing, and super friendly!! 

One downside was waiting in a LONG luggage checkin line upon check out....no priority pass for us :(
