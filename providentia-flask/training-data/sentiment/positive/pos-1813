The Lemon Roll was the one thing that was a little and I mean very little disappointed, but it is extremely fresh but lacked some flavor. The service was exceptional though and she was attentive. The Fried Rice with Pork Belly was amazing!!!! The Foo Dogs was exception in take. The satay looking thinks with shrimp and jalape√±o bacon was very flavorful. The ambiance and music, primarily 80s music i.e. Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode, really nice. I really want to give it a 4.5 because the sushi was fresh but not worth paying a la carte prices when we are in the capital of all you can east sushi, but everything else was sooooo good and the prices very reasonable 6-15 per plate and the dessert was very good we ordered the Giant Fortune Cookie and the Blondie Brownie and it was good so it did deserve 5 stars. I'm in Summerlin, but it is worth the 30-40 minute drive, I'll be coming back soon.
