Yes!  Yes there is a Vietnamese fusion restaurant in random as hell Surprise and it is absolutely phenomenal!  Definitely wait for a table if this place is packed because it will be well worth your time and patience.  

I can't help myself when it comes to their ginger garlic chicken wings.  These things are flash fried to absolute crispy perfection.  You will want to lick your plate clean after sucking it off your fingers first.  

My favorite dish to get each and every time I've been in is their firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles.  This dish is what dreams are made of by far!  The noodles are not too strong and are best companion to the crispy shrimp served alongside them.  I never have any shrimp left over, because that would be blasphemy, but having the noodles for leftovers the next day is always a treat.  

This last time I went in, it was packed to the gills...but we waited it out because my gf had never been.  The owner recommended his sweet and sour ribs for her and just like the chicken wings...they had this nice crispiness to the outside and juicy on the inside.  Your food does take a while to come out, but that is because every thing is made completely fresh and not placed under any of those lame red lamps.
