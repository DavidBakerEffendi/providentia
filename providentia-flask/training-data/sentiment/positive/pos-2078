Came here for a quick lunch with a coworker. Loved their tacos, it's very tasty and they also provide condiments such as chilis, red, and green sauce, grilled onions, radishes, cucumbers, and peppers! The wait is not long but be prepared to wait for you food, it took about 15 minutes to get ours so a total of 20 minutes of waiting for our food. Their food is affordable between 2-10 dollars.
