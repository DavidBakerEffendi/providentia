I always love Uncle Tetsu's cheese cake. Whenever I am in Asia, this is always on my "must have" list. So excited to find they are now in Toronto. I passed by this location by accident. Walked in right away, got a cake & their famous rusk. Hmmm... Same taste as what I had in Japan and Taiwan. Loving it!!!
