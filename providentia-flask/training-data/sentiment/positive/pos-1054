How could I give my beloved Venetian anything less than 5 stars?

The Venetian is freaking awesome. Home to one of the most comfortable beds I ever slept in, the spacious bathrooms, the crackin day & night club, and the tasty Bouchon and Grand Luxe. Venetian has it ALL. 

I love their huge rooms where you and your 10 friends can knock out practically anywhere in the room and not feel cramped after a long night of boozing and creeping at Tao, which is located right above the casino. Venetian finds a way to accommodate any guest, whether they're young bucks like myself or chronic gamblers. Lol. Basically, just stay here and you'll experience the greatness I've been rambling on about :)
