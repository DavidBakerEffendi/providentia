I miss living so close to here. This place is amazing. I love how it's the perfect coffee and breakfast shop in the morning. A great place for a lunch or a pick me up drink. And by evening and night time it's the perfect place to gather with friends or a date and have a drink or two. 

Josh is great. He knows his stuff and is just awesome. Honestly everyone I have encountered for the most part is really cool and efficient. The owner is great too and always remembers Brian and I. We would bring my boyfriends cousins dog with us all the time to 32 Shea when we would dog sit. They have water bowls and treats for dogs. It's a great atmosphere and I miss living so close to here! Will be back soon :)
