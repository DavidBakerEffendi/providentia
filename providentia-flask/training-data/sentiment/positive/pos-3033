Have been having breakfast at this location for over twenty years and it's always a great choice. It does get busy but the wait is worth it. There is counter service for the single customers. The combo French toast and eggs is my favorite and usually I don't need to eat lunch because the portions are large. Every time I visit Vegas this is a must goto for breakfast even if my hotel has free.
