The Peppermill has always been talked about through social media!

I've heard enough about the Peppermill restaurant being a Vegas staple on the strip so I had to check it out for myself. I was craving steak for breakfast but the Americano Cafe in Caesar's Palace had their steak at a high mark up $45+!! I did some researching and found that the Peppermill's steak was only $28. So I got on a Uber for only $7 to get to the restaurant to try it out.

Excited and thrilled I was when I got there because there was no wait at all. It's located just north of Encore and across from Resorts World. The inside kinda resembled a 70's Vegas style cafe, kinda what you'd expect when the mob ran the hotels and designed it with lots and lots of velvet and 70's neon lighting. 

My Ribeye steak was huge and it came with a freshly made salad with three pieces of huge Texas style toast. The steak was cooked perfectly to what I preferred (Rare). I love my steaks bloody and juicy. From time to time, my waitress checked on me and quickly refilled my water. Just checking the decor makes you feel like you time warped back to the 70's era of Las Vegas. I consider this cafe a win win!
