Poke Express shares the same space as Island Sushi & Grill. If you are sitting on the Island Sushi side and order hot food, it will come from the Poke Express kitchen. Only cold food comes from the Island Sushi side.
I sat on the Poke Express side and ordered a poke bowl. It was huge and so glad I shared with my sister. The salmon poke was very fresh and tasty! I recommend their bowls. We also ordered the spam musubi. My only complaint, there was too much rice! Otherwise, it was good. I was totally carbed out after the meal. 

If you decide not to dine in, you can order to go. You can also order different types of poke which are weighed and priced per pound. See my uploaded pics to the business.

This place is convenient for me to visit when staying at South Point or when visiting the 24 Hour Fitness nearby.
