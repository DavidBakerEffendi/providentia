I love basically everything about this place.

Let's start with the food.  It is seriously, seriously delicious.  I know this has been said before, but even though Apteka is all vegan, you will NOT miss meat -- or even dairy.  I am a pretty big meat-lover and I thought every bite of the food was not only delicious but surprisingly packed with umami. I might even be so bold as to say that this is the best vegan restaurant I have ever been to in my life.

As the original flagship dish, the pierogis are not to be missed. The owners used to run the well-known pop-up pierogi nights!  The sauerkraut and mushroom one, in particular, is to die for, and the yogurt-mustard sauce is so tasty you won't want to waste a single drop.

I also love the kanapki (toppings change seasonally, I think) and the endive/mushroom dish. As I mentioned, none of these dishes are lacking in umami in the slightest, despite being vegan.

The cocktails are inventive and VERY fairly priced at $6-8, aka nearly half the prices you'd find at a craft cocktail bar. I love their incorporation of pickled flavors in both their cocktails and food alike. The bourbon, pickled prune, and sage cocktail is a good choice if you love a sour drink.

To top it all off, the atmosphere is tops -- hip yet casual -- and the service is friendly. You order at the counter, get a number, find first-come/first-serve seating, and they bring you your food. Personally, my favorite spot is at the bar where you can watch the cocktail mixing magic happen!
