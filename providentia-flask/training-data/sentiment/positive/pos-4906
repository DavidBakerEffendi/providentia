If you are a Sushi Burrito lover, this place is the best!!! The portions of protein are bigger then any in town, not too much rice.  Fish is fresh!!  Sides are fresh and crunchy!!!  Super nice staff!!! This place beats all the rest in product!!!  Take it to go!!!  It's not known for the ambiance.  But I'm not going there for that anyway!!! I could only eat half!!!
