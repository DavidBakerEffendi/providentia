Ok i had a chance to go back to Toms Urban to try it out again..Compliments of Doug Winter..I want to thk you Doug for getting back to me and giving me another chance to try out Toms..Im glad you did nad im glad i went back..I never had a problem with the food..the food was awesome...gotta try the sin city burger and the wings or one of the best wings i have ever tasted. Anyways this review is not about the food, we already know the food is good. Its about the service and overall experience. I want to say the service was top notch..Veronica, our server, was on top of it and brought was everything we needed. She came by our table asking if we needed anything and didnt ignore us. Doug Winter..thk you again and i will definitely be coming back to Toms again.
