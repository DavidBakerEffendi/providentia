This restaurant has been replaced by Kim's Vietnamese, but the owner still runs Viet Ho grocery next door.

I've been watching this spot for the past two months, hoping it wasn't just another so-so buffet. The wait was worth it. The space used to house a dance studio and The Medicine Shoppe but now has been busted out into a nicely-sized restaurant with a bar and (ooo yeah) apparently a karaoke machine. 

Obviously the Asian population has heard about this place, even though it just opened. Walking in, I saw people poised over bowls of pho and other non-Americanized delicacies. The fact it is literally next door to Viet Hoa Asian Market means (I am assuming) that the ingredients are purchased by a simple walk across three parking spaces.

Jasmine tea came in a real pot. My hubby raved about the Shrimp with Broccoli in the "chef's special white sauce" and found himself competing with our daughter for the shrimp. She's not a big shrimp fan so something is up with that one. Must be good. 

Daughter had a nicely done Chicken Chow Mein Fun. Tasty. I tried the Vietnamese Menu's Bún ch giò. Beautifully served and an excellent sauce complemented this dish. 

Staff informed me that dim sum starts up next month. I'm there! No more driving to the other side of town for what I am assuming will be a real dim sum (7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on weekends once they get going). Woot!
