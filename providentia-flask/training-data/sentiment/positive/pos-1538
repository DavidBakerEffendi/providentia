Guys, I love this place. I have been here multiple times, and I have literally no complaints. Oh wait, yes I do. Their rooftop bar is only opened on the weekends during the colder months. I mean, I get it, but it's sad. 

Each floor is a different type of restaurant, which is a unique vibe for Pittsburgh. I have eaten at Emporio a handful of times, and I have been to the rooftop bar, but I've never gone to Il Tetto. At Emporio, I always get meatball sliders - the pesto sauce is my go-to on a  beef or chicken meatball. They are small enough to try a few, and if you're like me you will still have some room for a side. The tomato risotto is seriously everything. The mac and cheese with the creamy parm sauce is also a good side choice, but honestly just get the risotto. You won't regret it. 

The rooftop bar has an awesome vibe for a happy hour any time of the year. During the winter, it is only open on the weekends which has tripped my plans a few times. They have a decent beer and cocktail selection. I haven't gotten wine there, but I think they have decent choices in that department too. The prices are what you would expect for a more upscale place downtown.
