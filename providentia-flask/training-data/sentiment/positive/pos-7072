We enjoyed the complimentary side dishes they bring out before the meal very much, everything was flavorful. 
We had the sweet and mild chicken wings with cole slaw, kiwi salad, and the pizza: half potato and half bulgogi. Everything was quite enjoyable, we left wondering if their entire menu is this good. So we shall return soon to further investigate. Thanks for the free jelly straw, that was nice.
