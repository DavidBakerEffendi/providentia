This is hands up the number one port of subs in Nevada. Yes. I'm sure! They consistently have the freshest ingredients and I'm never anything short of excited to eat after ordering. Sadly I can't remember his name, but the guy that works the front is so attentive and really knowledgeable when it comes to the menu. He also always reminds me to use my port of subs rewards card which is apart of a new program they have that gives port of subs' loyal customers an opportunity to get possibly free food! I'd say if you like your sandwich guy friendly, your tomatoes ripe, your bread soft, and meats cut fresh get to this location! You won't regret it!
