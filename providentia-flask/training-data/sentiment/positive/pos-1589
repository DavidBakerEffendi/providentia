Every time we come to Scottsdale, which is often because my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughters live here, We always make it a point to eat lunch and/or dinner and ALWAYS get our cars washed at Tom Thumb for the following reasons:
service fabulous, 
barbecue/food fabulous 
gift shop fabulous 
ambience fabulous 
And the car wash is always far beyond our expectations! BEST CAR WASH IN SOCAL AND ARIZONA!!
