It is a very warm and welcoming place. Donna, the owner made a point to come over and introduce herself, and dropped by from time to time to ensure all was well. I noticed that everyone who came through the door had the same treatment. The servers too, were all very warm and personable. I felt very settled the whole night

The food was excellent. I started with a Scotch egg. I love Scotch eggs, and have few places to have them and this was as good as my Scottish neighbor used to make in Oshawa a lifetime ago. Teena and I both had fish and chips which were great. I loved the lightly battered fish, the chips and the greens which came with it.

I love the beer selection. They have a good draught selection but if you are looking for true Scottish beer, it comes in bottle form. Many great and unusual choices.

Their motto on the website is "Come for the food, stay for the drink, return for the friends you've made."

As Teena and I left, Donna the owner, on a very busy night, made sure to call out to tell us to have a good night and thanks for coming.

Thanks Donna......and yes we'll be back!
