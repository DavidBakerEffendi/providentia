On our way home, hubby noticed baker Wee and suggest we pop in. After searching for the perfect desert, we decided on the pineapple upside down cake. It was 9.99 worth of gooey deliciousness. Although it was very deep for a pineapple upside down cake, the cake was moist and fluffy. The topping oozed down the sides and soaked into the cake for a sinfully sweet bite. Amazing!!!

I know I am basing 5 stars on one cake but it was to die for and the girl behind the counter was super helpful and friendly. I should just confess now....we bough the cake yesterday and it is already gone. Yep. Two people, one cake....it was that good.
