Very cool little cafe for food and coffee bar. Located right in a parking lot type of area but a seriously cool hidden gem. Definitely a trendy vibe with young and fun atmosphere. 

The patio area is decorated nice with a relaxed atmosphere. They have heaters, a small water feature, nice greenery and plants, and a cool statue head. 

Inside seating is small but fun mom-and-pop vibe of a good coffee bar. 

Drive thru is also available. 

Order at the bar then take a seat. After 4pm it's apparently more of a restaurant style where they serve you. 

Definitely a cool spot to check out.
