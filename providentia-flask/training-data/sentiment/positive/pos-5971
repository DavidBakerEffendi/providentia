Bonfyre is on my Madison Favorite Restaurant List. (A mental list of mine!) 

My husband and I first discovered Bonfyre after the Madison Parade of Homes promotion where your parade ticket got you $15 off your Bonfyre meal. We ate lunch there and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. We decided we liked Bonfyre so much that we went back to eat our Christmas Eve dinner. I am a huge Christmas fanatic, so Christmas Eve dinner is actually a very special occasion, and I would not choose just any old restaurant for that dinner.

Both times dining at Bonfyre, all of our appetizers, entrees and desserts have been scrumptious and cooked perfectly, and the servers were personable and attentive.

Bonfyre is a little on the pricey side, so I probably won't ever become a regular. But Bonfyre will definitely be on my list of restaurants to visit for special dinners and special occasions.
