This is a great place overall in food and atmosphere. It's definitely more on the expensive side but it is usually worth it for a nice meal. I like a variety of items but weirdly find the wagyu beef burger to be one of my favorite menu items. They try to keep the food as local and organic as possible from my understanding which is another plus. I generally go here for lunch downtown so I'm not drinking but I would love to come for dinner and try the wine selections.
