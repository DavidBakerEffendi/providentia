Theres little to say other than that I love this place. Cheap, fast, and they deliver. All of the meats, cheeses, veggies, and breads are fresh. Never had a bad customer service experience. The only thing I can really attest to is that they are liberal users of mayo; be aware of that when ordering online and ask for packets instead. :-P
