Great place for a sandwich this location they take care of you when your in a rush . I call my order in a lot and it's ready when I get there . Try the Dagwood with all the meats great sandwich my favorite. Their fries are fresh cut fried in Peanut oil great taste with some malt vinegar. Friendly staff and always offer condiments with order . Kudos Penn station!!!!
