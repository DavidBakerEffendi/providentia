Without question the best wings in the Pittsburgh area.  My wife and I make the 45 minute trip to this place a few times a year and are always happy.

The wings are cooked perfectly, not too crunchy or too slimy.  Their sauce choice can be overwhelming, but if you ask for recommendations they will provide you with some food options.

I have many favorites, but our usual go to sauces are the wet cajun, hot ranch, hot bbq, and regular buffalo.  Make sure to get their homemade ranch with the wings as well.
