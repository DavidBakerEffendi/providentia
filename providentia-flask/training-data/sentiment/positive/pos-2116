Have eaten there on numerous occasions and it is always great!  We go for the buffet on either Sat or Sun and the quality is superior, well seasoned (just perfect, never too much) and the service is excellent.  The tomato soup is to die for and is addicting.  Always clean.  A great place to go for Indian food!!
