Forgot to review this spot on our last visit but wanted to make sure I gave them praise!! Love their salads at lunch and the dinner offerings are super yummy! Very thoughtful food and they take great pride in plating! Kind of loud inside but worth it! So wether your at the bar sitting for a nice light lunch or dining in a table you will enjoy this spot!  And it's not anywhere near the strip so you get a great price for quality foods!
