Mmmmm....so many different options of restaurants in the Concord Mills area!  We chose Charanda Mex. Grill & Cantina today, and it was a good choice.   Their chips and salsa were good, though I would like the chips better if Mexican restaurants would follow Chili's lead and serve the thin chips.   I had Baja fish tacos, which contain tilapia and slaw, along with  "special sauce" which amounts to a Mexican style mayo-tarter sauce.  I'm typically not a fan of tilapia, but these fish tacos were very good.  Also, I had a few bites of my husband's Steak Relleno "Do√±a Juve and it too was very good.  The waitress and the hostess were very attentive and we will definately be back.  A huge plus is the fact that they have a restaurant health inspection grade of 99!
