If you're on the mood for Persian food go here! Support this cute mom and pop establishment. Plus the food is delish. Quick and super fresh with decent portions. The rice is so good. Mmmmm....My filet kebab was very tender. I tried my coworker's salmon plate and it was amazing! Wow! Totally getting that next time!! This is the perfect place when you don't have time to sit down at Persian room :) We loved it and we will be back soon! Can't believe it took us this long to find it! It's located right between the movie theatre and sports authority next to a hot dog place.  Thanks Yelp!
