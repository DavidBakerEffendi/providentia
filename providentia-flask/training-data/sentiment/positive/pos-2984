I've had Mizu Sushi takeout multiple times, and the food has always been amazing. We dined in for my boyfriend's birthday, and not only was the food great, the service was wonderful as well! The server went out of her way and was extremely patient dealing with a large group on a busy Friday night. I can't recommend Mizu enough!
