Lil Man and I went there yesterday to celebrate a friend's birthday. There were suppose to be about 10 of us, but ended up being only 5. Lil Man, my friend, the birthday gal and her son, and me. Here is what we all ordered:

D = Stuffed Chicken Marsala (Oven-roasted chicken breast stuffed with Italian cheeses and sun-dried tomatoes, topped with mushrooms and a creamy marsala sauce. Served with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes. (Suggested wine: Secco-Bertani Valpolicella)... instead she had two Strawberry Margarita with Sugar around the rim of the glass.

V = Seafood Alfredo (Sautéed shrimp and scallops tossed with creamy fettuccine alfredo.) Served with her plate, she had a Strawberry-Mango Limonata.

A = (kid) Italian Cheese Pizza topped off with mushrooms. Served with his pizza, he had a few glasses of rasberry lemonade.

M = (my son) = (Grilled Chicken with Pasta) - Grilled chicken breast with sides of steamed broccoli and spaghetti with tomato sauce. Served with his meal, he had a glass of sprite and a glass of rasberry lemonade.

Me = Capellini di Mare. (Shrimp, clams and mussels sautéed in white wine, garlic and a zesty marinara sauce. Served over capellini and topped with fresh basil.) Suggested wine: Sutter Home White Zinfandel.... Instead I had a sprite and strawberry margarita with salt around the rim. 

As a appetizer, we had bread and salad. For dessert, the waiter, Mario.... forgot his name tag, therefore, his boss gave him one with the name of Buddy... Brought out a birthday cake that was awesome for the birthday gal. The cake was awesome. Check out the pic. 

We all had a blast because we were filled with laughter, chatter, great food, and a great waiter.
