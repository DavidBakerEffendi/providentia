LOVE! They provide these thin baked cracker things paired with a sweet butter to tide you over for a bit. I know I sound like an idiot describing that but I can't think of the proper term for them. For dinner time they have the same things but also include fresh baked bread. They have an awesome lunch special for about $21. You can get an appetizer, main dish, and dessert. Their Caesar salad is to die for as is their meatball appetizer. Their Fried Chicken Sandwich comes with a honey mustard and coleslaw and two pieces of the best boneless fried chicken I have had in my life. It is so moist and simply melts in your mouth. For dinner I've had the scallops, which were impeccable. For desert I've had the strawberry sorbet and the brownie, which came out so warm and deliciously gooey. 

Beverage wise I've had their Garden Mule which is a modified version of a Moscow Mule. I've also had a blood orange soda and a fancy tea. Everything was amazing. 

They have complimentary salt water taffy at the hostess stand which is AHMAYZING!!!! They also have a salt scrub in their bathroom for you to test that they sell out friend. The salt scrub is great and leaves your skins so soft and hydrated. 

My only complaint is that they will rent out the restaurant for private parties but won't notify on any of their social media that they're close to the public. I arrived once and they were hosting a private party so I drove all the way there for nothing, which was extremely annoying and inconvenient. Especially when I was so looking forward to stuffing my face with nummy food. The other complaint was that I called ahead to make a lunch reservation and it wasn't put down. So I arrived and I was told I didn't have a reservation. Luckily it was not busy and I didn't have to wait for anything but I'm sure it would've been a different story if it was busy.
