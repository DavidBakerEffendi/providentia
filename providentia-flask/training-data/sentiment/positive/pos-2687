Gimme Some Sugar Bake Shop is the most unique dessert experience in town.  Not only do they have yummy macarons in intoxicating flavors but they serve a variety of delicious selections AND have craft beers, wines and bubbly!  
The wines are very reasonably priced - actually too good.  You need to go before they realize this and start raising the prices. 
This place is a great alternative to girls night out and a perfect place for an after dinner drink and dessert or a date night.
