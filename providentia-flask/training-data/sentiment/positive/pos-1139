Great breakfast, really really good fish and chips (surprisingly so), and a pizza selection that will make your mouth water. It's not a "classy" place, just a good old pub, where you can have some great food and relax with friends. It's also not excessively loud, which is a definitely plus... no one likes hearing a bad music selection over their friends.
