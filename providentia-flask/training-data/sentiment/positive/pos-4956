Really enjoyed my meal here tonight. Came here on a friends suggestion to try some place new. I called ahead not sure if I needed to make reservations due to all of the positive reviews on yelp. Got there and it wasn't busy. Ordered the soup and wrap combo, lamb wrap and butternut squash soup. The lamb wrap was pretty awesome, it had curry base so it helped knock out some of my under the weather I was feeling. The soup was delicious, it was hot and complimented the wrap perfectly. Will definitely return for the same thing again!
