One of the only chains i love. Very good fish tacos, brown rice n black beans for cheap. 3 dollar pacifico drafts w a lime. Quick service, good atmosphere. This location has a full bar too. Now they give you a free taco just for downloading their app, and Vegas food n bev and casino employees get 20% off here. Pretty economical and delicious. Get some. The only thing is you have to always ask for limes, but that way they come to you fresh cut.

Also the wahoo/mahi mahi they use is wild caught in USA. Much preferred to cheap overseas alternative used by most restaurants.
