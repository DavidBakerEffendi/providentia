One of the best neighborhood gems in Las Vegas.  A foodie heaven for sure, with fresh farm-to-table fare!  If you are staying on the strip it is well worth the drive to Summerlin (my old stomping grounds) for an exceptional dinner.  

Note that the dishes are seasonal so you may not see the dishes I talk about below on the menu.

The fried chicken was out of this world.  I have had many upscale, foodie fried chicken dishes and this was 2 out of 3 (Stripsteak still tops the list).  Juicy, crispy, perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor.  Also the scallops with parsnip puree and cauliflower was to-die-for.  I wanted to literally pick up my dish and lick it clean.  

They also have a great selection of specialty cocktails and wine.  They also homemade non-alcoholic beverages, which is a huge plus in my book.  More restaurants should have these options - helps the restaurant and provides non-alcoholic options besides tea and soft drinks.

Only negative is that in the winter, the restarant can get very cold and drafty with the location of the front door.  

When I am back in Vegas, Honey Salt will be at the top of my list!
