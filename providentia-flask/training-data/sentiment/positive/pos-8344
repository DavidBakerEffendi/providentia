For diner food this place is excellent and has an awful lot of vegetarian options including a delicious tofu scramble.  The staff is always very pleasant and sometimes they get busy but I personally think it's understandable.  The pies, cakes and milk shakes are all excellent and I often come here just for desert plus they serve breakfast all night long. Definitely the best diner in Madison.
