The Artisan at Polish Goodies is not only a sausagesmith but Polish Goodies is a also true craftsman. The smoked kielbasa we got lasted for a couple of weeks. We used it to replace typical breakfast proteins like bacon and ham and we also tested a camp cooking recipe. This item had a long shelf life and multiple recipe uses. They put quality first in everything they make and you can taste the difference. I don't think Batman would win in a battle against this all around champ.. We are going to get another one soon so please don't buy them all, The Pierogis are very flavorful as well. They have a wide variety of items and I'm going to trying more soon
