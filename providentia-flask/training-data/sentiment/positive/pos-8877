Everything was great: the atmosphere, the food, the drinks and the staff. 
We went in for a quick bite before dinner and would have rather stayed there for the whole evening.
Very welcoming place: the staff made us feel right at home.
We had drinks, fried pickles and the fish arancini balls: they all were awesome!
