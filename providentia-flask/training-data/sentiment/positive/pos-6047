My BF brought me here for lunch on sat and we really enjoyed ourselves! Upon walking in I was surprised the interior was decorated so nicely since the outside did not make the restaurant look like anything spectacular. The brick walls were dressed up with pretty pictures and really gave the resto a cozy family ish feeling. Service-wise our waitress was good, our glasses were never empty and she cleared our plates in a timely fashion.

So we started off with bread with 3 types of dipping sauces which were all super yummy (sorry I don't know what they are exactly but this is a perfect excuse to go back to find out!) My boyfriend ordered a burger which he struggled to finish and I had the asparagus and feta eggs benedict. It was SOOOOO yummy, and I appreciated how they did not drown my eggs in hollandaise sauce.

I really can't wait to go back to try their other items. I'd probably try their salads because they looked huge and delicious. I'm definitely planning to have my summer filled with time spent at the beach and Green Eggplant.
