Soooooo, Lil Man and I loved Menchie's sooooo much from 6/5/10, that we went back the next day twice.... LOL.... The first time we went on 6/6/10, I had a combo of Hawaiian Delight Sorbet, Blueberry Pomegranate, and Coconut yogurts topped with once again mangos, pineapples, cherries, and this time instead of blackberries, I added blueberries. My son..... I don't what his combo was because he did the same thing by mixing everything. Then we left to meet family at Meadows Mall, walked around, bought some stylish clothes for myself, and then went back to Menchies with the family. The second time around, I had the combo of Hawaiian Delight, Blueberry Pomegranate, and Orange sorbet topped again with.... gotta have my mangos, pineapples, cherries, and blueberries. Lil Man, well, once again went off to make his own combo. Grandma, Lil Sis, and her friend made their own combos as well... I forgot what each of them had.. They charge $0.39 per oz... The first time around, we paid like $10 almost $11. The second time we went thru, with the additional combos came out to like $26. My son loves going there now that he went and asked if they were hiring. I asked the day before how long they were open and the guy told me that they have only been open like a month. So with that, they said that they are still hiring... And as soon as they said that, my son went and got two applications.. one for my Lil Sis and one for her friend... so that he can get a discount... so he thinks... LOL...
