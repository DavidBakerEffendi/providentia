I ordered the 3 amigos, which has Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Cucumber, Red Onion, Cilantro, Masago, Crispy Wonton Strips, and Wasabi Aioli, but I substituted spicy tuna (I like a little kick) for the Ahi and I added avocado, and it was amazing! I also got the furikake taro chips w/ nacho cheese and they were delicious too...I just wish the serving of cheese was a little bit bigger.
