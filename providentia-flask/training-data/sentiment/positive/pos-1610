I love this coffee house. It's located in downtown summerlin across from skinny fats. The vibe is a little different than the downtown location. It's definitely a little more cramped... but the service is great and menu is the same. They don't have a happy hour which is kind of a bummer. They do have beer, wine, espresso, and cocktails. They also have a coffee bar with outlets for your laptop, which is great when you want to study or work through lunch. Overall, it's still one of my favorite places to grab a latte or glass of wine. I highly suggest giving it a shot.
