Wonderful place. Went for dinner. Started with the peaches and cream cocktail, as delicious as it sounds! The Reuben ribs were amazing and I don't even like corned beef. Had a salad and couple other appetizers, both delicious! Had the gyro gnocchi for an entree, we were hesitant, but after reassurance from server, we gave it a shot. Creamy, rich, delicate gnocchi, and tons of lamb...was not sure what to expect, but loved it.
