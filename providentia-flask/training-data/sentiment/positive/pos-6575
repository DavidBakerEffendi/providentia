My last review was about 3 years ago! This place is very consistent. Staff has changed a bit but still all are very nice & attentive. The Chicken fajitas are still amazing! I always love that first bite when that beautiful citrus marinated chicken hits my taste buds. The flour tortillas are made in the restaurant. That's always a plus in my book. The margaritas are great but decided to be brave & tried the pina colada margarita. I'm in love! The best of both my flavor worlds! The green salsa is awesome!!! I always ask for an extra side to take home. I don't mind an extra fee-give me a big one. My only complaint is that we don't go as much as we used to because they are always so busy! Good for you Juan!!!
