Just tried the wings and they were excellent.  The "hot" sauce is very unique and one of the best I've had since moving here from Buffalo. Now I can say that Aeillos' does it all.  Best Pizza, amazing Italian dinners, awesome subs, and now I can confirm the wings are terrific.  Keep up the great work. If you are looking for authentic food made with high quality ingredients,this is the place.
