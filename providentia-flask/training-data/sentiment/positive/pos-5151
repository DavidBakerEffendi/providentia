Best hotel in Las Vegas by far!

Our stay at the Venetian was five stars across the board from the moment we stepped out of our Uber, to the check in, casino, restaurants, food court and the pool. 

The lobby of the Venetian is beautifully decorated and transports you to a different country the moment you pull up. The line to check in was about a 20 minute wait. Our front desk attendant was extremely nice and offered us a higher floor at no additional cost. Our room was ready around noon and we were able to go right up the elevators to our room.

Our standard king suite made us feel like we were staying in the presidential suite! There were three separate "rooms" to our suite: the sleeping room, the living room and the bathroom. Our bed was luxurious and felt like we were sleeping on the clouds, the living room space had a comfy pull out sofa, two sitting chairs and a table with three chairs. There was a tv in both the living room and in front of the bed. The bathroom was luxurious and included a stand alone shower, spacious bathtub, double sinks, a T.V. and the toilet was in it's own room.

Our group of friends was spread out at all the different resorts in Vegas so we got to see the best of the best and the Venetian definitely won. 

Aside from the awesome room, the restaurants inside of the Venetian were awesome! We ate at Yardbird (best meal in Vegas), got giant margaritas from Tacos and Ritas (with a groupon), & also got Boba in the foodcourt.

This was the BEST hotel experience I have ever had and I look forward to coming back to Las Vegas, NV just to stay at the Venetian again!
