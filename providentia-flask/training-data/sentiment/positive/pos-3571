delicious! we stumbled upon this place on accident, we originally we going to try out Zinburger in down town Gilbert but it was an hour and a half wait, with a 16month old we were not waiting.  So instead we found this place and I'm soo happy we did!  not crowded at all, very clean, and the staff was very personable!  ordered some mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers for the kiddo to start, you can tell everything was homemade and tasted soo good! the kiddo ate a nice big plate.  the bacon cheeseburger was juicy and just perfect, I suggest the onion straws on the side they were delicious!  the filet was cooked perfectly, tender and really really good!  their French fries are also really good, some of the best I've had at a restaurant .  finally don't forget to try the skillet cookie for dessert, one word Wow!  so happy we found this place, will Definitely return!...Ooo and their beef is grass fed and all comes from one butcher!
