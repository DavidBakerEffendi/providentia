I've always wanted to try pinkberry! Pinkberry's first Ontario store opened officialy on Friday, August 21, 2015 at Square One. Pinkberry is the original tart frozen yogurt brand from Los Angeles, California. You always see celebs eating this treat so I was curious to try it out. 

Ok....they serve fresh ingredients. They taste as good as they are for you. Their yogurt is made with real milk and real yogurt and their fruit is hand cut fresh daily. You can really taste the high quality ingredients.

Chocolate hazelnut frozen yogurt is amazing and I was able to try the pomegranate, green tea and vanilla... I wanted all of them lol the best part is that you can add as many toppings as you can fit in the cup. Just amazing. Also! The service is out of this world! Everyone was so professional and attentive! You've gotta try it!
