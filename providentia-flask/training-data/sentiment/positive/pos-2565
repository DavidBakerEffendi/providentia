One of our favorite places. I'm from Calif. and this is the closest we can get to a cheese burger special. Food is always hot and fresh. Long wait in the drive thru, but that's to be expected with Farmer Boys. The food is worth the wait. I like that you can download their app. and upload your receipt and accumulate points to receive 5.00 of your next order.
