Classy seafood presentation done right!  I've enjoyed Landry's here in Las Vegas scattered over the last 7 years.  I first started eating there when I used to work at Television City at the MGM Grand.  We'd often receive gift certificates for eating there of up to $50.00 and it really was delicious!  Amazing shrimp and oyster Po-Boys, tasty steamed clams, and some of those platters just filled with different varieties of fish...man....I can still smell how amazing it was!

This is definitely a great 'night out' eatery too and my fianc√©e and I have enjoyed a few meals there over the last couple years.  I always order their lobster bisque which is truly exquisite and I cannot recommend their crab cakes enough!

It's nice to go eat in their bar for lunch as it's usually empty and quiet so you have the area practically to yourself during that time!

The dining room of course is lovely and very much resembles that of a ship's dining quarters.  I highly recommend giving Landry's a try if you're a seafood lover!
