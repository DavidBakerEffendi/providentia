Located South of the Las Vegas Strip, the Silverton is a great property.  It has undergone several renovations and the latest iteration looks fantastic. Very woodsy, but a bit modern at the same time. A great variety of restaurants to choose from One of the great features of the casino is a huge fish tank with Sting Rays as well as other fish. A must see. Also if you get board with the casino or the fish, take a stroll thru the Bass Pro Shop (it's attached to the hotel) and while your are there buy a boat with all of your winnings Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
