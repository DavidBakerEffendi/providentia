This place was awesome!   Right across from my favorite coffee shop "The Summit".  It was SOOOOOO busy!!!! For a Tuesday, it was insane.  I can see why though. The food was amazing. I the roast beef, and it was incredible! The horse radish sauce on it was so creamy.  

I also had the Mayan coffee, but it was just okay. It had cayenne pepper, chia, and vanilla. It was way to spicy for me! 

My wife had a blueberry coffee which was pretty tasty! But I'd still say if your looking for coffee, the summit is the place to go.
