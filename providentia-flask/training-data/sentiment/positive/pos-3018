The pho is probably the second best in the valley. I typically go to the egg roll factory in Chandler but when I'm up in Scottsdale this location is not only the busiest but the tastiest pho. So spring rolls are good but the peanut sauce is not sweet enough. I haven't tried the sandwiches yet but the FO is good.
