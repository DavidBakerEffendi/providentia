The food, the staff, and the experience is always on point at Shinto! You can't go wrong with anything that you order; from drinks, to sushi or hibatchi, it's all above and beyond any other place I've been to. My favorite sushi is the little delicious roll or the Keller roll. Hibatchi gives you sooo much food!  I'm not even mad about eating these leftovers for days after my visit.
