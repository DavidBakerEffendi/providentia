Very good food! Staff super friendly and helpful. You go in and are seated at a table, handed and menu, waiter comes by asks for drink order, then asks if you know how the system works, if not they explain it all to you. Our waiter was nice, but we didn't see much of her. 
It's a topping bar style, do-it-yourself, make your own stir fry place, however if your not in the mood to really think about putting a bowl together, you can pick from a menu. First you choose your meats (raw) and they have everything from chicken, to seafood, to beef, to turkey. Next choose your spices. Add veggies, and there is plenty of great variety and they are fresh, pick out a sauce (fyi Dragon sauce is awesome), then take it to the 'grill area' and pick out a starch. (The tofu was very good too!)

**TIP: Pile your bowl high, the veggies and meats reduce when they are cooked. 

The food was very healthy, tasteful, full of flavor, and cooked very nicely. You can watch your food being cooked as well. Prices were a little high, however I would return because the food is quality. For a lunch bowl it was $7.99 and for dinner is was $9.99.  

Side note, it was a VERY cold inside, might wanna bring a light jacket.
