Best Chinese food in all of Arizona. How do I know this?

1) I am full 100% Asian.
2) I grew up in LA and San Francisco.
3) I have eaten at almost every Chinese place in AZ.

Ok, the last one is not entirely true, but after eating at King Wok, I don't need to try another Chinese joint. It's a hole in the wall, in a GoodWill strip mall, but it is incredibly delicious.

If u know anything about Chinese food, u know that NY and SF have the best Chinese. King Wok brings that to AZ and I couldn't be happier!

No more Panda Express or Pei Wei or PF Changs for this gal, it's all about King Wok!!!!!
