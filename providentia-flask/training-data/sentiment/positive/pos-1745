Have you ever looked at someone because you're just soooo into them? Your eyes all big and googly? Like you just can't resist them? Welps, that's me everytime i see the food i ordered on it's way to my table here at Bar Kada Avenue. The food is sooo good that sometimes I wish someone would look at me the way I look at their food. Kwek-kwek, isaw, pisbul, pancit....oh my....getting hungry just thinking about it. They also serve Red Horse (yep it'll sure kick you in the bum-bum), the bar offers this beer as cold as your ex gf's/bf's heart. The live bands are very entertaining. Good music and they have dance floor if you wanna get your freak on :). You will definitely feel at home. Do you miss the hell out of the Philippines? This is the place to be, tambay, sunog-bagas, kantahan, jamming, tagay-tagay....you got it here. I Love this place. B to the A to he R to the K-A-D-A my God it's Bar Kada my God it's Bar Kada my God it's Bar Kada Avenue
