I finally had the chance to visit Pho Tai Bac and they did not disappoint!

We ordered their pho, fried spring rolls, and a jackfruit shake.

Let's start with their pho. There is no cilantro in it, which is GREAT! Their broth is flavourful and not too salty. There was plenty of noodles and meat.. a pretty generous portion.

We also really enjoyed their fried spring rolls. They're of a good size and tasted proper. Nice and crispy. 

Jackfruit shake is something I always order and this one was perfect. It was not too milky nor too sweet, good amount of jackfruit flavour. It also didn't take forever to arrive, as many restaurants somehow bring the shake when i'm almost finished eating my meal.

The restaurant itself is in a plaza, so there is plenty of free parking in the lot. Inside the resto is quite spacious and with open space. 

They play some good Vietnamese music, too! And there is free wifi. Nice amenities.

I highly recommend this place, and this is now my go-to place for pho in Richmond Hill.
