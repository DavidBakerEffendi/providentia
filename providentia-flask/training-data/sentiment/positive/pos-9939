After about 30 stops around Charlotte trying to find the best reuben (with a few left to check out), my reuben at Tyber Creek still stands out as one of the highlights of the adventure. The reuben at Tyber is unbelievable and a must-try spot if you're looking for a great reuben around the Queen City.

The corned beef was the first thing you notice - thick, clearly hand-carved cuts off a meat clearly done in-house. This was far from the deli meat served on most reubens around Charlotte. It tasted like St Patty's Day inside the surrounding rye bread. The kraut was fantastic, adding that pickled flavor a reuben requires, and the cheese was flavorful enough to be enjoyed in each bite. The bread was the only thing about the reuben that didn't stand out, and something other than standard marbled rye (something locally baked maybe?) would have made this reuben perfect. The experience was great and without a doubt I'll be back to enjoy another reuben from Tyber.
