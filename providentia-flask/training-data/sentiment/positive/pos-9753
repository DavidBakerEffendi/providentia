Golf Club restaurant on the Chimera Golf course.

The clubhouse serves breakfast, lunch, dinner, and has a full bar.

I came here several times during a stay with a friend who lives in the neighborhood. I tried the pizza, pork quesidellas, and fish and chips. The fish and chips were very good. The menu has as assortment of appetizers, breakfast, pizzas, sandwiches, and entrees.

You can also purchase beer to go at the bar if you are hitting the green. Buy 5 beers and you get the 6th for free. They will even package it in ice for you.

The staff is very friendly.
