Hubby had a late working night one Saturday (today) and I really had been craving spaghetti. We are new to lakewood and I'm very weary of trying new places... But what else can you do but try new places when EVERY SINGLE THING AROUND Is unfamiliar :) anyhow. We found this place on Yelp and decided why not. We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, Marsala and some bread. Delicious. It was fast, on time and they even have a curbside pick up. The young woman came out to us, delivered our food to the car and even took the credit card inside to run it. The bread was so yummy, the meatballs were cooked just right and the chicken was superb! Mind you, this was all at 10 o'clock at night. We will definitely be back when we want some italian!
