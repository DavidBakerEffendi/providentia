A great place to come for a romantic dinner. Absolutely love the pretzel bites with provolone dip. You can sit in a booth and watch a basketball game in a fun & hip environment. There is also bar seating, where a lot of people seem to come after work. The decor, like at all Sam Fox concepts, is impeccably done. The service this time around was great -our waiter was so attentive, funny and thoughtful, as was the rest of the staff. It makes for a stress-free and totally fun night out.
