Arrived Friday night at around 9 pm, the Dry Noodle with Tomato and Egg was sold out (not sure how egg and tomato can sell out, I could literally grab it from my fridge down the street and ask them to cook it for me) so I tried their vegetarian broth and it was surprisingly great. My sister got the mega size Special Lanzhou Beef Noodle and it was massive (could feed 2-3 people). We really enjoyed our meal, food was great, very large portions, and friendly staff. So great, I went back the next day to try the dry noodle, and I have to say, their soup noodle is actually better than the dry!
