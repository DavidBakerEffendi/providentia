I recently stopped here with a friend for Sunday brunch with our puppies. I've only ever been to the downtown summerlin location so compared to that this one is much bigger. It's located in the front of town square right near bonefish grill and Fleming's. All dogs are welcome on the patio and they even have a dog menu. 

On this visit we decided to share the DIY mimosas to start which was a fantastic idea. It came with a full bottle of champagne and three homemade juices. My personal favorite was the huckleberry. For a meal I had the chilaquiles, so good! I loved the salsa and that fact that it's vegetarian friendly. My friend had the blackened chicken bowl which she said was amazing as well. To finish it off we enjoyed a free pumpkin cheesecake from an email promo my friend had. It was probably the best dessert I've had in awhile.

I really just love everything about this place. The concept, the food, and the service are all great.
