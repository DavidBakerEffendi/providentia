Island Style

I went to the Island Style booth, same owners as the Island Style that is on Sahara and Valley view. 
I had #2 Bibimdaemyeun- cold buckwheat noodles in a spicy sauce with sliced pickled radishes and cucumber, brisket and a hardboiled egg. they have me two banchan of cabbage and a radish kimchee and a bowl of broth, seaweed I think. All that and a Hawaiian Sun Lillikoi can for $10. It was delicious- this is one of my favorite Korean dishes specially on a hot day. Actually cools you down quite a bit while heating you up with the chili! Chewy buckwheat and crisp veggies is such a great texture combo too. Island flavor also gives you complimentary, serve yourself barley tea and water. It's great for when I eat spicy- I'm drinking up cups in a single gulp! 

Will be eating at this food court quite often since I work close by now. Other than Island Flavor there is a Noodle Village, Chapaghetti, namyriang. 3 more booths are coming soon. The court also has L'Epidor Bakery, a cellphone place, a clothing store and a Korean cosmetics place.

Mr. Colorfood 6/25
I tried another booth, the most recently opened Mr. Colorfood. Got to-go order of "Happy Pig Pork and Squid" which comes in a spicy sauce and they gave me a side order of a miso soup, spicy pickled radish and sweet vinegar pickled radish and cucumbers for $10.50. It was a bit disappointing....usually this dish comes in a thick spicy paste and this was more watery. It also had this herb that is okay in some dishes, but I don't know if I like it in this and the squid had an odd texture...it was soft in a way that the outside of it was brittle/mushy that I can't really describe. I dunno, but I'm not sure about this booth....3 stars for that.

Island Style 7/1
 Got beef bimbimbap from Island Style....yummy and generously sized! Lots and Lots of veggies (garlic spinach!, carrots), pickles (radish) and banchan (kimchee and radish on the side). I could not finish so I saved the rest for later. Still my favorite booth- 5 stars

*****
Chapaghetti 7/16
I got jajangmyun which is black bean paste noodles. It has in it egg noodles, zucchini, cabbage, potato, onion and diced pork. It was pretty good, the sauce was savory (some places make it too sweet). There was mostly onions, with a little more meat/veggie and a thicker sauce it would be absolutely perfect. 4 stars.

Island Style 8/11
Got their meat jun- pretty decent! Comes with cabbage kimchee and macaroni salad. I like this place a lot.

L'Epidor Bakery 8/24
Got honey layer cake- was pretty good. I would need to try more...I noticed their bags were Providence Bakery bags....so even though they're sort've different I assume this, Crown and Providence are related somehow. Will confirm this bit of info soon. 4 stars

UPDATE 8/25- SO we tried to finish the Honey layer cake today and found EGGSHELL in it. WTF?! This also happened at Crown which we wonder if they are affiliated then it's the same person baking eggshells into the cake?!! Lets put that it's 3 stars since now I'm cautious even though it was a good cake.

Island Style 8/25
Got Chicken Teriyaki to go. Nice flavors, good char, but needed a sauce. I dont know if it usually has one and they forgot to include a cup of it One thing that was off though was the macaroni- it was frozen and the parts that  were not was a yucky texture since it defrosted. 3 stars. 
***
Noodle Village 9/7
Got the "spicy noodles with vegetable". It is very like my favorite Bibimdaemyeun but the noodles are thicker (spaghetti width) and has sliced cucumbers, cabbage, carrots, and half a hardboiled egg. They give you some daan moo ji/ sweetyellow pickled radish on the side. 4 stars. 
Just a note- Mr. Colorfood and Namyriang are now CLOSED. Tiffany Coffee will have a frozen yogurt booth coming soon.

I Love Oishi 10/6

This is the newest booth  in the food court.I got their Korean Style Jirashi bowl to go. It has mixed diced fish (tuna, salmon, and snapper it looked like), some masago roe, mixed greens, rice and spicy bean paste. They also give you miso soup with it. This was a lot better than the premade ones in the greenland deli since it's fresh made. The fish and greens were all fresh and for $7.99 it was a good portion of food. 4 stars.

Just a note- Mr. Colorfoods old booth has a sign for "School Food" coming soon....what an odd name! Curious to see what the food is like.

I Love Oishi 10/26

Sushi and Sashimi Bento $9.99 It had salmon sashimi, 4pc nigiri (shrimp. tuna, white fish, salmon) , grilled salmon collar, salad, potato crochette and miso soup. It's a good light lunch. The salmon was very fresh but the other sushi is just ok. The grilled collar was great. I rather have rice than the crochette though. 3 stars. I still think the Korean Jirashi is the dish to get here.
