Like brisket?  Look no more.  City BBQ has driven their "interpretation of all things smoked" stake deep into the heart of Dixie without apology.  East Carolina?  S Carolina?  Lexington?  Max's?  Midwood?  McCoy's?  Spoons?  They don't care.  City has their smokers loaded with shaggy-bark Hickory to face any competitor in the area.  And, let's just say, game on.  

Simply, in my humble and chubby opinion, one of the best briskets in the area.  My service experience was also very good.  They seemed to have worked out some of their opening missteps others have Yelped.  

PS:  Not a Carolina pork-based BBQ indigenous to the area (case you are wondering).
