We arrived at 8:45 for our 8:30 dinner reservation without any hassle... the place was so festive! The music, the videos on the screens and the decor created a very vibrant atmosphere and the restaurant was packed and loud, we did feel like we were yelling at each other while having a conversation during dinner! Our waitress was knowledgeable and the food and cocktails were delicious! Everything I wanted from a dinner in Vegas. It's pricey...but hey, it's Vegas we were expecting it. 

If they have the lobster served escargot style get it! I also recommend the cucumber martini.
