Tonight was my second time to Sushi Samba in the last month and I'm just in love with their food!!  

We had Wagyu beef gyoza, yellowtail taquitos, kanpachi sashimi tiradito, SÃ£o Paulo roll, Samba strip roll, and salt & pepper squid.  I LOVED all of it, but if I was forced to pick a favorite it would be the Samba strip roll...chunks of succulent Maine lobster!  

On my first visit, we had an amazing server named Nick and I HIGHLY suggest requesting to sit in his area.  He has great recommendations, is attentive without being intrusive, and is just a fun guy!  The young lady we had today was very sweet, but seemed a little overwhelmed.  There are also managers floating around, checking on tables, and this totally helps you feel valued as a diner.

I can't wait to go back again!  Completely worth braving the strip and dealing with all the tourists!  :)
