The only thing here you should get is the chicken mole. 
It is legit- best in the city.
I've tried a lot of mole and this one is a nice thick chocolatey bitter flavour- not watered down like EVERY other mexican place in Kensington (seriously-- I went to 3 different places in Kensington and all their mole was just sad and watered down).
