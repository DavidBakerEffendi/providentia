This is one of the reasons that Las Vegas is truly an Oasis in the desert.  This is one of the best known tourist attractions in the world and there and many good reasons for it.  The beauty is that you can see it from so many places.  The music is chosen with all tastes in mind, in fact for a certain amount you can even pay to choose the song the fountains go along with!  

Make sure if you are at the Bellagio, or really anywhere in Vegas you check out the fountains.  It is one of the most amazing sites you can see and unlike most things in Vegas, it's free!  Perfect on a hot Summer night or perfect to bundle up with a cocoa and hear your favorite songs done to a water show unlike any other!
