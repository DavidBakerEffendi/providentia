Love this place it's dog friendly so the pugs can come along.  Service was great waitress was extremely attentive. I had the crusted tuna and it was so good and cooked perfectly. Portions were not too large or small just perfect. My daughter had the chicken pot pie and usually I am not a fan of this dish but hers was delicious. You could tell that the pie crust was made in house not frozen and the chicken mix inside was so fresh.   This place will become one of my usual hangouts especially if it is as good in the future.
