Food here is incredible. Everything was delicious. There is NOT one thing that I didn't like about this buffet. Everything is cooked fresh. Meats are cooked in font of you. The grilled salmon was my favorite. So many options to choose from. Lines get like pretty long, worth the wait tho. Perfect anniversary dinner!
