Just wanted to say that I have been a customer of Jacks Deli for over a year now, I go frequently, my favorite is the build your own omelet, but I have had other things such as the corned beef sandwich as well and it is awesome. The food is always tasty, fresh and at a  great price. The front attendant/cashier Markita ( not sure if I spelled her name correctly)  is the sweetest young lady. She is so friendly and remembers what I like to order. It's nice to walk in and be greeted by her beautiful smile. She is a great representative/employee for the restaurant.
