Love this place... I've had the Morris Ramen on both occasions. Once as is adding Bok Choy and once with beef short ribs instead of the pork belly. 

I recommend the Morris Ramen as is with the pork belly with added Bok Choy.  I really enjoyed this signature dish. The signature Ginger cocktail was also very good, as was the squash bun. My usual companions both really seemed to like the Spicy Ramen. While I haven't tied this bowl it
Looked good. 

This is my new favorite noodle joint. The broth is rich and savory - such that one is tempted to lick the bowl.
