My experiences at Carson City Saloon have always been great. The main reason why is that the owners are awesome. These guys know how to run a good bar/restaurant. They have awesome specials that cater to everyone. Who doesn't want a 32 oz Yuengling for $1 on Wednedsay? Who isn't in for a Blue Moon Yard for $1 on Tuesday? Happy Hours from 5-7 with $2 you call it drafts(they have plenty), and 5$ appetizers. On Wednesdays they have a live band(Walk of Shame). These guys play all songs that you know. Their wings are awesome. I think they're .45 on Mondays. There are specials for all of your local sports teams games. Many TV's. A huge projection TV. Perfect sound on for the big game. They have a roof top deck which is so nice once the weather breaks. They have a party room I believe you can rent in the downstairs with a beer pong table and its on little private bar. I have been there for birthday parties before. The Jayson burger gets 2 thumbs up. It was cooked perfectly to my liking and seasoned to perfection. For a sports bar, this place is as good as it gets. It gets busy during the nights, slower during the daytime. I have always loved doing some day drinking at this place on the weekend. They've had my business from the beginning and will continue to do so.
