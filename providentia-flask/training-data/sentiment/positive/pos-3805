Today for a catering activity are used BLD barbecue and it was beyond superb all of my guess really really enjoyed the ribs pulled pork the brisket and the sausages. The baked beans the coleslaw and potato salad really rounded out the meal to be very very good. The food was hot packed well and carried out to my car so it was so easy to do this I highly recommend   BLD  for any catering that you were going to doSoon or over the holidays. The staff was extremely helpful in determining how much I should order and they were spot on.
