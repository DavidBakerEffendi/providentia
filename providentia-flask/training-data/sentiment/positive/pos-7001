Let me start by saying they have a bidet, what place do you know has one?! Super clean bathrooms. The place is great, open area, outside patio for games. The service is beyond great. I had Brussels and the drunken shrimp, both were fantastic. My cousin had the breakfast burrito which was huge and stated it was great. I thoroughly enjoyed this place and will return!
