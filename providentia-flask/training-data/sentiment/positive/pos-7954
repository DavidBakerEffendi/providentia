I just discovered this place and I'm honestly embarrassed to say it took 4.5 years for me to find this place!

This place has $18 4L pitchers (of Keith's!!!) and some tables with a tap built right into allowing you to serve yourself beer at a cheap $0.20/ounce (that's $2.40/pint !!!).

I can't really talk about the food at all here, but it's definitely the cheapest place to drink in Montreal that I've found yet...The savings in beer more than make up the cost of the taxi at the end of the night :)
