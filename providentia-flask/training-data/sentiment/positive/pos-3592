I normally don't eat breakfast and have never really cared for breakfast spots... But now I know it's because I haven't had good breakfast until now! I am so impressed with this place for not being afraid to actually season their food! Each bite was bursting with flavor! And not super greasy like a lot of breakfast places tend to be . The ribeye steak is as good as it looks in the pictures! Biscuits were good but the gravy is some of the best gravy I have ever had! And those hashbrowns, so flavorful! The Ambiance is casual but inviting with lots of natural light with lots of windows. I am so excited to go back and try more things on the menu! Thanks for making me a fan of breakfast!  Luckily I live just a few minutes away so I plan on coming often
