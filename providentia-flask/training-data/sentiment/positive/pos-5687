After a little winning in the poker room, the husband and I did some shopping at the Forum Shops and ended up deciding on lunching here and are both thrilled we did.
Both the service and the food way exceeded our expectations and we wished we had a little more time to have eaten here again before we left.

We shared tomato soup that came with a small sliver of a delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We also had the warm goat cheese salad with a wonderful green goddess dressing and finally, we shared a french dip sandwich with a side of yukon gold mashed potatoes instead of french fries. 

Our waitress was great, refilling our drinks and even splitting our sandwich so Kevin could have cheese on his half and I could have mine without it. It was a great French dip and a great meal overall!
