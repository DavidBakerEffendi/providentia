I gotta admit I was getting a little miffed with this place because I've tried to go a couple times and haven't been able to get in because of the crowds. As a local, I suppose I felt unreasonably entitled. Yesterday I gave it another go and the third time was certainly the charm. My friend and I pulled up at our very high table and ordered what we saw being delivered to another table. Holy Mother Mary! Yum! I started with a Batch cider and had the mussels in blue cheese sauce with frites. It was one of the most delicious things I have eaten in a long time. It was so good, I am rather bashful about admitting this, that I used a spoon to demolish ALL the sauce! And the frites were so spot on that we ordered more to share. This experience was made even better by the friendly staff working there. They seemed authenically pleased that we enjoyed ourselves so much. The only thing possible I can say against this place other than the wait if you come at a busy time, is the noise level. The decor is fresh and lovely, but all the hard surfaces and the high ceiling really amplify and echo all sounds. So go knowing it won't be some tranquil dinning experience, but the nosh is top notch. I will for sure come back soon!
