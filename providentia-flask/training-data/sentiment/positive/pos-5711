Been here a few times since my initial coming to Sweet Tomatoes.... I am still torn about which I prefer... this or Souper Salad...the prices are nicer there and they got that amazing homemade whipped cream, but this one is closer to home and has more options.... Today I tried a bit of everything.... the wonton salad was probably my favorite thing on actual lettuce salad bar... they had really good pasta salad and potato salad too. The corn muffin was hot and moist with actual pieces of corn in them, and I wish I would have saved room for another. THey had three different types of brushetta....or however you spell that.... one was like cheese bread with tomatoes and the other was like cheese pizza. Also a cheesy garlic bread type thing. The tomato basil soup was really good and reminded me of pizza sauce, the chicken noodle soup was my least favorite with dry chicken and doughy noodles, the potato leek and corn chowder were both amazing, and the others were okay just not remarkable. Their strawberry lemonade is amazing as is their vanilla bean coffee. And to top it off try their warm brownie bites with soft serve and nuts or their delicious sugar free chocolate mousse.
