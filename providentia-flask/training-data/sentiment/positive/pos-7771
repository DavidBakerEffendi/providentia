This remains my absolute favorite bar in South Side. Whether I'm heading out for lunch, or a few drinks, I'm always happy here! The burgers are just delicious. The salads are nice and large. The prices are very reasonable. The waitstaff is amazing!
They turned an old bank into a bar. No matter how many times I come here, I can't help but be amused to see the vault doors in the back of the dining area.
