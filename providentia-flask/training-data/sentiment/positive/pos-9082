Spicy Basil with chicken served with a side of rice

Thum Ka with chicken served with rice.

Serving sizes are generous and plenty to share btw the 2 of us.  

This is an easy and typical meal that you Wil sure enjoy.  We'll definitely come back for more for the authentic Thai. 

Spent our Christmas here for dinner and it was a nice change of cuisine.  We enjoyed shrimp curry, crab fried rice( their signature dish),  crab puffs, tam yum,  potstickers.  We had plenty of food and savored every bite.
