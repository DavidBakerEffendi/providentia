Thanks to Yelp we found this hidden gem! It's about 20 minutes outside of Phoenix but worth every mile drive from Sedona. We were craving authentic Chinese cuisine -- specifically hand pulled noodles and dumplings and we found Chou's Kitchen.
Like some of the other Yelpers have said, please do a flash mob here to support local businesses. The owner lady is friendly and helpful with the dish recommendations. Please see my pics of the yummy pan fried beef buns, green onion pancakes, freshly made napa cabbage and pork dumplings, and the cold salad appetizer of parsley, green onions and jalape√±os. Once seated, you will get a complimentary bowl of cornmeal porridge (very typical in Beijing cuisine). We would definitely come back if we are ever in the area.
