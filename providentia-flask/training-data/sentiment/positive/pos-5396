It is so nice to go to a Japanese resteraunt and find something other than Sushi on the menu! Their Kitsune Udon is amazing, it makes me want to melt!

The prices are a dollar or so more than I was expecting to pay but due to the fact that the only people who work there (that I have seen) are the owners, and the fact that it is one of the only place I have found with non rolled Japanese cuisine (not to mention a humber of Vegetarian friendly meals) I am willing to pay whatever they want of me.

The owners are really nice and friendly, and give good service.  

The only downside I have encountered is they have sub-par air conditioning which is harsh in AZ, it is also very small so you really can't bring a big group but please don't let these stop you from trying it out!
