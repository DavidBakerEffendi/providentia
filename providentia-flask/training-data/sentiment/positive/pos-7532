Peppermint is one of my favorite go-to restaurants close to home. They're relatively fast when ordering takeout. We usually order food for 3-5 people, and it's always very good. I haven't been inside Peppermint for a while, but the interior has nice decorations and, from what I remember, the staff was always attentive and polite. Their Pad Thai (I think shrimp and chicken comes automatically) is my favorite thing on the menu, and I could probably eat the whole container in one sitting! The beef satay is also very good, well seasoned and bonus point because it's on a stick, and who doesn't love things on sticks? This review is getting long, but Peppermint is so good that the deliciousness of their food can't be explained in words! Definitely try the pad thai, beef satay (the peanut sauce that comes with it is the best sauce I've ever tasted, and it goes well in the pad thai), and if you're in the mood for yummy hot food, try Peppermint!
