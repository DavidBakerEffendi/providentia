Going to Greenland Supermarket is a major trek for me as I live on the opposite side of town, but is it worth it? YES. YES INDEED.

Upon entering there is a mall-type area, with shops on the left and a food court to the right. Straight ahead is the supermarket itself. The vegetable and fruit selection were bright and fresh, though my friend said a few items seemed pricey. What I really liked was their selection of yogurt drinks (i.e. Yakult). We had been looking for ones that do not contain many additives or sugar and were quite surprised that the selection here had just what we wanted.

This store is huge and we spent well over an hour maneuvering through the aisles. 

I will definitely try to come back again.
