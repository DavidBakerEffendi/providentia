Good food in a gas station? It's true.

My husband stopped by here for lunch last week and brought back this amazing barbeque pork sandwich with some of the best shoestring fries I've ever had. One bite and I was hooked. Since then we have been here 2 times and both times the service has been fast and the food delicious. The food is fresh and tasty - for both breakfast and lunch. My husband and I split a breakfast wrap and this was no ordinary wrap. Whole wheat tortilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, grilled peppers and onions, jalapeno bacon and cheddar cheese - definitely enough food for two. The second time we went for lunch my husband got the special of the day, Fried Catfish. My husband devoured it. I tried a bite and it was really good - it wasn't fishy tasting and the plating looked really nice. I got the pulled pork sandwich with shoestring fries which came in a basket. I'd prefer a plate, but this didn't affect the taste! All their meats are slow smoked and have this great "campfire" taste.  All items come sans barbeque because they have their own barbeque bar! You can pick and choose which sauces you want to use. I recommend the Low Country BBQ (has BACON and peppers) and the Texas Chipotle. Both are a little sweet but super addictive. 

Even the decor inside is nice and simple. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area or just want to try some new BBQ.
