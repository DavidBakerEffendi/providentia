My favorite restaurant in Arizona hands down. They won the James Beard Award for a reason! Great food and Service make El Chorro my First Choice for fine dining. When I take friends they all love it and become steady customers. My favorites comfort food is their Beef Stroganoff. Try it, you won't be disappointed.
