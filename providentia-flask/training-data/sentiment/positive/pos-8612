Food here is as everyone says, amazing. 
Some of the best pizza I've ever had.

On top of that for my daughter's birthday party we ordered a large delivery ordered which was delivered by the owner himself, still decked out in his chef whites. I offered him a hefty tip for coming on such short notice and with so much pizza, but he declined the big tip and said he was happy to help.

Great service, great food, we'll be going here for years to come.
