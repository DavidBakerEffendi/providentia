After balling it up at the Sky Lofts at the MGM the last time I came to Vegas, I was afraid that I would be too jaded and unsatisfied with any other hotel. I definitely did not feel that way when I stayed at The Venetian. I love that it is suite style which definitely makes it easier to have a few extra guests. The beds are super comfy and the sofa actually pulls out into a bed which gave our 5th guest a good place to sleep. I guess the room is kind of expensive at around $200 a night, but if you split it between a few people it's not so bad. I also love the fact that they play music from Phantom here in the elevators.

Also, you must pay a visit to their pool. Tao beach and the shallow pool with chairs in the middle make for a perfect place to get that tan!
