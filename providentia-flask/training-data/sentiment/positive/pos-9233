My boyfriend & several friends rave about how good Pho is & still yet, I was nervous about it...well today was so cold & gloomy, I decided today was going to be the day to try Pho for the first time!

My boyfriend is a regular at Lang Van & knew I would be comfortable there. He was right! While Lang Vang is not in the most prominent area of Charlotte, it is a popular spot. It's small, but very intimate. The decor is warm & cozy...the bamboo "fence" at the entrance is nice!

I LOVE fresh spring rolls & Lang Van's are amazing!  The accompanied peanut sauce wasn't what I am used to, but it had a mild kick to it & worked well with the rolls. They rolls are a decent size, too, full of ingredients & rolled up tight. 

Sweet tea...WOW! It was just the right amount of sweet. I think we both had like 4 glasses each.  

The Pho...we had the #37  - which features the well cooked steak. In under 5 minutes our plate of basil, mint, lemon, bean sprouts, & jalape√±os & large bowls of glorious Pho were on our table.  I immediately fell in love with this soup.  I'm already looking forward to eating it again.

Restaurant was clean & catchy music played overhead, but wasn't overpowering.  The owner was so nice & friendly. Waiters & waitresses were fast & efficient, clearing off tables quickly & constantly filling up drinks.  As Chad mentioned, they don't have much for parking, so be mindful of that.  I'm especially pleased at ow fast we got in & out, as I was on a time crunch trying to get to a yelp event. :)

I was impressed with the peanut cookies & candy on a cute little dish on our "bill plate" (for lack of a better title!) AND fortune cookies! 

Funny that Nick said the staff knows what he wants when he comes in! It was the same for my boyfriend & we have friends that say the same experience.  How's that for customer service?!

I'm really pleased with Lang Van...I'll definitely be back. Yay for my first Pho experience!
