Great waitstaff! The female waitress we had was super sweet and attentive. Everything we ordered was very good, my parent even agreed. Which is huge! I really liked their chicken lettuce wrap and papaya salad the most. Very flavorful and delicious. Def would love to come back and try the rest of the menu. Wasn't really a fan of the dark setting in the back area seating arrangement. Felt a little off from the rest of the place. Weird layout but foods were good.
