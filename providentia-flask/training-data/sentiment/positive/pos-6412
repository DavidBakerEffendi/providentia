Steak fajitas as usual...but to go. I would recommend letting them know your tortilla preference and also to place the cheese in a container by itself. The Mexican rice was not that good; I would rather have regular white rice to go with my beans. There's curb side parking for to go orders which works out well when you don't want to park that far away. Overall the good was very tasty!
