Another groupon purchase, another new restaurant to try that I would not have know about if I had not. And am I ever glad that I found that groupon! This location is in the Esplanade in Phoenix, and there were not many people down there when we went tonight around 7pm. This could either work in their favor, or against it. Could go either way at this point. But it was good for me because I hate waiting for tables and I hate crowded restaurants. Neither of which I had to deal with today. Got in right as we walked in the door, and there were only another 20 or so people in. 

We sit down and our waitress promptly takes our drink orders. I ordered tea that for some reason tasted like chap-stick. The waitress took it away and off of our bill. Thank you! I also ordered the Hawaiian punch, and HO-LY SHIT! That thing had so much alcohol in it, I am STILL recovering. Half way through the drink and I was pretty much buzzed. And $5 for all alcoholic drinks?? Yes please!

So I went with my mom, husband and sister. I got the vegetarian tacos which were really spicy and good. Next time I think though I will get them with the soft taco shells. I was not too crazy about the hard shells. And their beans are amazing!! Have I told you how much I love beans? I especially love vegetarian black beans, and an entire plate of them. SO GOOD! My husband got the baja fish tacos, mom got street tacos I think, and my sister another meat taco. All were happy with their choices. And even though it looks like not that much food, everyone except the half drunk me left food on their plates. They are really filling. 

Thank god I bought two groupons because I will definitely be coming back here for some more drinks and tacos.
