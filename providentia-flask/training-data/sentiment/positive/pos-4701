A truly hidden gem in Cleveland, Aladdin's is one of the few restaurants that seems to get better and better. The dessert display is beautiful and the food is entirely authentic while bursting with flavour. 

This is absolutely one of the best places to eat at if you're looking to stay fit without feeling as though you have too narrow of a selection.
