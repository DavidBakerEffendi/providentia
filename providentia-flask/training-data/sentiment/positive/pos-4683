I started pharmacy school at Midwestern just up the street and saw there was a Groupon for this place so of course I bought it and stopped in one day during lunch. 

The interior was lovely and the server, who I'm kind of assuming was the owner, was really nice and attentive. It wasn't busy at all when I went in with a friend around noon. 

I like that the sushi menu had pictures and descriptions of all their special rolls, which are all decently priced compared to other sushi places I've been to in town (same goes for happy hour). I feel like they also put in more effort when it comes to plating, which isn't entirely important to me just as long as my food doesn't come out looking gross, but it was something I noticed. 

Sushi quality was good, and that's always what matters at a sushi place, right?
I know I'll probably be eating here on occasion during my time on campus these next couple years.
