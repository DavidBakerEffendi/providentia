Don't let the line up scare you, it moves quicker than it looks. This is hands down the best chicken you'll find in Montreal. The poutine is great, and boy I'm glad they now do delivery. The staff are nice which is surprising considering the volume they deal with. NOTE: Have your order ready by the time you arrive to the front, otherwise the crowd of people behind you might string you up by your toes. It doesn't matter what you order on the menu, you'll love it.
