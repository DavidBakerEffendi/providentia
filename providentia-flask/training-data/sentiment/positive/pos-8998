What a find!

Great food, wonderful server... an all around great time!

Started out with Caramel Hazelnut coffee... yum

The hummus was wonderful and the lettuce wraps are a "don't miss" item!

I had the Jerk chicken sandwich.  The flavor was fantastic, but the bread was too large for the chicken breast.  The chili sauce and pineapple flavor to the sandwich made for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

My girl had the Seafood chowder soup (loved it) and the eggplant (she said it was OK, but nothing to write home about)

The five stars are for the food and service as well as the decor and cleanliness!
