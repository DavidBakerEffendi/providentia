this place is really awesome. Good food, incredible bon chon and just a great environment to chill at and have a great time with friends. The korean fried chicken is some of the best I've had and small (six piece) is plenty to share. I suggest ordering a side of rice to go with it, some soju and extra bonchon and enjoy!
