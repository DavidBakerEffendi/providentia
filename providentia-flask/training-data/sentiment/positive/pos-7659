Vintage 95, you sexy young thing....! I stop by for lunch and I'm always thrilled. The lunch selection is perfect. I need to always get back to work and you always get me in and out in the right amount of time but with the just right amount of perfect lunch. Perfect! My lunch of choice is the salad with a cup of the tomato soup. The cheesy croutons are bliss, what culinary genius dreamt those up, I love them! Well, thank you Vintage for being my go to lunch spot, you are just lovely.
