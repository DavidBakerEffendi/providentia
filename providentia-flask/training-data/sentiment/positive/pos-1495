As a San Diego native that moved to Pittsburgh over two years ago, I want to say:  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!  I've been craving a Carne Asada Burrito ever since I left home and you guys satisfy me.

Every time I mention Mexican food/burritos shops to a Pittsburgher, I cringed when they recommend Qdoba, Chipotle, or Mad Mex.  For $8 at these places I get a big burrito stuffed with fillers (beans, rice, veg).  For $6 at CTS, I can a big burrito of stuffed with primarily MEAT.

If you're going to try something here, try the Carne Asada Burrito.  It is a must at least once.  The California Burrito and the Carne Asada Fries are also good recommendations too.  Oh man, there is so much I want to come back and try.  They also have the two bottles of hot sauce and a sandwich pouch of marinated/pickled carrots, just like home :)

Everything about this place screams home.  People might say it has tacky decorations but this is how a taco shop in San Diego would look like.  This place is also clean.  It felt like home as I sat in the big booth, watching morning talk shows on the LCD TV, and dumping loads and loads of hot sauce on my Carne Asada Burrito.

While dining in, other California natives came in and were happy to find the place.  I also had a nice talk with the people there too.  They were super friendly.  GIVE THEM ALL YOUR BUSINESS, so they can open a second store near Shadyside *hint hint.*  Maybe I'm bias but living in Pittsburgh just got a little bit happier with this place in town.  

FYI, Google Maps didn't find the exact location.  I was a few blocks off.  Just look for the huge white/baby blue Whitehall Tire Service building.  CTS is right across from it.
