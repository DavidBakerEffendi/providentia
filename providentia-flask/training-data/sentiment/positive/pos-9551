And best of all, The Annual Vintage Grand Prix!!!

What a great event on a hot Summer day!  We went for an hour and ended up spending the day!!  We watched the qualifying races which were great fun.  All the race cars were so cute!  And a lot of them ran really, really fast!  We even got to hang out at the starting line.  Also, we were very amazed by the car shows.  There were Aston Martins, Austin-Healeys, Bentley's, Jaguars, Lotus', Mini's, MG's, and Triumphs.  There were Lamborghini's and Maserati's and Porsche's and heck, cars that I had never seen before!!  Plus, there were a lot of muscle cars from the 60's and 70's.  I was totally amazed!  This awesome event only comes once a year, every July, so get ready for next year!!
