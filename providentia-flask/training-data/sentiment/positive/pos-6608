I have driven by US Eggs several times on my way in or out of Old Town Scottsdale.  US Eggs has to have one of the tallest buildings I have ever seen for a restaurant.  One morning, I decided to give it a shot.  I did a little research on Yelp, and I saw that people enjoyed the protein pancakes.  I eat quite a bit of protein supplements, so I was wondering if they somehow infused whey protein powder into the pancake batter.  It actually has fresh blueberries, cinnamon, and almonds.  I think the batter had whole grain wheat.  I decided to go with the half and half, which gave me 2 mini protein pancakes (humongous) and an Idaho Skillet that came with potatoes, your choice of 1 egg, and a type of sauce such as Cajun spices, Santa Fe, or various other assortments.  Each of my friends got the same dish, but with different skillet sauces.  We enjoyed the Cajun, Santa Fe, and chicken avocado.

The best part of the experience is that you definitely get your money's worth.  If you ever have a hard workout or are extremely hungry, come to US Eggs for a power-packed breakfast.
