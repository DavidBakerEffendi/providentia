This place is great. Sushi is always fresh and they are made right in front of you. I really like the layout of the place too. Tables around the convey belt and then there are tables on the sides as well. Food is delicious too and it's a great price. It ranges from 1-2 $ per plate. They also have desert as well. There are a lot of parking spots outside as well. Will definitely come again.
