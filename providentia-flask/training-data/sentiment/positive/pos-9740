This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to for brunch. Their menu is so well made that every dish is delicious, not just certain dishes. Their restaurant has a cute classy family style to it, it's very welcoming, and the waiters and chef are all so friendly.

For drinks, their Mango Melon Juice is fresh made in house daily and is absolutely refreshing. I get it every time I go here.

For breakfast, their Portobello Eggs Benedict or Pork Belly Benedict is so delicious. I don't personally like eggs benedict, but I actually really love theirs.

For lunch, their Ono Chicken Wings was very delicious with a twist to Hawaiian sweet and tasty flavors. The Pork Belly Banh Mi is a fusion to Vietnamese sandwiches and had meat that was very moist. On the lighter side, the Spinach Salad is very simple yet one of my favorites. The Miso Pork Belly Burger is one of their signature dishes and it does not disappoint. As you bite into it, you can see all the juicies bursting out from the burger and it is served with crispy potato nuggets.

Complimentary chips (with a secret seasoning) and salsa are served.

Love the food here, love the service, love the atmosphere, only wish this place opened for dinner!
