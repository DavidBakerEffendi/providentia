This place is great!!!! You have to come here on Tuesdays because it's unlimited toppings for ONLY $6.00. 

The best way I can describe is... Think about eating at a Chipotle/subway. Now add a flat bread and start picking your toppings. It's takes about 4mins for them to cook the pizza. Pretty cool right? + the pizza I made was delicious.

Pepperoni, ham, chicken, meatball, olives & mushrooms. Mmmm mmmm yummy!
