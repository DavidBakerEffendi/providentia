Best bagels in town - I know because I searched high and low.  This place has the feel of a neighborhood diner and Jewish deli wrapped in one.  No skimping on the schmear here.  I get the everything with veggie cream cheese, and if I am hungover I have a bacon, egg, and swiss on sesame.  Then I eat celery for a week and feel self loathing.  

It's in the middle of a non descript commercial strip mall in Summerlin, but I come from downtown and run into people from my building here.  Fresh, yummy bagels.  It's not NYC 5 star bagels, but its the best I've tasted outside the 5 boroughs.
