How this place doesn't have 5 solid stars...the pizza, the ingredients, the flavors, and the customer service was on great!!! I couldn't make up my mind all I knew was I wanted their Pizza.  The guy at the counter helped me out....this Pizza was fantastic. 

Pepperoni supreme and added arugula & spinach to it and they hooked me up w/free knots per Yelp check in offer. Glad I stood there and checked in. 
Pros: great location, free parking w/purchase, pizza crust was awesome and knots were buttery soft. 

Cons: none!
Do yourself a favor, go earlier than actual lunch time or midday. All pros...no cons..
