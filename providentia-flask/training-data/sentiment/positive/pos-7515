In-n-out is my favorite fast food place... and this specific location is my favorite in-n-out. It's on the way home for me - which is a good and bad thing. Good because it's so convenient; bad because it's so convenient! My week isn't complete without an in-n-out burger. Eeek! 

I always go thru the drive-thru. One, because I am lazy. Two, because I can't stand the smell of onions! The entire restaurant reeks of onions as soon as you walk in and the smell stays on ya. No thanks. It's just so much easier to be lazy. Another reason I love the drive thru is because they're so friendly and fast. They ALWAYS greet with something along the lines of "welcome to in-n-out, how are you doing today?" Yeah lots of people ask that question but they actually care enough to follow through and give you a real answer and thank you if you ask how they are as well. It's great!
