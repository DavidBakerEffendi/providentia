My family and I went here Thursday night and had THE BEST experience ever!! Definitely my new fav sushi spot. From the amazing sushi, to the decent price and most importantly the experience the servers gave us! I wish I would have got the gentlemen's name, he had longer hair and was older then the other servers, because he was the SWEETEST to our darling daughter! We had a saki bomb and he randomly came over and brought her a special orange Japanese soda that had a marble in it, just to make her feel special too, and she had such a kick out of that!! I had the California roll and the shrimp tempura roll and my husband tried the chefs special plate where they decide for you what they bring out. Everything was really fresh, a must try!!
