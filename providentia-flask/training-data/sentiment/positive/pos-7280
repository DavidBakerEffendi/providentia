This place is amazing! The ayce selection is huge so you have so much you can try! And there are no limitations like other sushi places. Whatever is on the menu, you can order. The CJ's special rolls was out of this world! The portions are just right, and not filled with a ton of rice which I like. And the best part is they do half rolls, so you can taste even more! The staff is so friendly. This is by far the best sushi place I have been to!
