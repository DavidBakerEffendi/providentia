Visiting family in area. Stopped in to Aladdin's for dinner. Nice setting, friendly staff. Started w hummus and tabula and pita. Really great, not like the store hummus. Great beef shish kabob plate, beef little tough, but otherwise son enjoyed. Curry chicken roll was flavorful and large. Wife had a falafel roll which reminded her of earlier visits to other Aladdin restaurants years ago. I had a Sambusek plate, which was chicken curry in a pastry wrap and a side salad w tahini sauce. Very good. We bought 3 different baklava for take out. Great honey and nuts flavor. Great food.
