This was my 2nd visit to Savoy.  Went here on a Groupon.  Simply amazing place with delicious food.  I really appreciate how the owner was able to renovate an old building in the Strip District into this beautiful restaurant and club lounge.

The menu is definitely a little pricey, but it's really worth it in my opinion, especially for special occasions and date nights.  If money wasn't an issue I would eat here at least once a month.

ENVIRONMENT:
I'm a sucker for restaurants with modern atmospheres and Savoy doesn't disappoint in this regard.  As soon as you walk in, the vibe is just awesome.  The mood lighting is just right too.  A live jazz band was playing on the main floor which added to this.  However, we eventually were seated downstairs in what they call the "Owner's Room", which is a small room with about 6 tables in it and a flat screen TV.  This came off a little cheesy to me and I felt a bit separated from the rest of the patrons, but this is just a personal peeve of mine.  For the full Savoy experience, I recommend asking to be seated on the "main" floor and not in the basement.

FOOD:
As for the food, I ordered the Lamb chops, which at $38 is the most expensive entree on the menu.  But I had a Groupon that allowed me to order whatever I wanted, so why not? :-)  The size of the chops are very generous and they are served over risotto.  It was unbelievably delicious!

For dessert, my wife and I had "salted caramel chocolate cake with banana ice cream".  I hope I wrote that correctly.  It was amazing and they give you such a generous amount I could hardly finish it.

I can't wait I go back here again!
