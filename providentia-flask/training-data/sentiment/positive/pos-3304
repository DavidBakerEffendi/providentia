We have been lost without Palette in Downtown Phx, but this place may be our new spot.  The atmosphere is great, clean modern lines and very trendy setup.  The staff very friendly the owner? walking around checking on guests to make sure everyone is pleased with their orders.  The food DELISH!  I had the plain and simple (eggs, potatoes, toast $5.50) simple and great tasting.  My husband  had the  Croquet Monsieur and loved it and for $7.50 you cannot beat it.  Great for families or meeting up with a friend.  This place is amazing and we will be back!
