This is probably the BEST chinese place in mcmurray and my favorite. I normally don't like beef dishes because they're not tender and full of gristle. Their beef is perfect! I love their Mongolian beef and chicken, delicious! Their crab ragoons are really good too. I always get "on the house" donuts which is fried bread dough and sugar, I haven't had these since a chinese place I used to go to in Florida. No other chinese place has them around here. Sometimes you have to wait a bit longer than normal for your food to be ready for pickup but it's always worth it. The staff is always so nice. Whenever I'm craving Chinese food this is the first place I order for takeout. You definitely won't be disappointed.
