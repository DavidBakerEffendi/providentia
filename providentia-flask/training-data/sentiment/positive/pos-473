It took me a long time to scratch Pie Commission off of my list of places to check out, mainly because I would only visit the neighborhood on Sundays when they're closed. The wait was definitely worth it. Trying out dishes that I don't normally eat (like savoury meat-filled pies) is an adventure I like to indulge in every so often. This is a perfect spot for that.

Must-try items:
Braised Beef Rib pie
Any savoury pie w/ fries

They have dessert pies here which I plan to try as well. The brisket pie tastes really good. It feels like a very old school, hearty, classic meal that'll get you right and full. They sell them frozen as well which is a bonus for takeout situations. You can heat them up at home whenever you feel for one.

I expected it to be a pricier place with stingy portions for some reason, but I was wrong. The pies are a great value meal and a rare experience. Staff were very polite and friendly on my first visit They'll walk you through the entire menu if you need it. I definitely recommend trying this place out.
