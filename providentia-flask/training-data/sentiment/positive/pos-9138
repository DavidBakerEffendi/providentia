On a recommendation was here for lunch Friday afternoon and WOW. I've never had such a freshly made sandwich before from a shop. I had the vegetarian (#6), which was full of different veggies (sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, tomato, etc), on a whole grain bread that definitely tasted homemade. It was filling and excellent- and in no way am I a vegetarian! I'm also NOT a fan of mayo, but I even enjoyed the mayo on this sandwich. I will definitely be coming back to try their other creations, especially now that we have the convenience of the light rail to get us to Tempe!
