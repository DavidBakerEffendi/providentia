The salsa is what you come for, the food is what you stay for. The salsa is hands down the best in Las Vegas. It is fresh with chopped onions and herbs waiting to be scooped up. I could drink this stuff. It could be served as a soup on its own. It is so good. The bean dip is a great pairing to it, but really the red stuff is all you need. I mean with all the veggies, could one live on salsa alone? If yes, this is the stuff you want to choose. The menu options are wide and offer a group plenty of choices. I've never been disappointed in a meal selection here. Plus, there is a bakery connected to it so you can get your concha fix as well.
