My wife and I grabbed lunch today here at Bon Chef Cafe and I was totally ecstatic with our experience. Food was awesome, service was great, and the atmosphere was familiar and quiet. We ordered some of the reasonably priced entrees, the portions were solid (not too much not too little), quality was on point, and they even brought out a couple of samples of their baklava with a coffee we ordered after the meal. Little details like the chef coming out and asking how everything was were just icing on the cake. We're going to give breakfast and dinner a shot as well.
