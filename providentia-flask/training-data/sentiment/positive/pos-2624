There seem to be so many great options in this area and even in this building that it's hard to say what to get. We just had a taste for tacos so we went for it. They were piping hot and each was pretty fantastic. Although the asada and chorizo were great it was the carnitas that stole the show! In fact, I'd probably opt to get only carnitas on my next visit!
