I've been a big fan of Phoenix Coffee for years, and I always loved Phoenix in Lakewood! The Root Cafe is Phoenix reimagined! Still the same great Phoenix Coffee (locally roasted) and loose leaf teas, plus great food, all cooked in house. I have not tried a ton of the food, but what I have tried has been excellent. Their pizza is quality. Sunbutter cookies- TO DIE FOR. Pretty much any muffin or scone I've ever tried has been delicious. 
The vibe here is everything I look for in a coffee shop. The baristas are hip, but not too cool to talk to you. They are super friendly! The decor is original, and you can tell the place was decorated with love. It's not trying too hard, but it's really warm and welcoming. There are big tables, small tables, and a bar facing the window to sit at. It is well lit. It's great for sitting and reading, writing, working, catching up with a friend, people watching, etc.
This is by far my favorite coffee shop on the West Side. If you haven't been yet, CHECK IT OUT!
