Updating this review, as the old Ninety's is LONG GONE, and the new Ninety's is my new ice cream go-to! The owners are incredibly friendly and super helpful when picking from the variety of ice cream (and cookie dough!) treats they have available. 

Their milkshakes are spot-on (for extra, you can add icing and toppings on the outside for that perfect instagram photo!), and their macaron ice cream sandwiches are messy, but delicious! I would highly recommend any of their cookie dough pops. While the location itself is off the beaten path (in University), it's worth the trip to try these unique treats!
