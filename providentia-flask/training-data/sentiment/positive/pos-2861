Let's be honest, you do not come to a Chinese buffet for the finest in cuisine. If you are comparing one to a Michelin star restaurant, you might need to check your expectations.

However, this place is better than any Chinese buffet I've tried. The food was hot and fresh, they had my usual favorites, and the staff was very friendly.

The sushi was tasty according to my companion, and they had a decent variety.

But the best part was the hibachi style stir fry.  Choose your meat, noodles and veggies, enjoy some conversation with the chef (the other guy didn't want garlic so the chef tossed it into mine with a smirk - thank you!), and before you know it you have a hot garlicky plate that I couldn't stop eating. I'm smacking my lips thinking about it, now.

I finished it off with one of the classic sugar doughnuts and some hard ice cream - not soft serve, like most buffets.

Ten dollars. Ten. Dollars.  Cheapest, best Chinese buffet, bottom line.
