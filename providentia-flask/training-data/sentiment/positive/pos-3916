If you are looking for authentic Mexican, this is the place.  Great for burritos or a quick Mexican meal while on the go.  I love the Pork Burrito with guacamole and both hot salsa and mild.

The staff is super friendly and very helpful.  Enjoy a Corona for the full Mexican adventure. 

Definitely good value for money.
