I was pretty excited to try this place out.  I saw on yelp that they had beignets and well...I drove right over!  Haven't had a fresh beignet since I was in New Orleans few years ago.  They were absolutely delish...really, enough for 2/3 people...but I still ate all three.  Very nice, laid back place and I will be returning.
