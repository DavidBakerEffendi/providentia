Add this to my list of "my God why didn't I try this place before" places. Like the others have mentioned, this road-side stand does fantastic BBQ beef and smoked brisket on a hoagie roll at a dynamite price, all served up by a super-friendly dude in less time than it would take you to grab a gut-buster from Rotten Ronnie's. 

At the owner's advice, I had the smoked brisket. I was happy to see that while the brisket was sliced quite thin (freshly sliced might I add) there was a nice balance of meat, crusty edges and fat, unlike the mushy, chopped, steam-tray resting beef that some of the city's supposed BBQ royalty (or should I say high priests) serve up. 

I was also pleasantly surprised by the toppings. I ordered mine 1/2 plain to really check out the meat, and half chef's choice. This turned out to be: sliced onions, a little bit of hot sauce, and a little bit of what appeared to be a provolone cheese sauce. Plain was great, and the meat holds up, but hot damn the next time I head back I'm ordering the whole thing chefs special. 

The hoagie loaf or Vienna roll had nice flavour, and while I'd usually argue for a slightly crustier loaf, I was actually glad not to shower my lap with breadcrumbs. Only thing that would make this better would be a can of cherry coke, rather than the standard coke, Pepsi, or ice-tea. 

I am definitely a fan, and can't wait to drop in again (that's sort of my threshold for 5 stars...if I scheme, daydream, and wistfully plan my next visit). 

You have to love it when someone chooses to do something simple but do it really, really well. 5 sauce soaked stars.
