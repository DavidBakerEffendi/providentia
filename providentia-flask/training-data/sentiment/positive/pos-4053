Love.. love... love. This was a new find for us and would more than likely return.  The service was wonderful (LOVED MELIA!!!) From the moment we arrived, the staff was very attentive. The food was amazing. I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and baked mac n cheese. My fiance had the lobster. We highly recommend this place. It's fancy but NOT stuffy.
