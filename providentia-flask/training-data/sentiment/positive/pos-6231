This review is strictly on the Pho as I'm unwilling to try anything else off the menu after driving half way across the city for its delicious broth. I can honestly say that the broth at this Pho restaurant is my favorite in the city, you can really taste all the different spices used but none of them over power the other. I am a huge fan and recommend it to any true fan of Pho
