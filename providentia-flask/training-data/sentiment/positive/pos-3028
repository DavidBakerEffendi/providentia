I'm from a suburb of Chicago, where we had Greek restaurants on every corner and I was in heaven. When I moved to Vegas, I've yet to find an authentic Greek restaurant that could match up to back home, until I had this today! Hands down the best I've had in Vegas. Everything was so fresh and delicious! Wish it wasn't in the mall because I really dislike going to the mall but I will definitely go just for this awesome food. The baklava was Devine!
