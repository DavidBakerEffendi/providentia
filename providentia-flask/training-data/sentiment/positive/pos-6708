Great breakfast place, I would recommend to come here early in the morning if it gets past 9 AM on a sunday or Saturday the place is packed. The bagel is the best in Las Vegas the prices are good based on the quality and quantity of the food being served. Make sure to come here HUNGRY otherwise you have to bring the food home. My daughter  gets her chicken fingers and the servings are enormous enough for an Adult Large Meal.  The service is good , although due to the amount of people the service degrades a bit which is completely understandable. If your looking for  A Simple breakfast with good quality and quantity this place would be it.
