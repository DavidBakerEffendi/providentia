What a great place for breakfast. This is a family owned business with a great business model. Great service, great food, immaculate restaurant. We were in town from Las Vegas and found this place on Yelp. The food was good and plentiful, it came out quickly. They give you a carafe of coffee so you aren't looking for your waitress to refill your cup. In spite of being super busy on a Saturday morning, we had our food in 10 minutes or less. What a surprise. I give them 5 thumbs up
