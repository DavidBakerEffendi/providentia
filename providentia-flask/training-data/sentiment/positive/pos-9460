Our first time here today and we were impressed!
The waitresses were very friendly and attentive. The food was at a good temperature. Country Fried New York Steak & Eggs were delish. My husband said that the Homemade Corned Beef Hash & Eggs were the best. 
Over all we loved it and we'll be back soon :)
