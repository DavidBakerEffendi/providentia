they have an entire menu for vegans. & its really freaking good. I've been here twice and was so happy both times. anyone would love to eat here cause its so good. the decor is awesome. the bathroom was super cool lol you just have to see it for yourself. definitely try it if you're thinking about it!!! i recommend sushi samba to anyone because any diet would be more than pleased & the vibe is good. :)
