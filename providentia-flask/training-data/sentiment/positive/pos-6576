Dinner on patio with friends on March 19 was a first class experience in all respects.  The grounds were beautiful, the weather spectacular and the delicious cuisine paired with flawless service completed the package. Julia ( from Philly), our server , was quite personable and very knowledgeable on the menu, wine pairings and the history of the property. We will request her when we return to this restaurant. (Even though we live 300 miles away) 

I had the locavore beet salad with goat cheese - beautiful presentation and delicious. Entree was halibut with Pasilla chili-lime beurre blanc sauce - show stopper. 

Finished our meal with an expertly prepared cappuccino and a walk around the grounds and appreciated the historical photographs.
