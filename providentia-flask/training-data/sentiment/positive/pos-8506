Our crew stops by for coffee about 3 times a shift here at little city. The food is hot, fast and good. You must be hungry if you come here. The chicken fried steak and eggs is quite good, hand breaded on site and very fresh with some really good sausage gravy
The naked wraps (omelets) are really good with the name your own being the best $8.75 for an everything omelet. I usually have them leave out the zucchini though. The service is the best in town and they do have a drive through. But I would recommend going in as it is pretty fast.
I have had burgers here and they are quite tasty also.
Yes I do recommend going there, just not while we are there. JK.
They also do have a great patio out back that is set up for a TV but have never seen it on. Maybe in the summer in the evening.
