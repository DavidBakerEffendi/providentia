You ever have a conversation were you want to go somewhere with friends that isn't too loud, isn't too douchey, the food menu is good in case you want to order something, the drink menu has a lot of options, and the wait staff is knowledgeable? This is that place. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with the sense that wherever you've come from, you are now a traveler passing through the Rhineland. The food has a Germanic thing going on too (meatballs, frites, pigs knuckle, sausages, sour kraut). Each beer comes in its own specific glass, you will find no generic pint or half pint glasses here. The owners are clearly people who love beer above all other drinks. I have been here many times and will be back. It is close to the movie theatre so great for post-flick conversation. There is seating upstairs and downstairs. For food, I recommend the pigs knuckle.
