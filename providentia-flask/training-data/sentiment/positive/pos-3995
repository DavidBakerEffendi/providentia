Odin is truly one of a kind. I have yet to find a cafe that covers all bases. It's great for a great coffee, brunch, lazy afternoons & a chill night out.

5 stars for the coffee. From their lattes to cortado's, they are always good. They also make a mean matcha latte. 

5 stars for the food. Odin has the usual cookies, brownies & cakes. They also have amazing empanadas, breakfast dishes (pancakes, shakshuka), paninis & other delicious pairings. They also carry ready-made salads, juice & chocolate. 

5 stars for their liquor & beer options. Not only is Odin open early, but also late on Friday's & Saturday's. It's a great spot to grab a drink & have a chill night.

5 starts for the friendly staff. They are always super friendly & attentive to their customers. 


Lastly, (& most obviously) the decor. The Scandinavian design is absolutely beautiful. The layout allows for lots of workspace, plus communal seating. I absolutely love the Magis stools, which are way more comfortable then they look. The only downside is that it does get packed with the usual laptop club. Luckily the weather is starting to warm up again, because Odin also has a fantastic patio.

If you haven't already been, go now!
