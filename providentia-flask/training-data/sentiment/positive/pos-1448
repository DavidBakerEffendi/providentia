Whenever I would pass this restaurant, it always appeared busy and packed. A good sign of an amazing restaurant. I put it on my MUST TRY list. 

Well I tried and let me tell you, awesome! We arrived close 12:30 on Sunday, so prime brunch time. It was busy when we walked in, we had to wait about 5 minutes for a seat.  The restaurant itself is fairly small, probably close to 50 tables(?). The menu is pretty extensive, from Breakfast fare, to sandwiches, burgers, pasta etc. 

I ordered the veggies burger, which was absolutely insanely good. The fries were nice, light and crispy to the bite!  My foodie mate ordered the portabello burger (it had a portabello mushroom and some grilled veggies, and goat cheese). He said it was good too. 

Before our meal we were given a basket of bread and 3 types of dips. One was an eggplant one, the second hummus and the third, equally delish, not sure what it was.. It was a creamy based dip.. 

Each burger meal comes with a salad - either house or caesar. I ordered a greek salad for $1 more.  It was one of the best, maybe even the best greek salad I've ever had, the dressing had a sweetness to it.. mmmmmmm.... 

My meal ended up costing $12 before tax and tip, which is pretty good for lunch! I had a good size doggie bag which I ate later that day. I love this restaurant...
