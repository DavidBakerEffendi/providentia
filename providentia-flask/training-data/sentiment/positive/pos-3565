Awesome food, awesome price. I found this place by accident but quickly realized what a gem it was. The sushi is more than reasonably priced. The service is awesome. I've become a regular, service like this is HARD to find. Youre treated like a valued customer, which is something that is rare in this day and age. If you want awesome sushi, even better service and keep some money in your wallet, I definitely recommend you try this place.
