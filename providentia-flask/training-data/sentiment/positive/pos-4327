I moved to Los Angeles, yet Golden Dragon is still my favorite sushi place! Every time I'm anywhere within 3 hours of Golden Dragon, I make a point to visit.

Their sushi is top notch, as are their other dishes. Chai, Hong, and Meng love joking around with their guests, especially when you sit at the sushi bar! It doesn't take long for them to treat you like family, which then leads to them offering you food not on the menu.

I keep trying, but have yet to find a sushi place as fun and delicious as Golden Dragon!
