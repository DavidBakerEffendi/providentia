Las Vegas strip has a little gem of a place with this restaurant.

When I arrived, I thought, "Ok, maybe this is just like another burger or steak place like Applebees or Chili's". 

Walking through the doors though, was a whole other world. It definitely resonates Las Vegas.

In the reception area you will discover slot machines, mirrored walls with lots of blue and purple neon lights outlining the different segmented areas.

On the right side of the restaurant is standard seating for groups, families, etc. decorated in some nice greenery.

As I walked towards the entrance to the left of the restaurant, that area is known as the Fireside lounge.

Throughout the lounge are circular table settings with a fireplace in the middle. The atmosphere reminds me of what I would imagine of the early heydays of Las Vegas. It was appropriate to dress up to the nines and hit the town and I imagine this lounge to be reminiscent of that era.

I was there to enjoy some drinks with my other Zapponian co workers and we ended up ordering some food as well.

The wings were good but I'll be honest, the drinks took a little long to arrive. I ended up opening two tabs and ordered from the bar.

Other than that, I had a great time.

If you want to lose yourself and find a themed restaurant, put this on the list to visit, it's on the strip and it perfect for something different and yet a bit intimate.
