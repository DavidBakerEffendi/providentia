First off, read my review for New India Market, which is in the next complex over. Now come back to Rani's World Foods. Yeah. The difference is ridiculous.

This store is much larger! Cleaner! The staff is much nicer! The selection of products is better! Most importantly, the pricing is always consistent!

The prices don't constantly change, and almost everything is clearly marked with a price tag. The price isn't up to the person at the cash register at that very moment. Everyone pays the same price.

Also, they have fresh food as well, and it is amazing!! 

Plenty of shopping carts, so you can load up on all your Indian groceries, produce and whatnots. You'll be on your merry way in no time at all.

Great selection of Indian prayer items, teas, spices, pots, pans and the like. Also, if you like marmite, vegemite or any of that stuff....you can get it here.

Hop to it!
