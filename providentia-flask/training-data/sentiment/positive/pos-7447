It's been over a year since my last review and at current count I have eaten here 65 times.  To say I like this place is an understatement. It is by far my favorite place to go to lunch. The staff here is exceptional. In all the times I have come here for lunch I have never once had bad service or bad food. I can't speak for how authentic the food is since I have never been to Thailand. My Thai food experience is limited to restaurants here in the states, but I haven't found any better than here. It has the added bonus of being extremely close to my house and 95% of the time the food is served way faster than you would think possible. If they are super slammed for lunch then it can take a bit of time occasionally, but they have soup and salad while you wait.  I am a huge fan of noodle dishes and they have my favorite Drunken Noodles and Pad See Ew.

TRY:
- Drunken Noodles
- Pad See Ew
- Fried Thai Ice Cream
