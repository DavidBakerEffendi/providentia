Hello, I think I'm in love!
This co-op is by far the best I have been to. The selection of food is great! I was blown away by the amount of vegan selections available, from the bakery to the deli. Having a vegan grilled cheese on a dairy free grill made my day. The staff is so friendly and helpful. I wish the co-op in Tucson was like this one.
