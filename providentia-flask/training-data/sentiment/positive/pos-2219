Want to try some of their delicious meats and cheeses but not sure how to choose?  Get the butcher's platter!  We did, and did not regret it!  It came with meats and cheeses, and also some little nibbles (deviled eggs, bacon wrapped sweet potatoes and some sort of smoked salmon dip).  For my meal I got the sea bass, and it was also amazing.  Fish was cooked perfectly and the whole dish had fantastic flavor.

A great dining option near the Talking Stick arena if you're going to an event there. But be sure to get there on the early side if you're planning to eat... we checked in at 5pm (our event started at 8pm) and had only a 30-45 minute wait.  By the time they called us up to our table the lobby was packed and the wait time was over an hour.  We were glad we got there when we did!
