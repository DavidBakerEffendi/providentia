Love this place! 

The staff could not be nicer or more helpful. I have had so many conversations with them about beer and it's always really enjoyable. They have a great selection of beer on tap to fill up growlers, which is awesome. You can also make your own six pack and the selection is pretty good for that! Lots of other beer and wine to choose from. 

I heard about this place from Melt, by the way. They mention on the menu that you can find the beers they have at this place, which is why I first went here. Now I live nearby and go here fairly regularly. It's awesome!
