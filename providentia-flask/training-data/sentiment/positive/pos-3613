I have ordered delivery from Alexander's twice. The delivery was fast within 30 minutes or less, the food was good, And the staff are friendly. Prices are average.
 I have tried the BBQ wings and the pepperoni pizza, both were delicious and the ranch that comes with the wings is VERY tasty! This place gets 5 stars from me. I really do love excellent customer service and I believe that is the icing on the cake for Alexanders.
