Don't know what to eat on meatless Monday?!  Here's the place : )  I've been coming here quite often since it has opened.  It's spacious, excellent service, fantastic food and great tea.  It isn't as noisy as most Chinese restaurants.  My fave:Baked turnip puff, baked mushrooms tart, pan fried lotus cake, layered cake with nuts and rice roll. Dinner is good as well!  Everything is good here : )  
* ask for an extra pot of chrysanthemum tea and mix with your favorite tea.  Chrysanthemum goes well with both green and red tea*
