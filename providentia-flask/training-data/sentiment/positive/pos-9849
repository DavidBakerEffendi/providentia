This is a place that you to when you are really hungry or seeking to share. The portions are huge including the menu. It is hard to choose what to eat since everything sounds so good.  I had the brioche french toast, the bread is made there and each piece is at least 1 1/2" thick, my mother had a side of pancakes which in most restaurants this would have been a full sized order and it only cost $2.95. Can't beat it! Others in our party had omelets which were packed with various add-ins and comes with a side of pancakes. Even the coffee, which is Lavazza, is very good and your cup rarely has a chance to be empty since our waitress kept our cups full all the time. The service is great for such a busy place we had just the right amount of attention paid to our table. They have a great outdoor, dog friendly patio too. But if you go on a weekend be prepared to wait for a table, it is very busy and it's best to sit outside if you can since inside is very noisy.
