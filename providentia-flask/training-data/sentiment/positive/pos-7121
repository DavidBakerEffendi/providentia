Today was my first time at a Wildflower Bread Company. I've been in the Valley for a year now but assumed it was just another Panera or Paradise Bakery and never bothered to venture in. On a whim I made a last minute decision to grab lunch there and loved it! The atmosphere was wonderful and even though the place was full for a Sunday lunch it didn't seem too loud or overwhelming. The selection was more interesting than Panera. I chose an open faced Chicken Parm sandwich. The homemade marinara was incredibly flavorful and I enjoyed the added touch of mushrooms and arugula. Normally Chicken Parm that isn't breaded tastes dry and dull but this was the opposite!

My only complaint would be that they have a delicious looking pasta menu that doesn't start until 3. I originally wanted to order the Herb Linguini but it was only 12:30. I didn't see that listed on their menu anywhere and it would be helpful to have that listed. 

On my way out I saw some amazing looking bagels. I ended up getting some, but they didn't have a dozen deal listed anywhere. It would be nice to have a dozen price listed instead of just $1.29 each. They're delicious enough that I'll still come back for more! Definitely recommend it for anyone on any sort of diet or who has dietary restrictions as well.
