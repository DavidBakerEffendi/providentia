I love everything from the atmosphere, friendly staff, food, culture and mission.  Not only is the food delicious but each store is committed to their community.  I don't only mean that they will buy their food and drink from local farms and manufacturers because they go even further than that.  The concept of Even Stevens is when you buy a sandwich, they will donate the ingredients for one sandwich to a local service in need, such as food banks or homeless shelters.  When we went in, only one month in, they had already donated almost 4500 sandwiches locally.
