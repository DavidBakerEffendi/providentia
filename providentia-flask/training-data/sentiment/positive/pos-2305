Mothers Day Dinner was a success. Chef Juan knocked it out of the park with his signature paella and surf N turf dishes. Appetizers were quick and cooked to perfection. The octopus was just right and the clams too.

Cesar, our waiter was very personable and helpful in decision making for menu/wine items.

The owner, conversed with us and made us feel welcome.

Highly recommend Bodega 13!
