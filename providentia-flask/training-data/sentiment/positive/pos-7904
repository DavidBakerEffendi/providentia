The half-chicken is an amazing deal! Comes with fries and salad, and the chicken itself is very well seasoned and full of flavor. The seating space is a little bit limited though, and the pastry section's desserts seemed not very fresh. Altogether, a great experience because the chicken was top notch. I will definitely revisit this place, but I suggest to avoid the desserts section in the evening.
