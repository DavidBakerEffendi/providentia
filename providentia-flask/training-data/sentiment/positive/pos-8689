This place is unbelievably awesome! Every single employee is top notch with stellar management to boot! Toby (manager) came and spoke with us along with other employee's. Made us feel like we were family. My daughter thought the hand washing station was so cool! The food? BOMB! An employee came by and asked my daughter what PDQ stood for and when she answered correctly he gave her a shirt! Needless to say this is our new spot. Great people, awesome food, and good vibes. Thank you guys for being you!
