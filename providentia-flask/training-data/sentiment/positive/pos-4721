Great place for Ramen in Southend...I have a seafood allergy and knowing how Ramen is prepared I called ahead to see if all their Ramen was prepared with any type of fish or fish oil....they took the time over the phone to research the menu to tell me exactly what I can order when I get there. And they also informed me that they can omit any thing from any of the dishes on the menu at my request. Once there our order was taken promptly and the food cake out quickly and did not disappoint. Top notch service and great food, you can't go wrong.
