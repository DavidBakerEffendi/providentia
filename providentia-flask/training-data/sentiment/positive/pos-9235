Fantastic food. Fantastic people. Not sure what else there is to say. It doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that dissuade you. We had the hearty skillet, Hawaiian French toast and the boom power. Way too much food for two of us. Everything is fresh and in large proportions. Really good stuff and we will definitely be back!
