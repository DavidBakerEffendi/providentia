Gave Sweet Dough a visit this morning and was impressed with their selection...even though it was 10:45. I knew me and my family wouldn't be satisfied with the standard dozen, so we got a mix of regular and premium donuts, eclairs and fritters. They were all EXCEPTIONAL! My favorite was the chocolate-iced BOSTON cream-filled and the banana and peanut butter eclair. It had real banana cream and banana chips atop the chocolate icing with a ribbon of peanut butter. It was a doughnut that would've made Elvis proud. Not exactly cheap for the dozen mixed, $20, but weLl worth it after the taste-testing. Will definitely be back!
