The Glen Tavern is a quaint, cozy, friendly place to enjoy fine food. Truly a Gastropub in that definition. The pub environment welcomes you in, and makes you feel at ease. The service staff are friendly and efficient. The food is fine restaurant quality! We enjoyed everything that we selected along with some local mirco-brews. Fantastic place nestled in the beautiful little town of Glen Williams!
