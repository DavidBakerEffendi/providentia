I go here at least twice a month for Sunday brunch, try to introduce it to as many people as I can. Great value. I've been twice for dinner on other days and it's also delicious, but just doesn't seem like the wildly good bang for your buck that you get on Sunday. The line in the morning goes around the block every week! The menu also changes weekly.
