Been coming to this place in mornings and on lunch breaks almost going on three years now and was quite happy to know that this location was not selected for closing, unlike the ones Park Road and East Boulevard. Coffee is excellent, all of the time. Staff are marvelous, friendly, and know people by name (as well as learn your orders and take them before paying, if you come often enough). The breakfast foods (i.e. oatmeal, biscuits) I've ordered on occasion and liked them. Keep up the great work Caribou.
