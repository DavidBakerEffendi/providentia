Is it loud? Yes.

I have been 3 times and loved it every time.

As the name suggests, it is Korean - Soul Food Fusion.    
The Loosey is to die for. Think of a kicked up whopper!
Phili Cheesestake is amazing. Don't judge...just order and eat it.
Pork Neck Bowl and Kim Chi Fried rice are epic.
Squash Poutine is unlike anything you'll try elsewhere. Curry used as the gravy!

Cheap. Fun. Loud. Unique Flavours.  I send folks from out of town all the time and they always thank me later.
