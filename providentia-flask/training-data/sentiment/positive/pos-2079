Feast Buffet at Palace Station Casino

Maybe I was just lucky, but my experience was excellent. 

I went to see the new makeover and was really impressed. It's set up very similarly to the AYCE at the Palms with various stations set up by cooking technique and regional flavors. 

The Turkey and the Brisket were great! The Top Round was a little dry and tough, but there were plenty of other meat choices. Some of the side dishes, such as the Hungarian Goulash were on the dry side from the heat lamps but still tasty. The salad bar had all the usuals plus a hummus and pita section with half a dozen flavor variations. The Healthy Section was novel and cooked 'bowls' to order for you. Another highlight was the matcha boba tea (without boba) and sugar rimmed horchata. The gelato was awesome and there was a nice selection of deserts in addition to cobblers and a soft-serve station. 

I'm giving Feast Buffet 5 Stars because of the great value for the money. Especially if you have a player's card. The worst part was the 45 minute wait to get in, the best part was the super friendly service!
