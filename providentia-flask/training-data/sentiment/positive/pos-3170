Came in with a Groupon, otherwise, I'd never have found this place--and what a find it is!  Prices are excellent, quality is excellent, service is excellent.
I'd suggest you use Baker Wee for alot of your cookie buying.  I know I am.  I love this place!!!!

By the way, I have been in there two times near holidays, and they do some really cute cookies each holiday..cool!
