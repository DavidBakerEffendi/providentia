This hotel was simply beautiful and huge (as is everything in Vegas). The King suite was roomy and spacious with a sunken living room, double sink in bathroom suite with stand in shower and separate tub. The window to our room overlooked the hills in the background. It was perfect. Takes about 20mins to exit the hotel because of the size (lol ok perhaps a bit of an exaggeration but still!). Lots of food and shopping options. The main pool area is amazing and is connected to the Palazzo pools which you have access to. There seems to be an unlimited amount of pools so just go exploring on this level (4). There is also a smaller pool area on floor 10 which is shaded and quieter.
Would highly recommend this hotel.
