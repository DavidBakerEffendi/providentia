I was feeling ill last week, so I decided to get some soup and noodles to sustain my cold, and I tried this place out since I live down the street, and I was impressed! the chicken soup and a variety of vegetables and had a good bite of spice to it which helped clear up my chest congestion and the chicken noodles especially tasty with carrots and lettuce chopped in it. I'll be trying this place soon again with it being right next to the movie theater makes it even better.
