All I can say about Pizza People is, WOW!  Yummy pizza at a yummy price:D I never eat my crust, because it's usually never good enough. But it's all about the dough at this little food truck! They took their time in creating it and it shows! I especially love the names they chose for some of their pizzas, like "testosteroni" (spelling?) but it's a meat pizza made with a local favorite, Schreiner's fine sausage.I could of ate two, Incredible! They also have vegan options which is a great plus. And starting at $6 bucks a pizza, you can't beat it!  The owners of this food truck are Marybeth and Tim. A couple that is wonderfully friendly and inviting. I hope that you get a chance to check out their wonderful product and give them a great review!

Cheers!
