Had dinner here for the first time. Service is good, very sweet and polite. Ordered egg drop soup delicious, egg rolls.. I gotta be honest I rarely like egg rolls from most places because there's always something that I don't like, these on the other hand are good, along with the crab puffs. Ordered Mongolian beef, Wong chow mein, all delicious! It's really hard to find that old school Chinese food and this is where it's at... Definitely be back.
