So, this is seriously one of the best hidden secrets in all of Phoenix!  I have been here 3 times (and I rarely go back to the same place twice - it has to be that good!) and this place never disappoints.  Get here early enough to snag a comfortable outdoor sofa and enjoy the great, reasonably priced wine, cheese and paninis.  I love this place!
