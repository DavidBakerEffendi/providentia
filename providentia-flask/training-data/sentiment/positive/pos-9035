5 stars!
And i must thank Yelp for this one too!
Since moving from Bloor/Ossington to Etobicoke, i was in dire need of a real butcher. I was spoiled by Gasparos (see review), and will always consider that place the real deal. So i typed into Yelp, and came across Medium Rare.

I needed something pretty specific, and cut specific (inside round, was making beef jerky), so decided to give this place a shot.
I was very impressed upon first impression. Great deli meats and cheese display when you arrive. 

I have been here a few times, and even on the 2nd time, i was recognized, and was asked how my previous order was. 

Right wall is all freezers of homemade and Medium Rare approved meals. Some really neat finds too further down in the sausage section. I picked up the Turducken sausages (which were awesome!), and have the Maple Cajun in the freezer. Another trip, i picked up the lasagna, and a steak soup. I am actually considering cutting out a lot of my shopping at Sobeys, and shopping here with their pre-done meals. (I am a single guy who lives on his own, and works long hours and travel a fair bit, so i find I am in a race against time with groceries).
The meat cut i received was fantastic, and cut to order, and he even sliced into strips for me since i was making jerky. No attitude, and happy to help. Was offered an espresso while waiting. Great window into the meat curing room too, can see my next rib-roast!
They have some great looking fresh fish as well, will give a salmon filet a try next payday.

Very pleased though with Medium Rare! Give this place a go! 5 stars!
