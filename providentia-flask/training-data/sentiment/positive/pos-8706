This is a great tex mex place.. There food is always good and the service is great. Lots of tequilas to choose from and they have good Margarita specials as well. They are well know for the good tacos but this time I got the chicken chopped salad and it was great.. The portion was very large. I got a small and it was more then enough. We really like there white cheese queso..
