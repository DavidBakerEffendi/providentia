OMG, why did I need a Groupon to find about this place? I can't believe I hadn't tried this for so long!
Firstly, since this place is inside the 7th Street Market, parking is validated.

So there was this $10 for $20 Groupon deal for this place that came up on my phone. Because I hadn't heard of this place before I looked it up on Yelp and saw the reviews. Me and my boyfriend headed to this place the following weekend and ordered a large pizza, half Wild Mushroom, half Pure Country. Because everyone was raving about their sprouted grain crust we asked for that, unfortunately they don't do that for the large pizzas. Fortunately, their regular crust tastes delicious too! The Wild Mushroom is my #1 at this place. It is also my boyfriend's favorite, and did I mention, he DISLIKES mushrooms? Go figure!

The second time we went here we got so greedy, we ordered two large pizzas, thinking we would have them for lunch the following few days, and we did. The second time we did half Pepperoni Supreme, half T-Rex and a while Wild Mushroom! Oh Mother of God, that was like the best pizza weekend ever! Also, I really like how they give you honey and cinnamon sugar with the pizza to dip the crust in at the end. I enjoyed that part so much (especially since I throw away all the crust or give it to my boyfriend), that I started doing that with all pizzas I get from other stores. But no, sadly that doesn't taste so great with other pizza places. This place really has some magic ingredient in their crust, next time I'm seriously considering getting my pizza half wild mushroom, half plain crust!
