This has pretty much everything your kids love: an enormous indoor playplace with tunnels, large slides, an obstacle course, and a ball pit. Even bigger kids should enjoy this portion of the Luv 2 Play. There's also a few sections specifically designed for the very young children, with foam blocks, a smaller playplace and slide, and a Playdough station amongst other things. At least a few hours worth of entertainment.

The snackbar offers pizza delivered from NYPD pizza, which is pretty decent and comes at a fair price per slice. The place is also well-maintained/clean. I would say Luv 2 Play is at the top of the list for places to bring your children where they'll have a blast and burn a lot of energy.
