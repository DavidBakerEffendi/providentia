I love being a platinum member ! The service at the Scottsdale location is amazing tonight especially this girl named savvy helped me she wasn't even my host but she brought my balloons up when I moved floors and she even has hurt foot,... I was impressed she remembered and she also help me set up my Father's Day balloons and Anniversary. Hunter was very helpful as well just like Chris and jim... they treat you like family
