My girlfriend and I stopped here last weekend on the way home and it was great. They have a very small bar but it is cozy and also has an outdoor patio area. They can probably hold a total of 50-60 maximum indoor and outdoor which is nice because it keeps the crowd smaller. There is a massive amount of wines and beers here to choose from and their happy hour goes pretty late which is awesome. They are a new bar and deserve a five star. Great place!
