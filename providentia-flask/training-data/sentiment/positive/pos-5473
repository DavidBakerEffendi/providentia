I came here with a group of people, all of whom have different food preferences and restrictions. Everly easily accommodated our group and everyone (including a vegan, a person with gluten-sensitives, and one who avoids dairy) was able to directly order off of the standard menu and was 100% thrilled with brunch. 

I should mention also, that our group included someone who is the complete opposite of the other members and craves tons of meat and cheese, and he was also completely happy with the menu options and his meal. Basically, Everly was a perfect fit for the challenging task of feeding and satisfying a group with diverse food preferences. 

Growing up, my family and I frequented Bluephie's quite a bit. While I have fond memories of that restaurant, I really love what the new restaurant owners have done with the space and renovations. I am not at all nostalgic, I think this is a great new venue.

Everly being described as a California-style restaurant had me pretty skeptical, because that sounds like hipster nonsense, but the actual experience and environment put all doubts to rest. After brunch, we all agreed that we want to come back and try other menu items.

This is a great place to take your family, especially if you want to impress in-laws or feed variety appetites.
