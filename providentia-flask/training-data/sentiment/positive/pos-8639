Great new place on the east side. Excellent service. Food was fresh, hot and very good. My son loved the buffalo wings. I enjoyed the California wrap with sweet potato fries. My wife said the guacamole burger was delicious. 

Nice big place with lots of TVs will accommodate large groups for games. Decent sized bar with an average beer selection.
