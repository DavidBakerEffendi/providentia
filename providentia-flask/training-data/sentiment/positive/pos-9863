First impression walking in, very clean! Staff was extremely nice and very helpful. They changed the grill plates often and when needed, you did not have to ask because they were already on top of it. Staff explained menu items well and helped us out. Food was tasty and well marinated, and portions were large. Good food, clean restaurant and great staff!
