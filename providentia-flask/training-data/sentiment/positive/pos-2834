STARTER... TOMATO SOUP W/ A LOVELY CRUSTY CHEESE PANINI.
ENTREE... BUCATINI W/ KING CRAB.
SKIP THE MENU, UNTIL DESSERT TIME TODAY.  THESE ARE A MUST!

Not only because of the 'Food Network style' of food that you wanna watch being made... & ask the chef how did you put this together?  A hint of Meyer Lemon tang, with a creamy tomato sweetness complimenting the already amazing King Crab on a bucatini pasta, unbelievable!  

Celeste, the above & beyond bartender recommended this Bucatini dish.  I mean her & I... our tastebuds speak to each other.  She is like a sommelier to me & every dining experience can turn into an unexpected 4-course w/ a perfect wine pairing at the bar.  Both Javier the GM & her recommend the most fantastic dishes fyi.  

Celeste recommened this beautiful entree, a Bucatini dish that mom, dad & I tried.  They were already full from the previous dish which I'll get to, but wow this Bucatini was phenomenal.  The sauce filled the perfectly cooked bucatini pasta holes.  Zucchini 'zoodles' as I call it, w/ roasted tomato, a meyer lemon cream, I added alil red pepper flakes since I love spice, very fresh & the king crab is the cherry on top.  Wow.  An absolute MUST.

It's funny, I highly recommend Bottiglia to my friends & one of them recommended a dish to me this evening that was an excellent starter!  The tomato soup w/ a grilled cheese panini.  It's chilly outside & wow did the crusty & cheesy bread melt into the sweet sun-dried tomato soup!  Perfect for dad, who has a sensitive throat.  Not too rough when dipped into that delicious hot soup, it melted.  Perfection Chef!  Thank you, Javier & Celeste.  If I could award you 5 diamonds I would, especially a restaurant in our local casino Green Valley, you totally stand out way above many restaurants on the strip.
