Went for delivery 
Pros:
+ large portions
+ friendly service

Cons:
- not made for eating in.


Atmosphere: (3/5)
This is not a sit down place, it is only for take out.  There are bars stools and tables, but it is more for a single person eating rather than a group.  The place is clean and well lit.  The sides you can order with the meal and the toppings are displayed in front you. The view of the kitchen is open, so you can see what they are doing there  

Service: (4.5/5)
We interacted only with the server (who took us to another cashier since there was a line), and the person who filled in our pittas.  Both were friendly and helpful.  The person who was filling in the pitas suggested a different order.  We waited for around 10 minutes for the food to be made.

Food: (5/5 stars)
We ordered two shawarma and one felafel.  For every one they gave us a choice of which toppings we wanted.  On everything we put on tahini sauce, humus, babaganush, eggplant salad, lettuce and tomatoes. It cost $21 with tax. 
The portions were large and tasty.  Would recommend it when you want to eat a large portion for decent prices. 


I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a large tasty meal to eat at home.  I would not recommend to eat in the restaurant.
