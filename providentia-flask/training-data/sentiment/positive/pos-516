Amazingness on a plate, thats all I can say. Fresh pancakes topped with fresh strawberries and sliced bananas plus whipped cream, add some blueberry syrup on top. Do I need to say more? 

This place is so close to our new home and I'm so happy about it. Staff was super friendly, coffee was good, the place is clean, food was delicious. I will be back.
