Be sure to call ahead for a reservation. We went with four people, ordered an appetizer, a small pie, and a large pie. It was basically the correct amount of food, and we wound up taking two slices of the small pizza home. The atmosphere was not great since we spent the whole meal shouting at each other to be heard. The waiting area was too cramped and smiley from the smiley pizza oven. Plus it's a small and cramped eating area. Service was very nice but slow. It was at least five minutes before they brought water to our table and took our order, and food came out slowly.

The food was excellent. The burrata appetizer was not great. The vegetables for topping the bread were incredibly fresh, but the ingredients didn't seem to come together well. I think it might have been better if the mozzarella was more flavorful or at least more salty. We ordered the large Carbonara pie without bacon. The crust was delicious and the cheese was outstanding. We all agreed it was a bit too peppery. The daily special pizza was excellent. One of our party was really disappointed, though, that neither pizza had tomato sauce, so beware when you order.
