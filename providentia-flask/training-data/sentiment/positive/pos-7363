Why can't I give Carolina's SIX stars? I L-O-V-E this place and, if I could come to terms with being 500+ lbs and seriously reducing my life span, I would eat here twice a day. The Number 3 is where I go every time....taco, enchilada, AND tostada.....plus one of their amazing parachute-sized tortillas to compliment the meal. Their salsa is addicting, as well, and I go through a minimum of 6 small cups per meal. 

Another thing I love about Carolina's is that they haven't sold their soul to the soft drink corporate incentive gods....i.e. they have BOTH Coke and Pepsi products (as well as some exciting punches!).....way to give your patrons what they want! 

Lastly, if you ever want to cheer yourself up or just throw an impromptu party at your cubicle, go to their main website ( www.carolinasmex.com ) and let the sweet music brighten your day. I dare you not to smile!
