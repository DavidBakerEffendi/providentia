The past several times that we've come here have been fantastic, so I decided it was time to update the review.  Peppermint is now my favorite Thai place in the Cleveland area.  We go there almost weekly.  The service is always great, as is the food.  The food quality and taste have seemed to improve over the past couple of months.  The green curry and crazy noodles are my favorites, but everything that I have had here is on point.  If you like spicy food like me, they will make your items very spicy if you ask.
