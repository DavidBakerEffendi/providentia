Enjoyed a Sunday brunch here with my fianc√© last weekend. I ordered their breakfast sandwich which came with tiny baked potatoes and he had the eggs Benedict. Not only was the food delicious but they had $12 bottomless mimosas and live music that was very impressive! We were really able to relax and enjoy our Sunday afternoon. The waitresses were super friendly and service was all around great. We can't wait to go back. 

The place is also very intimate at night and a fun place for dates or getting together with friends. I highly recommend trying the smokey bear cocktail if you enjoy unique flavors and something less on the sweet side.
