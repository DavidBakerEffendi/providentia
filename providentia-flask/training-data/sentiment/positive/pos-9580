Amazing food! Showed up this weekend without reservations and was told it'd be a 2 hour wait. Luckily we were able to find a bar side table which is full service. We had miso soup shared the Lima roll, Jalapeño roll & the Ahi Jalapeño Ceviche. The miso soup and rolls were great but felt the ceviche wasn't as good as we expected.  I also had a specialty drink recommended by our waiter which was very good and refreshing. Don't remember the name but it had grapefruit juice, gin and mint if I'm not mistaken. To end our meal, we shared the samba split which is a banana split that has caramelized bananas, candied popcorn, little pieces of flan, whipped cream and of course ice cream. 

Highly recommend this restaurant. The atmosphere is very upbeat and lively.
