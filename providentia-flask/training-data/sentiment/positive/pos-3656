We went here last night for a late dinner and some beers and had AMAZING service!

I knew I wanted to try the lavosh, but was a bit bummed when I saw that the only vegetarian one was covered in olives (bleh).  The "LB Special" sounded tasty, with a bit of a Mexican theme but had bacon on it.  We asked the waitress to substitute the bacon for anything the chef wanted - as long as it wasn't olives (or meat). 

The chef personally came out to talk to us about what wanted on the lavosh instead!  Beans? Yes.  Chilies? Yes.  Onions?  Yes.  Pico?  Yes!!  It was awesome! Instead of getting bacon, we got four delish veg-friendly toppings for the same price.  

They were overly accommodating with our vegetarian diet and I really appreciated that the chef came out to talk to us about what he could do with the lavosh.  

Oh and it was delicious, by the way!
