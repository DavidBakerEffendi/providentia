Love this place!

I was craving gelato while walking around on the strip so I yelped this place and was sold on the 5 star rating! 

GELATO:
AMAZINGGG. So fresh and light and creamy and flavorful!! Desyree, the owner, was super duper nice and gave us so many samples right when we walked in and also any flavor that we wanted to try. 

- Fior de Latte - only the best gelato places have this flavor!! It's the base of all gelato flavors and this was soo good and creamy and refreshing!
- Spumoni - Now, I'm usually not a fan of spumoni because the cherry always tasted super artificial - but this was soooo good! Super pistachio-y and the cherry tasted real!
- Mango - super fresh and mango-y!

I also sampled the blueberry, coconut (I thought this was good and I don't even like coconut!), creme brulee and a bunch of other flavors I can't remember.

SERVICE:
AWESOME! Desyree is so so nice and friendly! She explained the gelato flavors to us and was super nice about giving us samples and helping us decided which 3 flavors to narrow it down to. She also seemed to have some regular customers/family/friends who came in to visit her!

LOCATION & PARKING:
Oddly located in a sketchy plaza just past the main Strip. Parking is aplenty in the lot but be careful when you're walking around!

VENUE:
Colorful and homey decorations, cute tables and very pretty gelato display.

I would definitely come back here whenever I get a gelato craving and I'm in town!
