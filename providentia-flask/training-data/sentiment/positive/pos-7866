The all you can eat lunch buffet is to die for! Must try and some point in your life it is life changing. I eat the buffet every day.  I only go to Peter piper for lunch.  The cashier at the front knows me by name.  They remember to give me a ranch before I even ask! Also they have Coca Cola products, I like the cherry Coke
