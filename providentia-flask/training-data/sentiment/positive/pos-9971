My first time here was a few days ago. I went through the drive thru and got a grilled turkey sandwich. It was soooo yummy!

A few days later (today), I went back and ate in the restaurant will my friend, Dale. He got a double cheese burger with nothing on it and I got the grilled turkey sandwich (it was that good). They got the order correct the first time. Dale and I felt that the fries were way too salty and so they brought us a fresh batch (still a bit over salted but maybe that's their thing). For me, my sandwich only had about a teaspoon of cranberry sauce. I'm a HUGE cranberry fan so I requested more sauce. The manager brought it to me in person. She was friendly. She wasn't wearing a name tag though so she will remain anonymous. 

The restaurant is very large and clean (but not sterile feeling). The staff was especially pleasant and helpful.

I highly recommend PDQ!
