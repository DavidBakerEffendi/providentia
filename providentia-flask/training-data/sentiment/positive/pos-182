This place rocks.  We ordered 2 pizzas, a small salad, and 2 beers and devoured them like we were never going to eat again.

The customer service was friendly and efficient.  The pizzas were legit and tasted just like a Neapolitano pizza should taste.

The ambiance was nice and it was a gorgeous day so they had the doors to the patio open which was awesome.  

We really enjoyed this place and will go back next time we are in Vegas again.  Plus, it only took like 10 minutes from start to finish to get everything ordered, paid for, and food in front of us.  I guess that's what an 800-degree oven'll do!
