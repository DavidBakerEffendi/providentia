Decided at the last minute to check out Marigold Maison on Wednesday and I'm so glad we did! The restaurant is in a strip mall near Paradise Valley Mall. When you walk in, I instantly noticed a couple things, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the smells, AMAZING smells coming from the open kitchen.

We were seated right away. 

We started off with the garlic naan. It was good, I mean, really good, we ended up ordering another one. Best 3 bucks you can spend!

Wife got the Chicken Tikka Masala served with Basmati rice. It was rich and the chicken was tender, I loved it, yes, I ate some of her food. Don't worry, I shared mine with her.

I got the lamb chops. They were perfectly cooked. Tender, melt in your mouth deliciousness. It came with a mango salad, full of raisins, assorted nuts, it was awesome. 

So stoked that we took a little drive to this restaurant. Service was on point, super clean restaurant, appreciated seeing the manager walk the restaurant and check out the tables to make sure everyone was o.k. Super awesome service.

WE WILL BE BACK!

Oh, they have Happy Hour (food) but you have to sit at the bar or patio for it. They do offer Happy Hour (just alcohol) if you're in the dining room.
