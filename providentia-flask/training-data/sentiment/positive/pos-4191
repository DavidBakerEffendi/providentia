I'll gladly sing the praises everyone is heaping on Island Style.  This is exactly the kind of restaurant I love no matter the cuisine, and Russell serves all sorts of Hawaiian/Korean so very good, scratch that, not good, great.  My only complaint is they are so far from my house.  
  Every meal comes with boiled peanuts, and I've been served kimchi, and bean sprouts with my meals.  Your glass is never empty and if you are drinking water quickly you'll get a pitcher.  I've had the tea on each visit too and will get it again.  
  I've enjoyed their combo platter and very hot (both in spice and temperature) seafood & tofu soup.  Experience the food for yourself, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
  Island Style may be a small family run "hole in the wall" (a term I use with much respect and endearment) restaurant in a strip mall however has a rare combination of excellent food, warm attentive staff and more than reasonable prices compared to the servings you receive.  So long as I'm live in Las Vegas I'll be a customer of Island Style.
