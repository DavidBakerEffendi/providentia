This is my new favorite Italian restaurant.  The food is amazing.  I have tried all the small dish happy hour appetizers- and they are are worth a taste.  The chicken parm is devine!!! The lasagna was amazing as well.  The atmosphere inside and out are perfect for a special occasion, date night and even a quick appetizer and wine happy hour.
