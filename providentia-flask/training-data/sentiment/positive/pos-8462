This place is awesome, this is my second time here, and it rocked it again! I ordered the roti and again it was the best I have ever had, also had the chicken raviolli and it was fresh and tasty. Now Lisa made something off the menu for us, called pad cha, it was so bold in flavor, with spice and fresh vegitables and chicken making a beautiful melody together. I also had the crying tiger, at Misti's suggestion, and it was HUGE in flavor and light. Big flavors meshing together, fresh ingredients, excellent service, clean, and innovative. The best!
