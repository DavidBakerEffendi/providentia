I've eaten at quite a few Indian restaurants around the valley and this is right up there at the top of my favorites list. The Chicken Tiki Marsala with garlic naan bread was so delicious. If you are not a fan of spice this is a good choice as it has a very mild spice. The Prawns were also delicious. Will have to stop by again and try out some more dishes!
