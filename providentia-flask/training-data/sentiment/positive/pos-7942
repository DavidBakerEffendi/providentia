They start off with free boiled peanuts. One can never pass up free items, especially delicious ones. I ordered the Stone Clay Pot Bim Bim Map, and it was damn good. The Owners treated us like family and it was our first time there. The only downside was that it was a little wait to check out, however, I can understand considering it was a full house.
