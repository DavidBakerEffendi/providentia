Don't judge a book by its cover, as they say. From the outside this block looks a little forgotten. And walking up we were met with what I'll describe as a not-so-user-friendly door guy who scanned our faces for, I dunno, I can't even pretend to have any kind of reasoning behind the lack of privacy in modern life anymore. Maybe he stole my soul with his face scan, but nonetheless they scanned me and I went in.

From there things went on the up and up. You lose the lack of curb appeal and enter to find a big, open bar and seating area. The friendly fella slinging drinks poured me a mean Sprite and we headed outside. Indoors there was plenty of seating, but outside is where the party is at.

The place has a chunk of real estate and they're working it. The back is a grownup kid-at-heart's dream: four square, tetherball, massive cornhole, a stage for music, and probably a bunch of other things I'm forgetting. We jumped into the cornhole foray, and then played some four square with a bunch of tipsy kids. And by kids, I mean legal drinking age, but blowing off steam after work. They were fun, but had no clue how to play and as a champ of the 5th grade courts, I can tell you it should be all underhand, all day, two hand touch.

I reigned supreme at tetherball and felt it in my shoulder the next day, but I wrought destruction on my foes. I looked like an idiot, but when your pals are talking smack you wrap the top of the pole and walk away like a boss. Thanks, 6th grade.

Super fun spot to hang out. No idea how it plays out when it gets packed. Our weeknight visit was not super bumping, but I preferred it that way. More discovery, less jostle. Get past the street and the scan and play on.
