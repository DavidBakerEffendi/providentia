I always make sure to go see the Fountains every time I'm in Vegas! They have a wide range of music that the waters always seem to match perfectly with (I was really surprised to hear TiÃ«sto lol). It can be crowded at times but each showing is pretty fast in between, I forgot the exact time (10-20 minutes?). 

I love it when the water have their big finish at the end. You can hear them from the other hotels across the street. Don't miss out!
