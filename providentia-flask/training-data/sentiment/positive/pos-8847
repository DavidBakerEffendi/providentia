With so many pizza places in the Strongsville area, it's finally great to see something that stands out from the rest of the other places. 

It's located in the shopping where the Costco is, close to I-71. 

You can purchase a 10in or 14in pizza, if you're on a hot date and extremely hungry, grab the 14in, it's only $16.95 and load it up with unlimited toppings, mix it up any way you want, or you can get one a pizza of the menu. Either way, they are all good. 

Customer service is fantastic here, each time we have came to eat at this establishment, owner was there and made small talk with us. 

We were here a few days back and after we received our pizza, owner walked by to see how we were doing how the food was, realized that we had way to much sauce on our pizza and was adamant about remaking it so we can fully enjoy the experience here, which we did remake for us. We will be back for the great food and customer service.
