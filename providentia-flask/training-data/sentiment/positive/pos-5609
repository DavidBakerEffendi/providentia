Seriously the BEST food we've had in a LONG time & COLDEST beers - 1* from slushy! Wow! 2nd time here & ahhhmazing! Ignore the few bad reviews, those snobs have no idea what good good is...this place is the real deal! We're sharing Wings & loaded duck fat fries again - both are to die for! !  Today we're having those & Hubby is having the ahi tuna burger & grilled turkey panini for me! YUM! Perfect for my "last meal" before back in my diet! Ha! Excellent service & no issues whatsoever! Big screen TV's in the bar & great music playing! We love this place & will be back every week!
