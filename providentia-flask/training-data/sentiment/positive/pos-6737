This is a great place to get a delicious meal. It's not only the food that makes it great, but the atmosphere and service as well. I'd recommend making reservations. 

Atmosphere is one that a lot of restaurants don't have. It's almost a mix of fine dining with a club type environment. The food is impeccable, but you can't go there expecting the same atmosphere you would get at other steakhouses such as Lawry's. Instead, it's almost like walking into a club. Music blaring and people having fun.

Service was also spot on. They were very attentive to our needs, without being over bearing. Some restaurants tend to over do their service, bothering you every five minutes or so. At N9NE, I never had to ask for anything, they just seemed to magically know I would need it - without having to check on us every five minutes.

They have a very extensive wine list, and our server was very knowledgeable and helpful in picking out wines that we would like. I'd recommend getting the bone in rib eye. I don't think I've ever had a steak that great. I don't even know how to explain it - except that it was effin delicious. 

So, next time you have money to spare and you want a great steak - definitely go to N9NE.
