I came back after first time being there after getting take out after my birthday. It was in Friday night, I came to eat in and get a pizza, in the bar area. Also attending Karaoke. Met Chelsi, very nice woman. I also had a man named Riley take care of me, did a great job. Another manager I met at Native named Brian on duty there. Asking me if everything was alright. Told him everything was fine. The first time in a while found a place appreciates my business. Also customer service above and beyond. Great vibe there, everyone was nice. Will be back again. 
Great job Native Grill and Wings Dobson and Guadalupe in Mesa.
