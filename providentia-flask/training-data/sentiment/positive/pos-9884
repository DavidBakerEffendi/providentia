I decided to visit Juan's on the advice of a family friend. She was raving about the red menudo, so I came here with my parents.

I ordered a plate of tacos de lengua. My dad got a shredded beef chimichanga and a shredded beef taco, and my mom had a carne asada burrito (w/o guacamole) and a small bowl of red menudo. Everybody enjoyed everything.

My tacos came to the table wrapped in foil, and when I opened it... WHOOSH! They were filled with steaming hot meat, onions and cilantro.  The steam just wafts out straight to your nose. Beef tongue is amazing when it's done right, and Juan's does it just right.  That lengua was so tender: it's like butter when it hits your teeth. I put a little salsa and jalape√±os for some spice. So good!  Beans and rice were good, you can't mess that up.

The menudo though... that menudo? My mom was murdering it, so my dad ordered a large bowl and shared it.  That broth was so flavorful and had plenty of hominy and tender chunks of tripe.  Why have I never been here before?

Pretty good service too.  I'd love to come back and try the infamous chile relleno or the green corn tamales!
