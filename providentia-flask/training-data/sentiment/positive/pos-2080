started with the BLT salad and a dozen oysters. Salad was good, but the oysters were incredible. Our server, David, steered us right on those. By the way, he also was incredible. My wife had a double order of clams for dinner, while I had Ciapino Di Friavlo ( bad spelling). Everything was outstanding.
This is fine dining, on the Vegas STRIP, so expect it to be pricey, but worth it.
