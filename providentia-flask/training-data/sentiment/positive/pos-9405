If you're reading this to find out if the hype is real. Let me tell you it's real. This place is real deal gelato. I would recommend coming in to grab this as a snack so you can savor the flavors and appreciate them on your palette. If you come in full you won't have the same experience. 


That being said I was in the area one day and I knew I had to finally experience Art of flavors for myself. The owner herself greeted me and told me that she makes everything herself and let me try the base which is used for all the gelato flavors. She also proceeded to let me sample any and all the flavors in the case! Or as many as I wanted to try. She has sweet and savory which sets her gelato apart from others IMO. Me myself personally I have a hard time choosing. In general wherever I go in fears of regretting what I will order.  I went with pistachio because I was having a pistachio craving, which I later regretted. Not because it wasn't good but because she has unique flavors you won't find anywhere else. If I remember correctly flavor of the day was pesto pizza that day. Interesting but very good. I wish I would have got it. 

Anyways art of flavors is great if you love sweet or savory because you will find something to fit your palette. With flavors constantly changing there is always something interesting and different to try and taste. Not to mention the gelato quality is amazing. This place is as good as it gets. Just do yourself a favor and be open minded!
