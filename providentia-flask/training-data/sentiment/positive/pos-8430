Amazing Thai Food. The food here is as consistent and as delicious as it gets. I have been here probably over a 100 times and have never been disappointed. It is a fine dine restaurant and it is vegan. I have brought friends here who are hardcore non-vegetarians and they have had a hard time believing what they ate was not meat.

I have tried probably everything on their menu like especially like cripsy seaweed, crispy duck with spinach, Panang beef curry, Pad kee mow, crispy rice.

If you're a foodie (like me) this is one place you can't afford to miss. You can thank me later and I do accept cheques (or you can just like my post if you agree afterwards) :)
