The reason my family and I keep coming here is they make you feel like family.  The atmosphere is quaint and authentic, warm and friendly.  The food is very tasty, fresh ingredients and well-spiced. We just began to dig into the freshly homemade chips and delicious salsa and our diet cherry cokes (they made these for us!) And our meals came out piping hot.  My Mom had the delicious enciladas suizas and I my favorite no. 1 combo with a chicken tostada and chicken enchilada. I love the shredded chicken, very generous portion and tender.  You can't go wrong here!
