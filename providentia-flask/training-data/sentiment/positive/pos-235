Food: (4.5 stars)
For appetizers:
asian nachos (kind of spicey, but really delicious)  comes in 5 (4 stars)
calamri (5 stars)

For main meals, we all got steaks.
I got Rib Eye with fully loaded potatoes on the side. (4.5 stars).  It was really good but nothing really amazing)

The whole bill came out to 360.

Service: (4.5 stars)
The waiter was very polite, gave us suggestions on what are the favorites, came to check up on us a few times, but was not annoying.  
He was a bit slow on refilling water so (.5 star) off.


Overall very similar to the KEG.  

Would go there again.
