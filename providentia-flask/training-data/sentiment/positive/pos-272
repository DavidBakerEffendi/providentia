Due to currently at the time of writing this very unconstitutional rule against a certain religion being active, I have to say I am so grateful for this wonderful gem of another culture, correction: of ONE of many interesting and enriching cultures this world luckily still has to offer for us to enjoy and learn from, besides the fact that the food in there is simply awesome, in particular the cucumber smoothie and the shawarma are excellent. 
The place went through ups and downs over time so it depends on the moment if you get excellent service and polite counter staff or if you get un-engaged kids playing with their smart phones. 
Besides that please note the fantastic wooden furniture and also the pottery, which is all the amazing work handmade by the occasionally a bit eccentric owner, I wish he would go into production with the stuff, I would want such cabinets at home. Oh wait, I tend to rent, well one day I will settle, then hopefully we can do it. 
Hopefully this place will never be bullied out of town or out of the country, we need it now more than ever.
