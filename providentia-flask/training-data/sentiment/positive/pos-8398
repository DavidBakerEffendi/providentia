I gave 5 stars just for SERDAR's service. Food was good, usual Red Lobster quality but the service put our experience over the top. The restaurant was busy you could tell that the staff was stretched thin. Serdar took the time to make sure my friends and I had everything we needed. He was very attentive and friendly. Thanks man!
