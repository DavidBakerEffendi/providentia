It was a mediocre Monday until we pulled into Janeys Coffee. We were looking for lunch and coffee. So delighted we happened upon this place! I knew I liked it as soon as we walked through the doors. The European craft espresso machine, alongside the bar, was a sight for tired eyes. 

We ordered lunch (fresh, yummy, enough for a take-away box), espresso with coconut milk (thank you for having coconut milk!), iced green tea (my 80-year-old mother was impressed which doesn't happen very often), and a fruit bowl (so many blackberries! yippee! - restaurants usually skimp on the berries). We had a lovely and leisurely lunch. 

I want to go back. I noticed the wine selection, so I am going to put this place on my "Return ASAP" list. The coffee was perfect; another reason to go back. Live music in the evening? My perfect trifecta!
