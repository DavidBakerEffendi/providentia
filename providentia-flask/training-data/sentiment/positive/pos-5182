Truly EGGceptional!  If you want your cake and eat it too (aka large portions without compromising one smidge of quality and deliciousness) (Ummm, of course you do!), then mosey on down to Eggstacy.  Many wonderful breakfast standards including just as many proprietary creations.  Speaking of which, just reading the menu alone becomes an exciting experience simply to learn of seemingly endless, delectable ideas your remaining brain cells have not ever contemplated.  

Oh, and for those of you who focus calorie consumption... what you too have here is yet another form of having your cake and eat it to.  Quite a large healthy conscious selection that is surprisingly sizable, delicious and also... creative!  

Move over Matt's Big Breakfast.  Your days are over easy.
