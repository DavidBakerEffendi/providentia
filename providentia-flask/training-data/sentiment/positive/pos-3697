I had my first experience with Moe's today after always hearing "Welcome to Mooooeee's", while listening to Pandora. Not knowing what Moe's was or where it was, I happened to run into it by chance after doing some shopping. To my surprise I was pleasantly pleased with this restaurant. The restaurant is super clean and spacious. They play good music. The food is delicious, fresh, and the portions are large (the small is large and the large is ginormous). They have a steady flow of customers. The service is fast and the staff is friendly. Look out Chipotle, Moe's has you beat!
