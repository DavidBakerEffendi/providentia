I've been here back to back the last two days. And brought more of my coworkers each time.

1. Chicken is hot. Juicy and yummy. 
2. The chicken is not over breaded. 
3. The dry rub is amazing.
4. If you like crispy but not soggy or over burnt fries. ALSO THEY AREN'T OVERLY GREASY. You need to come here.
5. The price is well worth the amount of food you get.
6. Last but not least. There is a server named Sam. Nicest and most attentive server I have ever encountered in the many times I have ever ate at downtown summerlin. And he not only cleans the tables. He also keeps an eye out on ALL the customers and makes sure their dining experience is top notch. I pay a lot of attention to servers and it's a big part of whether or not I go back to a place. Everything from helping you refill your drinks. To grabbing more to-go containers and asking at the most appropriate times before I need anything. The most impressive part was how he handled the situation as he was the only server and there were many tables filled. I went to tell my coworkers he was the poster child of what the service industry should be!

Went above and beyond my expectations of a server at this restaurant. Service was 10 STARS!

I went to speak to his manager today 07/01/15 - and told him. Manager was also a very kind man - you can see his eyes light up when I told him about Sam.

Sam is outstanding - I even asked for his photo to let the world see how great service is highly appreciated.

I will be sure to come here again soon!!
