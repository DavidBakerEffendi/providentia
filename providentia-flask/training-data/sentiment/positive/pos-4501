We've been back twice since our initial visit, and it's still good! 

During the week, we had beignets (piping hot, good flavor, and definitely cooked in clean oil - always a plus!), a cinnamon roll (had a hint of nutmeg or something that I wasn't really a fan of), a quiche lorraine (so good! pastry was excellent), and a ham and cheese croissant (also very good). 

Today (Saturday) we just HAD to get more of the praline bacon that we had last week... mmmmm, meat candy! We also got a duck sandwich on a batard roll (a bit pricey at $13.95, but excellent - heavy on the duck, with flavored goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and a port reduction), and a quiche lorraine and an almond croissant to save for tomorrow's breakfast, since they aren't open on Sundays. 

We're about to move across the country, and I'm really sad to be leaving this awesome eatery behind!
