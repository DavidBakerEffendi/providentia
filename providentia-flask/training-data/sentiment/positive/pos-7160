The owner here was so nice to my friend and I when we ate here. He offered both the Hawaiian and Korean styles of kimchee and iced tea. I ordered Bi Bim Bap and my friend ordered the combo plate. We were both happy with our food and the portions were perfect. 

For anyone hungry for Hawaiian or Korean, come here and you won't be disappointed. Great service and good food.
