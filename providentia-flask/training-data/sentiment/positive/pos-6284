Pork Belly appetizer was to die for!  A little more pork belly a little less garnish :)  Mixed Greens could use a little love - there is a sprinkling of oil & it is literally leaves on a plate.  Shitake & Gruyere burger so rich & it was as if you could taste the difference in it being local.  This will become one of my new standards.
