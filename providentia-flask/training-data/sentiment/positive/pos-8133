it's an awesome idea that combines both coziness of home and a coffee shop.

they also done a good marketing campaign ( a friend from holland wrote me about this place and encouraged to go!) 

it's always packed which is annoying but totally understandable. people like unique places=)

the owner and the staff are super friendly. chai latte is super yummy and the assortment of boardgames us super huge!

I also love the way they care about the customers. someone forgot a camera there and they posted it on their fb page.

A+
