Went last night for ladies night, and very pleasantly surprised. First of all, you can't beat 50 cent drinks and no cover. It's not as scary inside as it looks outside. The staff- so awesome, and friendly! Good music, but then again I'm a GINORMOUS country fan, so I'm a little biased. They also make it fun with contests and giveaways. I really can't find anything sucky about this club. There was a good amount of hotties there too! 
Oh, and did I mention-50 cent drinks! 
5 stars for you Whiskey River, you got yourself a new regular!
