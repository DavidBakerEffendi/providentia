If you're ever in the area and looking for a guilt free dessert ice cream option, this is the place. 

Soft serve or popsicle option. It's banana based and obviously no dairy. The Popsicles are vacuum sealed to preserve freshness. 

Oh and the employees and owner? SUPER DOOPER friendly and informative. 
Most def a try place. Even if it's just once.
