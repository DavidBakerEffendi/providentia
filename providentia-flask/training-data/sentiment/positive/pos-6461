So happy this place opened next to me! Their donuts and friend chicken sandwiches are great. Donuts are $1-2 and chicken sandwhiches are $4.75 with the option to add a variety of paid and free toppings. There is usually a long line but service is fast. I love their maple bacon doughnut and their classic donut. Their creme brulee donut is actually a little too sweet for me. Their fried chicken is crispy and their biscuits are light and fluffy. There is a lot of parking but sometimes the lot fills up because of the sheer amount of people going to Rise! Be warned that it opens very early in the day and closes at 3pm on weekdays and 2pm on weekends so it's not for late risers!
