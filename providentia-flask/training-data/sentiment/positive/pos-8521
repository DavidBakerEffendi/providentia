I just love this place. First off it has a great upbeat atmosphere dj will get up there and start spinning and you feel like you are in the scene for the night.  Then the food is just savory goodness. Whoever actually came up with the concept to mix Brazilian Peruvian and Japanese cuisine and out together a menu like this deserves a reward for the betterment of mankind. As you can tell I'm a little high in this place. Also have to admit a wonderful cocktail menu. There ceviche is just heavenly.
