We've been wanting to stop by for a while. Finally made it. Ordered the smoked carnitas nachos with 2 old fashions to start.  They were great. Then I had the most perfect medium prime rib ever. Hubby had the short rib stew. He loved it. Paired with a delicious Pinot noir. Wonderful dinner. The place is literally next to everything downtown. We're staying next door at the Palomar hotel and walking distance to cityscape. Will be back soon.
