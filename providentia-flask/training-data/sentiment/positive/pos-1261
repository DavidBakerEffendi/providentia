This. Place.

Seriously. Mom's Teriyaki is the BEST. 

After searching Yelp for a good noodle/bento/sushi-type place, we saw some good reviews, trekked over, and have been HOOKED ever since.

The food is delicious. In the several times we have gone, we have tried noodle dishes, rice dishes, sushi, salads, etc. Each has been fantastic. When you look at their menu and smell the food cooking, you will want to order a bunch of stuff, there's no way your tummy will hold it all. The portions are big!

A nice plus is the fruit juices they sell have no HFCS. They also sell regular soda (Coke products) so you're set if that's your thing.

If you're on a tight budget, try to make it here on Saturdays. They have great specials from 10 until 3 *and* they throw in your choice of extra freebies (some free cans of soda, pot stickers, and other choices) if your order is over $20. 

This place is super clean. If you've read our other reviews, you know that's crucial for us for a dining establishment and we have been described as picky. 

In addition to being clean and well ventilated, the dining area has very tasteful and pretty decor. 

The same employee has helped us each time we have been here and she has been really cool and welcoming. 

The parking at Mom's Teriyaki is good because it shares a large lot with other businesses.

Sooo, typing this review made us crave Mom's Teriyaki AGAIN. It's been an entire week since we've been and will be on our way back as soon as I close the laptop. 

Enjoy!
