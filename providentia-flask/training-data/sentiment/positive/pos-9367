Been going here for trivias lately and hope to into the future.

Food is GREAT and CHEAP! Tap brewed beer is $2 DURING trivia. I did not mistype that - 2 freaking dollars. It had the first pumpkin ale I've EVER liked(didn't expect that) and great IPAs. Great place for trivia and $2 beer! The pretzel appetizer+tap beer on a budget price but amazing taste ! Will be going here a lot for trivia!
