This is a hidden gem.  Right behind the Flamingo.  An old Italian amazing trip through time that you won't find anywhere else.  Make a reservation or be prepared to wait.  Try their homemade Sangria!  All the free table wine with dinner you can drink.  The salad is amazing.  Their linguini with clams is one of my favorites.  I don't know how they make the cappuccino but I always want more.  And best of all it all comes with your meal!! 

When in Vegas or if your local and have never been you shouldn't miss it or your missing out.  Be prepared to take home leftovers!   They are awesome the next day!
