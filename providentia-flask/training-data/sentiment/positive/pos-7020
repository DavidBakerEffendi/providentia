Went on a Friday night for some Happy Hour! What a great place for some good quality sushi and drinks. Great Happy Hour pricing for a friday night till 7pm, better get there early because it does fill up pretty quick. 
Down side, I live in Mesa and this place is a good 30 minute drive for me at that time but with that said, I would come back even with the drive for their food. Staff was awesome and service was great. Even with a mix up with the check, they made it right with no issues. Staff was friendly and personable and the manager was out and about helping as needed. Love seeing manages along side their staff helping and making it a great experience. 
Food was really good. Had the vegas roll, spicy crab, phoenix, and buffalo I believe. All were perfect. Some where same as they should be but the item that stole the night was the Kobi Burger! 
Great flavors and cooked just perfect. It was passed around the table it was so good. Perfect 10 on the taste and quality! Seasonings were on point and just couldn't get much better.
Drinks were good, typical beer and saki selections. The table had a few of the martinis and they were pretty good. Not a big martini fan so dont remember the names but the table passed them around and sure did like them. 

All in all! a must go when you are in the North Scottsdale area. Great Happy Hour, Great outdoor seating, appears to be a dog friendly place. 

Out side of Happy Hour, might get a little pricey- just an FYI
