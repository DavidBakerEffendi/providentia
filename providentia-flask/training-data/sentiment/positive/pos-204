***Gasp*** OMGoodness! I've died and gone to taco heaven! Let me just say that this was absolutely the first time ever in my life eating food out of a food truck, and clearly I've been missing out! My mom thought I was crazy when I gave her directions to Waldo's Tacos, and then told her "turn into this parking lot, quick!" When she asked me where Waldo's Tacos was, I pointed out the truck when the "open" sign flashing in the window, and her exact words were "you've got to be kidding me"... well no, I wasn't. 

We went up to the truck, and although my Spanglish is pretty good, I didn't really know what to order. Lucky for my mom and I, there was someone there taking orders who spoke English (phew!) He saw the "deer-caught-in-headlights" look on my mom and my face so he walked us through the menu. I ended up ordering 2 shrimp tacos, 2 chicken tacos, 2 steak tacos (yes, that was just for me), and my mom ordered a chicken burrito. The food came out fairly quickly, and I barely made it to the car without opening the box... Ya, my tacos didn't make it very far before I devoured them. Since eating here, I've been ranting and raving and craving more... but it's sooo far away from me! :(

Waldo's Tacos... since you're mobile, can you drive to the northeast side of the valley, please?
