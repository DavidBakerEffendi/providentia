I rarely dole out 5 stars.  In fact, as I read through other reviews before writing this, I started to doubt myself.  Was it really 5 stars?  The reviews, as you can see, are definitely mixed.

I think Toronto has too many mediocre Italian restaurants.  It's a problem. When my friend suggested Piano Piano, I was like...mehhh.  But not having my own suggestion, I went along.

The room: gorgeous.  The service: we lucked out with an attentive, knowledgeable and pleasant server.  She absolutely understood how to toggle being present and being invisible.  A true art in servery.

First, the smoked burrata.  No smoke taste, but that didn't matter.  It was served with blueberry, peaches, mint and hot chilis on a bed of olive oil.  Fantastic.  So much flavour with all of these seasonal ingredients.  

Next up, garlic cheese bread.  This was intriguing.  How often do you see garlic cheese bread on a modern menu?  Not one to shy away from garlic cheese bread, we ordered it.  It was actually a small version of their pizza pie, but in garlic cheese bread form.  It was GLORIOUS.  Pro tip: skip the pizza and order this instead.  

Mains: my friend ordered the vodka pasta, which I initially wanted to order.  It was delicious but nothing tops my dish - the ravioli bolongese.  It's a silky cheese filling in perfectly al dente pasta, served on a bed on rich bolongese sauce.  Because the pasta wasn't under the sauce, it retained it's perfect texture.  I can't say enough about this dish and it's probably what made my rating a perfect 5 stars.  

Dessert?  There was no room for dessert.  

Definitely a solid meal.  A place I would take someone who I want to impress when I want to look like I'm not trying too hard to impress them.
