This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. Have been here for both breakfast and lunch. The servers are great and are always happy looking. To date I have tried the country Benni, homemade corned beef hash, the Mexican skillet, the enchilada omelette, chicken fried steak, Reuben, patty melt, bleu cheese bacon burger, and the open faced chili burger. The chili is excellent. The homemade corned beef hash was a bit disappointing. My go to favorite is the country Benni. Breakfast on the weekends is a bit of a wait.
