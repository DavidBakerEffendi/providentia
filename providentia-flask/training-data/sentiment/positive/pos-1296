For utter fast-food satisfaction, look no further. Seriously, the burger patties are plump, generously sized and well-prepared, regardless of what type you order- though the apple butter type is a personal favourite. While On The Bun suffers from a few drawbacks such as a rather deviated location, ordinary decor, mundane food presentation and an altogether boring appearance; it boasts an incredible array of craving-inducing food to wipe the superficialities from your mind as soon as you take a bite. 

I've tried all the variations of the burgers, and all are truly some of the best burgers I've had in the Greater Toronto area. The options are cleverly designed and quite independent from one another so there's something for different moods. Spicy, savoury, sweet, cheesy- it's all there. The sides are also just as good, I highly recommend the poutine. Even though there's no cheese curds on the poutine it's bloody undeniable. A poutine/burger combo can be very filling however, so don't hesitate to opt for the perfectly fried and salted fries. Really, I wouldn't give any of the menu items I've had here anything lower than a 7/10.

Prices are easily justifiable, on-par or lower than sit-down burger joints like Hero Burger, Lick's or South St. While On The Bun doesn't have the brand, fit and finish or fame like the others, they most certainly have the taste and that coveted non-commercial almost home cooked feel to the food. You can walk away with a combo for around $11 which will definitely conquer that fast-food desire.
