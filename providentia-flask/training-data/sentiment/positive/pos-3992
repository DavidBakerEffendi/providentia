I don't know the fact that it's open til 4 AM or if it's that tira misu that's so good that makes this restaurant a 5 star restaurant for me. I had a Louisiana Etouffe and it was absolutely delicious. My roommate told me to come here after it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Even though I never ate what Guy ate, I did eat part of it since my mom got what he which was the Tom Turkey. I never watched the show so I didn't know what to get, luckily the waiter was wonderful and pointed out what was good. (She pointed out the tira misu)

And the dessert (the raving tira misu) was absolutely delicious. The waiter told us that they make it every Friday and they sell out by Saturday night. SO GET ONE! (If you're there and they have some.) Inside, it seems completely different to what it is outside as I didn't expect it. Outside, it looks like an ordinary diner until you go in there which my mind was absolutely blown by the way the restaurant was set up. The inside seemed like t was a high class diner or somewhere where you can just relax.

Overall, I love this place and definitely will go back, as the raving reviews on Yelp says and my own experience. (Plus, they have so many things on the menu I don't think i'll have nothing to try.)
