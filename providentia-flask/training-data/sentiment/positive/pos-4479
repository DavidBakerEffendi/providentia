Me and the wife went here for dinner last night. This is one of many trips to Canteen 1511 and none have been disappointing. The wife had a house salad and I had the chicken fajitas, which were some of the best I have ever had. They, IMO have some of the best chips and salsa in Charlotte. I have never had a bad experience here and will continue to eat here often. Small tip, on the weekends make a reservation with OpenTable or you will be waiting awhile.
