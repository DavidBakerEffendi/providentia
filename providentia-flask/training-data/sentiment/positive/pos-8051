I love this place! Every time I walk in the store is extremely inviting. The place is kept very clean and organized. The help is definitely helpful. And they make a darn good product! The coffee is delicious. Very creamy vanilla lattes that are not too sweet.
I'm an Oregon resident and find myself here once a month for work. To my surprise when I first came in this time around the guy at the front counter remembered who I was! He was very personable and very polite. Gave me a firm handshake and thanked me for my business.
