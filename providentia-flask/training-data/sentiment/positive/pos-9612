Stayed here again for our anniversary. Still like this hotel. This time, we got the basic, luxury room, with a king-sized bed over looking the pools, Wynn,  a bit of the  mountains, and a hit if the  strips. I wish that there was a kettle or a fridge that we can use. I don't like that I'd be paying for something accidentally if I move a bottle in there. There weren't any long dirty sofas to sit on, so that's another plus. 

Pools were clean and enjoyable. All I care about. 

The resort was decorated for Christmas. There is that usual Christmas tree in  front of the building, facing S Las Vegas Blvd, before the gondola bridge. The color changes constantly, and it's beautiful. 

Bouchon bakery is right there, too. Yummy. 

Tips for public transportation: from the airport, use the DEUCE bus for stop at Treasure Island/Venetian, after Caesars/the Linq stop.
