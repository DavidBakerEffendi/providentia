Best Blue Corn Tamales by far!
I first visited Los Dos Molinos with a friend from work and was warned that even some of the mild items on the menu where Spicy.
This is definitely true! If you like spice, and I mean real spice with flavor Dos Molinos is for you. They do have some milder items but their Blue Corn Tamales are spicy and quite awesome.
Its not in the greatest part of town but its worth the drive. The atmosphere is authentic and straight out of south of the border.
Meals and ingredients are all fresh and its a family run operation.
I rarely give 5 stars for anything but it is warranted here.
Give it a shot and see if we agree.
