I've been here several times with my family and the food service just keep getting better. The service is just great and they really know how to cater kids and went out of their way to keep the finicky little ones happy. The wife and I had the chicken fajitas for two and it was delicious. Happy hour is a great time to go with drinks 1/2 off. We'll be back for sure.
