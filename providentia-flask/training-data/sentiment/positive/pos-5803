Very nice place. Went there around midnight with friends after a show at playhouse square in downdown. The cheesecake selections were amazing. Luved the atmosphere and the service. Special thanks to Tevin for making it very nice for all of us. Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place. 
Thx
