I have to say first that this was one of the most enjoyable dinners I have had. My guest and I sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen. What a great choice. Eric, the chef/owner was very personable and happy to chat and explain everything, cooking tips, wine pairings, anything. We spent nearly 3 hours there on a Thursday night. Michelle, Eric's fiance, was happy to offer up information and tips as well. We ordered stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto to start. They are popped in the wood oven just long enough to char the outside edges a little. To me, anything wrapped in prosciutto is a very good thing. But these come with a cheddar tarragon sauce that just sings. They give you more than enough cheddar sauce you will want to keep to dip bread, or in our case pizza crust in. We followed up with 2 pizzas, a classic Margherita and a salami and artichoke. Both were excellent. Very thin, crisp, almost cracker like at the edge, think Pizzeria Bianco. We also ordered a chocolate pastry dessert filled with raspberry and cheese. I'm not a huge dessert person so I am not the best judge. I thought it was very good though. We did get to sample numerous other dishes that were all amazing. Gnocchi was great, lots of Parmesan cheese goes into the sauce. I did not get to try the meatball dish but after seeing them and hearing how they are made I can not wait to come back to try them. We are planning to come back on a Wednesday to try all the tapas, and also happy hour.
