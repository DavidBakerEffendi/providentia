Deliciousness - 4/5
Happiness - 4/5

I am a native east coaster and most of my relatives live in New York and New Jersey, aka, the world's bagel capital. Needless to say, I have spent much of my life devouring great, fantastic, or stupendous bagels. Outside of New York and New Jersey, I have never had a better bagel than at New York Bagels 'N Bialys. 

I had high hopes once I saw them marketing bialys. If you have never had a bialy, I strongly urge you to do so. They are delicious and essentially, a more healthy version of a bagel (look it up - less sugar, no boiling, less flour). And boy did they not disappoint. the bagels are flavorful and covered in just the right amount of toppings (seeds/garlic/onion or whatever you like). The pumpernickel is my favorite on the bagel side. The bialys are top-notch as well - with an "everything" bialy being the best. 

The service also reminds me of New York - for better or worse (I take that to be for the better). Don't be shy when you enter - walk right up to the counter and you will be served ASAP.

The best non-bagel item is the hopple-popple. It is a mixture of eggs, chunks of beef salami, and onions and peppers. It is a hearty and utterly delicious breakfast. The deli sandwiches are fine, but I'd personally stick with the breakfast side of the menu where everything is virtually exceptional. Also, there is no better place to find a variety of smoked fish than here. 

My only complaint? The price. I feel like the price constantly goes up and a meal for two can easily get into $30-40, which is expensive for breakfast. I would go there more often if it wasn't such a hit to the bank account. Still, the quality is there, so I am willing to pay the higher price, especially for special occasions. Also, they are very good about offering deals through Yelp or other deal sites, so you can typically find something to mitigate the price. But the important thing is to just sit back and enjoy!
