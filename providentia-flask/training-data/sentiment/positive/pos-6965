This cafe is so homey. It's not the best place to show off on instagram but it gives such a homey vibe that I wanted to stay there all day. The barista was super knowledgable and helpful with what I should order. He was super talkative and it was nice to interact with such a friendly barista.They do change their blends all the time which is great if you love coffee as much as I do. There isn't that much seating so don't bring your whole study group here. They also sell Pilot beans in bags, thermoses and this really cool aero press coffee maker.
