I can see why Mr Mesquite has such high reviews. Located next to Harkins. We were looking for quick bite to eat before catching a movie and just stumbled in here. As soon as we walked it, we saw large amount of chicken being grilled over open flames. I knew I wanted some of it. We settled on a burrito and quesadillas. You choose the meat and add-ins to your order. 
I was very impressed with the quality of meat; both chicken and steak was very moist and flavorful. Did I mention the massive size of the entrees? We were really hungry so we managed to chow down every bite but 3 people can easily share 2 entrees. 
The only thing I didn't care for here was the guacamole that came with the quesadillas. It didn't really taste like avocados at all, very watered down. However, that didn't take away from the deliciousness of all the entrees. 
I cant wait to go back and try their tacos.
