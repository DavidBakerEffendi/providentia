Review is strictly for the restaurant rather than the supermarket.

Typically, most places that I've awarded 5 stars almost floor me. I can't say that Ghadir gave me that experience, but at the same time I can't pick out any flaws either. You'll find a lot of the usual suspects that you'd find in other Middle Eastern places. The pricing is fairly typical, being fair but not exactly a steal like Shawarma Empire.

Here's the key however: the food is always 100% FRESH and the high-quality meat has been cooked perfectly each time I've been here. I've never seen meat come out of a warming tray here. You might wait about 10 minutes for the food, but it's well worth it.

You're not necessarily going to get "flavour profiles" at Ghadir that you haven't had elsewhere, but what sets them apart is delivering perfectly and consistently on freshness which is not a given at most places. Naturally, it's most important that the meat is good quality and done right, but even the pita, veggies, and bread all tasted as though they'd just been prepared.
