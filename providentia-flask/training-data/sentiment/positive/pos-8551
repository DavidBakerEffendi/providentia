I pretty much eat dinner here every Wednesday night.  I would say I have been doing that since maybe August.  I have never had one issue here with the food.  It has always been fresh and yummy.  I have tried the various sandwiches at this place and been happy with them.  Last night was a ham and swiss sandwich, BBQ chips and chocolate cake.  The food was all good and yummy.  I even sampled some of the asiago bread and had them use that for my sandwich too.  What a great place and I am not sure why the rating is where it is at for this place.
