TBH, I have not had a bad meal yet at B32. We often frequent the Gilbert location on Higley and we are always welcomed with a pleasant smile. The food is awesome here and cooked to order. Tonight I had the grilled salmon and wow was it tasty. The wings are also a must. The steamed broccoli was on point and great taste. GreAt atmosphere and lots of T.Vs to watch your favorite sporting event. Be sure to get there early particularly on Friday's. If you are in the area stop in for a cold  or 2.
