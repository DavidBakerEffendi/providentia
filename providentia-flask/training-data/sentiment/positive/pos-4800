This is the new location of the Copoli that used to be on De Maisonneuve. We went for brunch a couple of weeks ago and let me tell you, we were completely blown away. Now I know I know, this is a burger joint, how could I be raving about their breakfast. Well that's exactly why we were so surprised. I ordered the daily special and for $12 I got coffee, a pot of fresh-brewed loose-leaf Persian cardamom tea, assorted toasted bread, feta, cream cheese, a collection of homemade jams, including quince, sour cherry, pistachio carrot, and local organic honey, butter, fresh cucumber and tomato, and fruit. My boyfriend, who had ordered the standard eggs, bacon, and toast breakfast was perfectly satisfied with his breakfast until they served mine, when he proceeded to sample my extravagant breakfast. In the background, they were playing beautiful traditional Persian music as the couple who owns the local business hummed along with the music and interacted joyously with their customers. Long story short, don't judge a book by its cover. Go for brunch and ask for the Persian breakfast platter. You won't be disappointed, I promise ;)
