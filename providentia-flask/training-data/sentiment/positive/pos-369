This place has such a cool atmosphere. They make you give a funny name when you order your food so they can call it over the intercom when your food is ready. I got the buta burger and it was awesome! I loved it, the sauce was really good and the patty was really good. The bun was perfectly crisp. I will definitely be coming back.
