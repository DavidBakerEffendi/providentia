In Las Vegas for the weekend and looking for food to eat. With its bright contrasting colours Tom Urban stood out from the bright lights of Sin City.

This restaurant was clean, quick and great service. They were playing great music and good sports channels. It's the perfect setting for a great time.

Our server Michael, may possibly be the best server of the year. He was patient and a great food advisor. He has recommended the eats and don't eats, which made of choosing from the elaborate menu so easy. It is very well appreciated when service attempts to give each and every individual the best experience at that establishment.

My choice of meal was the Korean BBQ burger. It a was mouthwatering, plentiful, delicious, and original. The burger was perfectly prepared with fresh toppings and a perfect height to width ratio. The meal comes with a side of garlic shoestring fries or sweet potato fries. This is a meal to grant a return visit. It's simply amazing.

My experience in this establishment is great and can only hope that more people can experience the same feeling I have. I'm saddened that it is not available in Toronto. However, first pits in Vegas in the future would be Toms Urban.
