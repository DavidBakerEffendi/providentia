The Venetian is awesome! It's a gorgeous hotel! The room was very large compared to the other hotels I've stayed at. We were 5 ladies in a bella suite and it was pretty sweet! 2 Queens and a pretty big sofa. A lot of mirrors, which is important with a group of 5 girls! WiFi is included in your resort fee. The elevators play Phantom of the Opera! The show Phantom is closing this year :-( I saw it a couple years ago and it was great. My only minor complaint is that I ordered extra pillows and a blanket twice and the first time they brought me 4 pillows, no blanket. The next time I ordered a comforter, I was corrected that they have feather blah blah's and I'm like sure. So they bring up some sort of blanket. Not a really big deal. We went to Lavo and Tao and had a great time at both. I would stay here again.
