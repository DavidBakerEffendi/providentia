My fav AYCE in the GTA! They have a cool ordering system. Each table gets a stack of mini printed menus that you tick off and submit. There is an amazing array of menu items from your basic sushi, tempura (of many kinds - yam, onion, shrimp, mushroom, etc) and teriyaki. I was surprised to see the very trendy scorched sushi available. There are many teppanyaki options as well and other grilled items like eggplant and shrimp, An individual item of note is a really interesting eel and banana maki roll. There's also many noodles and soups to order - one noteworthy one is the fish head soup. My favourite for dessert is the fried banana with chocolate sauce. This actually isn't found on the dessert sheet so look out for it under the fried section. Speaking of dessert, there are a lot of ice cream flavours (not just stuck with green tea) and a ton of other options like mango yogurt, ginger milk, mousse, etc. Come hungry and you'll be so very happy!
