Think back to the last time you ate a salad and examine how it made you feel. Great! Now, throw all of that away and try a salad from Cafe 56.

What does it take to make a good salad? How about a great salad? Salads are odd. I can go to the store and buy the exact same ingredients that restaurants use to make their salads but mine never seem to turn out tasting the same. Its the difference between craving something, like CHOCOLATE, and just eating it because its healthy or you are on a diet. I really truly enjoy all of the wonderful flavor that Cafe 56 is able to pack into that bowl.

Cafe 56 is great. For me its in an extremely convenient location; right near where I work. Yeah, sure, sometimes the wait is a bit long for a quick grab-n-go but they do make each and every salad right there in front of you. If you're picky about waiting, try ordering online. This location lets you pre-order and just pay and go!

So far I have tried many different menu items. According to my yelp check-ins I have been here something like 25 times.

Salads:
-Millionaire (with chicken please!)
-Napa Valley
-Arizona Sun
-Chicken Caesar
-Beef Taco Salad
-Fajita Chicken Taco Salad

Other:
-comfort bbq chicken sandwich on ciabatta

Each one of these menu items has a unique, distinct, flavorful taste. You'll be sure to enjoy every bite with some left for later! These salads are quite large!

Want to dine in? It can get busy in here during lunch hours. However, I have never been left without a spot should I want to sit and eat. Later in the day? No problem! They're open until a good hour and theyre usually quiet in the early evening.

So what are you waiting for? Go try a Cafe 56 salad! They're each around $10 so you don't have much to lose. 

Fun tip: Try the tropical green tea. Its bananas (that's youngster for amazing).
