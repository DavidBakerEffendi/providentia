Interesting restaurant. its like a lounge/restaurant with plenty of patrons enjoying drinks from the bar. lighting was more on the dark side but is still manageable. Last night we had my gf's birthday dinner here. from the hostess, waiter, busser n runners. service was great. they were all on top of their jobs. Food was 8/10 for me. we started off with sashimi and lobster bisque. Sashimi was ok but that lobster bisque was delicious. main course was one boneless ribeye for the lady and I settled with a dry aged bone in ribeye both with foie gras. accompanied with cream of spinach and truffle fries. sides were pretty darn tasty and the steaks were good but I had better. don't get me wrong I enjoyed it very much and will order it again. for dessert, compliments of the house was a fun platter of s'mores 3 kinds: dark n white chocolate and Nutella for two. overall our experience was delightful and the reason I gave 5 stars is because of the hospitality. I believe our servers name was Marco. Thanks to him n 9 for a wonderful evening.
