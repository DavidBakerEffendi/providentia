So good. Tacos Chiwas (their namesake) are amazing with ham, beef, green chiles, cheese, and all sorts of deliciousness. I've also had the red and green deshebrada burritos as well as the pastor. Full of flavor and filling! You can get Red or green sauces, which also have great flavor and a perfect amount of heat. Very affordable, and delicious.
