First  time here !!! My new fav! So glad it's so close to our house ! Friday's they have a live mariachi band ! Service and food was beyond amazing ! Michelle was our server and she went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed a night out and enjoyed our dinner ! Clean and everyone is super friendly ! Fajitas are just incredible! Can't wait to go back
