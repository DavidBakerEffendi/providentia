I love Jimmy's! Hands down the best shwarma/donair place in Calgary! Soooo good. I have random cravings for it all the time. My only complaint is that I wish they were opened till a bit later - I think they close at 9:30pm, at least on weekdays.

As previous reviews state, the portions are huge. I usually get a medium or large and split it half/half with my sister or my boyfriend, and we are always more than satisfied by how full we are. If you are eating one by yourself, I would recommend a small size unless you want to explode. The staff are super friendly - just ask them to cut it in half if you are sharing. They always make jokes and are so cheerful. One time I saw a little boy at the place with his father and he started crying because he couldn't get a chocolate bar - one of the employees (I think he is one of the owners because he is always there) made the little boy promise him that he would brush his teeth and gave him a free chocolate bar! Such good customer service.
 
I also love their baklava. I think the chocolate pistacchio one is amazing. Super sweet but not in an overwhelming way, like some I've tried at other places.

There is parking available on the street. There are also some tables and chairs outside in front, nice to be able to eat outside when it's sunny outside. Unfortunately there are no seating inside on the first floor. I think I've seen a sign for ice cream upstairs but I've never been so I'm not sure what's up there.

Oh also. It is extremely messy to eat so I would not recommend going here on a date.... Unless you don't mind having food all over your face and dripping! :P
