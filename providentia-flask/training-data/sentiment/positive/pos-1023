Great service & fresh food here! We came for a family breakfast here on a busy sat morning. We got seated quickly and the tables were clean. Our waitress was bubbly and friendly. She was patient with us and quick to repond to our requests. 

We ordered breakfast food and it wasnt a long wait. We were really happy with the quality of food and the service.
