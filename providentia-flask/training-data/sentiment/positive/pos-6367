I was pleasantly surprised by this place.My friend Michelle had a coupon for "Buy one Panino get one Free." The food was delicious and the service was superb.

 I ordered the prosciutto panini and and it was fantastic.  I can't say enough good things about the wonderful warm service of our waitress! Definitely will be back!

The interior is cozy and definitely not at all pretentious.
