The Mrs. and I hit this place twice in a week when we were in the area for a class.  We came armed with Groupons both times - never leave a deal behind!

The carne asada is every bit as good as they say, and the guacamole is really tasty.  Their reddish refried beans are also surprisingly scrumptious, so much so that I strayed from my beloved carne burrito to try the carne quesadilla platter the second time.  It was good but not worth the sacrifice - the burrito is chock-full of spices, veggies, and textures, while the quesadilla is more straightforward.  My lovely wife highly recommends the taco platter, which she had both times.  She mixed and matched meats the first time to try the barbacoa, but by the second time she was totally sold - all carne, all the time.

The horchata and the lemonade are also refreshing, and the staff is really nice.  Unfortunately this isn't "our side" of the Valley but we vowed to come by the next time we're in the area, and inform those who are lucky enough to be in the ballpark.

Give it a try, I bet you'll like it.
