Shut your mouth!  Meatloaf of the Gods!  There are three types of meat rolled into this meatloaf.  It comes with a red wine gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies.  All of this for $10.  Yup, a complete, well-rounded, mouth watering meal for just $10.  

The broccoli was blanched rather than steam.  So it was not mushy.  

The service is incredible.  The people are friendly and the food comes up fast.  I have nothing but good things to say.  On a date?  With family?  Have a small child?  Check this place out.  

They get desserts from a local bakery.  The carrot cake is ridiculous.  Are you full from your meal?  Take cake or pie to go.  Seriously, you will not regret a snack for later.
