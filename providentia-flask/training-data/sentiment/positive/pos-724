Customer service : We were welcomed right upon entering, by multiple employees. It was our first time going and we told the woman helping us that so she was very helpful in making some recommendations to us. 

Food: I ordered the chicken taco combo and you get a choice of white or black beans as well as white or brown rice. I ordered the cajun white beans and they were absolutely delicious! We also ordered a side of chips and guacamole and the guacamole was flavorless. The avocados did not even have a taste to them and I was really disappointed by it. The meat in the taco was the complete opposite and had tons of flavor and was delicious! 

Environment: It is a casual, very laid back place with plenty of seating and very interesting decor. They definitely brought their California beach vibe with them!
