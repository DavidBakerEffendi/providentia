I'm a fan! There is a vegan hot dog option on the menu! The toppings list seems endless and the tater tots are delicious!!! There is usually a couple people behind the bar, so quick refills on beer and water. I've never been to the Happy Dog for music but I've been there a couple times for their science lecture: Life, the Universe and Hot Dogs. I always take my out-of-town visitors here.
