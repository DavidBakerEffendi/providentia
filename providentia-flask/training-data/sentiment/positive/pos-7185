Went to Bottiglia a couple of times now and service was spectacular...great service, great management team, great ambiance, great food...
We tried the following:
King crab bucatini - creamy, meaty...quite pricey but quality is there.
Linguini Vongole - light, yet so satisfying.  The clams were fresh and plump.
Dessert platter - strawberry panna cotta, tiramisu, lemon poppy seed donuts, all delicious!
Oysters - On a Tuesday, these oysters from Washington was at $1/each (regularly priced at $3).  Fresh and delightful...I can finish 2 dozens on my own.

Currently in November, they are offering 50% off pasta from Mon-Thurs.
