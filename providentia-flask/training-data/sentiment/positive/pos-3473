I've been going to Bagel Cafe for years, I'm really surprised I haven't posted a review yet. I don't live as close now, so I don't get to go as much. It's great to see the food and service are still superb. 

When we arrived today (Sunday about 10AM), they were busy of course. Our wait was quoted at 20 minutes and we waited maybe 15. Every employee hustles there! They seem to work well together. No attitudes and they seem to enjoy their jobs. 

The food is always great. Within our party today there was eggs, bacon, Lox, whitefish, bagels, chicken salad and matzo ball soup. Everyone finished their meals and we were FULL! 

Great Job Bagel Caf√©!!!!
