Amazing!  I have been looking forward to trying this place for ages based on the incredibly positive reviews. This place lives up to the hype and more. Oh my golly. I wish I worked or lived closer to this place and I would be here all the time.

I tried the apple butter burger (no cheese) combo which came with hand-cut fries and a drink. The burger is a somewhat thin patty (but wide in circumference), but get this, it wasn't overcooked! Mine was a perfectly cooked medium. Slightly pink and so incredibly juicy and flavourful. Why can't all burger joints cook a patty like that. Why? I get so sad when burgers are cooked to a dried out well done. 

The burger came topped with finely shredded lettuce, apple butter barbecue sauce, and a bit of mayo. When I first unwrapped the burger, my heart sunk a little at the bun. It looked large. I feared it would be substantial. My fears were unfounded! This baby is a squishable pillow that perfectly held the juicy patty and saucy toppings together. This burger is very saucy and the finely shredded lettuce does get coated in the sauce and may sneak out of your bun on occassion, so you should be aware of that if you're wearing a light-coloured outfit. 

The hand-cut fries are crazy good. Any burger joint that uses frozen fries should be ashamed of themselves and should attempt to become more like On the Bun. They are doing things right. I ordered a side of their secret weapon sauce, which is apple butter barbecue, a bit of mayo, and a squirt of sriracha. They don't blend the sauce for you, so you can blend it yourself or dip your fries into various parts of the sauce to your heart's desire. It was so yummy. Get this with your fries! 

The parking lot got a bit congested on my way out, but aside from that, this was a stellar burger experience. Absolute perfection.
