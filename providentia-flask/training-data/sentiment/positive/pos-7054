I proposed to Jeremy, the owner, the other night. Of course, I also proposed to the lovely bottle of artisanal gin from BC that he made lovely martinis from, so I'm not sure how flattering the offer was. The people at the next table were trying to figure out how they could move to Cafe Taste and never leave. It was that kind of evening.

I've given this 5 stars even though there are things that could, in theory, be better. It could be open Sundays. It could have more mains. But what it does it does so perfectly that I couldn't possibly give it less than a full 5 stars. 

The owner really knows his stuff. My usual procedure when I come here is just to ask Jeremy to bring me things he thinks are interesting, and I always end up with a selection of cheese, charcuterie, and wine so perfectly matched with both each other and my mood that the experience ends up feeling magical. I tend toward serious geekitude so really appreciate how much I learn every time I go here. Want to drink an Ontario rattafid, the only wine made with this technique outside Chablis? Cafe Taste has it and can match it with something perfect - and serve it with a house-baked rye-maple bread that complements it perfectly.

Really, I second (or third) the other positive reviews. Go for wine and cheese, ask what's best, and sit back and enjoy the ride.
