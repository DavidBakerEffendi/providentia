I'm back in town in AZ and Yan's is always a pit stop that I need to make. On this trip, I had the chicken lettuce wrap with the crab rangoon. I really enjoy the filling that they use for the lettuce wrap because they include water chestnuts. The chestnut adds a wonderful crunch to the meal. I also enjoy how the seasoning for the lettuce wrap is just right. It is never too salty or too dry. The portion size also leaves plenty of food for leftovers. Being a college student, I love having leftovers. It really is great in my opinion. I also really like how they add celery to their lettuce wraps. In my experience, celery is not always an ingredient. But, I love the flavor of celery. Personally, I really love eating cream cheese. So, the crab rangoons resonate well with my personal tastes. But, I highly highly recommend them if you enjoy cream cheese and fried foods! Really tasty! 

Yan's is a nice place to eat with very nice cashiers. They tend to remember you if you're a regular. They really are very nice even if it is a little bit difficult to understand them. If you're looking for an inexpensive bite to eat on the fly, please try Yan's.
