This is my friend's favorite restaurant in the city, and I can see why: the food was flavorful and affordable, it is centrally-located, and the service was fantastic. I had my favorite, Pad See Eau, and it was one of the best dishes I've had in the city. My friend swears by the curry. 

The place is casual and a bit small but very clean and modern-looking (my friend says they recently went through a renovation - it looks good)! I would definitely recommend grabbing a bite here.
