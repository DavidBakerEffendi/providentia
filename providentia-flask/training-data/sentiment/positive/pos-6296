Of the fast food style Mexican joints (Fillbertos, Los Favs, America's Taco Shop, etc.), Senor Taco is my absolute favorite. The food is not the best I ever had, but the portions are huge and there is something to be said about quantity! I also love the flavor of the green salsa in the salsa bar. Most places just whip up a salsa verde which is mostly jalapeno and just hot with no flavor. The green salsa has a distinctly tomatillo flavor and I pour this stuff all over my meal. Tip: The beef rolled tacos (taquitos) are waaaaaaaay more flavorful than the chicken ones and the cashier will let you mix things up if you prefer more beef than chicken or vice versa.
