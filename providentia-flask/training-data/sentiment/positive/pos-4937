Excellent coffee house.

Technically this is a "shared office space" so if you want to pay $10 an hour, you can rent a conference room with a projector and a big table.

Almost no one was taking them up on the deal when I was there.

Mostly it was an orthodox coffee house with a third of the customers working on line and the rest involved in groups in animated conversation.

(Being near the convention center increases the talkers and decreases the home-workers.)

The coffee is OUTSTANDING.

Net of a good base product, they have a number of high price ou-la-la brews that use elaborate technologies.

(Beakers like something out of high school chemistry class - obscure vintages from deepest darkest wherever.)

I would say fewer than 20% of places that offer "expensive whiz-bang coffee" have a product that justifies the price.

Here the Chemex top of the line brew really IS that good and really DOES justify the price.

Add a nice workplace, a young nerdy crowd and nice scenery on both the front and back views

And you have a first rate place to settle down to get some work done.
