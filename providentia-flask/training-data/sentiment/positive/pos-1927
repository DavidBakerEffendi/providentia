Big eye Tuna Tartar is on point! The food portions are a little small for a dude like me that likes to shovel food towards my face on certain occasions. With that being said, the night I went with my wifey and our friend, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Joe, one of the assistant managers was off the hook and the ambience was jumping that night after a few glasses of wine. The waiters and Joe took especially good care of our table and that locked in the 5th star! Good people, good food, good wine= good occasional spot for some fine dining....
