While hanging out at seven tattoo with my boyfriend getting tattooed, I was introduced to this delicious bbq. The bbq master came in, was the coolest guy,took everyones orders, and cooked it up in the parking lot. It was so good, everyone in the shop was digging in. Super affordable! Try the pulled pork, brisket, and mac &cheese!
