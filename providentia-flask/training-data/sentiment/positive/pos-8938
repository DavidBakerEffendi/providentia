My absolute favorite place to eat in Vegas.  Whenever I'm in NY, Montreal or Miami: I try to stop by.  I can't put my finger on it but they all differ slightly.  The Miami locale lacked alot of the zest and pow you get in Vegas.  Out of all the ones I been to, I like vegas the best. 

The Churrasco plate is wicked. I usually go with 3-5 friends and share this plate.  The chorizo is off the hook.  All kinds of flavor happening.  The new tokyo and topo rolls are insane good.

Try this place you won't be dissapointed.
