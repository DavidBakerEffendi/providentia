There's a reason why this business has been open for as long as it has. The owners are savvy in keeping up with dietary trends and that's where they shine! 

I'm newly vegetarian and their veggie & gluten free options are amazing. Specifically I love ordering their veggie balls that come with their to-die-for marinara. A favorite of mine up until I quit eating meat is their Italian Salad, which is loaded with cold cuts of salami, pepperoni and cheeses. I MISS IT SO MUCH!!! 

For dessert you should order the brownie ala mode. At one point we were ordering it every other day, it's THAT tasty. 

The service here is always on point. The owners treat their customers like family and that brings such a warm and inviting vibe to the restaurant!
