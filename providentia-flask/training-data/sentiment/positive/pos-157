Stopped in for an early dinner. It wasn't at all crowded. But still a nice vibe to the place. The guy preparing meals behind the counter was very nice and patient with us newbies. I had a brisket bowl - never thought to have BBQ that way. It was really good. The brisket was very tender and juicy with a bit of crust on the edges. Lots of choices for toppings/additions. My husband had a pulled pork sandwich. He thought the pork was a little fatty for his taste, but once he got rid of some of the fat he thought it was very good. And their Cole slaw is near perfect in my book - creamy with a just right sweet/tangy flavor. Another great place to eat in our new neighborhood.
