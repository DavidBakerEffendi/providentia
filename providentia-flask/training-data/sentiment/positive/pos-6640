Over the top! 

#1 BEST service ever...thanks to Kat (cute lil girl managing the floor). The food was amazing...apps, steak, seafood, shots, dessert, etc! The place is really nice on the inside...a little hidden...kind of looks like you might be entering an underground secret restaurant. The bathrooms have the world's tiniest tv's in the wall next to the stall's random but cute. This place was packed. 

A very trendy fun place with incredible food & service...whatelse could you want!
