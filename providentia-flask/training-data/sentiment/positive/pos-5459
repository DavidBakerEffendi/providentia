# of Visits: 4-5
Price: Really fair
Quality: Really good for price, you could even take out the words "for price"
Atmosphere: Excellent
Service: There is a cleancut gentlemen behind the bar that has only seen me twice but seems like he knows me and is very cognizant. TOP NOTCH. Professional, courtious, and smart. Again, TOP NOTCH. He also is extremely polite to his fellow workers. Again, TOP NOTCH. 
There is a girl who is the manager and she is very social, and seems genuinely thrilled about her job and her customers.
Notes: I like how they have bean dip with their chips and salsa
Notes 2: I was very pleased and surprised... They had a happy hour at 6:30 on a Saturday - drink and food specials.
