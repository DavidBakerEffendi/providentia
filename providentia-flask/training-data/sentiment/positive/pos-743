This is just the place I was looking for! Freshly grilled meat and nicely seasoned salad at a great price. We had many places like this in Brooklyn and I was glad to find one in Phoenix. A pleasant space to eat in. The service is once and meets are fresh and flavorful. A great place for a take out or a low key meal when no one wants to cook.
