My husband and I love this place the ambiance the house music the bartender Angel is our absolute Fav!!! He is always helpful engaging caring about each and every client he serves!!! I love the 5-Star quality food like short ribs with mashed potatoes the cheese platter, the best drinks here not watered down like most places in Vegas. But definitely stop by the bar area after you eat at the restaurant to meet Angel, he will lighten your day up!!! Oh and kudos to the best music in a restaurant!!!
