I've literally eaten at Pasta Fresh three times in the last three days! What can I say I love this place. 

Concept: Build your own fresh pasta meal. I hate to say this but the concept is totally a run off of Mac Shack. That being said its way way way nicer than Mac Shack. For starters the pasta noodles are made fresh on site and they don't do cheap kids eat free gimmicks which means no screaming children! The kitchen is also an open kitchen so you can literally see them make your food which is good if you're like me and have a gluten allergy. 

The food: The gluten sensitive noodles are AMAZING! Seriously Chef Wes has come up with one of the best gluten sensitive pasta recipes I have ever tried. The best thing about it is eating this pasta actually reminds me of my time in Italy eat fresh pasta. 

So far I have had the lasagna, two create your own masterpieces which were to die for and a kale salad. The salad was amazing although I can't remember what all was in it! 

Remember to save a tiny bit of room for desert: My favorite the Carmel Macaroon!
