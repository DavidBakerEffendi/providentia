Being new to Phoenix, I wanted to check out the downtown cityscape area. After looking at menus of the restaurants nearby, this one was the only one that looked delicious and fairly inexpensive so I made a reservation on the patio on a Saturday night to go with friends. 

We had an awesome experience. Our friends were late so my fianc√©e and I ordered a few drinks and waited at our table. The waiter was super cool and didn't seem to mind at all that our friends were 20 mins late. He gave us food recommendations and was everything a great waiter should be! Needless to say, service was excellent!

And the food! Since we were sitting on the patio, we could order off the patio menu... Everything $6! Between the all of of us we got an order of nachos, chicken tacos, and several BBQ pork quesadillas. Everyone loved the food. Especially for the price!  I am a super fan of nachos with melted cheese and that can be surprisingly hard to come by, but these nachos had it. Sooo good. They even brought us out a complimentary dessert.. Key lime pie. Yum!  

I definitely would recommend Fuego to anyone looking to grab dinner down in cityscape. Oh and they are dog friendly on the patio! I always love that!
