My wife and I have been to John Cutters a few times and every time we walk out pleased. Servers are excellent, bartenders are too.  The food is always good.  Last weekend I had the Mediterranean Chicken Wrap. It came with a choice of fries or a house salad. The house salad was AWESOME.  Plus I won $20 while watching the football game at the bar.  I'll be back real soon!
