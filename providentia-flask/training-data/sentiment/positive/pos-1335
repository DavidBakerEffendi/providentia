The staff are always friendly.  The atmosphere is relaxed.  The food is AMAZING.  Large portions and great taste.  My personal favorite is "THE LOCAL".  It combines 3 great tastes in one Pita.  My service animals even love it.  I get then the "lil" turkey.   

you can fax in an order or order on line.  they even do school lunch program and corporate catering.  

I love that the staff all seem to love what they do and you know the food is good when staff eat there as well.  Recommendations from the staff have proven to be good tasting as well.  

They even have great soup and chili.  The tomato soup with a Queso-pita is a nice rainy day treat.  The chili has great flavor with just enough bite.  Guess I know what I'm having for lunch again...writing this review is making me hungry.
