Pizza heaven.  It's like Chipotle, but for pizza, and you can add all the extras you want with no extra charge.  The only downside is they only have one type of crust, and it isn't the best.  But for a quick flavorful pizza fix, this is the place.  They have my all time fav pizza topping - artichokes- which can be hard to find otherwise.  LOVE!!!!
