I love this place!  The owners are great and always make a point to say hello, even when I am in the drive thru.  You can even call ahead of time and order your coffee, so that it is ready when you arrive... that is service!  I do it all the time, and love that they offer that. The coffee is amazing.   In the fall they make the most amazing Pumpkin Spice latte, made from a puree not just syrups!!  That is my favorite ... anyway, great place and I am so thankful they are close by.
