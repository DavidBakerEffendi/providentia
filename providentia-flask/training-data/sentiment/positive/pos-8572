I can't say enough good things. Every thing you've read in other reviews is true. Great service and sublime food.

We were a group of 8 and the waiter gave everyone equal attention. We ordered the fritters and the pretzel bites for appetizers. Both were great. The pretzel bites and cheese are addictive.

As an entree I ordered the short rib stew, and attached a pic of it. The rib meat was tender and tasty, and it had just the right amount of heat from the green chilis. Amazing cornbread too. Others ordered the fish and chips, and the sloppy joe; all were happy with their orders.

I'll definitely be back.
