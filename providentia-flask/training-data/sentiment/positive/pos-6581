My husband and I have been staying at the Wynn/Encore for years, partially because it is so vegan friendly. The vegan chicken and waffles at Terrace Pointe Cafe is hands down the best meal I've ever had in my life. I spend all year dreaming about it until it's time to go to Vegas. It's even better with fresh watermelon juice. If chicken and waffles aren't for you, the vegan hamburger, fries, and chocolate shake are also amazing. 

The wait can be a bit long, but it's Vegas and there is plenty of people watching to occupy you. I'm counting down the days until my next visit. Thank you Steve Wynn for having delicious vegan options at every Wynn and Encore restaurant! It makes every visit a first class experience for me!
