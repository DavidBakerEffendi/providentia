My boss asked me if I wanted to go to lunch one day. "Yeah, I want to take you to this gas station. They have the best barbecue." I was a little skeptical about eating at a gas station, but I am certainly not going to turn down a free lunch.

Calling this place a gas station is really a misnomer. Yes, there are gas pumps and a car wash outside, but the market itself could easily function as a standalone restaurant. When was the last time you saw a chandelier in a gas station? And they serve beer and wine (and not in a brown paper bag).

On to the food...it was amazing! I got the brisket tacos and the brisket was perfectly cooked. They don't put any sauce on the meat, but they have about 6 different BBQ sauces for you to choose from, including traditional ones like Memphis style to spicy ones like  Habanero. 

They also have breakfast. The bacon waffles are pretty good and have a cinnamon taste to them, but not very bacony. The campfire wrap is essentially a giant breakfast burrito with eggs, bacon, and tons of veggies. You definitely won't be hungry the rest of the day.

If you live/work in the Scottsdale area, you definitely need to add this place to your rotation!
