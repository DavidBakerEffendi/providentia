This place is very hard to find. 

It's in the corner of one of those ugly Vegas strip malls (isn't every restaurant off the strip in one of those malls?), but I kind of got a kick out of that. It's like a secret restaurant. I felt like I belonged to the Russian mafia.

But once you find it, you'll be glad you did. The food is staggeringly good.

The waiter told us that the goulash, the beef stroganoff and the chicken kiev we ordered wouldn't be like any we'd ever had, because this restaurant was authentic. He was very right. They were all different than what I expected, but they were all delicious and memorable. The goulash was particulary stunning.

Prices are very fair. They have no liquor license (strange for Russians, who are not exactly tea-totalers) but they allow you to bring in liquid refreshment for a very small fee.

This isn't "PF Krushchev's"...this is the real deal.
