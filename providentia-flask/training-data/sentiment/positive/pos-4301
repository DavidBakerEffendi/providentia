This is now one of my favorite places to eat. Ordered a carne asada burrito combo and it was delicious! Everyone working there were very friendly and delivered outstanding customer service. I am looking forward to trying more things on the menu. I decided to return and try the chicken flautas they were very good and loved the churros.
