This place is awesome. Very small and unassuming but the food is delicious. A friend and I got the french toast platters which is a lot of food for less than $7. I would have never noticed let alone visited this type of place without all the reviews from other Yelpers. I will definitely be back for a quick, cheap & delicious breakfast.
