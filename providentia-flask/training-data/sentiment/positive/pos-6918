This review is more for my son. He tends to notice service alot, especially in places in which service might not be thier top priority. 

Hr pointed out to me that every time we go to this birger king the people are always nice, smiling and very patient with him especially. I make him order his own food (so he can learn). He can be timid sometimes but he always ends up feeling like he did a good job.

For a fast food place, service usually isn't amongst the top reasons people visit but for us...at this location it is.
