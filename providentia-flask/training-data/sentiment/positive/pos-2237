While I have only eaten the buffet at Bellagio only once, this is definitely one of my favorites.  Since most buffets cost about $26-30, I would much rather pick Bellagio since it has a larger selection of sushi.  Service is attentive and the line moves slowly, but surely.  

Some of the meat cuts were dry, but I'm not much a meat eater.  They also cut the crab legs for you (a definitely plus for those who love crab) and they also have a great selection of fish.  I didn't find their dessert/soup section that extraordinary, but I don't think anyone goes to a buffet to fill up on dessert or soup as the main course!
