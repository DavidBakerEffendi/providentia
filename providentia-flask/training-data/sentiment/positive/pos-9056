As soon as I walked in, I knew it was going to be a messy meal. People had their bibs on and were wearing gloves. This place lets us humans be our primal selves and eat with our hands in a socially acceptable way!! It helps that the food is delicious. 

It goes without saying that there is lots of plastic in use...plastic cups, bib, gloves and even the table cloth. Hopefully its all recyclable material because this kind of hurts their green footprint...

The lunch special is a must for me. Before 4pm, you can get a fish or chicken teriyaki plate for $10.95. There is just something about fried fish that tastes so damn good so thats what I got. The lunch plate came with 5 pieces of fish, 2 crawfish, some clams and some mussels. Super filling.

Service was somewhat incapable but I think thats because the location and the employees were new...they didnt know any of the beers!..nor did they know our orders when giving us our food! Overlooked though, food was great!
