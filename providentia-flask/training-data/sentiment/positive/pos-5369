I am so glad this is under new ownership! This bakery is in the same shopping center as Sprouts and CVS on Flamingo and Rainbow. It's a Korean Swedish fusion with a French ambience! Super cute little bakery with great food and pastries! I came in on a Tuesday afternoon with my boyfriend before we went to buy groceries! Pro tip - always eats before buying groceries so you don't buy everything! It's right next to Myloan nails. When you walk in you see the menu on a big chalkboard behind the register. Everything is organic and made by the owner! She was so sweet! The music was French and soft,it made you feel like you weren't in a shopping center but rather a cafe in Paris! It was a little bit later in the afternoon so we decided on lunch. The menu had croissants,sandwiches and bulgogi burgers and noodles! We ordered the burger and the noodles! They were both a 10! The owner makes this dressing that's sweet and spicy and you pour it over the noodles or salad it was so good. You can also buy jars of this sauce, I recommend getting some for salads at home! The flavors of everything stood out it was delicious! Definitely will be  returning to eat here and try everything!
