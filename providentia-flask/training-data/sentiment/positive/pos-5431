Although expensive, I think this place is great and have never had a bad meal, plus I enjoy the eclectic crazy decorations. The lobster soup, green beans, lobster mac & cheese, the rolls with butter, calamari, are all really good. But probably the best thing is the all you can eat shrimp special. Sooo much food!
