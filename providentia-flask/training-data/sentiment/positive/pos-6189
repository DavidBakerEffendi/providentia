Fresh cup is a refreshing new boba place right in central Las Vegas! I stepped in and already loved the atmosphere. The place was clean, cute, and I was immediately greeted by the friendly staff! 

I got the Thai Tea blended with egg pudding and boba. Their boba was cooked PERFECTLY! It was up to par with Half and Half, which I frequently visit in SoCal! The drink was overall a refreshing way to cool down from the hot Vegas heat!
