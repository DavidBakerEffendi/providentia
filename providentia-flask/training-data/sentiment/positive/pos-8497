Great place! We were able to get in before the crowd on a Sunday morning and had our choice of tables. The staff was very friendly and the food came in just a few minutes. 

We ordered two crepes and both were fantastic!
Bristol - Smoked turkey, goat cheese, avocado and bechamel sauce. YUM!
Ham and Swiss Cheese - Ham, Swiss cheese and honey aioli. Also YUM!

I had a hot tea and my friend tried the coffee - both good options! I definitely recommend heading there for brunch when in Shadyside!
