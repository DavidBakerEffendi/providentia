Beautiful spot on the corner of Tatum and Shea. Atmosphere is classy but casual, garage door style windows are a nice touch.  For appetizers we had the crab cake and charcuterie board both were excellent.  The short rib ravioli, scallops, and banh mi sandwich were a favorite of everyone. Good cocktail and wine list, the girls loved the Carri and Big guy cocktail.  I would definitely recommend this to friends. Looking forward to the coffee bar opening up soon. It will be a nice spot for morning meetings.
