Have been going to their other locations in Toronto for a long time and was excited to hear that they were finally opening one in Mississauga. The restaurant is decorated nicely with a modern look. I came on opening day and their customer service was great as there wasn't too many tables.

We ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein and it came quickly. Portion size was great in terms of meat and noodles. I love how they're always making the noodles at the right level of crispness served with the right amount of sauce. Shrimps were huge and the squid was bouncy!

Can't wait to come here and try their other new menu items like the HK style lobster.
