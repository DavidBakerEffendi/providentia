This is now a new favorite!
My bf is a carnivore and could eat a whole cow...This place allows him to be in his zone without spending a whole week's pay...which is unheard of in Vegas.
The locay isn't especially fancy, but it's quaint amd intimate....You can see the meat being grilled if you're into that....it's what some would call "rustic"
The bar is a semi-circle of leather bar chairs.
Oh, and MY FAVE ( duh) is that they have happy hour :)
The locay is kinda hidden from the streets' side ...We had seen it from the 215 for forever and couldn't "figure out" how to get to it on our own...so had to "2016 it" and gps it. Lol. It's near Ann and 95

Note: I didn't care for the house potatoes..They were a bit too rich for my tastes so just be aware. Expect heaviness
