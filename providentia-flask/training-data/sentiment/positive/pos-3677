This is my favorite place in the Strip District. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh, the service is fast and the price is right. I've had their fried plantains, yucca fries, fried burrito and rotisserie chicken. I would recommend all of them and the chicken is extremely moist!!! And last but not least, their green hot sauce is amazing and you can buy a container to go. Two thumbs up
