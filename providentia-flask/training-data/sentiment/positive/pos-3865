Went there with a friend for lunch. Service was quick and friendly. Food was excellent. I couldn't ask for a better experience. 

My lunch partner went on and on about the authenticity of the food. We walked through the deli side on the way out. I think there were 8 or 10 kinds of cream cheese.

I'll definitely return when I'm in town.
