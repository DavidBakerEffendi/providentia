My first time here was amazing. The food was delicious and prepared in a timely fashion. I ordered the Smoked Dog fusion style hot dog and it was a meal unto itself. The spicy link was cooked to perfection. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The dog was topped with onions, coleslaw, cheddar and an amazing garlic mayonnaise sauce. The bun was warm, soft and delectable. I will definitely eat here again. And again.
