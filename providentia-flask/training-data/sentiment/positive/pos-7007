After a long time we enjoyed the LARGE spread of delicious food, you will run out of space but the flow of the amazing food never ends.


New management team , new attitude and the love of cooking and customer service is all good 

I went with a friends family and every one enjoyed for more that 90 mins


Will recommend every one to try the lunch buffet it's worth every penny.


Keep up the great work.
