Great foodie place in Broadview Heights. Who would have thought such great restaurants existed outside Cleveland?

Drinks were great. Tried the Stellar which is a foamy peach vodka drink. Delicious--couldn't even taste the vodka. Also tried another drink which was just whiskey and ginger beer, which was made perfectly.

Everyone is served pumpernickel bread with spinach dip--a nice change from usually getting bread and butter.

We started off with chicken and waffles and the Reuben ribs. The chicken and waffles is served with a spicy butter. The syrup compliments this very well. The Reuben ribs were awesome and would definitely recommend.

Split the pork paprikash as our entree. Very delicious.

Had a deep fried brownie for dessert. Interesting taste. I wish they had a better dessert selection.

Our server was great.

The decor is pretty bad but I wasn't expecting anything super trendy.

Would definitely go again!
