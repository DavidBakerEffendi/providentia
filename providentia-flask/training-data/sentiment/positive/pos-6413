I am a NY pizza snob. Stopped for lunch. Pizza by the slice or pie. These are large thin crust that you can fold over as pizza should be. I had pepperoni with the garlic crust. I don't think I will try others. Totally loved it. Look I'm a fat old new Yorker. This is the best pizza in Tempe and maybe the valley until someone shows me better.
