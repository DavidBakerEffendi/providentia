Ventured in late afternoon, just missing happy hour (11-3). Sat at bar and Ryan was just coming on. This was the second time we sat at bar with Ryan.  We got a few cocktails instead of beer, I got the Geishas Gimlet, substitute gin for vodka because wifey does not approve my behavior on gin... lol. The Gimlet was very good. We ordered crab puffs, lettuce wraps and general li, wit chicken. Chicken lightly fried and breaded. Very good. The crab puffs were exceptional!! Overall very good atmosphere and experience.
