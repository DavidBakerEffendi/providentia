This place is fairly far from where I tend to be in the city. It is also a pain in the butt to get to. It's not all that nice inside. The sign looks like it should be an Indian convenience store.

Fan-Effing-Tastic. If you've never had Ghandi's roti, skip it and come here. If you have had Ghandi's you'll definitely love their sister restaurant Mother India. It's all the flavor and roti goodness of Ghandi's but with cutlery, water, seats, tables, and a wider selection.  

Food spicing and quality is equal or better than Ghandi's or maybe the cutlery and seats make it that much better. This place is nevvveerrr busy but that may change and the yelposphere start broadcasting this place. 

The servers here are also super nice and on the ball when it comes to water and other things. It's really hard for me to go back to Ghandi's when I can get the same thing with more comfort. 

Overall, Mother India is Ghandi's on crack and that my friends is a good thing. The price is super cheap for the quality and quantity of food you get. I'm drooling right now just thinking about this place. I'm leaving. Right now. Need roti. So good.
