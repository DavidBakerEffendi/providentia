My favorite breakfast place. The plates are huge, the quality is high.

At first I hated the potatoes because they are more "smashed" potatoes then breakfast potatoes. But after a few tries I'm now in love with them.

If you feel down for a full fry-up choose the Logger/BÃ»cheron. Looking for something light with tons of fruits? Choose the Good Morning. My favorite of the moment: The special Allo mon Coco: A good fry-up with a moist and fluffy banana pancake to get a sweet treat to balance all the salt of the bacon/ham/sausage.

My only concern: The parking is kind of a madhouse.
