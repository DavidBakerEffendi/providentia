I can't believe I haven't written my review for Roy's sooner! Andy and I come here a ton. The happy hour is amazing. Between the Mango Mojitos and the Lobster Potstickers you can't go wrong. A few other HH items we enjoy are the braised short ribs, ahi sushi, and fish tacos. 

We came here on our 1 year anniversary (2 years ago) and had a true memorable experience. The entire staff was so sweet and every single person wished us a Happy anniversary. We had the blackened Island Ahi. So amazing, it had this spicy mustard sauce that was to die. The seared scallops were also delicious..don't even get me started on the chocolate souffl√©... 

We absolutely love the bar staff, especially Nathan. Thanks for all the amazing times. We are sure to make more memories at our favorite seafood restaurant!
