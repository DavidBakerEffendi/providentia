I had walked past Ginger Monkey numerous times over the last couple years but never had the time to drop in. Since one of my fellow Elite friends comes here frequently, I knew it had to be a pretty cool place! Paid a visit last weekend and had no clue how good the wings would be! My wife ordered the chicken carbonara pasta and loved it as well. The overall vibe is super chill and from what I've heard they have live music on certain nights. Haven't been for happy hour yet but I'm pretty sure that'll be my next trip as the deals on the awesome craft beer they serve are pretty competitive. That and it's an easy walk from home!
