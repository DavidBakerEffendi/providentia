Amazing service. Amazing food. A great dining experience!

I've been waiting to try Bradley Ogden for years. Finally I can check this restaurant off my list! They happen to have a summer prix fixe menu that was too good to pass up, so for $59, I got:

Tomato Soup - DELICIOUS! Love the grilled cheese sandwich in the soup.

Pan Seared Halibut - who woulda thought to put watermelon with fish? Not me! But I loved the dish. Light and refreshing.

Banana Fosters Cake - HOLY $%*#%^(@. One of the best things I've ever eaten. Now I know why it was featured on Food Network. WOW. I would totally go back just to have this dessert.

Thank you Bradley Ogden! You where the highlight of my Vegas weekend!
