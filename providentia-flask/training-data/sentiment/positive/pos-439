Love this restaurant! The salmon, onion, chive omelette is a fluffy, delicious delight. The pancakes are also perfect- sweet yet light. I was charmed by the ambiance & decor as well. I adore breakfast/ brunch and this is most definitely at the top of my list for brunch hotspots in Phoenix/Scottsdale. The menu here is insanely diverse & there's truly something for everyone here!
