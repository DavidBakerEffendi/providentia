I feel in love last night. Yes, the wine could have had some impact on my emotions but nonetheless this place is nothing short of awesome. Surprised my lover boy and took him on a date to this very romantic and sophisticated establishment and from the big comfy couches and chairs, to the bruschetta and cheese tasting washed down by delicious wine undoubtedly served up a very good time. After eating, we enjoyed our drinks outside sitting on the fire pit listening to music and canoodling like we were teenagers... sigh.... I could go on but you're not here to read about my mushy moments now are you? No, you're not but you now have read about a place that you MUST go check out... just go.. shhhhh you don't need to say anything just get up and go....and have a wineederfuulll time.
