Darn you Winchells for being 24 hours and having a good selection of doughnuts always on standby. I went yesterday for my usual apple fritter and cinnamon roll and to my surprise I selected a Pumpkin cake doughnut. Wholly moly was it delicious- moist with just enough allspice and nutmeg! Sadly, I didn't turn around and grab the other 3, but I went today and they were all sold out! I shed a small tear, because that's my luck so I grabbed two regular glazed and polished them off instead.
