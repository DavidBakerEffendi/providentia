Here is my dissertation on this place... I eat here way more often than I care to admit aloud. Everything from the Bib im bop to angry dogs...all the food is top notch (at a way way too reasonable price). This guys done a great fusion between Korean, American Mexican and god knows what else.....I highly recommend anything they serve that has pork belly on it, especially the euro fries... oh man the euro fries..don't even get me started. I also have to tip my hat to the owner, somehow I always end up chatting with this guy when I come in. This guy is a super super nice, all around salt of the earth kind of guy. Hes super honest, he works more hours than anyone would care to admit, works his a** off to keep this place running and do all the prep work for his new food truck  from his restaurant while operating active food service . Definitely a restaurant I want to support just in that, this is a case of the little guy (non corporate) private owner busting his hump to make it work. If you are into supporting local food, local business, and have any kind of understanding of how hard the food industry is to stay afloat in you should check this place out. Seriously, BRAVO food well done, hats off and any other accolade I can pass on!! Thank you for the continuously awesome food!
