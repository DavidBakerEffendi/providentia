Honestly , I don't love fast food but this restaurant is very close for me to get to for lunch. 

The reason I love this restaurant is because I always get my food fast and it is always correct. It's always hot and very good. 

The food is the same no matter which location I visit but the service here is excellent. The ladies taking my order are fun and friendly. They always make me smile and laugh.

The are efficient here ! The drive thru is always busy and they have people taking orders outside most of the time to move the line along. 

I don't love fast food but I do enjoy this restaurant! Lastly they have wifi and a play place for kids and not many places have both of those !
