Came here for a late lunch after being slightly hungover the night before. They give complimentary herbal tea which was whey I needed. We ordered the saut√©ed beef pho but we had to order another dish because they have a 5 dollar min per person on orders. We ordered the green curry with chicken but they didn't have so we tried the yellow. It was perfect. The soup was so filling and the beef was thinly sliced and cooked well. The large was a good size for two people. The yellow curry tasted a bit like dahl but it was scrumptious. The bill was about 15 dollars and the quality and quantity made it feel like it was triple that price. Would definitely return! It's in a plaza so you will find lots of parking but it is busy on a weekend. The young man and woman working there were very nice. Craving this right now!
