We were on our way to the Mall at Robinson and were planning to go to the location inside, but decided to go here instead.

It was around 2pm on a Monday and was pretty busy, but the line moved fast. By the time we ordered, they were able to give us our food before we even got our drinks, lucky us.

It's clean, service is friendly, and the fried chicken of course is outstanding! We got a Chick Fil A Deluxe and a Spicy Deluxe, the lettuce, tomatoes and cheese give the sandwich extra flavor. Oh, but how can I forget about the pickles? There's just something about pickles and fried chicken that just works.  

My waffle fries weren't as crispy as I expected, could've been some extras left over from the lunch rush, but nevertheless I still enjoyed them. Try them with mayo for something extra tasty!
