Tott's has the best Orange Chicken in Arizona. They have friendly staff who always remember you, great prices, and amazing dishes. Dishes are served with brown rice and generous portions. Also try the Traditional Signapore Rice Noodle.

New location (Ray and McClintock) is a little smaller than the old location but has a nicer atmosphere.

 I like to think of Tott's as a better version of Pei Wei.
