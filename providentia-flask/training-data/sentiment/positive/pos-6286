All good sushi restaurants are in Parma!

My first visit was fantastic and I have added it to my top sushi picks in NEO. The size of the sushi rolls for the price that Mizu charges is amazing! This is the first place I have been in a long time that I actually enjoyed eel in my sushi. One of my favorite things is that they give you a menu of sushi filled with pictures so you know exactly what the roll will look like when they set it in front of you. It's the simplest things that go a long way in my opinion!

My boyfriend and I ordered the Christmas Roll, Shrimp Roll, Crazy Tuna Roll and the Rock and Roll. They were all equally delicious. I can't wait to visit again and try the Green Tea ice cream that other yelpers have posted about!
