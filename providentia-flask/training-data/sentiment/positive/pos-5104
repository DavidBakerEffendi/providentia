Best banh mi in the area, fantastic pho. Super reasonable prices and really high quality - better than Pho Kim Long and some other Chinatown restaurants even. Plus, they're a family-owned place so it's great to be able to support the community.

Those expecting Lotus of Siam tier decoration and service are honestly just at the wrong place. This is not meant to be a high-end restaurant, and it doesn't pretend to be. Service is attentive enough without being doting, the place is clean and nicely set up. Anyone who knocks off stars for that alone has their priorities crooked.
