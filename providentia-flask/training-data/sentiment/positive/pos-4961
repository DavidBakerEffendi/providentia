I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment

I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years

I've lived all over the world

I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)
1.  Skim Milk
2.  Mexican food
3.  Tokyo Express

Now pay attention

If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order

An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl
5 extra sides of spicy sauce
A small salad
2 extra sides of salad dressing

Ok, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.

This place makes me want to cry I love it so much.
