Chic restaurant + off the strip = Awesome! 

I really like it here. The decor is chic, food is DELICIOUS, service is great, and did I say that the decor was really nice?!

I've had the short rib benedict, portobello fries, & queso dip w/ chips.. all were delicious. 

The prices are a little higher & portion sizes are a little smaller, but the quality of food you get + the ambiance is totally worth it.

I also heard that their happy hour is pretty good, so I plan to check it out one day.

I'll definitely be back =)
