Let me start by saying, I've heard amazing things about this place but wasn't sure. As soon as I walked in the door I knew it was gonna be an amazing experience. Water was delivered immediately as we sat down which I like. The menu is laid out pretty easily so it shouldn't be hard to figure out what you want. I decided on the Lunasaga. I can't stress how incredibly delicious it is. The sauce was very good and had a great after taste. I also got the local greens salad and I added garlic since I love garlic. Delicious! The dressing is a hemp dressing. It tasted like a mix between a ranch and a Caesar dressing. I'm pretty sure I cleaned my plate in under 10 mins. It was THAT good. Of course I couldn't pass on dessert. I opted for the turtle cake which was rich but not overwhelmingly rich. I promise you, you won't be disappointed. My friend ordered the milk and cookies. You get a choice of milk. She likes regular milk but that wasn't an option. She got hemp milk that I enjoyed. The cookies are chocolate chip. Very moist and delicious. Before you leave, check out the stuff in the fridge by the bar. I got the antidote and the protector shots along with the hemp dressing that was on my salad. My experience was awesome! The service was awesome too! Except a little longer than normal on food, it's absolutely worth it! Enjoy!
