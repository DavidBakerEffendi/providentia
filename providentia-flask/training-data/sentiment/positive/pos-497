Spring Sushi   is hit or miss.  Have gone with groups and its always a hit. My recommendation buffet  and we always order the items that are only available during dinner  and sashimi.  
When ordering go easy on the rolls , but dont avoid them either since sushi is all about the rolls and the sashimi . Try items you have not had before. If you are not adventurous it just ruins the experience for adventurous foodies  in the group.  Our servers  have been very helpful when showing us how to use the i pad. Another plus point  here is the window seats that overlook the square . I always request the window seat when dining here. Will be back and do remember to make a reservation  and Print  a copy to bring with you so that you get your spot quickly.  Great experiences are always planned and if you are strategic in   the process from  reserving to ordering you will have a nice seat, great food with your friends and a  great experience at Spring Sushi .
