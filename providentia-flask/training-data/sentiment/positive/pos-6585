My husband, two daughters (15 & 13) had a wonderful lunch at Futo Buta. Service was friendly and professional. We couldn't find the restaurAnt at first but the directions over the phone guided us in. My husband and oldest daughter had Tonkotsu ramen. Very tasty with pork belly and mushroom in a delicious broth. My youngest daughter had shoyu (a good time) which she loved. I had gyoza , crispy pot stickers, check this place out!
