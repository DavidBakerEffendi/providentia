Purple Rice!

You will not find a place better for omakase than at Harumi sushi. Omakase in Japanese means "chefs choice" in Japanese, which means that thce sushi chef gets to choose what he wishes to serve you. Usually this would cost at least $75 or more in other cities. Each piece of fish brought out was delicate, savory, and divine.

I also had the chance to try the nigiri combo plate which contains generous portion of delicious fish and a roll. Think that you will notice that it's different with the sushi joint is that they use purple rice, which adds special indescribable taste to any roll or nigiri. 

My only complaint would have to be that the service was a bit curt, and they seem to be more interested in turning over tables then providing customer service. Regardless I will be back to consume epic amounts of fish.
