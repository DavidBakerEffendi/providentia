Ordered mushroom and pepperoni, Hawaiian and baked ziti- all yummy!!!! Got busy really quick so make sure you know you might not get a seat. Plan for takeout. We were lucky got there before the hockey team came in. Staff very friendly. I think it was the owner who came out to check on us. Definitely will come back again.
