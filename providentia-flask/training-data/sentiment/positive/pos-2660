Came here for the first time after having this place bookmarked for over a year!  My coworkers are constantly raving about their food, but I just never found the time to head over in this direction.  Fortunately I had a friend flying out of the Mesa Gateway Airport and figured it would be the perfect time to check this place out!
We got there fairly early on a Sunday morning, around 10:30am and we were lucky to get seated right away.  They have TV's throughout the restaurant, which is good for all those Sunday football fans.  
I ended up getting the Hawaiian style French Toast - captain crunch style, and my friend got the BLD Benedict.  Both were amazing!  I tried my friends benedict and I enjoyed how it wasn't a thick slab of ham like other places serve.  It was thin sliced pieces which made cutting so much easier!  
And their french toast was amazing!  It was sweet enough with the captain crunch, bananas, and powdered sugar that I didn't even need syrup.  Although I still ended up using a very small amount just so that it didnt' feel like I was eating dry bread. 
I will definitely be making it out here again sometime soon!  Hopefully to try out their lunch/dinner menu!
