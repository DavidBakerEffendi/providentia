Absolutely love it here! It's definitely something you will want to do at least once!

The cafe seating area is lovely and spacious, but I can see how it may get crammed during peek hours! The interior is covered in lovely pastel colours, and all of the staff are very friendly!

It was my birthday so I got the dessert platter to share with my boyfriend. It was amazing to try everything the cafe had to offer for only $25! Not all of the items on the platter are what they have, but it's a good majority! You definitely have to share with someone, as we were both feeling stuffed by the end! Definitely needed a third person LOL!

Our waitress was adorable, she was very familiar with the menu and was more than happy to help us with our questions. She engaged in conversation with us and was very sweet, she also taught us about a few Japanese words (although we were already familiar with them) and we did a little cat pose together and meowed! I know it sounds silly to read but it was soooo cute and fun. I didn't feel embarrassed or anything because it's so welcoming there.

I cannot wait to go back and try some of their normal food! I originally thought it was just dessert but you could easily have dinner or lunch there!
