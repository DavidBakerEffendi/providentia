Service was good.  Food was excellent.  We thought getting there at 5:15 pm there wouldn't be hardly anyone there.  By 5:45 pm, the small place was packed with 2 big parties of about 10 people or so each and then the surrounding tables were couples or small families.

Before coming, I got a $25 Groupon for $17.  I told them before we ordered that we had a Groupon and it wasn't an issue.

My husband ordered the Lomo Saltado (Beef loin strips saut√©d with onions, tomatoes, cilantro mignonette and French fries).  I ordered Pescado a lo Macho (Fish fillet fried and covered with mixed sea food spice sauce, jasmine rice).  My husband LOVED his dish and I loved my dish.   The seafood melted in my mouth (well, not the oysters or shrimp, but the rest of the stuff).  My husband really loved his dish and he said that's the one he's going to get the next time.

There was nothing left on our plates.  Neither of us ate lunch and decided to do an early dinner date with the kids being on vacation from us.

The place was a little warm, so they could crank down the A/C some.  They could hire another server for the evening.  And despite the first big party there, we didn't have to wait too long for our food.  We also ordered some Passion Fruit drink, which was good.  I would have preferred having ice in it, but that's not how they normally serve it.

We'll be back a bit sooner the next time and we were so glad we came here this evening.  Perfect for our date night.
