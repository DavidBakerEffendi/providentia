This place has everything one might need in an Asian supermarket...

I used to shop at Western Market on Spring Mtn before they shut down. Greenland is much bigger and more spacious, with lots of ready-to-eat foods which are helpful for me who doesn't cook. You can still get your fresh fish and meats from the back, noodles, Asian snacks, and especially their produce. Who doesn't like Korean pears?

You can't go wrong with their food court, I'm always ordering something to go, shop inside for groceries, then come back to pick up my food. Kal-bi, sushi, spicy tofu soup, spicy rice cakes... lots of choices.

I'll be there again next week :)
