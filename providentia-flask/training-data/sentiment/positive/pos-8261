Review by anyone below 4 stars shows they are not familiar to what a street taco is and should hang out with their velvet rope buddies at the Hard Rock and eat at their "real" mexican restaurant..  This place HAS THE BEST TACOS in town.  Better than any meat taco in Cabo San Lucas (no fish tacos here though so Cabo still the best in fish tacos).  Salsas are AWESOME!  I go here three times a week. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!
Service is great!
