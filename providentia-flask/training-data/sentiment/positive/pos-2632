Darn Yelp... My favorite Mexican restaurant has been discovered. Arrived  at 6:00 on a Sat  night and had an hour wait. Totally worth it though

I enjoyed carne asada tacos. My husband had a huge burrito and we both enjoyed an organic margarita. (Excellent)

Food-Excellent
Service-Top Notch
Price -Very Affordable
