The yellow curry was fragrant and amazingly flavorful-- the best one I've tried so far! The salad and spicy peanut dressing are definitely worth having, and I appreciate their awesome selection of desserts on the menu. Overall, an inviting place to eat with very memorable food!

We are lucky to have them in this area :)
