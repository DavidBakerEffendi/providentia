I love this place! When I used to live on that side of town,  I would go here all the time!!
The teriyaki chicken bowls are so tasty!
But the small side salad reigns supreme with me,  the dressing is a lemon ginger combo and oh so tasty!
So after 30 years of this awesome place, I have to go again when I am over that way!!!
