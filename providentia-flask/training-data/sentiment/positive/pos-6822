Hip hip hurrah for no-animal-product-pho! I'm so glad that this restaurant popped up when I yelp-ed "vegan" in Glendale. Their veggie pho is light, flavorful, and not overly salty. It comes with all the regular veggie fixings as well as fried tofu, carrots, cabbage, and baby bok choy (my fav!). My food came out quickly, so it'll be a great spot for those who are looking for a restaurant on their work lunch break. 5 stars for efficiency, staff, location, cleanliness, taste, and menu. Well worth the 8 bucks...I'll be a regular for sure!
