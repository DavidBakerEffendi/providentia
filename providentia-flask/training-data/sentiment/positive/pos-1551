Holy Grill is a great lunch and breakfast space, I frequent the 5th ave one as I can get to it through the +15's from work, it's a bit of a walk but I can definitely use the extra calories burned getting there and back for the deliciousness that I enjoy once I am there. You order at the front and then get a table after, they have buzzers to let you know when your food is ready. The tables are often all full when I get there but they open up quite quickly as people are pretty courteous about others waiting. 

For breakfast I usually get the classic bacon and egg sandwich, it comes with a pickle which is delicious and you can add extras like spinach and pickled hot peppers. They have an avocado breakfast sandwich as well which is fully loaded and delicious but a bit much for me that early in the morning.

For lunch the ranch burger is a great option or the salad is especially good if you're looking for something a bit lighter, either way you need to get the sweet potato or beet chips on the side with the chipotle dip, so good!
