A gem in Summerlin, this place is an experience.  Its like having a strip quality restaurant in your back yard. Be sure to check out the fresh market where you get to create your own dish.  I chose shrimp, chicken and salmon with fettuccine, mushrooms, spinach, green onions and peanut sauce.  If you don't know which way to go, you should try this combo, it was simply delicious.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  I went on a Friday night and there was live jazz, the perfect atmosphere.   My new favorite spot
