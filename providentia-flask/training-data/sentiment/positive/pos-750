I love water and I loved these fountains.  It was breathtaking watching the show.  We were in Vegas in August, 105* days.  Watching the show gave us a nice mist that cooled us off for a few minutes.  But man what a great free performance done by just a fountain!  So cool.  This is a must see if you have the time to walk over.
