Great on any side of the state line.  Real Jersey subs...dripping with Italian dressing, quality cold cuts stacked on fresh wheat of white breads that are soft, warm and like a sweet hug.

Giant size is truly too much for one person, so bring a friend or order the regular.

Hot sandwiches include a very excellent Philly Cheese steak and the kahuna includes extra cheese and jalapenos.  Oh boy!

Treat yourself.  Excellent lunch or dinner and kids will love you for feeding them from Jersey Mike's.
