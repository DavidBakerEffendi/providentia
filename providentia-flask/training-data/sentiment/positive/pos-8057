This is a wonderful place to relax with friends. The atmosphere inside is dark and eclectic (definitely a locally owned, mom-n-pop establishment). 

Top notch brick oven pizza, super cheese plates, and a great wine selection (though only two Italian beers). Very affordable for Scottsdale. 

The outdoor patio is also charming, with fireplaces and quality furnishings.
