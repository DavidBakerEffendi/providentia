Updated to include dinner New Year's Eve at Gaetano's.   The Ossobuco was absolutely  fantastic.   Very tender, very flavorful and of course the marrow is the crowning glory.   Missed the traditional gremolata (garlic/parsley/lemon zest sprinkled over the shanks) but other than that it was perfect.  It was served over pasta, but again being the traditionalist when it comes to Ossobuco I asked for and got Risotto Milanese and it too was perfect.   Two others in my group ordered the same and they loved it.
I love that the owner always makes it a point to talk to the patrons and maybe josh with them a little.  He always makes himself visible and available and if you need anything, or make substituions he's there and ready to accomodate. Nice touch.
