Thanks to my certifiably insane desire to try everything on the planet at least once, we came here all the way from Florida to indulge.

The Chef was super helpful as we explored the menu and made our selections. I chose to go the non-spicy route and Chef kindly offered to customize to meet my needs. My wife decided to take the extra spicy route and the result, balanced perfectly!

Angry kimchee fries are now our new meal of choice. Getting some extra sauce for extra angriness was definitely a positive move. The sauce is so freaking good we got a small container to go! If only it was available bottled, we'd take it home on the plane and start a Buldogi fan club in Florida!

There were plenty of families there with young kiddies who enjoyed some of the dog statues / decor. The items were at perfect kiddo height so they were petting the pretend dogs and really enjoying themselves while their parents scarfed down demented kimchee bulgogi garlic bacon hot dog concoctions! 

We can't wait to return!
