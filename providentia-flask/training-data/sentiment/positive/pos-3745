I really enjoyed this place since it's quiet enough to spend your evening or have a business meeting. Haven't noticed any teenagers there and I believe that's a good enough reason to go. Food is fresh and bakery is good. I also like the idea that they used a transmitter, which allows them to bring food to ur table. Panera was smart to do that bc it avoid unnecessary lines. Prices are fair enough. They also have drive thru for busy people but I'm not sure how fast it takes to get your order there.
