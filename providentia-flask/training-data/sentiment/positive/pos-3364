While eating my scrumptuous grilled sausages, fried zucchini and potatoes, the owner decided to show off his professional singing skills to a couple of curious customers. His voice filled the entirety of the small, charming historical house in which the restaurant is venued with the melody of "I left my heart in San Francisco." I happened to be there with a San Franciscan who shall remain nameless because, though he will vehemently deny it, I saw a tear make its way down his face.
