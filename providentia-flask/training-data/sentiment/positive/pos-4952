I used to live in North Las Vegas and this was my go-to for my Korean fix. After moving out of NLV ... a year and a half later this is the ONLY restaurant that I find myself craving and wanting to drive to the north side for! My step-grandmother is Korean and I've been eating korean food since I was like 4! Kimchi since I was 5, so I say I would have a pretty good idea of what this kind of food should taste like. ITS SO GOOD! I usually get the two meat combo with Kalbi, bulgogi, rice, and double kimchi. The portions are too big for me to finish in one sitting, but trust and believe I'll eat the rest of it later! If you're debating on whether or not to go here, stop thinking about it and just go. I promise it'll be good(:
