Get ready for an experience of a lifetime. Before even trying Los Dos Molinos, I knew my exposure to Mexican cuisine was missing something truly spectacular. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to try Molinos, that I knew my intuition to be correct. This location draws you in even before you order. The décor and layout is unique. Outdoor seating provides private dining in an open space. Indoor décor draws you into Mexican heritage that gets so Americanized at other restaurants. 

When it comes time to order you have had your fill of the best tortilla chips and salsa your tongue could ask for. The salsa fills your mouth with multiple flavors of tomato, peppers, onion and a hint of lingering spice. The tortillas are obviously fresh, crisp and compliment the salsa perfectly.

Get ready for flavor in whatever you order. The majority of their dishes favor spice, but the waiter will give some recommendations to those with weaker stomachs. I LOVE their chimichangas with red sauce. The chicken is moist and the deep fried tortilla is flakey and delicious. Serving sizes are enough for two people, but I rarely share. Los Dos Molinos offers a typical Mexican dessert, sopapillas but I'm usually too stuffed to participate. 

This has now become the only true Mexican food I will eat. I recommend it to all my friends who visit from other states, or who live here and have a hankering for something truly authentic and full of flavor.
