The first thing you have to ask yourself is ... why would I review a place I didn't even patron!!!  Because just walking in blew my mind!  I walked in and I literally felt like I was visiting a bakery in Singapore again.  The pastries and cakes ... I drool.  I did get to taste the green bean (no, not green beans - green mung beans) pastry and that wasn't bad at all.  Flakey, light, and traditional mung bean.  Can I have a cake from here for my next birthday?
