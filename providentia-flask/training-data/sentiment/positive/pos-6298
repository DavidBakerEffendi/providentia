Love having more acai bowl choices in the area. If you haven't had one, it's basically an acai or Pitaya (fruit) smoothie base, topped with chopped fruit, seeds, granola, chia, honey. They also have smoothies, better for you than the chain smoothies (no turbinado sugar added). They have fresh vegetable/fruit juices. They menu is well laid out so it isn't confusing for newcomers.
