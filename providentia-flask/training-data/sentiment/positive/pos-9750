I hate Mill Ave because it's trendy and often overpriced for the college scene, but we happened to be down town and stopped for a quick beer or two and bite to eat.

The view upstairs on the patio is to die for.

Our server was SO WONDERFUL and friendly. If the staff reads these reviews, please give kudos to the tall southern boy who knows his beers! I wish I could remember his name. So sweet and on top of refills and he really knows how to read a table.

He pointed out so many things on the menus about the food, beer, specials, etc. he's what made us decide to order some appetizers and everything was hot and delicious.

We will be back because of his service first, but the great beers and appetizers also. We want to try happy hour next.
