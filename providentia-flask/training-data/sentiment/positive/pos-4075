Who doesn't love them some Chipotle?

Everything is good here, and portion sizes are huge--come hungry.  My personal favorite are the Burrito Bols which are a kind of salad-burrito hybrid.

The Cilantro lime rice they serve here would make any dish taste good.  Green tomatillo salsa is outstanding.

This place gets super crowded, so be ready to wait in line.
