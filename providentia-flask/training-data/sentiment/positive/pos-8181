So whenever I have had a hankering for sushi in the past, I always wound up in old town at Ra or Stingray...or one of the other 20 sushi joints within 10 feet of one another. That, and I always wound up paying an arm and a leg for sushi. Not so with Sakana! A good friend let me in on this place, as it is kind of hidden in a strip mall. Yelp helped me find it :) Anyhow, I  am a yellowtail sashimi kind of girl, and I must say that Sakana has great quality. I also found that the staff was very flexible- they even made my friend and I things that arent even on the menu. Amazing. That, is above and beyond the call of duty.
