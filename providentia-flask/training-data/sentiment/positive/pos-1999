Had lunch here for the first time. I wanted the Bison Burger but decided to play it safe with the Black and Bleu Burger. It was a good size burger with a healthy portion of fries and a delicious secret dipping sauce ssshhhhhh!!!!! The burger was juicy and I would definitely order it again. Something about Bleu Cheese on a burger that just makes me happy. From what I see in the pics, I can't wait to try the BBQ Bison Meatloaf. Service was on point, clean tables and overall nice ambiance. I'm Worth checking out again.
