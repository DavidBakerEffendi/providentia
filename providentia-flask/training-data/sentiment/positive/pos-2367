Today I tried the brisket stack for breakfast and it was so beyond awesome I'm still thinking about it hours later.  Smoky brisket on a crispy potato pancake topped with chipotle aioli, probably the best breakfast ever.  We also tried the stuffed french toast which was outstanding.

Please please please add the brisket stack to the regular breakfast menu!!!
