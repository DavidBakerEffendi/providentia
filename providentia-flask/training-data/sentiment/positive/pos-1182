Ahh keg you are my go to birthday dinner spot and you never disappoint!

We celebrated my boyfriend's 30th birthday by having a delicious dinner at the keg on adelaide. We only waited abt 10 minutes for a table on Friday night and I was impressed.... Toronto on a Friday night is never a 10 min wait!

We thoroughly enjoyed our dinners and drinks and dessert...gotta love that birthday billy pie.

Servers were excellent as usual and the food was outstanding...whatbmore can I say? Srsly get your a$$ over there :)

Con is the price but hey you can't eat good steak on a milk budget!
