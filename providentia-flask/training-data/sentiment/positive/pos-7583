Outstanding service and excellent food. On our 1st visit, we ordered Korean bbq sauce steak and curried salmon. The entrees were excellent. Due to large number of conference attendees, the entrees were slow to prepare. The server kept us informed of the challenge and even provided complimentary appetizer and dessert.
 On my second visit, I ordered organic green salad and stuffed French toast. I felt the organic greens were a bit too heavy on salt. French toast was sweet, tangy and savory; it melted in my mouth and was delicious. We were extremely pleased with the overall experience.
