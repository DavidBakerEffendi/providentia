If you told me that I was going to a Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian fusion restaurant for dinner, I would have thought that the food just wouldn't have worked and that it would have been a waste of my time. Just do me a favor and take that guy and hit him on the head.

This place works and they do a fantastic job on tying the cuisines together and finding commonality between them. They do a killer Miso Ramen that my daughter inhaled. Their sushi rolls are great too, they are smaller than what I've experienced at other places but that had them much lighter and easier to digest too. Also I'd recommend to give their Tuna Tataki a shot too.

Staff were beyond friendly and were eager to make sure we are return customers. We will be for sure the next time we are there.

Menu is pricey, but what place isn't in Vegas?
