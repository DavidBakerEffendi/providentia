OMG!!! I am totally in love with this place, we came here before a Suns game and surprisingly it wasn't slammed. We quickly got sat and had our drinks within minutes. This place was really cozy, I liked how the "sushi rollers" were right there in front of everyone rolling the sushi. We got some potstickers as appetizers, and ordered like 3 rolls. 1 was definitely Las Vegas, the sex and the city, and another one don't remember. They were all delicious!!!! Writing about it is making me crave it again, everything tasted fresh. We already had a lot of food on our table and the waitress brought us some sashimi on the house. Im not a big fan but I tried it and it was pretty good. I couldn't really understand what she was calling it by my nephew loved it and ate it all except the one I tried. I was surely impressed with the service and the food and will be back. Im willing to make the drive from the east valley for this chow.
