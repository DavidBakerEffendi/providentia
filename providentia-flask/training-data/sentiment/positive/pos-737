Very impressive for Greek and "food court food!" This place takes passion in their product and it shows every time, never a time where it's lacking. It's a bummer when places try to pass as "Mediterranean" or "Greek" and they're not. Kyklos is the real deal! The dolmathes are amazing; meat-filled and with lemon sauce. They don't have the usual gummy rice filling that's so tart it makes you gag. They also come warm at Kyklos, a plus! Rice pudding is something I always get and its worth it. Warm, seasoned perfectly and great size for the price. The best is that you know you are getting fresh, quality, and pretty healthy food at Kyklos. A must when I come to galleria mall, in fact I'd eat here before any of the restaurants.
