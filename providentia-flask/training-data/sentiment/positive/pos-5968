Love this demetres location. Great staff, great service !! We end up going once a month. It was my husband's birthday and they brought out a special plate along with our order and sang happy birthday. 
The order is always correct, on time & tastes sooo good!! 
Definitely recommend to everyone.
We always bring our guests from out of town and they absolutely love the variety!
