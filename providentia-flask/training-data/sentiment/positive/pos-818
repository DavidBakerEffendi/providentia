The hype is real! Everyone always talks about art of flavors in yelp talk about must try places in Vegas and I couldn't agree more.

The only gelato I've had is at Caesar's Palace so maybe I am no authority but this place is so good! 

I'm a die hard Luv It and Cold Stone fan but this definitely is my new favorite cold dessert place.

So they make all of their gelato in house. They have about 10-12 flavors at a time from what I can see. If you get a small you can pick one flavor. If you get a medium you can get up to two flavors. If you get the biggest I believe you can get 3. The prices I believe are $3.50, then about $5, and then maybe $6.50.

I got the caramel cookie which was a flavor of the day and half of the pistachio baklava.

I was so glad I did get that pistachio baklava.

Did I say pistachio baklava too much? 

The pistachio baklava changed my life.

The pistachio baklava is the pinnacle of frozen creamy desserts.

The pistachio baklava is a must try.

The pistachio baklava is so.. Creamy, perfectly sweet, rich, buttery, and mildly nutty.

Although the caramel one was good the awesomeness of the pistachio baklava was just making it taste .. Not memorable.

If you do, which I do suggest you go, I suggest you get one flavor to really appreciate it.

This place is really special.

My family & my niece especially loved it as well.

It was so busy I do suggest extra seating. That's the only thing I can say.

The price is really justified in the specialness of the product.

Oh & the staff is nice and helpful.
