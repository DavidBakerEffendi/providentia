We stopped by the bakery over in 701 E Western Ave, Avondale, AZ 85323. Cute bakery with some delicious cupcakes! Make sure you try the coconut and red velvet cupcakes. Those are my favorite picks. The cupcakes range from $3 to $4 a piece depending if the cupcakes are filled or not. A nice treat and a great local place. The staff was very friendly and even offered their favorites when we couldn't decide what to try.
