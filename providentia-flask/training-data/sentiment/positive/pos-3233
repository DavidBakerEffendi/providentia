Okay...OKay..This place is great! This comes from the stereotypical picky Korean snob. The ponchon tastes like Mom's. I don't care for the sour kimchi stuff but this is your fresh crisp kimchi. The combo plate with fried rice is Awesome and tastes right. The Korean food is right on and tastes like home. I love this place plus the owner is super friendly.
