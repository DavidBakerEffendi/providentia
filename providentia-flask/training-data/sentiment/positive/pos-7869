This has to easily be one of my top 4 restaurants in Las Vegas. 

It's an easy-ish location to get too. It's not so busy but good lord the food is off the wall. Oh. My. God. I don't know if it's just me but if you love, no not even, if you just as so much *like* Latin food (not Mexican) you will love this place. The gastronomy and offerings surprised my pant line that's for sure. I am going to go back to this place when I come back to LV even though I hateeee caesars palace just because the place is difficult to get through all the time. Highly recommend. 

It is South American/Peruvian/Asian fusion. Please have a few drinks for my until I can return .
