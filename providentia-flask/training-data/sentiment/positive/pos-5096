I had the pleasure of eating at Harumi for the first time last night. We were starving and craving sushi when we arrived around 7:00 (it was a Thursday) and were so sad that there was a line out of the door! We decided to go down the street for a couple of drinks and come back later, I'm so glad we did!  We came back around 8:45 and got a table right away. The service was AMAZING and the food was even better. We had a couple of rolls and a sashimi sampler, so fresh and so tasty! Chef Juno came out to greet us and gave us complimentary green tea ice cream and it was delightful! 
This is definitely  our new fave sushi spot!
