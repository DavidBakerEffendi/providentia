Chino Locos definitely deserves all five of these stars. The service is quick, to the point, and the portions are huge and delicious. I have NEVER been disappointed with a burrito from here. The only down-side to this place was that it isn't very accessible, so getting up the front steps was tricky with a stroller (but one of the guys behind the counter helped me out). I have yet to try the noodles, but I'll get there. There's also a tiny parking lot at the side of the building, which makes pick-up a breeze.
