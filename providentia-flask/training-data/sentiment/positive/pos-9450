This is one of my favourite desert places! You can choose from plenty of options. 

My personal favourite drink is the Machiatto with Belgian Milk Chocolate, definitely must try this! I also like DIY (do it yourself) option which allows me to choose between a wafflee or a crepe, my favourite scoop of ice cream and toppings. 

The price is decent as the portions are big. Although, I don't like sharing my dessert, the portion is enough for two, especially if you go with the waffle option.
