Despite the price of our suite during Shot Show 2011, The Venetian was worth it.  They totally delivered in luxury, no hidden fees, friendliness of staff, and efficiency making up the room each morning.  They have completely won over my future business and pleasure on The Strip.  The hotel is beautiful, the suites spacious and beyond comfortable.  700 square feet and this is the tiny suite?  That's bigger than my first apartment.  

The Venetian was everything I hoped the Bellagio would be when we stayed there last year.  Bellagio failed, but The Venetian totally delivered.  Watch rates, and if you can get there during a non-peak period, it is worth every penny you will spend over nearby properties.  Promise.
