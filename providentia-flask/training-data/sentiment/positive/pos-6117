It's our second time coming here and we will keep coming.

We started with the chicken Tum yum and chicken egg roll. Both were perfect in flavor, level of spice.

The main course we ordered was the pad thai and panang curry.  Both again were perfect! 

Not only is the food good but the service is amazing.  Oh yeah try the homemade ice cream.
