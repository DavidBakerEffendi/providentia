Oh I love the seafood buffet at the Rio, this is definately on my must go list whenever I travel to Vegas, it is all worth the $40 you pay to get your fill of all you can eat crablegs.  Last time I was there all I ate was the crab and prime rib!

I was in a major coma status after I was done eating here!
