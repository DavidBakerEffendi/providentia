A friend and I were looking for a spot to eat lunch at when I saw JoJo's Truck parked in Barbeque's Galore Parking lot. We had the brisket and it was a great with sliced chunks of tasty meat. It had just the right amount of sauce on it for me. The jalapeno fries were freshly made with fresh chopped peppers with the seeds removed to reduce the heat and to give just the right amount of flavor to the fries. Next time I will ask for more fresh chopped jalapeno to be added to them, as they were so darn good. The coleslaw is nice and spicy with just the amount of vinegar in it. You can tell that she spent some time in Memphis studying how they did things and she does a great job of bringing those flavors here to Calgary
