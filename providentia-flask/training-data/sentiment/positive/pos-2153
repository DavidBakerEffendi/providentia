I am a regular at Saigon Kitchen. The staff is awesome and the food is probably hands down the best I've ever experienced in a Vietnamese restaurants. The atmosphere is awesome. The place has a great style. I've introduced my family to Saigon Kitchen and my dad looks like he will become a regular as well. 

I was a fan of Pho and spring rolls, but this place steps up from the level of food I'm use to. Everything is fresh. I use to eat spring rolls and pho, until the owner encouraged me to try more. I've had many things on the menu and never one bad experience with the food. I sit down, order a iced green tea and let them surprise me. I've got that much trust in the staff. 

I will continue to be a regular and recommend others to try it too. Local business need support and this one goes above in beyond to earn loyalty.
