I went to this place within days of hearing about it from an in-law who had just started working there and we just loved it--so much that I went back there with my brother when he came to town (he liked it too) and with my picky daughter who is, unlike her mother, hesitant to try new and exotic foods, and anybody else I could get to go there with me.  They even gave me the "family discount" without my even asking for one and let my relative take time to sit down and chat with us when she had a chance.  The owners treated us like we were THEIR family. And they brought over some unsolicited complimentary appetizers just so we could try more things!  My daughter loved the Anise Pho Beef Soup so much she got it both times.  My mother had the veggie crepe and it was more than she could eat.  In fact we had so many leftovers we made an entire meal out of them the next day!    I can't wait to return to Chandler and go to this place again.
