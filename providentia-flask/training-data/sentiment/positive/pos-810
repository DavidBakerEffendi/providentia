So fresh so good! I must say this is one of the freshest hot pot places I been to. The ingredients are so fresh. You get what you pay for because their quality is just on top. It's not ayce but you order by plate. We split everything amongst 6 people so it worked out to about $45 each person and we got a bit of everything. I would choose the bigger pot next if you plan on have two types of broth because it just ends up overflowing when you put everything in. Service is your usual at an asian resto, most of them can't speak english properly so you have to ask them for things at least twice but you don't come here for service. Overall, it was delicious and would definitely come back again for my next hotpot craving.
