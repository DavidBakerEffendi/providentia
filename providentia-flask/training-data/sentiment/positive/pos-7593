The fiery BBFF took me here for a day early birthday lunch for her first visit and another one for me and I was excited af to return.  A nice lunch during work, can be like a little hour+ vacation if things work out right, this was one of those lunches!  Quick Recap

Service: Our server Adrian was fantastic.  She checked on us frequently and arranged for a special birthday dessert at the end which I completely appreciated.  David the GM introduced himself and ensured everything was great.  The Chef Mike stopped by as well to say hi and I'm glad he did so I can tell him in person how bomb his dishes were.

Food: Here's the new dishes I tried this visit...

Empanadas - Fantastic.  I don't want to discount the filling, but the pastry dough really made this great and distinguished it from other great empanadas I've had.  Best empanadas I've had in awhile and is now a must order with every future visit.

Marinated Skirt Steak - Skirt steak with herb chimichurri was great.  I ordered it medium and it was perfect but the chimichurri sauce really took it to the next level.  The creamy huanca√¨na sauce also took the shoestring fries up.  It's one thing to get the food cooked/prepared right, but to enhance the taste with the accompanying sauces is the expectation that was met today, great stuff.

Another shout out to the Corn (tracer round) Lollipops, always my favorite, always going to order them.  The BBFF couldn't finish hers, I helped take it down.  That's what I do.  It's just my time, it's just my time..

Summary:  Service has always been consistently great from my visits.  Brief, friendly conversation seems to be struck with everyone who visits the table and it was great meeting David and Mike.  The new dishes I tried this time around were great and was exactly the high quality dishes to be expected from a restaurant like Chica.  Hitting up the Chica Burger or Cubano next visit, stay tuned. =)
