I don't see what people complain about here. If i wanted bistro style, high quality expensive food I would go to Rosewood. 

I go to the happy moose because the prices are good, the servers are pleasant and the alcohol is great. My only issue would be to tell management to hurry up on that Sunday liquor license. I wanted to go cocktail crazy but had to stick with beer!
