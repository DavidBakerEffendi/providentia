Only my second time here and both experiences were on point. 

The stuffed French toast is amazing. The mimosas are delicious. Breakfast burrito with the Siracha sauce is extremely good. 

The atmosphere is very laid back with couch seating if you prefer. Very relaxing atmosphere. 

They have $3 mimosas on Sunday's with Live music. And the best part is for every sandwich sold they donate a sandwich to a local non profit. 

I will be back.
