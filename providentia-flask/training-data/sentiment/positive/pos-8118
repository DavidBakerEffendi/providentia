When we walked in the music was awesome and fun, the owner Bob came and sat us at a table , walked us through what to order... they were making specialty omelets and they were incredible. You have got to try the hob nob cheesy breakfast potatoes and they have an amazing picture of President Roosevelt's Rough Riders Association and all of the signatures of all the men so great piece of Phoenix history. The staff is kind and the food is off the chain. Gotta try this out if you're in town.
