This place is a hidden gem. We ordered the cauliflower spinach dip which was a superb start to our meal. I got the mushroom melt which had an exquisite array of tastes to it. My friend got the Mediterranean Mac n cheese and the coconut curry soup which was lit.  

The atmosphere was perfect as well. The lighting was great, the music was on point and not too loud, and the servers were great. 

This was my second time here and will definitely be back at some point.
