Excellent pizza! I tried the new Mu-shu bbq duck pizza and was blown away! Super delicious thin crust with sweet sauce. I tried a few different red wines and had a slice of my friend's siciliana, also good. The evening was paired off with a dixie cup of vanilla bean gelato! Molto bene!

Such a cool environment & unique pizzeria concept. I could have just hung out there for hours in this neighborhood spot. Great, attentive service as well.

I love this place and can see why everyone's been raving about it! Can't wait to try the one in the city.
