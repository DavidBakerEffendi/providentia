I LOVEEE this bar & grill. Me and my boyfriend at the time were huge regulars there for the past 2 years, although from time to time I enjoy coming back. The bartenders are all amazing, fast paced and on top of their game. They make great food suggestions and their tap selection is good. 

You couldn't ask for a better restaurant that caters to everyone's needs. if you want the divey bar feel, they have a great bar set up with new TV's stationed, Megatouch play, pool and darts, and a race horse gambling area. If you're looking just to dine with a candlelit dinner, they have a quiet section in the restaurant and around the bar as well.
