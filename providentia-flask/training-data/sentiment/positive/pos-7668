I am shocked this place doesn't have better reviews??? 
This place is the best Italian food in Charlotte. I moved here from Philadelphia and have gone to plenty of the best Italian restaurants in Philly, as well as NYC. Dolce is authentic and delicious. And the owner is Italian!! (Sweet lady) 
I have been here several times and always get something different. It is always great. I Highly recommend.
