When I moved to Madison I was shocked at how truly awful the downtown pizza was. Ian's, Pizza de Roma, and Glass Nickel are all bland, uninspiring options. Then I discovered places like Pizza Brutta and Porta Alba that made high quality pizza. Unfortunately, this was "authentic Italian pizza," which I like, but which doesn't really do it for me-- the kind of place where people praise them for not putting too many toppings on the pie. I was still on the lookout for a place where the pizza was decadent and cheesy but also high quality. 

Then we moved to the east side and I found two places that fit the bill: Grampa's and Sal's. 

Sal's makes a fantastic pizza. My go-to option is the Forza: ricotta cheese, pepperoni, roasted garlic, and chilis (I get it without the tomatoes).  It's everything I could possibly ask for: salty, greasy, decadent and creamy. I'd give them 6 stars for that pizza alone. 

I'm less of a fan of their standard options-- too much sauce, not enough cheese, and I thought that the forestiere (sp?) was disappointing-- a little one note. 

Other small complaints:
-no delivery and not always easy to park 
-the space is small and poorly ventilated 
- it's a little pricy. 

Nonetheless, this easily gets 4 stars-- 4.5 really-- based on the Forza alone. Nice job, Sal's. 

Edit: I had a chance to try a few new pies at an event this week. After one bite of the jalapeño assadero (sp?) I knew I'd be coming back soon. Soon turned out to be the next night. This pizza turned out to be even better than the Forza. The key here is the combination of chorizo AND carnitas. They blend perfectly with the spicy jalapeño pesto. If it were just chorizo the pizza would be salty and one-note, but the carnitas gives it a nice earthy undertone. This place makes two of the best pizzas I've ever had. If that doesn't deserve five stars, I don't know what does.
