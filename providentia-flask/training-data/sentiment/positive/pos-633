If could give seven stars, I would! 

Start out with the service. Channon was AMAZING! Warm, welcoming and from start to finish was an All-Star server. 

The food: the food is out of this world. I wouldn't believe this is a chain if I didn't KNOW it was a chain. Everything from scratch and it shows. Delishness? Off the charts...! The pace of the food coming out was perfect, just as we were finishing our apps, food was arriving, beyond impressed. You MUST try this place!!!!

Best place to eat in Town Square.
