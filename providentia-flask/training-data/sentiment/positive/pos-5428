Very cozy little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in downtown Chandler.  The closest cross streets for Yoli's are S Wall St. and Chicago, and visitors coming here for the first time may have a hard time finding it if they don't routinely shop in the little artisan craft plaza the restaurant is in.  Once you enter, you are greeted warmly by one of the family members.  We had brunch here, and left pleasantly full and satisfied.  

The meals are a very good price for the portions given.  I was especially impressed with the carne asada burrito ($6).  The burrito was gigantic, encompassing the whole plate, with a side of delicious freshly made salsa and some sour cream.  The tortilla was grilled which gave a nice added texture to the meal.  They have a "choose your own breakfast" option which I tried ($6.50), which comes with 2 eggs, and then 3 different breakfast selections (such as French toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, different breakfast potatoes).  Everything was prepared fresh, tasted very good, and a nice option I found was that they had sugar-free syrup for those that didn't want regular syrup.  They also have pretty good coffee ($1.75), both hot and iced.  It is smooth and rich, no hint of bitterness.  

If it weren't for yelp I probably would not have even known about Yoli's, but thanks to the wonder that is the internet I now have a good breakfast spot to go to when I want to start my day off right.
