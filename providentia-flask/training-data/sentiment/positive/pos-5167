$1 tacos? Don't mind if I do. Found a hightop table during happy hour before it started to pick up. The general dining area was about full except for about 3 or 4 larger tables. Our waiter was easily the most pleasant one I've had since I could remember and the tacos were amazing! Free chips and salsa are always a bonus. Mondays $3 margaritas are a crowd pleaser too. Patron is the place to be for tacos on Mondays!
