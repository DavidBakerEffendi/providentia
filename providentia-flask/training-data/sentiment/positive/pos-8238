Thin crepe cooked evenly, slightly sweet batter. Spread on some nutella scoop of rocky road ice cream, now add some strawberries, blueberries, and banana's. next comes some chocolate sauce drizzled on top, whip cream and a cherry.  Now that's a tasty crepe! 

Very good, generous portion, friendly staff.
