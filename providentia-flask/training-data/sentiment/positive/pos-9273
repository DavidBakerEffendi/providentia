Food is super killer here. My fav (since I'm not a beef eater): Fish Jun! But, based on other friend-made recommendations, you are probably still good trying either Jun; it's just so good!  I love the fact that they serve boiled peanuts when you dine-in too.  It reminds me of back home in Hawaii when boiled peanut was eaten so frequently that it was pretty much a staple already.


Hawaii-style Korean grubs done right.  Chill vibe, good grubs, and the ever present aloha-style hospitality.  Always a treat!  Mahalos guys!!
