I'm speed-walking along Dundas with my main squeeze to go run bureaucratic errands. We start to get a little bit snippy about orders of operations, figuring out if we have all the paperwork we need, if we're running late (we are) and whose fault that is (his). 

This bickering isn't like us. What in the world? Oh shit. We're just hangry! 

We are heading east and then boom! Hello 707 Dundas market stalls! We stop at the very first one, Trinidad & Toronto Roti. At this point, being more late is totally fine as long as we can devour this beautifully seasoned, moist but not sloppy goat roti! $9 and it was enough for two! When I'm on this block again, I know I should try one of the other stalls but damn, it'll be hard not to just return to T&T for the exact same order. 

When she handed us our absolutely-needed-to-prevent-domestic-abuse snack she told us we were "A good couple. Always laughing." And you know what, as long as I'm constantly full, we really are.
