We discovered this restaurant on my Yelp app after looking for a new place for lunch in the Summerlin area.  I loved the shabby chic vintage look of the place and the very friendly waiters.  This place has almost a romantic feel to it and it's a very nice change from everything else in this city.  

Hubby and I ordered a couple of flat breads and the burger.  They all were delicious and we gave our best to eat slow and enjoy.  

Living in North Las Vegas, I'm sad that all the nice places are so far away from us.  But we will definitely keep this place in mind for next time we make a day trip to Summerlin.
