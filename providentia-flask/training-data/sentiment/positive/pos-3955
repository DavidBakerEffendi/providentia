Pizzeria Bianco is widely acknowledged as some of the best Pizza (or The Best to some reivewers) in the nation. Not sure what I can add except to say it was terrific!  The Princess and I went to his second location in the Town and Country shopping center (Biltmore area) and walked right in at 5 PM.  The location is wonderful, setting is nice looking out onto the courtyard and it appears there are tables you can use if the weather is not 110 as it was during our visit.  We ordered a nice Italian red wine for The P and I had a negroni, both were fantastic.  The meal started with a small complimentary bowl of five small kalmata olives and  a few slices of their in-house bread with a bowl of olive oil, nice touch.  I ordered their famous wise guy and The P ordered the sonny boy. The wise guy is white sauced based with wonderful fennel sausage from Shrieners (local meat co.) fennel, roasted onions. Wood fired, the Pizza was excellent.  However, I actually enjoyed the sonny boy more.  It was red sauce based with soppresseta and it was, IMHO, one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  We finished the meal with flourless chocolate cake, very good with a vanilla sauce.  Service was delightful, server was attentive without being in our face.  Loved the small touches such as real silverware (Oneida).  Attention to detail has made Mr. Bianco a success and I'm humbled to be able to join the chorus of people who sing his and his restaurants praises!  Slainte!
