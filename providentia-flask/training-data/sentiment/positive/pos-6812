Not really sure what happened since my last visit,  but wow was it great! 

The food was cooked perfectly and all of us left full.  The green chili was so great I sat there looking up recipes for when I get home to make it!

Phenomenal fresh salsa... Perfectly cooked pulled pork,  and the mooseadilla was awesome as well! 

Wait staff was great and right on with service,  drink  refills,  etc. 

We will definitely be back again and that is a promise!
