We met friends here for a "Beer & Banter" dinner (1 dinner of a 3 series of 5 course set menu meals paired with different breweries). The entire experience was amazing. 

The food was wonderful, portions were just the right amount, and we enjoyed both hearing the Lumberyard Brewery owners and rep speak about the different beers and also hearing the Sous Chef and his assistant speak about the food and pairings (Fox RC definitely hires chefs who can speak to large crowds, not all chefs, from my experience, are capable of such). The chefs were excited to be able to "go off menu" for the pairings and were excited to share their thought process. 

Jaime seemed to be the manager in charge of the event and he made the whole experience very fun, laid back & welcoming. This was the third dinner of their summer series (we missed the other two unfortunately) but I am excited to see what other events AB comes up with in the future - I'll be there. I am also looking forward to visiting the restaurant to experience their normal dining menu. We will be back!
