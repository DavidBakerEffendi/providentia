This may have been the best hotel I walked through while in Vegas. The structure was gorgeous, they have gondola rides outside and madam toussauds is attached! So many of my favorite things. The actualy structure of the building is beautiful and tries to represent Venice as best as it can with the miles of casinos. 

If/when I go back to Vegas, I would love to stay here and give it a shot.
