OK, its in a strip mall....but what isnt?  I absolutely love this place for Indian food. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. The madras chicken melts in your mouth! We seriously lapped up every bit of the gravy with our naan. This wasn't the only dish that was fantastic. Everything was very good. Definitely one of the best places for Indian food in the valley (east and west).
