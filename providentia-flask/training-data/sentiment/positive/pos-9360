Bartenders like family.  Obviously I eat at the bar often.  The happy hour is great, but I always get about 3 of the same dishes now that I have tried almost everything on the menu.  The cobb salad, sweet potatoes, bone-in ribeye, southwestern style shrimp w/ extra corn bread and the crab are all a must!
