I'm a big fan of this place. The food is very good. First off, the Pho is solid. The broth is a bit sweeter than I am used to but that doesn't take away from how good it is. The meat is higher quality than the other Pho places in Surprise. The bowl was decently sized and filled with meat and noodles. I've also tried the Vietnamese curry and it is fantastic but comes in a very small bowl. I just wish there was more! Anyhow, I would definitely go here more often but it is a few dollars more than the other places. 

I've been here twice in uniform and both times the owner thanked me for my service and hooked us up with a free appetizer. The service is excellent and the waiters/waitresses are on top of their game. 

The restaurant is very nice inside with a more upscale look and feel. Also, it is very clean.
