From the minute I walked in the door and was greeted by the owner Brian Okin...I KNEW this was going to be a culinary experience I wouldn't soon forget. First they had one of my favorite Malbec's, Luigi Bosca. Our server Greg popped the cork and life filled the bottle while Luigi took a big breath and I took a big drink...AHHH, heaven. Taste buds awake I was ready for the feast about to dance across my taste buds. Starting with the Rueben Ribs that melted in my mouth, the tasty thousand island slaw they were served on was a fitting bed for them to rest. The CC Wedge salad arrived, Gouda crema, pickled butternut squash, apple, candied walnut, cider vinaigrette...a feast of flavors perfectly matched. Now eagerly anticipating the main show it arrived with fanfare... PERFECTLY seared scallops served atop a scrumptious warm acorn squash cassoulet resting on a cool bed of Cork and Cleavers house made apple butter. Not once was I sorry I was eating in a strip center, not once did I second guess my choices and I made a promise to myself...be sure to get back there quickly...AFTER Cleveland's winter thaw in the spring. I'm anxious to see what spring brings to this farm to table restaurant. Do yourself a favor, go to Cork and Cleaver if you're even CLOSE to the place...and make a reservation in advance!
