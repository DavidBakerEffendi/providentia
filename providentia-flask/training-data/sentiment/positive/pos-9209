This is probably one of my favorite burger joints in Las Vegas. They started as a food truck and I've been supporting them for years probably since 2011. 

What brings me back is their number #2 Tamago burger. I love how thick their burgers and the juiciness and perfectly medium cooked patty. I have tried everything on their menu and their specialties. 

My favorite is their Tamago and their Loco Moco. It's just something about that fried egg that makes my meal taste great. 

Their burgers are really unique and probably my 3rd favorite is the Katsu burger. Burgers always go well with fries and I love their special "crack" sauce. I always ask for a couple extra on the side because it's that good.

By far this is my favorite location in Chinatown because their other mortal spots they had the parking was so far and it is always hard to get around on the strip. 

This restaurant feels I guess you can say a comfortable atmosphere and while you're waiting for your food or eating they have classic board games to play. Friends and I were playing UNO and oh this location serves alcohol! 

The servers and cooks are really cool and I've became friends with a few of them. After you order they ask for a funny nickname and it's always fun to use unique silly names so when your order is ready you will definitely know it's yours instead of a boring number.

Thanks Colin and workers! Keep up the awesome work
