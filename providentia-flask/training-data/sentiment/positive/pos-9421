I visited here with a group of 20 people, as part of a Karma International event.

Wow.  So much fun.  Such an amazing experience. It was made even more fun by having such a group of friends. Enjoying the delicious food and drink, and the entire experiential aspect of the dinner, was really really enjoyable, even if you couldn't see me smiling in the dark. :-D

The check-in process required us to sign a waiver and have a short briefing talk.  Then we were led past a couple of curtains and turns, conga line style, to our table.  Sitting down was a challenge when you can't see the people next to you, the chair, or the table, but one that was easily overcome, especially since it's something you've done a few times, likely. 

The dishes are not described but are different textures and flavors.  When you're deprived of vision, your other senses are enhanced, and you can curiously consider the scents and tastes before you.  What I liked about all six courses was that the textures were very different and unique.  And very clever in regards to some courses. 

The table I was at had only one wine glass spilled, and lots of laughter and guessing.  We joked and teased each other, and had great conversations. 

When we were done, we compared notes, talked about favorites, and led each other back into the light.  

One note bears emphasizing: The service was absolutely fantastic.  The highest level of service here, with helpful hints for how to eat certain dishes, what to expect from what was on the plate you couldn't see, and refills on water and drinks.  They referred to us by name, which was impressive.  

I think this is highly recommended. I can't wait to come back and I hope I do soon.  Really a must try, well done experience for all the senses except for one.
