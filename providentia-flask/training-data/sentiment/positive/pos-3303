Hot new business!!! Breakfast and lunch served with style and taste. Open from 9am to 5pm, Served is doing it right.

Located in the shopping center off Horizon Ridge just west of Valle Verde. When you enter turn left and go past Siems Eye Clinic. If you turn right you will find Kitchen Table and Shabu Shabu Paradise. Its a little hard to find as there isn't much signage pointing you in the right direction. So remember...LEFT LEFT LEFT. Right?

Menu is pretty extensive, offering treats like Galbi (Korean BBQ short ribs), Burgers (like Miso Pork Belly Burger), Salads, Sandwiches, and breakfast items. Everything is hand made.
I opted for the Pork Belly Benedict with Thai Chili Hollandaise (hold the Thai Chili though) and it was no problem since the hollandaise was freshly made. Served with a helping of fried potatoes that were crispy just the way I like them. This meal was delicious. The pork belly is marinated and cut thick, served on top of a nice bread, eggs cooked perfectly so just a little runny. The more I ate, the better the dish tasted. I can't wait to come back and try the variety of offerings. This is good food!!!!!!

Prices are nice, service was very good. At 11am on a Tuesday it wasn't very crowded, only like 3 tables out of the possible 12 or so. Nicely decorated. 

I highly recommend coming here. Kitchen Table gets crowded, and the food is great there, but now you have another option that will make you feel just as good in this shopping area, maybe even better! Its going to be a tough choice to turn right or LEFT into the shopping area, but like my politics I might lean a little to the left.
