As expected, it was crowded with other Sunday morning patrons looking to have breakfast. We were seated at our table relatively quickly. Nothing fancy, small restaurant but the food was great and very filling. Large portions, I was only able to eat 1 of the 2 very large protein pancakes, they were delicious!
