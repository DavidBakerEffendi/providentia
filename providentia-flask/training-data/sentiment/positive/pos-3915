My man says service is not perfect,
but I think its just fine, all is forgiven bc of the wonderful food.

I really like the tempura zyaru soba.
I don't think I had up to standard zyaru soba in AZ before till I found this place.
The chicken skewers are really good here too.

The tempura is really fresh (Fried prawn and veggies), 

Curry Udon was so and so but I have been spoiled by my own recipies.

Gotta warn you that this place alwasy looks closed, so don't get fooled by the appearance. Always tug on the door before you head back to another eatery : ).
