YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(151/365) "La Reina De La Gelateria"

10 months later and still maintaining a 5 star average is not an easy task by any means. The dedication and drive That Desyree and her family posses is unmatched.
Day in, day out serving some of the best sweets in town six days a week showing no signs of slowing down, the quality, creativity and consistency is what keeps people constantly coming back and making them die hard fans in the process.

I am also a big fan of Desyree's approach to push the envelope and think outside the box of your usual, safe, and familiar flavors-Smoked Salmon?,Tomato-Basil? Pear-Gorgonzola?, Foie Gras? Brie and Bacon Marmalade? All unconventional, and all bomb.com. I'm always gonna remember the first three flavors I was hooked on(Fiori Di Latte, Sweet Corn, and White Coffee Bean, but having tried just about every flavor she's ever put out since day one, my new favorites would have to be the Foie, Cabernet Raspberry, Cookie Butter, and Yuzu Blueberry, with every other flavor not far behind.

The" adult line" of flavors is also killer too.(Sorry kids!) Bailey's Irish Cream, Cabernet Raspberry, Strawberry Margarita(Man was that good!) How's about throwing some whipped cream vodka into your Killer Arancia Sorbet for a Creamsicle for adults? Or even a Moscow Mule Sorbet? Hint hint..;) The Vegas summer heat is finally here and its the perfect time to hit up art of flavors if you haven't already...GO NOW!!!   ALOHA!!!!
