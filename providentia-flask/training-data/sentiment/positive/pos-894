Another highlight of my trip.

There is nothing more refreshing then to catch one of the numerous fountain shows here at the Bellagio. These things are ginormous.  The sound of the water shooting up in the air surely resembles the sound of thunder striking ten feet away.  The peak of the water seems to clear 40 or 50 stories high without effort.

For a free show of immense size, this is the best free show at Vegas, hands down.


Cheers
