This is by far our favourite neighbourhood pizza place - it's really quick, inexpensive, and I don't know what it is about it, but it's really scrumptious. This is thicker crust pizza (it's bready - but not in a bad away), lots of cheese and toppings; it kind of reminds me of the pizza I used to eat as a kid. The place is nothing fancy, there is take out and delivery only, and it's a really good value for pizza we consistently enjoy. My recommendation: meat lover's (with a generous helping of chilli flakes). YUM!
