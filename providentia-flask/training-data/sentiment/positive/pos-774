My vacation to Toronto provided some amazing culinary treats over the week we we there.... Odd Seoul was one of the very best, amongst many greats! Maybe I'm a bit biased, as the Lower Ossington neighborhood reminds me very much of my own neighborhood back home, but the vibe is just right while the look and feel of the bar are warm and inviting, while also conveying the proper confidence that you just know you're going to get a really good cocktail there.  We tried several of the craft cocktails - including the Bulleit Smash and the Odd Fashioned - and nothing disappointed! Same for the menu, which is limited in quantity, not in quality! I swear, they could double the number of items and I'd still have eaten them all! Particularly, their steam buns, Bulgogi Cheesesteak and Tempura Prawns were incredible. As a bartender, I always like to get to know the staff, management and owners of the places I visit, particularly when I really like the place, and I did have the fortune of meeting Leeto, who owns Odd Seoul with his brother Leemo, and I must say I wish nothing but many years of success for you both (if you're reading this) and we will be back!!!
