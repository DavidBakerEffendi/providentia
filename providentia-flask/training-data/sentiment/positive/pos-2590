This is by far the best Mexican food I've had in years! I have been searching for the best asada for a long time and this place even beats Tacos el Gordo. The owner Ben is very friendly and has great customer service. He knew all about my keto diet and created a "burrito" bowl special for me. He even offered a free drink while I waited for my freshly made food! I ordered the Jefe burrito bowl with added cheese which was so filling I could only eat half! My husband ordered the asada burrito and Ben added beans and rice at no extra charge! My brother got a grilled chicken taco salad. The shrimp, chicken and steak were perfectly seasoned and grilled without all those weird fatty chunks most Mexican restaurants have. They really care about your whole experience here...don't be fooled by the gas station, the best places are always hidden like that! Next time I want to try one of their breakfast burrito bowls! I will be back regularly for sure.
