This is hands-down the best frozen yogurt place I've ever been to. The yogurt flavors aren't too tart and they have a really great taste; they're also organic. The staff is super friendly, there's an abundance of toppings, the store is kept very clean, and they give a discount to police officers. This was a great place to stumble upon.
