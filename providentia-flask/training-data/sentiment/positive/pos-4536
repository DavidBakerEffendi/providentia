I was almost put off by the negative reviews and the  outside appearance.... but holy cannoli!!! SO IMPRESSED. SO DELICIOUS. We had it delivered, so I cannot comment on the service, but it was so good that they could have punched me in the face and I'd still go back. If you're on the edge about eating/ordering from here like I was, DO IT!!
