I love Makers and Finders. I was so excited that they opened one in downtown summerlin, so now it's super close to me. My mom and I went here yesterday, I got the Nutella latte and my mom a non fat latte. They both were amazing! I could eat their food everyday too, the empanadas are my all time favorite meal. I will definitely be back. The service is great, the restaurant itself is so clean and well designed!
