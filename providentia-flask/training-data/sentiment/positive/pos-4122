This is sort of out of range for Pittsburgh people but best pierogies I've ever had in my life. I've only had pierogies at Fuel and Fuddle in Oakland but these pierogies tasted so real. They're definitely handmade and homemade. You can taste each folded crease and it's not something you just heat up from a frozen package. There are a variety of fillings than just potatoes. We got ones with cottage cheese and chives filling and potato and cheese filling. I personally liked the potato and cheese filling more but the cottage cheese and chives filling was delicious too. 

Pierogies Plus seems like a pretty well known place in that area since there was never a time without a line of people waiting to order or grab their food. There's only a couple outdoor seating because the location actually used to be a gas station. So the inside is only the kitchen and ordering place. Also parking space isn't too big. 

Definitely worth driving here to get the most authentic, homemade pierogies!
