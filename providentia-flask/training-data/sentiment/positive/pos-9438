Isn't it great to find someplace new that you just know you will have a craving for in the future? This is such a place. So different - so good. I just went there for my first lunch. I had the Chizu ramen with spicy ground pork. It's delicious! Just right - one step from the ledge on the edge of being too spicy. It comes in an bowl. I used a fork but many use chopsticks. It comes separated in the bowl like a cob salad. You mix it together and then dive in.

So good. Large enough portion to feed me for lunch (and I'm 210 lbs). Afterwards all I wanted was a nap.

I'm already craving my next visit. Now is the hard part, do I get the same exact thing or venture around the menu? Expect to pay about $18 for lunch with tip and water to drink.

I see where they also have soshimi - that would be a great dinner to have that as an app.

All good.
