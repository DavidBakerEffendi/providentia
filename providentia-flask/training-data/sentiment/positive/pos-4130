What a find. I've driven past this place 25 times and wondered if it was any good. It definitely is VERY good. We had sushi, lobster deviled eggs, a fantastic cheeseburger, and more. Even the pickiest eater can find something delicious on the menu, and the wait staff are INCREDIBLE. I'm headed back there this afternoon for happy hour!
