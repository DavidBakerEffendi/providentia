I'll be the first to say, Azuma isn't the place to go if you're looking for any kind of advancement in avant-guard sushi with your foie gras and nitro sauces with rice paper wrapper served on a flip-flop cos it'd be ironic. The chef has been doing this for the past 30 years and this is the place you want to go to for good, traditional sushi. Azuma is a family run business with mom in the kitchen and the daughter up front. Like a five year old telling you that you're ugly, this sushi is about as honest as it gets. Please note that there was no fruit mentioned in any of the maki rolls the chef picked for us... take that as a GOOD thing.
