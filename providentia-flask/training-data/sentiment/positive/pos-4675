Cantina Laredo is so much fun! 
I enjoyed dining here not only because the menu sounded muy delicioso, not only because we had a gift card, it was because we are always served STELLAR service! 
For appetizers we split the Queso Laredo
With taco meat and pico de gallo to compliment the chips and salsa on the house. 
I ordered for my entree the Chimichanga de Pollo high is a fried flour tortilla filled with fajita chicken, poblano pepper, cheese and topped with chili con queso because.. YOLO!! 
For dessert.... my second time devouring this beautiful masterpiece was the Mexican apple pie!!
It comes out sizzling on a HOTTER than hell fajita plate half uncooked in Mexican brandy butter, with cinnamon ice cream. *droooool*
Every. Single. Bite. Eaten.
We would have licked the plate but.. like I said before, it was hotter than hell!
The waitress and I hit it off so well and I complimented her haircut/color she was so beyond sweet she returned with the name and phone number of her hairdresser for me! **awwwwwww**
I love it here, ready to move in!
