When my friend said he wanted to go to Sparklings late nite, I thought for sure we were going to a tittie bar and I was in for something dirty.  However, it is the exact opposite... 5 stars in every way.  The decor is elegant, the drink selection is spot on, and the service was tip top.  We chopped the chicken parm and a filet.  The chicken parm was fresh and the steak is easily the best suburban option past midnight.  My wife loved the cheesecake I got to go so it was clearly a success.  I'm sure I will find myself here again soon.
