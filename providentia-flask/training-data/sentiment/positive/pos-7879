First time here and I have to say.... I'm impressed. I keep forgetting that there is another restaurant on Sperry. My friend wanted to take me to dinner and suggested here. So I said sure... why not. The place was clean, tables were awesome, staff was great. Sat at our table and our waitress was super nice. Always came and checked on us. Made sure our drinks were full. 
I ordered grilled chicken fingers. They were sooo tender! I was really impressed. Juicy and not greasy. I got the fries with it and they were bomb! Cooked perfect. Not soggy and not burnt. We had the buffalo chicken dip for appetizer and .... I wish I could have just ate it with a spoon! Best buffalo chicken dip I've ever had! And it's a nice size portion too. We didn't have to wait long for our check either. It was kinda quiet for a Sunday. But it was also early. And like I said, I forgot about this place. Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!! Super impressed.
