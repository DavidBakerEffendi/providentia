Ah man, I had no idea about this place until a friend and I were craving some pizza and she suggested it. We popped over one weekday evening for some vegan pie. Now, I am a buffalo chicken *loverrrrrr* but recently have been trying to pursue a vegan lifestyle. When she told me that they had a vegan buffalo chicken pizza I was hesitant but curious. 

Wow, you definitely wouldn't be able to tell that it was vegan! We enjoyed our pizza there, piping hot, and were only able to finish one slice it was super filling. It even reheated well in the oven the next day!

This was my only visit there so far, but I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of their vegan options, as there were many!
