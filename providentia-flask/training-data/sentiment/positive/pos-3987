Great Mexican food CAN be found in Las Vegas and it's at Juan's!  Being from SoCal, I've been in search of good Mexican food for quite some time.  We chose Juan's based on the great  reviews.  

Started in the cantina since the wait on this Friday evening was about 20 minutes.  The strawberry Coronarita's were a hit with the group.  Dos XX and Corona Light on tap along with a number of other options.

Chips were good and we couldn't stop eating the salsa and bean dip.

They're famous for the Flaming Fajitas so the mixed chicken and beef were the choice.  In a word, excellent.  Big portions, all the options included (sour cream, pico, guac) along with rice and beans or veggies.

Not only was the food great but service was very attentive including refills on everything from drinks to chips and sides.  We rounded it out with the sopapillas and consensus was, this will be a repeat too. 

Will be back soon and often!  Glad we found Juan's!
