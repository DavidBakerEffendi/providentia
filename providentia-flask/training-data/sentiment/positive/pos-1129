Went on a brunch date with my girlfriend today after trying to get into some other places that had crazy lineups.  Glad we ended up here.  Atmosphere was warm and cozy and our waiter was very attentive.  I got the banana chocolate pancake and she got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  We both got teas to go with out meals.  I was scraping the chocolate off my plate once I was done my pancake and my girlfriend ate every last bite of her grilled cheese sammy.  Our waiter, without prompting, came over three times to refill our hot water and replenish our lemon and honey.  If you're looking for good homemade food in a cozy spot, definitely a place to try.
