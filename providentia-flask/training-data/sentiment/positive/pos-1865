Came in here on a Sunday and really digged the open atmosphere and very relaxed coffee shop type vibe. The live music was okay and they had a great happy hour. We got party tots and a pulled pork sandwich and the Bahn Mi sandwich which was all very good. The tots were a little soggy but the quality of the sandwiches made up for them as did the decent prices. Will definitely come back some other time!
