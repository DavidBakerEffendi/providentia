My wife and I came here for Valentines to enjoy a fun night out and good food. We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation and had a drink at the bar. They have plenty different cocktails to choose from and are reasonably priced. We got seated on time at 8PM and were greeted by a very nice waitress. She went over all menu items and gave her recommendations. 

We had yellowtail tacos, the sea bass skewers, few rolls and the tuna tataki. Each dish came out perfect and tasted great. They were very attentive with drinks and made sure plates were taken when we were done. 

Overall a very pleasant experience. Will come again.
