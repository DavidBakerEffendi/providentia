For the price that I paid for, this burrito filled me up to the point of sweet euphoric salmon joy. They give a lot of fish, and a lot of sides and toppings. What a splendid day and a great way to end it. All poetry and all bows to this place. Once you befriend Ted, there's no going back...to jaburrito...or soho.... but I'm not pointing fingers.
Thank you to the staff that worked tonight because they were super and beautifully knowledgeable in what we all wanted and how we loved fish. 
Yes.
Ted.
