I've been eating here ever since they opened. The food here is always hooked up. The portions are always perfect and the toppings are proportionate. The best part is that they overload the toppings and then top it off with different house made sauces. I've been going with their bulgogi beef bibimbap bowl lately. It's always so filling and delicious. When you're feeling extra hungry, get the euro fries, carne asada fries or the sweet potato kimchi fries. They are so damn good, but the portion is huge so it's definitely shareable. Overall, I'm always satisfied with my food here and I will continue to support this local spot.
