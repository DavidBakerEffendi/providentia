This place is dangerous. It's very good and in no way healthy. Chicken strips, fries, mac and cheese, and jalapeño poppers were amazing. The sweet tea was perfect as well. My absolute favorite was the ghost sauce and jalapeño ranch. Some of the best Sauce I have ever had. We will be back, but only on cheat days.
