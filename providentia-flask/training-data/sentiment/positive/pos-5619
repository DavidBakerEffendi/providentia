Liz was our server and she was very attentive and sweet. She had very nice hair and she made our experience wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the ham and cheese omelette with potatoes toast and bacon. I ordered the better half with turkey sandwich and the chicken tortilla soup. Everything was cooked perfectly and delicious. The soup came in a bigger bowl than I thought. The soup was perfect. Everything was yummy here. Price is affordable as well. The decorations inside was cute and I loved everything about this place. Definitely recommend and will come back.
