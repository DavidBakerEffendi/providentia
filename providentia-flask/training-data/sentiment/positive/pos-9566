Great food and atmosphere. We had a party of 8 and everyones food was great and correct! There was a band there and everyone seemed to enjoy them. It was hard to talk at the table but we will be happy to go back, to enjoy dinner or the band separately next time. The waitress was very friendly and attentive even with the place packed.
