Had the most wonderful time here for coffee and lunch.   Super warm and friendly staff.... they make you feel like you have known them for years.

Very homey environment with lots of gallery caliber art work to browse.

While the pizzas looked and smelled delicious.... I had the caprese salad which was super fresh and almost too pretty to eat.

Will be back!
