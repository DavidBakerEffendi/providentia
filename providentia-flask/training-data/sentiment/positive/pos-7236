I wish I lived next to this place, because I will never get tired of it. 
The soups are delicious! And it's not the boring old chicken noodle, cream of X or Y. 
My favourite = Corn Chowder (with blue crab, thai basil) 
It's unlike any other corn chowder in the best way possible! 

And their wraps - not the greatest in the city, but pretty darn good. A soup and wrap combo is about $10, and very filling!

Oh and the communal live edge table at the Adelaide location is fantastic! Nothing better than sitting around a tree with strangers and warming up with some delicious soup!
