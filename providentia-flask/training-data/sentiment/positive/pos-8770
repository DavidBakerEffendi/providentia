Took my 12 member family to eat here last weekend, and there were 6 very large wanting to eat men in the group.  I couldnt believe that they could actually say they were full. We must have ordered over 30 dinsum dishes here.

Service was slow, so most of the time we got up and went and got things ourselves, its okay my one cousin is a pro at this.

In the end it cost me around 130 bucks which made me very happy, what infuriated me was the 16 dollar parking bill outside in the back of the Dragon Mall.  We could have had another 4 plates for that amount.

Regency Dimsum  amazing, parking in the parkade out back SUCKS!!!
