The food truck is phenomenal. Once you see the grills fired up, make sure to get in line before it gets too long. The burritos are excellent but I've recently grown fond of their protein bowls as you get all the flavors, just without the tortilla. 

You can't go wrong with what you order but it's an absolute MUST to get a side of rice (and beans if you want). The spanish rice is extremely flavorful, unlike anything you've ever had. 

Pro-tip: If you order from the food truck, get ready for your clothes to smell because of the smoke from the grill. It's a great smell, honestly, but maybe a bit distracting when you try to get back to work after lunch!
