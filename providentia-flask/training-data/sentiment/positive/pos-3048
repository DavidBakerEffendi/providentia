I was visiting Las Vegas and ended up visiting this restaurant twice in 2 days. 

All of their ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp on ingredients.  The Greek salad was loaded with feta cheese and kalamata olives.

The pizza was delicious, loaded with toppings and the crust was great.  This is the best pizza I've had since I visited Long Island. 

I don't review very often but wanted to made a point of encouraging others to visit their quaint location.
