I've been here 3-5 times now.  Same owners as Roka Akor, one of my all time favorite restaurants, so you know that quality is going to be there as they settle for nothing but the best.  Very casual and quite atmosphere.  Service is fast and friendly.  Food is flavorful and has depth to it.  You can go no heat to quite hot.  Severs are good about explaining the dishes and levels of heat, flavors, etc.  

Give this place a shot if you like Indian Food or aren't sure if you do because they will make you a believer!
