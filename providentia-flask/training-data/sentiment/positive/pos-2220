My sister is vegan and she's been trying to get me to trek all the way from the Eastside to the Westside to visit this place. Well our cousins from out of town visited and we decided to go here for lunch one afternoon. Now I seriously regret not going here sooner! This place has some of the best hot dogs and the selection to put on the hot dog is outrageous. When I first got the list of what I could put on my hot dog I was overwhelmed. You could go here every day and try a new combination. Everyone loved their food and this has become one of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland!!! I can't wait to go back!
