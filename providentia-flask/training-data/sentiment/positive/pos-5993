I decided to take my wife here for our 10th wedding anniversary after I checked Yelp for "French" near my area that isn't on Yonge Street.

When we first got here we found out the hard way that the place wasn't a French restaurant. However, it didn't really matter.  The food was good.

The place is run by the family, the dad cooks, the mom makes dessert and the son serves.  From what I remember, they were an Italian, but they cook food that tastes good and may be mistaken for other cuisines including French.

The place reminded me of those restaurants I saw in Brussels with the signpost outside.

Their special of the day by the time I got there was gone, but they had another special (slightly more expensive) that I took.

Pork Belly and scallops.  Reminded me of the time when I went for tapas at Winnipeg where I was satisfied with the flavors, the only exception was I wasn't hungry after eating.  Though I still had room for dessert

My wife ordered the Spaghetti and Bacon with mushrooms sans olives (we don't like olives).  She loved the texture of the pasta.  She also said the price she paid here was cheaper than Shiso Tree but she liked it better.  For me I like both.  There'd be times I would still like the okonomiyaki pasta at Shiso, but at least I can go here as well for other pasta.

We ended up sharing a dessert which I had to Google to get the right bloody spelling: dacquoise.  It was the first time I had a dessert like that, the fact that I don't even know how to spell it intrigued me to dare try it out.

Overall, the price is on the steep side for random food encounters, but for an anniversary dinner, it's a bargain.
