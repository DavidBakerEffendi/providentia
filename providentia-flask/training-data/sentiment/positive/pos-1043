I have been to Grazie twice now! Both times a groupon was used - the groupon entailed a 12inch pizza of choice and then a pitcher or white or red sangria. When you arrive at Grazie you notice it's sweet and quaint ambiance. It is a smaller place with a nice patio. All the servers and staff are really nice there. It is pretty laid back and casual. 

The first time I came here I was with two friends. We opted for the red sangria, a salad to share, and the vegetarian pizza. Everything was really good and flavorful. The crust is amazing on the pizza!

 I went with my parents last night and again we got the red sangria. The sangria is very good- not too sweet but not bitter. We got the Americana pizza (pepperoni ) and added sausage on it. We got the bread and oil. The bread was just room temp. bread and I wasn't totally impressed by it- it did it's job though. The pizza was OUTSTANDING! I am so glad we got the sausage as it brought an extra kick to the meal. I like Grazie a lot and can't wait to go back!
