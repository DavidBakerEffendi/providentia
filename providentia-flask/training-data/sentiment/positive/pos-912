Cozy atmosphere, excellent food, polite staff and patrons.  Games and a variety of seating areas provide a fun experience for small to medium sized groups.  The patios would be great if it wasn't so hot outside, but it is June in Phoenix.   Had the avocado pesto sandwich with fries and the cauliflower tacos- delicious!   Will definitely visit again!
