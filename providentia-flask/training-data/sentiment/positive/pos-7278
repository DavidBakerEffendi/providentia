This was my second time at this pub.  The food is unbelievable.  We ordered the pretzel dish to share.  They make these incredible pretzels on site and serve with a charcuterie and dip.  I had the short ribs which were falling off the bone.  My companions had the hocks which was a huge portion and the other friend had the schnitzel.  Both were very satisfied.  Our server was a little pushy in that it really seemed like he was hustling us along, but otherwise very polite. If I were to give him some advice; don't look openly disappointed when people just want to sit and enjoy the rest of their drinks after their meal, it's not all about flipping tables and you should expect a little lingering after a meal in a pub.  Other than that little irksomeness, all the staff including our server there have been wonderful.
