I am a very picky restaurant patron and this place won me over! It's a total hole in the wall where the chef is right in front of you preparing really amazing meals. The wine suggestion for me was spot on and the chef made some changes to help with foods I could eat. Don't expect a overly decorated Scottsdale like place. It's very much self put together. But the food is to die for!
