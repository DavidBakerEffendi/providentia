I can't believe I haven't written a review for Archi's! 

Archi's is really authentic! I haven't had a bad experience with them. I always order the seafood combo with green curry and their chicken pad thai. I also like their fried rice, spicy eggplant with tofu and seafood tom yum soup! :) i didnt like their thai tea though because it was very sour and bitter. 

Service is excellent and food is really cheap! Come by and check it out!
