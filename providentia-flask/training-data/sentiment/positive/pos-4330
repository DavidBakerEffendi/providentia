I've been to several of the breakfast/lunch only places that have opened in the neighborhood recently. I often wondered what really differentiated them from getting breakfast at Denny's or IHOP. For most of them, the menu is fairly routine and the food is ok but nothing to write home about. None of that is true for Served. This is a fairly small restaurant ( maybe 20 tables) hidden off of Horizon Ridge Parkway. You really have to know that it's there because it is not visible from the street and could easily just drive by. At Served, the menu is anything but routine. The breakfast menu is loaded with items that you cannot get any place else and you certainly cannot make it yourself at home unless you are a Gourmet Chef. As soon as you order, they bring a basket homemade chips that are coated with cinnamon and sugar. In addition there is a side of a Nutella dipping sauce. Wow is that good. Very tempted to just eat the chips and Nutella and skip the meal. Needless to say I didn't do that. I ordered the Matt's omelet. It looks like the size of a 4 egg omelette but it is egg whites only. It is loaded with turkey, bacon (lots and lots of bacon), spinach, yellow peppers and topped with avocado. It comes with a side of potato nuggets and toast. Has to be the best omelet I've ever eaten. My buddy ordered the triple-decker club sandwich. He ordered it with a side of sweet potato fries. He loved the sandwich. But I thought the presentation was what was really spectacular. Our server, Hunter, did an outstanding job despite the fact that he's only been on the job 3 days. The restaurant manager, Jamie, came by several times to make sure everything was going well and to give us a little history of the restaurant.
This is why people go out for breakfast. Outstanding service and food that you could not prepare for yourself at home. I definitely will be back very soon.
