Wow. If sandwiches were swords CowTown beef shack is the Scottish claymore that will win you your freedom...from hunger

Props to Nick S. for suggesting this place. After two weeks of being delayed opportunities to try CowTown, I made it my mission today to go for lunch, ditching a desk full of unresolved reports and neglected a phone that wouldn't shut up. Located in the same parking lot as Home Food Inn, CowTown is literally a shack no bigger than 2-3 office cubicles put together. But when I walked up to the kiosk and peeked inside, I saw a chef with a miniature gourmet kitchen ready to fire out sandwiches!

I ordered the BBQ beef sandwich, which cost 8.00. The tissue soft sheet-strands of beef in BBQ tasted LES INCREDABLE. The pockets of fat made random bites of the sandwich a different experience. The bread was pretty basic but hey, how can you draw art without a plain sheet of paper? I asked for the cheese and pepper toppings which complimented the beef. The cheese sauce was interesting as it had a nacho cheese flow but with the curdled consistency of melted hard cheese.

I wish I still had my hefty appetite, otherwise I would go back and attempt to tackle a second sandwich. Still one order is large enough that I can feel my heartbeat drumming against the spine along my neck.

I could really use a na...*passes out*
