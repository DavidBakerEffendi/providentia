First time here and we loved it.  Arrived around 7:00 and belly dancing started about twenty minutes later.

Food was great, although we ate light so this might not be helpful to everyone... tried the vegetarian combo (hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, lentil soup, etc.) plus a full order of hummus, and finished with baklava.  We enjoyed the flavor of everything.

My dining companion tried the beer recommended by the server (a Lebanese beer called Almaza) and liked it.  I ordered a White Russian and the strength was good.

We came specifically for the dancing and were not disappointed.  There was one dancer and she made an effort to cover the entire room so everyone could see her (we've been to other restaurants where only some tables had a good view).  She also engaged well with the audience with a lot of eye contact, and she invited participation, which was fun.
