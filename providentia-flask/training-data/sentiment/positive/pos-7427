Holy acai on toast, there's finally a shop on this side of town. 
A small, new establishment that's hiding right next to a giant Yogurtland place, this little hole in the wall kicks ass. 
While it may be on the pricey side, the smoothies are delicious and the bowls are a pretty good size portion. They have a menu where you can select premade bowls, smoothies, or juices, but there is also a customization option where you can build yours with whatever you want. Along with acai, they have various assorted fruits, yogurt, oats and honey that you can mix into your healthy snack.
Super happy this place is here, hope it sticks around.
