Seven us went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  It was crowded and seemed like the place to go for dinner in Squirrel Hill.  They seemed to have forgotten our reservation, because the staff seemed to freak out when our group started to showed up.  They were able to seat us when we were all there, but it was a tight squeeze at our table.

Besides that initial confusion with our reservation, everything was amazing.  The food was fantastic.  Us veggies had the turnip cake as an appetizer, it's a solid appetizer choice that I'll be getting the next time I'm there.  There were four vegetarians in our group and we ordered family style, so I got to try the sauteed vegetables, the eggplant with garlic, the kimchi hot pot, and the Mapo tofu.  The sauteed vegetables and the eggplant with garlic were my favorite dishes.

The next time I have a craving for Taiwanese (which is surprisingly often), I'll be coming here.
