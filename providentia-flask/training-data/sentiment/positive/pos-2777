Some careless person threw bread crumbs into oncoming traffic. People are so rude/gross!!! Everyone knows that the Bloordale-Parkdale pigeons' #1 weakness is breadcrumbs. And you're gonna put breadcrumbs on the road during the morning rush?! You monsters.  On a typical day I would consider this a bad omen, but unlike those pigeons, my day was GREAT!

The original plan was to go to The Works up the street, but fortunately The Yellow Griffin just happened to be closer.  I ordered the Calypso burger with onion rings and they were too delicious to describe. My bf had the Canadian burger and he thought it was amazing as well.  Even the beverages were fresh and delicious. 

There was a HUGE and THICK bee flying around the windows inside the restaurant.  The bee was slow; I actually think it was a wasp.  Wasps are the ones with the child-bearing hips and the terrifying dangly legs.  This wasp is my only constructive criticism.  Next time either escort it off the premises or get a clip board and slap it down from the air until you hear that thud sound. 

For all of the above reasons, I give The Yellow Griffin, 4 stars.  The star that elevates it to 5, is the delightful gentleman who wears the hearty smile and pleasant disposition. Another delightfully symmetrical man serving on the west side. He didn't even fumble when that big ol bee came around. I love that guy but he probably wont call.

5 STARS!!!
