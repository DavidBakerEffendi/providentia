Was a little scared because it was 1pm on a friday and the place was empty. It took a while to get our order but the place is clean and we didn't mind. Out came my carne asada burrito, it was fresh,moist and tender and not the least bit greasy. Beans were beautifully done as well. If I lived in Phoenix it would be there weekly for sure.. excellent!
