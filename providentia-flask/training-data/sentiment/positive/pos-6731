Postino has very consistent food quality and vibe across its locations. I've been to the Central, Arcadia, and Kierland locations, and I love the consistent taste and services while enjoying the slight differences in their interior design. 

The $5 till 5 everyday tradition for all wines and beers just makes it a perfect spot for Friday afternoon drinks. Great start of the weekend! 

Postino is a great place to hang out with friends, relax by urself over wine, or showing visitors around. Always a safe choice and it never fails me.
