This is a short-order line-style resto, but with a big surprise: fantastic levantine food at a very cheap price. It looks a little cheesy from the outside but inside it was clean enough and has fairly standard cafeteria-style seating to go with the cafeteria line. But, oh, the food! For $20 we got something like eight of the little pizzas - spicy meat, eggplant, cheese - and containers of spiced Armenian couscous and tabolueh. If you'd taken the same food and put it in a dark bistro with a maitre'd and candlelit tables with fancy regional decor, I'd likely be paying three times as much fairly gladly. But the combination of delicious food, friendly counter service (from the owner, we think), and a good value elevate this within class of great cheap unusual food to five stars. YUM.
