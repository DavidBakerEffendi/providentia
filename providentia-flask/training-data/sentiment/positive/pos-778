I have nothing bad to say about this place.  The atmosphere was great, server was attentive and extremely knowledgable on the menu.  We ordered the italin stallion and the margherita pizza's and calamari for an appetizer.  The appetizer came out quickly, and was delish!  By the time we'd finished with the calamari, we'd waited five minutes and the pizza's came out piping hot! We finished our meal with a canoli and choc. Canoli for dessert to go.  We got home and tried them and they were the best canoli I have ever tasted.  The shell was crispy amd filling was so decadent, but not overly sweet.  You could tell they are made to order. We will definitely be back!
