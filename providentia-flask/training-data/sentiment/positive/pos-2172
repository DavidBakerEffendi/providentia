What a dinner!  From Chris, the friendly, knowledgeable  waiter to dessert, it was a great food experience.  Every item was fresh and well thought out.  But the memory we took away was the blind ice cream tasting.  Not only was this fun and a way to try some unconventional flavors, but Chris balanced his involvement between hints with spending the perfect amount of time to review.
