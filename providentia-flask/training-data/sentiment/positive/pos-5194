I ate at Mickey and Mooch for my college grad dinner 7 years ago and have been in love ever since, for anniversaries,  date nights, business dinners, whatever the reason I can get there!

Hailing from the Baltimore area - I have the authority to say their lump crab appetizer or dinner is the best crab plate you can get.  You get a plate that is piled high with a hefty chunk of crab for a dang good price - order the same thing at Ruth Chris and you get 1/5th of crab for 4 dollars more.  Crab cakes are still done better in Maryland though!

Wine by the glass is a deal!  Order a chardonnay at Sulivans - 14 dollars, half glass.  Same glass of wine here - 8 dollars and filled to the brim.  

Cesar salads here are done perfect - I pushed my wedge out of the way to pick at my wife's Cesar last night.

To enjoy this place you will need to order a Prime Filet, medium rare.  For a fraction of the price you get a steak as good as Ruth Chris, just not covered in butter (not a bad thing).  They cook medium rare pretty well, and the prime is tender and butter textured

You want the best desert - 7 layer chocolate cake.  The full slice is enough to make you gain 3-lbs.  My wife and I weighed a full slice - it's almost 3-lbs!  They do offer it in the half slice - which weights just under 2!  

Service is normally good, but that is definitely the difference between a Del Frisco's or Morton's, the waiters at Mickey and Mooch are not the caliber that you get at the higher priced steak houses, but I come for the food!
