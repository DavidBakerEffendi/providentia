So I really wanted some carne asada tacos! I like robertos but wanted some street style tacos. So I turned to Yelp as I often do. I found Jefe's! I am so glad I did. It is located in gas station which can be off putting to some, but get over it!! This is probably the best taco shop in Vegas. The kitchen is clean and the owners/staff are friendly and kind. I ordered the mini street tacos because I wanted to taste the meat without accoutrements. Many a bad taco has been hidden with toppings. Do I got three Carne Asada tacos, two chicken, and one al pastor taco. I also had my littles with me and got them a cheese quesadilla and fries. The Carne asada was cooked well, not dried out or overly chewy. The seasoning was the perfect amount of spice. The corn tortillas here are boss! Not overly salty like some places we've been. The chicken tacos were great too! The chicken was moist and similarly seasoned to the carne asada but not as spicy! The al pastor was amazing! It wasn't dried out, had great seasoning and the right amount of smoke/char flavor. The kids demolished the cheese quesadilla, fries, and horchata. Which in my house is amazing because they're some picky eaters. But honestly if you want a taco or anything else you see on the menu, give it a try, it'll be amazing!! Found my new taco stop.
