Okay, you don't feel like cooking today right? If you just miss moms or Grammys cooking? Well this is it! It's almost the same as home cooked except your dining with some people. They do have a pretty good selection of food here. Breakfast is awesome I've have tried a few items here. Oh my, if I did eat meat, ( I'm pescatarian) Id be down to eat the huge chicken and waffles I see come around! Man every time I see that plate I just wanna get down with it but... anyways! My breakfast experience here is just soooooo good. I just never really had the chance to yelp it till today ! Well... try it you'll love it ! Happy Morning eating! Happy happy joy joy! :)
