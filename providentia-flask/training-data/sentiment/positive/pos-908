Delicious!

I hosted a group dinner here with 14 people, and the staff was both incredibly accommodating before, and the food they brought out was amazing.

The set menu did not have any pizzas (which is a specialty), and I asked if they could add it - no problem!

Everyone was stuffed, and the food was just all around delicious. We were treated great, the food was great, and the service was great.

No-brainer.
