I had the day off of work last Monday so decided to celebrate with some pizza.  I had never been to Pizza Heaven before, but pass it every day on 7th Street on my way home from work.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting with true ambience (rare in the strip mall Phoenix culture).  Orders are placed in the front and a number is provided to you.  I have to say that the guy taking the order was helpful and courteous.  I had some questions and he answered them with a smile - not an attitude!

I ended up sharing a Greek style salad (it had artichokes and a red vinegar/oil olive dressing = Greek style).  The portion was generous and the salad as delicious.  The main course was an extra large thick crust pizza.   It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was simple, yet tasty.

Pizza Heaven is suitable for adults and children alike.  

I will be back.................!
