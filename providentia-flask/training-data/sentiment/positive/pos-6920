I love their selection of goods and products! From neem vitamins and hair oils to supplies to make Falooda and various meals, this place has usually what I am looking for. Today I was looking at the hair oils, since the one I got last time was running low. One of the owners told me about the one in my picture and I'm in love with it! It smells good and adds an extra shine to your hair! ^____^
