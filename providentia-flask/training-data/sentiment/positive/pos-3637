It's been two weeks since we had dinner here.  Our waitress Alicea suggested ordering two items from the special birthday menu and the dessert is on the house.  The special menu is for a limited time with entrees not offered on the regular menu. For our appetizer we ordered the pork satay. Three huge, tender juicy pieces of pork got our taste buds off to a yummy start. My husband's entree, the "Evil Jungle Princess" made with Filet Mignon and a peanut red curry sauce is on the regular menu. He enjoyed every bite...so did I. The red curry sauce is spicy spicy on the tongue, though a sip of the "Thai Mai" frozen drink was a quick fix. And speaking of this drink, it's a must to order.  (Much better flavors than the traditional Mai Tai.) I ordered from the special birthday menu. My entree was called "Crispy Whole Fish". As a waiter delivered it to our table the other diners heads turned with curiosity. It was a huge Red Snapper and yes the head, tail and fins still in tack! Every bite of the fish was perfectly moist. We forced ourselves to finish the Snapper since it was so scrumptious! This entree needs to be offered on the regular menu. The vegetable fried rice was fluffy and tasty with a hint of spiciness. (It wasn't oily like other Asian/Thai restaurants here in the valley make their rice.) The second side dish ordered was the wasabi mashed potatoes which was a perfect complement to both of our delicious entrees. And last was the complimentary dessert.....the Chocolate Volcano with vanilla bean ice cream.  We had our waitress box it up since we were full from eating all of the above food. This dessert can be ordered from the regular menu.  At home, later in the evening, we ate the Volcano. A great dessert, it was not to sweet. We're headed back to Ling and Louie's this week and you need to try it too!
