Great find in Gilbert for authentic Chinese food! My family and I went here on a whim and it was definitely worth it! Looks a lot bigger and nicer on the inside and the owners bring the Cantonese influence to their plates. 

I feel like their speciality is noodles! We got a Seafood combination chow mein, beef chow fun, and some kind of spicier "curry" influence dish seafood combo style! Wow the plates were huge! Such big portions for such a cheap price!  The noodles were all so yummy! Are they hand made? Probably not cause that would be super difficult to do on a day to day basis, but still good! The flavor of the chow mein was awesome! Good amount of seafood on the plate too! The beef chow fun is excellent as well! The curry-style chow mein would not be for everyone though. It has more of a "grimy dry" taste to it, but it's supposed to be that way! I thought it was good!

So it wasn't the best Chinese food I've had, but it's so great for the location! Who would think that there awesome Chinese food in Gilbert that's literally 5 minutes away from my house! Not only that, their service is sooo good! It feels like a "mom and pop" restaurant and my advice is, if you speak to the owner, she's really nice and she'll probably throw in some crab puffs for you, at least in my case :)
