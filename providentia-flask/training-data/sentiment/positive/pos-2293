Came here after dinner with a friend and my fiance. 

We were greeted quickly and our orders were promptly taken. 

My fiance got an earl grey tea. My friend and I got the tongue depressor crepe and I ordered a side of mango sorbet for the fiance. It's called a wrecking ball, in case you're wondering and it costs $4, which isn't bad for good quality ice cream, or in this case, sorbet. Huge scoop.

The tea came with a beautiful presentation. It even came with a little information card about earl grey tea (where it was discovered, who drank it, if it's caffeinated, etc). My fiance asked for honey with his tea and our server gladly got it for him. 

The tongue depressor crepe comes with brownie pieces, dark chocolate ice cream, white chocolate buttons, and a chocolate drizzle. Total indulgement. Generous scoop of ice cream and a fair amount of toppings. My friend and I couldn't finish the crepe.  

I love how we are given chocolate when the bill comes. As if we didn't just eat enough sweets, here's another sweet for you to eat! 

I loved the decor of this location. Very eclectic and just fun. Nice, victorian style couches with funky clocks everywhere. Like, who thinks of these things?! And the servers wear suspenders. Um, adorable!
