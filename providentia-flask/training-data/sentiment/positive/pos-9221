We love Wahoos, this is the only thing we miss when we moved from California. So when I found out there are 2 locations in Vegas I was overjoyed! We ordered our favorite No. 2, the food was late, but the staff came out and apologized with an offer of chips and salsa. I would say this place (Rampart location) tasted just like the other chains in California. Now I have no regrets moving out of Cali.
