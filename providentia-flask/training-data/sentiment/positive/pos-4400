We enjoyed a birthday dinner here and had an all around great experience.  The server Robert was very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere was contemporary classic and very luxurious.  I normally go for chairs over booths but went booth-side this time so my back wasn't to the room, it was a very comfortable seat.

The Grub:
We started with some Lobster pot stickers and complementary champagne.  Very good quality lobster.  I also enjoyed a Sangria cocktail.

My favorite cut of steak is the Rib Eye so I went with the 45 day dry aged bone in rib eye and a loaded backed potato.  Very delicious, very filling.  the dry aged meat offers a nice little kick for your taste buds.

She had a Kobe Burger and this thing was giant.  I liked the presentation for this dish the most as the fries were stacked like a Janga Tower.  I sampled some of the ground kobe beef and it was very juicy and succulent.

At this point we were too stuffed for dessert, but the waiter treated me to a special alcoholic espresso shot, great end to the meal.
