In A Sentence™
Greatest fountain show on Earth!

Quick Review™
+    Free.

+   Records playlist rotation includes Andrea Bocelli* (*who I have heard live [/non-humble brag]), Celine Dion (*), Placido Domingo (*), Elton John (*), Bruno Mars (*), and The Beatles+ (+not old enough to have heard live; however, Sir Paul McCartney has played live in front of these eyes a couple of times). 

+   By definition: what is played while the show takes place is rotated. Show is every fifteen minutes (or half an hour during non-peak).

-   Tiësto. Anyone with class despises Tiësto and his preposterous ego/God complex. Please remove Tiësto from the rotation forever. 

Employee of Excellence™ 
^ The engineer. The engineer who created this. He went on to remodel The Volcano [ https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-volcano-las-vegas ] into what it is today.

Parking
Street parking is nonexistent. It's the strip. That doesn't stop tourists in vehicles traveling southbound in the westernmost lane to simply stop or creep along so slowly they are basically stopped while the fountain is going off. 

Garage and valet parking is free for the time being.

Gift shop
None. None that is particular to the Fountain. There is one inside across the hallway from JPP and their world's largest chocolate fountain. Surely one could find some Fountain trinkets in there. Or, there is plenty of street gifts being peddled right on the sidewalk by all manner of street person.

Special attractions
They play different stuff for the traditional holiday season: festivus. They had a kabuki show last year but that was an unrivaled disaster. Imagine Dragons once played here (not in the fountain). 

I've been practically here for it all. (Check the check-ins.) I was across the street for kabuki (it was pandemonium on the west pavement); I have heard the entire rotation of music; I think I have seen fights/proposals/vomiting; and, in continuation with my Royal Duke™ series of better-late-than-never reviews, I present you my review of the World Famous Fountains of Bellagio on the World Famous Las Vegas Strip in World Famous Paradise, Nevada.

Bottom Line™
Free, good for everyone, and did I neglect to mention that is was free?

Good for Tourists.
Good for Kids.
Good for Dogs.

Rating: Five-stars, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"
