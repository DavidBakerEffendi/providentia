I've always been a fan of the Thai culture as much as the food  for it's diversity it's extremes. There is something about fresh food that is easily processed and just "feels right." A meal at papaya Thai  is a surefire way to boost my energy for the rest of the day. Unlike most other meals, I never leave hungy, always end up with 2nds(a to go bag), and get to relax in such a soothing atmosphere. Their food hassome kick so even a 2 out of 6 is respectable.
