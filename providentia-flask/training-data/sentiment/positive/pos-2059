MPJ Grill is a family owned restaurant in Fountain Hills and by far this families personal favorite.  From the moment you walk in the door you see smiling faces and caring people.  The owner is always there and truly cares about every piece of his business.  The food is beyond fabulous with so many options.....everything from the best fish and chips we have ever had (Friday/Saturday) to amazing lamp chops (Wednesday) to burgers, pasta and outrageous pork chops.  There are even vegetarian options which are wonderful as well!  Having lived here for over a year this is the one place that is consistent in food quality and we are there weekly.  You can not go wrong.  Any negatives about this place are totally unfounded, it is excellent, clean, friendly and just perfect.
