Toronto friends, you HAVE TO go and have Saturday brunch or weekday lunch at Maman. It's at the First Canadian Place, restaurant at a the mezzanine level (top of the elevators on your right). While you're there, try out one of their cocktail: like Gentiane (citadelle gin, gentiane, orgeat syrup, lemon juice, egg whites & cardamom) or Herbes de Provence (calvados, lillet infused with herbes de provence, lemon juice, sugar & egg whites). Great food, amazing place, fantastic staff and all around generosity. You won't be disappointed.
