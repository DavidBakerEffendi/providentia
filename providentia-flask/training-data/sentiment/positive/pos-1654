Went here for Sunday brunch and it was packed and full of delicious choices, did not realize it was a buffet and it was $27! So I ate as much as possible trying to not look greedy in front of my friends.  They had salmon, prime rib, pork loin, and the brisket was phenomenally tender.  Shrimp and oysters and sushi. Mac and cheese was kind of velveeta shells-y but the squash casserole was so awesome I wanted to take the whole tray to my table.  Salad and bacon and said have and bread pudding and layered chocolate trifle. Desserts. And you could order French toast and waffles off the brunch menu for free. I asked for French toast but they forgot to bring it. You have to go for brunch.
