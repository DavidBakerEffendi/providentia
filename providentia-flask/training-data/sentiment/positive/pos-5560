Every time I come here I plan on taking pictures to contribute to a review, but I've never even gotten the chance.  I always remember right around the time I come-to in a joyous, food coma haze.  

Everything is amazing (special shout-out to the Italian beef!) and the sauces! My god, the sauces. Tears of joy.  I think I've tried every side on offer by now and they're all incredible.  My favorite might be the brisket chili, but collard greens (with a dash of the mustard sauce) and the bbq beans (with a dash of the spicy sauce) are definitely my mainstay.  

I recommend the food here ALL the time, and it's usually my go-to spot to take out-of-towners for lunch.  The food's always fresh, the service super friendly, and did I mention how much I love their sauces? 

My one tip would be to eat in rather than taking the Q to go; having their sauce on the table rather than in a little to-go cup just works out better if you like to "apply liberally" like me.  Be warned that it's a fairly small place though, you'd probably want to keep your group size under 5 to make sure you're able to find a seat.  Take your friends in waves and you'll get to visit even more often! Score!

Now I'm hungry again.
