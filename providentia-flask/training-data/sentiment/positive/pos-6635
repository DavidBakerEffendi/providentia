If I could, I would give it six stars. The breakfast is fabulous and the service is great. I love lunch there too. I always leave with a dozed deserts and love to bring Iyummy filled with goodies for my staff and church. The service is AWESOME
I brought their homemade twinkles to go. The menu covers just about every craving you may have.  It's impossible to eat healthy here so don't even try.
