It's the best thing on Mill Ave in terms of food.

Made a date with some girlfriends to have brunch here on a rainy Saturday. I knew that was a stretch because of NCounter's popularity that we'd get a table at the brunch hour on a Saturday. But luckily, we got a table and we actually sat outside under a space heater and it was just fine. The inside is so modern. We went in December and their Christmas decorations were super cute. We stood in a line that wasn't too long but long enough that I had time to drool over the baked goods window. Mini cupcakes? Damn cutest things I'v ever seen. I ordered the Saturday special which was a plate of biscuits and gravy (I'm a simply gal) and my girlfriends order the much-raved about eggs benedict and an omlette. Let me tell you, for not being a fancy sit down brunch place, that was the best looking omletter I have ever seen. 

The bs and gs were great and I got a chocolate milk which totaled to $12.50. Meh, a little overpriced. I have to give NCounter props though, they sell their own merechandise and the branding they have going on is very cool and hip. Plus they have seating everywhere. I'm certain had it been a nice day out the place would have been packed to the rafters.

Can't wait to go back!
