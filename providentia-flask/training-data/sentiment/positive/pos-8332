I keep finding myself back here and it keeps getting better honestly... quality poke bowls and a good portion for the price. I was less of a fan of the sushi burrito BUT that was still a solid four stars. 

The service here is always friendly and consistent. The same guy is always working and he's so nice and helpful. 

This time we also tried the bubble waffle... an egg based waffle with ice cream and toppings. We got sprinkles and marshmallow. These things are sooo goood. The waffle is more cakey than cone but it's delicious. They are a good size and can definitely be split. 

There's also other food items that aren't sushi you can order on the other side. That side is called Green Bing. Rice bowls, noodles, etc. 

Check this place out!!!
