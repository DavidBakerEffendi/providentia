Found this place on yelp and decided to stop in. Great choice. I ordered their slaw burger and it was big, juicy, flavorful and messy as a burger should be and it didn't lack an excellent bun.I used to consider pit stop the best burger in boulder, I think that this place really is a good competitor. The service was exemplary and I would come back. The restroom was clean as well as the restaurant. I love the 24hr menu as well get anything at anytime. Will be back. Plus there is a drive through.
