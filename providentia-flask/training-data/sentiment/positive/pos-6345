Tried three different Macaroons and I'm in love! 
The red velvet was amazing so was the vanilla and the chocolate one. 

Actually the chocolate was downright amazing. The shell was perfect. It had that crunch but was still chewy and the flavor inside was unreal. 

Abby was so sweet and threw in two free macaroons! 

I'll definitely go back when I have a sweet tooth!
