This place never fails! Their food is great, the service is super-friendly/quick, and the ambiance is really relaxing. I've come here with my family dozens of times over the years and it's always an awesome experience!! I've been to a couple other Bombay Bhel locations, but this one is the best in my opinion(I think it's also the head location).

Service: I can't recall waiting too long for my meals here. The servers are really polite, professional and friendly. And the management is super-friendly too, they always come over to say hi :)

Food: Amazing. And the portions are decent for what you pay. My favourite entrees here are the chicken biryani, chicken tikka(dry) & chicken tikka masala. And my favourite starters are the aloo tikki & bhel puri. Channa masala here is also excellent! All of the meals I've had here are delicious and flavourful, but I honest-to-God have never EVER tasted a better chicken tikka anywhere! It is just soooo good! I don't even live close to this location, so if anyone in my family is passing by on the way to my place, I sometimes ask them to bring some for me... Simply because it is THAT GOOD! As close to my Mom's home cooking as it gets!

Atmosphere: Warm & family-friendly. There's often some eclectic indian-fusion-electro-lounge music playing in the background, and the decor is really pretty. It's also a nice place to host parties, with either family or employees, and they're more than happy to accommodate.
