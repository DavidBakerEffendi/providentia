When you step into Roy's you are instantaneously transported to your Hawaiian getaway. It really feels like you are on vacation on the islands. Try Roy's signature Hawaiian martini and try to tell me different. It's perfect. We came here for valentines and had the four course prefix menu which ended with the most incredible chocolate souffle. It sent me over the edge. Roy's staff were all friendly and efficient. They all had the aloha spirit. The manager came to the table and gave us a $20 gift certificate after we paid the bill. How sweet is that? I love this place. It was a memorable dinning experience.
