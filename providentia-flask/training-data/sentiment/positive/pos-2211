Nothing quite like this place in Charlotte.  You can tell this in the very first moments of entering and especially on a weekend at lunch.  People love this place and there's good reason.  Fresh ingredients and a creative kick to otherwise bland and boring dishes.  I was bowled over at how much I actually liked the meal I had and since have had even after my first visit.

Interiors are open and light is abundant by way of the large windows.  Trendy interiors compliment the rustic brick and wood accents.  Parking is a bit of bear here with the entire Afton Mill area having other great things like the market and Savory Spice Shop as well as Big Ben's.
