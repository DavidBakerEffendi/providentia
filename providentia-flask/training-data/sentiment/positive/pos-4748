I wasn't sure what to expect and ordering looked a little crazy (a few steps) but it's really nothing at all. The staff make it super easy and will help you by explaining the differences in curry/sauces. 

I had the chicken bbq and added grilled veggies. It was $15 and I got 2+ meals out of it. Tons of food and vegetarian friendly too. 

The seating area is nice & big and they keep kids at the counter for leftovers. Can't wait to go back!
