This is just my favourite resto in Montr√©al for bringing friends during the summer.
The live jazz, the cozy courtyard setting, sitting under giant umbrellas... It's got a vibe all its own.

Your main focus at Jardin should be salads. The rest of their menu can be hit or miss, but these folks do salads right. Also a nice place to stop by for a drink, not necessarily for a full meal though.

Touristy or not, if you're a Montrealer, a foodie, and you've never eaten here... Aim to mend the errors of your ways, to redeem your soul. You deserve it.

They're only open in the summer though, it's an open air dining sort of situation.
