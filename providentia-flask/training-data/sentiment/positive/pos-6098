Love this spot! First time going today and it definitely won't be my last! I tried the 6 pieces of frozen fruit with chocolate and different toppings which is a great bargain at $3.50. My favorite was the chocolate&peanuts covered banana, the dark chocolate mango, and the white chocolate pineapple. My boyfriend had the chocolate covered cheesecake which was amaze balls! Telling everyone I know about this hidden gem! Cute little dessert spot that doesn't break the bank!
