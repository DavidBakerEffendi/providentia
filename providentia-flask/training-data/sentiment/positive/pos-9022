The first time I came here was just to get a quick bite after a late night of hanging out at the Gold Spike. I ordered the French Toast and was absolutely blown away!  It was a combination of perfect bread and very tasty cinnamon batter. 

One of the best parts of this place is the prices. Most items are under $10 which is awesome because there is nothing I love more than a good value!

I had a burger which was OK, but the steak fries on the side were perfect. My last visit I re-ordered the French Toast and got two pancakes for $2 on the side. I was once again surprised with the size of them and how tasty they were. I asked our server what batter they used because I was blown away. For the price, I would much rather have a stack of these than at eat. 

There is no doubt I will be back and no doubt that I will continue to crave their French Toast!
