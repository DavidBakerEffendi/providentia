After growing up in Buffalo, I left it (and my favorite Ted's hot dogs) behind in 1999. Since that time I've been relegated to accepting my only taste of home would be on the very rare occasions I made a trip back North. Today, I learned that I was wrong! This place was awesome! The Sahlen's hot dogs were grilled to perfection and the toppings were perfect. It wasn't until after we began eating that I realized the onion rings looked like those served back home at Ted's as well. Definitely a must try next time! The staff was super nice and fun to engage with and all around it was just a great experience. I will definitely be making return trips on the regular!
