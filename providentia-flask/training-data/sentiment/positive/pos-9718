My sister has been raving about "Taco's Pacos" since she moved to Charlotte a few months ago. She basically lives across the street, so we added it to our must-see list on my recent visit. We met our cousin and her daughter for lunch and I was very impressed. The staff was on their game; the chips and salsa were delivered quickly and were yummy, and our waters were always full. 

I ordered the small chicken quesadilla with a side salad. In hindsight, I wish I had just ordered a large salad because the side salad was one of the best I've ever had! It had a little too much dressing (ask for it on the side) but there were chickpeas, peppers, avocado, corn, etc etc etc in this salad. SO YUMMY. The quesadilla was good with a decent amount of salsa/sour cream/guac on the side, and it was a good value for the lunch. YUM.
