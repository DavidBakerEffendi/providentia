I was going to give this place 4 stars, but what the hell? I can't think of a reason not to give it 5. 

Madhatter's or just Hatter's as people like to call it, is a small eclectic pub, with a homey atmosphere. I love it's many strange paintings and pictures hanging on the walls, as well as the stripper pole, which can be great fun when your friend is smashed, and you convince them to give you a dance. One of the best features i think, is the music. They don't play the standard billboard chart hits, and mix it up with some rock and older hits that will hit your nostalgia bone. Group sing alongs are quite common.

You can't tell by looking at the place, but they actually serve some decent food and at very decent prices. The beer is always flowing, as are the test tube shots. I recommend coming here to spend a night with friends and a few pitchers of beer, you won't regret it! Although you might in the morning.
