Been visiting this restaurant for years now, and since its located close to one of our friends, we order take-out often whenever we go over to watch games.

Service is super quick, they are usually pleasant, especially nice if you are a regular. Sometimes there can be lines out the door, so try calling to book reservations on friday/saturday dinner hours.

The flavours and unique dishes offered here are why they get 5 stars. The price also is a bonus, every dish is cheaper than comparable cantonese restaurants. My favourite unique dish here: Pure egg white with scallops in gravy. Order this. You won't be disappointed (even if it looks like just soup arrived after they bring it out).
