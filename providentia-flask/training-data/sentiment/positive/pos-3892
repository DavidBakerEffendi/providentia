Fun and clean Bingo hall. They even have a "chatty room" for us ladies who want to be a little louder than the serious folk.

The staff are really patient and helpful, answering whatever questions we might have and explaining the rules for each game.

The snacks are pretty basic and you really can't expect too much but machine water is free so that was a nice surprise.
