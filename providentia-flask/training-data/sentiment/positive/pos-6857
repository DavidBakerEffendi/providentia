AMAZING! Dear Fro is my favourite bingsu café by far. The desserts are delicious, the café is renovated and well decorated, the desserts came quickly and the service was good! Most importantly, everything tastes great. 

We ordered the matcha bingsu and the mango toast. Both were amazing! The ice has a rich creamy matcha flavour rather than just condensed milk ice. Other cafés have ice that is lacking in flavour but this one really comes together nicely. The mango toast smells and tastes divine - the pieces of toast are pre-sliced and are toasted with butter. 

I really enjoyed my experience here, especially compared to Snow Time which is next door. You do need to order and pay at the counter before, but this is similar to many other cafés. Definitely coming back to try other items on the menu!
