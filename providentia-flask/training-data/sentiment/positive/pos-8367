I came here on a Friday night for my boyfriends birthday along with friends. Great place! We were so impressed upon entering ! I didn't even have to remind the hostess that some of us had arrive, she came right to the bar and brought to our table. Our server was also super nice and attentive!!!! Food was delicious ! We ordered the New England fry which was gone within minutes. My entree was the free range chicken it was so delicious and juicy! And for the grand finale, brown bag apple pie, bread pudding and cheesecake!!! I'm not usually a fan of apple pie but this convinced me to love apple pie !! Bread pudding was delicious also but cheesecake was ok I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but the rest of my party enjoyed it !
