This place is delicious. I don't know how they have such a low average review! 

I have tried everything on the menu and I DIE every time. It's so amazing and that something vegan can be so freaking delicious, and they rock that to the end. The chicken and waffles are so delicious, definitely my favourite. 

Gets pretty packed often which leads me to Green Thai Chili sometimes if I'm super hungry and don't want to wait. 

Great drink selection and the desserts are KILLER. My table often orders all of them to split and we never regret it!
