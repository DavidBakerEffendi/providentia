I'm not sure if the "chili man" is the most appropriate name for Vic because ALL of his hot dogs are good, and not just the ones with chili. He's an entertaining guy as others have said, genuinely cares about his customers, and he always provides awesome dogs with great service. 
My favorite part is the dogs come exactly as you like. While there is a list of the famous "named" dogs, you can change or add unlimited toppings to them for no extra charge, and he'll make things exactly as you like. Want a TON of spicy mustard? No problem. Just a little BBQ sauce? Same deal. He even asked me if I wanted the BBQ sauce on my "Q Dog" to be spicy, sweet, or fruity and how much. 
The hot dogs and buns are solid quality, but what sets the Chili Man apart are his toppings. The chili is really beefy, flavorful, fresh, and clearly not from a can. The spicy mustard is awesome, the slaw is vinegary but just slightly sweet, the taco sauce is good..I could go on and on about every topping, but the point is they're great. If your dog has "fried cheese" he even puts a little cheddar cheese directly on the griddle to crisp up before adding it to the dog which is perfect. 
Go to the Chili Man, order a few hot dogs depending on how hungry you are (I'm partial to the life changer with extra mustard if you like fairly spicy things), pay the cheap price, thank Vic, and enjoy your killer lunch.
