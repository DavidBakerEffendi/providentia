The food is so good! I stopped in today for lunch with my coworkers and I wasn't expecting the food to be so good. Our server Sam was so sweet! She made great food recommendations for us and was super patient with how indecisive I was (I know I can be a pain). She refilled our drinks without us having to ask, I really appreciate that. I was wondering if we were getting special attention or something so I watched her with her other tables and noticed she is just as sweet to them all. She's got a great personality and you can tell she likes what she does. We left there happy today with good food and even BETTER Service! Thank you Sam! We may be back for brunch! Cheers!
