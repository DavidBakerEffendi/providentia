Our youngest has Juvenile Arthritis. His gluten-free diet has helped to alleviate his symptoms; however, it leaves him longing for donuts, cookies, etc. This cafe is his new favorite spot to eat!! He was so excited that he could order ANYTHING on the menu!!!! He had the hamburger and we treated him to a rocky road brownie. He was so happy and wouldn't stop talking about how good everything was! The brownie caused him quite the dilemma as he lamented, "It's so good, I want to eat it all up, but I want to eat it slowly!" 
The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, making this a wonderful experience all around.
