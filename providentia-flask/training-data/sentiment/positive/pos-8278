Lovely place for small plate tapas during their fabulous happy hour.  Our standard order is calamari & mussels. Delicious red sauce on the mussels that was devoured with the grilled toast.  We couldn't decide which was a better sauce for the calamari: aioli  or marinara. I'm not an onion fan but the pizza with the sausage & onions was amazing! The table also shared the walnut & pear salad and the mozzarella tower salad. Very full of flavor due to the fresh ingredients. The staff is very friendly. We enjoy our meals here every single time no matter the time of the day or our party size.
