Great food truck with local, organic offerings! I had Roots for the first time at Sycamore Brewery's once a month breakfast! The staff were friendly and the service was relatively quick. I had the huevos Rancheros with local chorizo and it was absolutely amazing! The hash was a mixed of sweet potatoes, regular potatoes and peppers, and seasoned perfectly. My husband had the irish breakfast sandwich on brown bread which was also quite delicious. I look forward to trying more from Root's Farm! You also get $2 lunch with a yelp check in - score!
