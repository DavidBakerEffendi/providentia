Updated after trying more pizzas (had to go back only a week later, it was too good!)

Initial Review: 
Pure Pizza is definitely the best pizza I've had in Charlotte thus far. I ordered the pesto pizza with tomatoes and red onion with a few friends, and it was superb! The crust is thin but stays crispy enough to hold up the toppings, the sauce to cheese ratio is solid, and all of the ingredients added great flavor without overpowering the pizza as a whole. You can really tell with their farm to table approach that they have high quality ingredients based on the taste alone. While this does cause the prices to be a bit higher than pizza chains, the quality more than makes up for it. My only complain is that I wish they had smaller options than 12" so that I could get a personal pizza during my lunch hour at work- but hey maybe I'll just have to feel like pigging out or want some leftovers that day.

New:
The Slap Yo Mama Lasagna is also incredible. The ricotta, ground beef, and Italian herb combo makes this taste spot on like lasagna filling..it's incredible. The wild mushroom pizza is nice and cheesy with a strong roasted mushroom taste. Also go a free order of garlic knots which didn't have a ton of garlic flavor but were buttery and had a good bit of parmesan on top. With the marinara sauce, they were very solid. All three pizzas I've tried have been out of this world. The crust is thin but still crispy, and the pizzas come out very fast (less than 10 minutes both visits). The only downside is the slightly higher price than other pizza places but the quality justifies it if you're looking for really good pizza.
