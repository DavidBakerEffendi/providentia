I would say we're not the ones to brag about breakfasts, but Marilynn and I were pretty impressed with lazy dogs server "Los" short for Carlos, he recommended the banana fosters French toast. Very good choice Marilynn stated. I had the breakfast club. WOW found a new place for biscuits breakfast sandwich. The experience was very relaxing and being outside by the fireplace in the patio, very romantic for an early bird date. Our bill was only $27.58 good value.
