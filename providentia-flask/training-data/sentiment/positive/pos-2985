This is a great place for grabbing a drink and getting some work done. I'm not really a coffee drinker, but the various iced teas I've had have always been good, and the Italian chocolate soda is one of my favorite drinks.

The pastries are always good, especially the "top tart" (described as "like a pop tart, but made with love").
