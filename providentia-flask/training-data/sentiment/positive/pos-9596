Finally a great quality pouting in HoMa. Decor is super cool industrial. The poutines are excellent. Personally the small was too small for my appetite and the large is a little more than i need so I usually go for the large. I tried the Szechwan poutine which was thankfully not spicy but very unique. The italian spaghetti sauce is home made so it has nice big chunks of tomatoes and onions. I am yet try the indian butter chicken poutine....I'll post pics of that...
