I'm SO sad they closed it.  I used to go to this BK because it's close to my work.  The staff is pretty bored but they are cool though.  I'm usually blasting them out with music so when I don't have it on they ask where the music is at.  They have gotten all my orders correct for the most part.  They could use some help at making sure the hamburgers are hotter because I would think they let the patties sit in the trays too long sometimes.  I'd like to see BK bring the debit card pin pads back at least inside because they accepted Android/Apple Pay previously.
