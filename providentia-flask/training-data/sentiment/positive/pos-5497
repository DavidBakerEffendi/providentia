Stopped in for a taco salad.. NEW FAVORITE PLACE. Carne asada meat tasted smoked and Mexican cheese made the best lunch I've had in a while.  Aka cartr, so pricey, taco salad with Carne was 9. Chips and salsa 3.50, and they charged me 2.00 for less than 2 ounces of "extra cheese".. that could be better.
