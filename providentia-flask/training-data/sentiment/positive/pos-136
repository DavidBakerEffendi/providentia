Just moved into the area and spotted cheese steak on their sign as we were driving by.  I got the famous cheese steak and my wife got the garlic chicken gyro with Greek fries.  

I have to say we were a little skeptical going into it as the variety of selection made us a little worried it wouldn't be that great.  Boy were we wrong!  

The famous cheese sauce and onions made this one off the better cheese steaks I've had outside of Philly.  I was too hap happy with my sandwich to try a bite off my wife's but she said it was very tasty.  And we were both surprised that the feta cheese and Greek dressing on fries went so well together.  My wife doesn't usually eat a lot of fries but this time the while container was empty!

Definite A+ for me and we will be going back for sure.
