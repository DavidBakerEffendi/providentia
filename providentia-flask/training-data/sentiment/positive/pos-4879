This is a review for their OUTSTANDING brunch.  I haven't been there at night yet.

The food is way better than you'd expect.  My friend and I both took pictures of our food ... that's how good it looked ... and it tasted even better.  Try the Breakfast Sandwich. YUM!

Their servers are incredibly nice.  Plus they have an amazing mimosa deal for brunch.  $12 for bottomless.  So good.  As a side note, we were impressed how clean the place was.  We imagine they had to clean up a fair amount from the crazy night before.

I feel like it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting packed on the weekends.  For now, it's a nice change of pace from RnR's weekend brunch party.
