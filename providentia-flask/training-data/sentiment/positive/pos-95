Experience: I have been here a few times and decided a review is long overdue. I love this restaurant, and one of my girls brought me here for a delayed birthday lunch. 

Facility:  This is small restaurant located in the middle of a strip mall. It's kinda a little divey, but the food is amazing, so who cares. They hVe table and chair seating. 

Service:  the wait staff are professional and extremely attentive. Sometimes they get busy, but they scan the room looking for anyone who need help, so just signal them over. 

Food: Thai is why I love this place. They have Korean and Chinese food, and even some Hawaiian influences. Such authentic flavors. 
My favorite thing to order is their combo plate. It has 3 different kinds of meat, Korean ribs, a teriyaki chicken and a beef in fried egg. All three are delicious!!! They serve it with white rice and macaroni salad.  They also serve some very good banchan with it!
I love their cucumber kimchi and seaweed noodles. I just really love this place. 

Overall:  they have great service and good authentic food. I will definitely be back many times!  I live close by too!  Lucky me. :P
