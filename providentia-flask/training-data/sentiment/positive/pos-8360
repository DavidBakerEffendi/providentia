Came here for lunch and I was blown away by the quality of the food, the inside decor (reminds me of Paris) and the service. Their salads are beyond fresh, large and the red wine vinaigrette is delicious! Their bread is so soft, fresh and delicious along with their muffins and carrot muffins. Absolutely delicious! It is all well placed and made to look humble yet fancy. It is all beyond amazing and for reasonable prices as well! 
The service was oh so kind, our waitress Georgia was incredibly kind, caring, and always made sure our drinks were filled to the top (so considerate for this harsh summer heat). We hardly had to wait for our food, and I must say, I was not expecting such outstanding service, quality and reasonable prices. I will definitely be coming back!
