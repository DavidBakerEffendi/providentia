We swung by here on Christmas morning to grab some bagels since Christmas Eve beget leftover smoked salmon. Bagels and lox? Yes, please. My relatives raved about this place, and rightly so because they weren't the only ones! It was packed when we ducked in around 9, but we ended up making it through the line fairly quickly. Service all along the way was great.

The bagels themselves are delicious. They were so chewy and doughy that I just wanted to eat more and more (but I didn't.) The cream cheese was very fresh and delicious as well. We opted for plain and the cheddar and garlic, and needless to say, it's hard to pick a favorite as they were both excellent.

Best. Bagels. Ever.
