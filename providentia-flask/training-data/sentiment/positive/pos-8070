Art of flavors was a yelp-induced-fly-by-trip.  We were driving around the other side of vegas in the downtown area, and then we went to do our nails (it was a car full of girls) and then after the nail spa session, gelato took over our brains.  Yelp provided us 'art of flavors' and while the pictures of the shop itself were A-ok, the pictures of the ice cream/gelato won us over.  

The inside isn't the best ice cream shop you've ever seen, not too much frills going on.  But they don't need any.  Taste that gelato! 

Everything we sampled was delicious, but I've never tasted a pistachio as good as this.  So I went with the waffle cone + pistachio ice cream.  I still think about it.  I need to go back, soon.
