Love this place! The people are extremely friendly and helpful, the prices are more than reasonable for the quality of food, and the food itself is terrific. I have brought several friends and family to Cove Trattoria and not one person has been anything but thankful for finding this place. Have not had anything but a great meal here, from their burger to the lobster ravioli.
