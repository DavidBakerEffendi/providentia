Great Wing Spot! 

This little joint is run by a small lovely family. They have great deals that has me coming back. No idea why people are complaining, the price is so cheap. You try finding a place near by which gives this amount of food for that price. Friend and I always come here for their wings, fries and pop deal. Their honey garlic is to DIE for. Great place to grab a quick bite. Will probably be there tomorrow....
