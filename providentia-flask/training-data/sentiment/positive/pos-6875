I can really imagine how good the food is at home in Wong family! So eating at Pan Asian will only give me a slight taste of their kitchen at home! 

We tried the Pad Thai and Pork ribs w/ XO sauce. Both were delicious. I love how spicy the pad Thai was and I only had a level 3. My only complaint was that the noodles were kinda stuck together. 

The pork ribs were wonderful and savory! The ribs were slightly crispy on the outside and nicely tender on the outside. 

David Wong himself served us and he was very nice and funny!

I really enjoyed it here and can't wait to come back and try their pho!
