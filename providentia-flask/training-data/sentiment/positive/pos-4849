UPDATE: Wahoo's just released a specialty cocktail menu and their Absolut Mules are where it's at! Perfectly balanced and not overwhelming with ginger. We also tried the enchiladas with green sauce- zesty and creamy; much better than the red sauce in my opinion. I also tried their classic fish taco and it was fantastic as well, loaded with fish fillet and the slaw compliments the spice of the fish really well.

I'm so happy we gave Wahoo's another shot, they did not disappoint the second time.
