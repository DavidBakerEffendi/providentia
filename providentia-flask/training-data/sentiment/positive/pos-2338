Nancy B's might be the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  On our way to Kennywood, my friend insisted that we stop here for some chocolate chip cookies.  I have lived in enough places to know that everyone has a favorite chocolate chip cookie so I usually have low expectations.  Yelpers, Nancy B's might actually be THE BEST chocolate chip cookie I have ever eaten.  We ordered two chocolate chips cookies ($1.50 each), and they were bigger than my hand.  The cookie dough is delicious and not too sweet with just the right amount of chocolate.  I cannot describe the perfection, you just need to go out of your way to get one of these cookies.  These cookies are exceptionally comparable to Levain's in New York City, but they charge $4 per cookie.  Clearly, Nancy B's is a gem.  Get here as soon as you can.
