I've been coming to Tokyo Express for YEARS! About 24ish years to give you an idea. Everything is always as expected. I always order the teriyaki chicken with brown rice and a couple small salads and it always comes the exact same. Service is always pleasant. This particular location needs a remodel but it doesn't take away from the food at all.  I Love Tokyo Express!
