I've been trying to find the right combination of platters for a perfect Peruvian meal. The last feeding that took place was "great success"!

We start right off the bat with fish ceviche, mussels, and a side order of cilantro rice.  The ceviche and mussels are always on point.  The fish ceviche had a perfect acidic marinade to it. The tomato and onion garnish was always refreshing everytime I inhaled a mussel. The cilantro rice combos well with these two appetizers. I can easily get full off of these orders.

I always get the beef kabobs. They are always tender.  Whatever they marinate the kabobs in, tends to make it a tad bit salty. I think it's supposed to be on the salty side.  Whatever it is, it makes me keep ordering it whenever I'm feeding there. I'd like to order something else, but those damn kabobs man...

Great Success!!!
