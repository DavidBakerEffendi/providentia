Found this place through yelp, came here for lunch and brought a coworker. The staff was great, very friendly mom-pop Chicago based taco place.
I ordered 4 tacos and all of them were amazing. I love love the yellow corn tortillas versus the white and they serve yellow here. Yellow tortillas have a better taste. 
I ordered lengua, chile relleno, al pastor, barbacoa, tripitas. My favorite was barbacoa, the tender and well spiced meat is my favorite personally. 
The ambient was great, upbeat music, top 40 which I really liked. The cook was dancing and singing along to Taylor Swift and I'm a fan!! I would totally come back here, tacos are great!
