OMG! I came here the first time when they did not have the AYCE.

This is truly the best Korean BBQ (AYCE and A LA CARTE) in Las Vegas!

Not only are the dishes traditionally prepared, but the beef is high quality (USDA prime), and the rest of the meat is excellent in quality. The price is a little bit more than many of the other Korean BBQs in town, but truthfully, just try the AYCE and pick many of their dishes. I suggest getting the steamed egg, bean soup, extra kimchi, brisket, bulgogi, ribeye, and marinated pork and chicken for the end, so it does not ruin the flavor of the non-marinated dishes.

I highly suggest planning to spend 1.5 - 2 hours here as it takes a little longer to get your food, let alone cook it.
