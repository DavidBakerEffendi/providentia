Came on a Groupon; super tasty, but if you're looking for real Spanish tapas, this isn't it.  It's more like Sushi fusion, but I love Sushi so it was great. What I liked about it, is you really got a sense of the chef's personality; every dish seemed original and custom. 

My favorite thing was this yellow tail "shot", I forget the exact name but it was really good. Next time I might just get 10 of those and call it a day. The food was all high end presentation, and much of it layered the flavors so your taste buds went on a real journey. 

The restaurant itself is pretty bare-bones, and has a sushi bar vibe, there is an actual sushi bar you can sit at. The walls have no art, and I feel like some old school Japanese art work, side by side with something more contemporary would  really take the vibe to the next level. Wait staff was super nice, and we didn't have to wait long. 

I will definitely be back and choose this spot rather than chain or conventional sushi spots moving forward. Cheers.
