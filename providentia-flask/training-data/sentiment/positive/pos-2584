Eat and drink they have it all ... Well let's just say our tacos were pretty darn good I love spice and yep they hit the spot...  had the Juan famous tacos shredded chicken and chorizo  comes with a spicy jalape√±o cream salsa and we order the habanero cream salsa also and let me tell you it was really good if you love spice with great flavor. They do have other thing on the menu that aren't spicy I asked for what was the spices thing that was good.. 
Nice fun atmosphere really makes you feel like you were in Mexico. they have corn Hole ,  4 foot connect four and beer pong. So in my opinion a good place to eat and drink just a fun all around place..
