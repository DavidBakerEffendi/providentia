Great spot just across the street from LeMeac.  Fantastic coffee selection including recently roasted Blue Mountain and a number of local providers, a huge chocolate selection including many of the best hard to find artisan brands, a diverse collection of coffee grinders and brewing mechanisms from Siphon to Chemex to French Press, and a helpful staff more than capable of discussing the virtues of their various sources of maple syrup, vinegar, olive oil, meats, and cheeses.  Prices are high end, but worth it.
