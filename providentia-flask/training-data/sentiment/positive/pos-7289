These guys deserve mega props for serving up amazing food full of love and goodness! It's been a while since I've had such wholesome eats out on the town. You know that feeling when you get filled up not only on some kinda savoury wonder but also on the overflowing good energy of the people who prepared it? That's this place and this food. I could go on about how genuinely cool and legit these guys are, but I'll get to the deets on the cuisine. 

The menu options are straight up: you can have a choice of about five different rotis (including vegan options), and/or jerk (also including vegan options), as well as some awesome sides, like a thick and hearty corn soup. The whole thing is real-deal Trinidadian fare, and serious kudos to the owner and the chef!! They were swapping recipes through the kitchen door when we were there. 

Because we were so appreciative (as in, moaning in bliss while eating every bite), they gave us some other treats to try, too, like a combo of sweet potato and pumpkin with tamarind sauce, and some of the jack fruit that makes a convincing meat substitute. 

There is no way to go wrong here - it's ALL good. Go, now! Culture yourself. Feel the love in your belly. Plus, the plants on the shelf have names.
