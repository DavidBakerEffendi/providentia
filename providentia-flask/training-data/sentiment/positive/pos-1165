After a cumulation of a 38 Day Road Trip,  I decided I was going to finish it off  with a fantastic meal . 

So, I went to the Black Bear Diner. But,I was a bit surprised that when I walked in, I got seated almost immediately, as there is usually a little bit of a weight based on what I've seen and driving by. 

At first, when the waitress handed me the paper, I was still waiting for a menu. Turns out, the paper is the menu. Whoops. 

Well, my waitress, introduced herself, even though she was wearing a name tag a rare occurrence in the restaurant industry nowadays on both. 

Well, I order the tri-tip combo with a salad, corn, and Redskin mashed potatoes. But, what did surprise me, was it when she asked if I wanted beef gravy, or turkey gravy. Apparently, people do order a beef dish with turkey gravy (In my opinion, that's like having a diet soda with a jelly-filled donut). And, blackberry cobbler ala mode (vanilla bean ice creamk for dessert. 

As you can see by the pictures, it looks absolutely delicious period and taste even better! 

And, to make it even better, there was enough left over to take home to give me a second dinner.

 Great food, and excellent service. Thanks again Sarah, and the other two waitresses one who seated me, and one who brought me my meal.

Well no fault of the restaurants, the one thing that really bugs me is their location. It's just south of the freeway, and between the poorly time traffic signals, only one way to go when coming out, and a couple of areas where no u-turns are allowed, getting there and leaving, can be a bit irritating.
