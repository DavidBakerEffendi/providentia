Went here in search of a hearty breakfast and man did I find it. I've had many Country Fried Steak in my life however the Green Chile Country Fried Steak was amazing. My friend enjoyed the Steak and Eggs which like any good "Ranch" worded restaurants would try to pull off, Ranch House Grilled Steak was fantastically cooked and very flavorful. I went for the biscuits and gravy on the side which like the rest of the meal, came in a generous portion. Hash browns were crispy as I ordered and the service was excellent. I also met the owner who was very friendly. Support this place, it's worth the dime to dine.
