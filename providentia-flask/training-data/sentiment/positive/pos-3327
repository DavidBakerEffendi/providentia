Anthony was totally amazing!!! 5 stars for him all the way. His energy the whole night was amazing. He kept us laughing, cracked jokes, what I really liked was he paid close attention to what we were and were not eating. It was quite obvious he wanted us to enjoy the experience. He is the best waiter I've ever had the pleasure of dining with. 
      It was pretty exciting eating in the dark, fumbling around trying to find things. Though I don't believe the price is fitting it's a great experience for a date.
