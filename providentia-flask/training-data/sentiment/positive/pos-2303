I am upgrading my review from the first time I visited Chaat cafe. 

The owner has been very open about listening to all issues customers had and have improved service tremendously. Food here is awesome. And I can say it because I have been visiting this place almost very week from the time it opened. Quality of food has consistently been good. The service is now fast and efficient. The place is always nice, inviting and clean. 

For anyone who hasn't tried this place yet. I would say you are missing out. Their chole bhatura and puri chole are out of this world. They have a variety of paranthas that are super yum. Very home made feeling. The stuffing were in abundance and the parantha itself was thin and very very fresh. Someone in the kitchen at Chaat cafe is cooking with a lot of love. 

Give this place a try. I assure you, it will be your go to Indian restaurant in Madison!!! It surely has become ours.
