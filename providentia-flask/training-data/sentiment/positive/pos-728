We were just passing in by, my bf spotted this place. I'm Portuguese he's not but we love Portuguese food. I was craving bife a casa. So we said why not, we sat down the place was empty was about 5 Saturday evening. The lady was nice. We got bread and butter very fresh. We got our big plates. So the menu says it's 10oz meat, covered in house chips. The chips were incredibly thin like lays chips. My bf didn't like that, I thought it was okay they gave you a lot even though, I still enjoyed it. I dug through the chips to finally get to the meat and it was little. It was thin and long. I cut into it took my first bite and was in love. It was very yummy I had no fat on my meat it was tender, not chewy or over done. I asked for medium well it was the most perfect piece of meet. I just wish there was more! We have big appetites this would have not filled us up in its own but we had gelato across the street after. We would come back it's our number 2 choice for bife a casa! Banaboia is number one still
