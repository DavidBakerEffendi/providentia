OK, all I had was oatmeal and coffee so I can't tell you if the rest of the food is fabulous or not.  But the coffee was very good and the oatmeal, which I eat in lots of places, was very very good. 

Service was great.  The interior is really cute.  I was put off for a long time by the drive thru -- assuming this place was a fast food place.  But nope.  I will go back. 

Oh, if you have a "frequent bladder" you might wanna take a pass.  I didn't use the restroom but it appears to be "out back".  I never like leaving the building to wash my hands or use the facilities.
