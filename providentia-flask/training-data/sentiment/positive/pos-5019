I thought that I had already found the perfect sandwich when I went to Quizno's, but I was way wrong.  Jimmy John's brings lunch to a whole new level with the freshest bread I have ever tasted.

My sandwich was overflowing with ingredients from the delectable guacamole spread to the sprouts, amazing turkey, and cucumbers of the #12 (Beach Club).

I was delighted that a pickle was one of the side choices in the combo (the other options were chips or a cookie -- and the jalapeno chips that my friend ordered were excellent) and it was HUGE.

Service was fast with an assembly line of folks churning out these sandwiches with extreme precision and never missing a beat on preparing gourmet selections.

I wish this place existed where I live, since I'd be a frequent customer.  If you're craving a delicious sandwich on bread that was baked today, you must try Jimmy John's.
