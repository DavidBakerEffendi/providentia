What a great gem in Thornhill! Delicious authentic Italian food from start to finish. The restaurant is spacious with a modern decor, and there is a private room at the back which is great for parties and events

For our visit, we had:
Caprese - The bocconcini di bufala was amazing, as was the vine riped tomatoes

Carpaccio Di Manzo - great starter as well. My companion doesn't usually eat anything raw but she liked this!

Bosco Pizza (mozzarella, pancetta, cremini mushrooms, truffle oil and parsley) - simply delicious and I loved the fact that it's densely packed with toppings. The crust on the pizza was amazing!

Pappardelle alla Boscaiola (egg noodles with wild mushrooms and lamb ragu) - great meat sauce on this one, and the pasta was cooked perfectly

Scialateilli allo stile Amalfitana - a nice seafood pasta with a pasta that is unique to the Amalfi coast (nice chew and thickness to it!) 

Gnocchi Verde - Spinach based gnocchi with gongozola cream and pistacchio. Absolutely deliciocus! I would say this is a must get!

Scottadito alla romana - Lamb chops that are presented nicely on a wooden board, with rapini, potatoes and fried onions. Great portion size on this one!

All the pasta and pizzas are made fresh in-house and I could really taste the difference. Service was friendly thoroughtout the night and at a pace that we didn't feel rushed. 

Overall we really enjoyed our visit and would not hesitate to recommend this place for anyone looking to dine in the Thornhill area.
