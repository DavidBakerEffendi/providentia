This place is absolutely amazing. I found it when I use to go to the gym right by it. The owners are so sweet and the wife is Thai, so you know the Thai tea is authentic! The savory crepes are delectable and it was the first time I every tried non-sweet crepes. I wasn't disappointed. The portions are huge! I brought my brother and sister, my mom. They all love it as much as I do! Go try it now.
