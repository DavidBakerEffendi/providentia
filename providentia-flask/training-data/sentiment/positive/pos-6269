I've heard of this concept, but never thought it would come to Vegas or it would be vegan. I went with my husband last night and it was the coolest experience ever. The staff was amazing and instantly made you feel comfortable sitting in a dark room. My husband was worried about the food but once he tried the first course he was happy and excited. Not being able to see your food and only rely on touch, smell and taste to figure out what it is was fun- now I know how babies feel trying foods for the first time. It was interesting discovering the different textures and trying to place all the flavors. It heightens your other senses. It's really a fun experience although kind of scary at first being led into a dark room to dine. But it's so freeing being invisible from the other diners and even yourself. The food was amazing I would definitely recommend this place.
