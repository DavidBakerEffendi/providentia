Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I got takeout from Biaggio's today - chicken wings, meatball calzone, and antipasto salad.  It was all terrific!  

The calzones have both ricotta and mozzarella inside, which I love!  It's huge and comes with a great side of marinara sauce.  The crust is awesome as well as the meatballs inside. The chicken wings stayed crispy and hot all the way home and came with both hot sauce and ranch dressing.  And the antipasto salad comes with a generous amount of cheese, salami, chickpeas, olives, tomatoes, red peppers and pepperoncinis.  I highly recommend the homemade creamy Italian dressing.  Yum!

The only bummer is that they close at 9pm on weekdays and 10pm on weekends.  Closed Sundays.  Late night eaters will be missing out.  Unless you can make it until 7am when they open again.

They will deliver anywhere ($3 charge - which is consistent with other pizza places around) and next time I will likely get delivery and re-review.

Biaggio is super nice and friendly!  He says if you aren't happy, he'll make it right. But don't take advantage of him people!  We need him to stay!
