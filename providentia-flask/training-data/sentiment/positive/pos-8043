I really like this place. It originated in California where I'm from so I try to stop in here now and then when I'm in the area. There are several scattered around the valley but none in Central Phoenix. 

Iced dark chocolate latte is my favorite, rain or shine! Their blended drinks are really good too! 

If you get a blended drink, try it "ultimate" where they will blend in chocolate covered coffee beans. Yum!

It's usually quiet. Nice furniture. Great place to get some work done. Free wi-fi. 

Enjoy!
