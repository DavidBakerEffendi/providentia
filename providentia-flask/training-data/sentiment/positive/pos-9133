First I'd like to say the portions are huge... Food taste pretty good.... the decor was a little tacky... but overall it was good... Service was fast and our waitress was great... Got there around 9:30 and only had a 5 min wait.  But when we left people were lined out the door and there was barely any parking.. glad we went there based on yelpers!
