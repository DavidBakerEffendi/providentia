Awesome, this is my new favorite steak house. Must have is the Bone-In Rib Eye. It was to die for. Also the Sea Scallop dish was amazing if you are looking for something smaller/lighter. The atmosphere was perfect, the staff were incredibly friendly, our waiter Zachary was the best. The wine was delicious , we had crab stuffed mushrooms to start which were phenomenal. The entrees were perfect and the sides were excellent. Definitely recommend the creamed corn and the lobster mashed potatoes (mixed together=perfection). The decor was beautiful and our booth was cozy and comfortable, a great place for date night. The manager even brought us glasses of champagne on the house. Loved this place! We will definitely be back!
