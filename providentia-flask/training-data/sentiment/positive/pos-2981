Great Food... don't judge a book by the cover. Their food was was great. I ordered the hibachi chicken and rice, with soup and salad. My meal was 8.95 with no drink. The waiter was very sharp. We only waited 6 mins for our food. The decor is not updated but the food and service was A1. I plans to go here from again and take my husband... oh wait forgot to tell you I had a small sake for $4.85 & got 4 1/2 drinks out of it. This place gives you enough food to share. My Friday night was done after eating here. Next time I go, I'll make sure I have no where to go afterwards
