I recently dined at RM seafood in the downstairs area. Husband and I shared a bottle of white wine (a shame really since their bartender JR Starkus is well-renown) and a selection of extremely fresh and delicious oysters.

For the main course I chose the halibut with fennel and apple, it was sublime. Hubby got the cioppino, which was huge! 

We were too full for dessert, but I will return to try the chef's sapler and Rick's tasting game, where you have to guess what flavor ice cream you are eating, blindfolded!
