Best place for Irish food.
Great ambience, the selection of beers is excellent (having Murphys on tap sold it for me).  We came during happy hour half off all food and beer - best happy hour ever!
Nice outside patio area to hang out.  
Coming from England this is the best approximation to an English/Irish pub I have come across so far in Phoenix.
