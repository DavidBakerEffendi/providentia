Pretty awesome setup they have in there! The way the lighting hits everything, it definitely make the whole place feel very chic. Friend brought me here as we were looking for more organic, natural food after a movie. We found it, that's for sure! He had the salmon and veggies, which was a good helping. He said the flavors were all just right. I had the spicy tuna banh mi with side salad. Very delicious although didn't feel too authentically Vietnamese. However they never claimed it was and I'm sure the chef put his/her own twist on it. Very friendly service from Gabby and we appreciated the whole experience. Would recommend for drinks, food, and/or good social time!
