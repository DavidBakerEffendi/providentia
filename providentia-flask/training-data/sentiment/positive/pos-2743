First time and loved it!! It was awesome. Most of the staff was really nice. Nice atmosphere! The food was amazing. We love a good steak and whoever was back there cooking won the prize! Holy cow! The cheese sauce on the Philly cheesesteak...I could just eat that...lol. Sooooo good! We will be back!!
