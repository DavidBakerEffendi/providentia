5/5 for food. Everything is homemade here and the pizzas are made to order with hand stretched dough. Proper thin crust Italian pizzas with very generous toppings. Saw the table next to ours ordered the charcuterie board, which looked amazing. Pasta is also really really good.

5/5 for service. The manager really cares about its customers and takes the chance to greet them when she can. Service is friendly.

Posh decorations with marble and pastel colors. Gets busy on Fridays but noise level is still kept at bay. (And may I say the bathroom smells so good!)
