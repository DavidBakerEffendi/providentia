RM Seafood was truly a wonderful dining experience!!  This place is expensive to be sure - but worth every delicious penny!

First - the service is fantastic.  Literally - these people are well seasoned and know exactly how much attention to give and when to give it.  A+++

The food - simply wonderful.  We had the following:
Charred Octopus appetizer - Simply delicious - every bite was a treat!!
BLT Salad -hubby loved it - said it was the perfect blend.
Foie Gras appetizer - hubby lost his mind - said it was the best ever!
Grilled Black Cod entrée - sooooo good - and corn puree - divine!!
Crab ménage a trois - hubby loved every bite - expensive but worth it!
Broccolini side - delicious made with garlic and olive oil.
BBQ Pork Mac & Cheese - Wow - blew our mind - beyond amazing!!

We also had a few of their specialty cocktails and some white wine.  All good.

The setting - very nice - just outside the Mandalay Bay casino - nice booths and candles.  Not gorgeous, but very nice.

Overall - a well deserved five stars.  We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas.
