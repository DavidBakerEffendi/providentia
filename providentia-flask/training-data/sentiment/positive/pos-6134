If you want to feel like being in Tainan, Taiwan, this is the place! 

My go to dishes are
1. Fried Pork Rib over Rice 炸排骨飯
2. Vegetarian Tofu over Rice 豆腐飯
3. Fried Chicken Cutlet over Rice 炸雞排飯

Friend had Coffin Toast 棺材板 and said it was good as well! P.S. From their Instagram page:  Starting Monday (7/2/18), we'll have an Afternoon Tea Set including one 16oz Iced drink and Taiwanese style thick toast for only $6!! Come in between 2-5 to try~~~

Don't forget their section of milk tea, brewed tea, and fruit teas!
