So maybe I'm easy to please.. but In N Out is my personal favorite burger spot in Vegas.

It's actually my favorite "fast food" restaurant.

Parking: 

is good, and this location's pretty safe. Star 1 :]

Cleanliness:

When it's not super busy & under staffed, In N Out is usually well maintained (including the restroom) so.. Star 2 :]

Service:

Staff members are always well mannered & greets always with a smile.. Star 3! :]

Food:

Double double with fries cooked to tasty goodness.. & a neopolitan shake from real ice cream? Star 4.

Atmosphere:

It's casual, and I love the laid back feeling when I'm going to devour something tasty. Star 5.

I wish there was a location near Red Rock Casino! ;D
