The Kahuku style shrimp was so delicious, I ate it in my car before heading into work. The delicious aroma of shrimp & garlic escaping from the container was driving me insane. I devoured the shrimp & rice in the parking lot of the office. I saved the mac salad for later. Which was eagerly devoured. I will return again for more ono eats. Soon. Mahalo!
