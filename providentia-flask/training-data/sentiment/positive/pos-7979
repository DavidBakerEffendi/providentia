Byblos might be considered by some to be the oldest city in the world, but to me, it's one of the BEST, BEST, BEST places to get a damn falafel pita in AZ. 

It's just a small little restaurant, but it's fantastic. Oh the vegetarian moussaka, the greek salad, the feta dip- how I miss you.  It's just so far away from where I live now, that I never got over to that side of town and it breaks my heart.

I know this restaurant has won all kinds of "Best of" awards, but I'm not sure for what exactly, but no matter what you choose, I'm positive you'll love this place too.
