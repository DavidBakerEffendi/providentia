Enter. Be really impressed by what the restaurant looks like inside. Be seated. Review the menu. Ask the servers what will be good for your tastes. They will astound you with awesome presentation, aroma and taste. Let the server select a wine for you... or let them pick glasses of wine that are appropriate. By all means enjoy a dessert.

Interact with the servers. Have fun. You will have a great time and enjoy food that is uniquely of the Rubino's creation. We have had a great time at Zoom, Rain and AME as the Rubino brothers change your opinion of Japanese restaurants.

It is not rocket science, but the food is really innovative and delicious.

I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
