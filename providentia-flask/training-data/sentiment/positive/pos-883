I went through the drive-thru yesterday and was served by Angel. She truly is an angel. I had a "oh no what did I do because I haven't had my coffee yet" moment. Angel went over and above to fix MY problem. She was quick and courteous and I had my corrected order in under two minutes. She is a star employee.
