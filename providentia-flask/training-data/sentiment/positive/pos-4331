Ordered the Chipotle chicken wrap and fries with gravy. Was super delicious and would order it again in a heartbeat.  She forgot my side of coleslaw but ordered it to go with my leftovers. Service was very slow but personally I was not in a rush so I didn't mind. Would come back here again for sure.
