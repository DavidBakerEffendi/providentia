This place is a delight. I have been coming here since 2005 and its a hidden little gem in a strip mall on Rural and University next to the FedEx Office. The staff is friendly and always ask me how I'm doing and how work is going. The food is delicious. They do a great lunch buffet every weekday from 11am to 2:30pm - til 3pm on the weekends - and the variety keeps me coming back. The items on the vegetarian portion of the buffet change every day. Yes the buffet is divided by vegetarian and meat options, which make a good place to take those of the non meat persuasion. On any given day, you could try some great spicy vegetable biryani, some delicious lentils or dal, some creamy and savory palak. Or it could be vegetable korma, aloo ghobi, bombay potaties, aloo eggplant, vegetables, pakoras, salad and more.

The meat portions of the buffet always includes the best chicken tikka masala in the Valley (even better at dinner!), yummy tandoori chicken, and a selection of curries, from goat to chicken and lamb vindaloo.

At dinner, the menu is more family style, where you get a large portion of the item and and you can order naan or rice on the side. The menu is more expansive at dinner, includes items like chicken biryani, which is delighful and many more curries and types of aloo. There's a few times Ive made extra rice at home and come just to pick up some tikka to take home and got comped the rice. At lunch, they give you endless naan as well.

Ambiance wise, they recently redid the interior with murals depicting India and its very inviting.

Bottom line, great staff, lovely decor and ambiance. Delicious food at dinner and lunch make this place well worth checking out.
