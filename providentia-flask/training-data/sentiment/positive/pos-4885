This place is great for cheap and fast Japanese style food. The sushi is not premium level but it's still great for the price. I was pleasantly surprised at the great value this place offered especially with sushi and sake. I think we've found our favorite place for a simple, casual, fast bite for those Tuesday night's when you don't want to cook. It's a great place and you should try it out. It won't break the bank so it's worth trying at least once.
