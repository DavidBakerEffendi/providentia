No idea where all these terrible reviews keep coming from?! 
I almost didn't go because of how many people complained, but I'm really glad I did.

Disregard all previous reviews, I will give you reality. 

This place is fantastic! Perfect for weekend late night! 

The sandwich I had was the cheese, egg, bacon. 

It was delicious, and loaded with bacon. 
The egg was cooked perfectly, and the bun was soft and fluffy. 

The customer service was friendly, and I was greeted with a smile! 

The prices are a bit steep, but cmon man... you're in Las Vegas, on the strip, and in the Cosmo. 
Next door are $6 tacos, I think we can all afford to shell out $8 for a damn good egg sandwich! 

GET THAT EGG SANDWICH AND THANK ALVIN FOR BLESSING US WITH HIS CREATIONS IN VEGAS.
