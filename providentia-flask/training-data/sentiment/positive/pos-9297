Absolutely amazing!!!

Delicious food with beautiful presentations, nice ambiance, super friendly staff and excellent services!! We had the four course 'Yu' tasting menu with a complimentary chef's dessert, every single dish was to die for. So here's a bit of recap:

1st course - seared halibut 
2nd course - trio of sashimi - tuna tartar, Japanese amberjack, and Japanese sea scallops
3rd course - 'grill your own steak' (you literally get your personal japanese styled grill and started cooking however the way you want your meat to be!
4th course -  sushi nigiri - blue fin tuna, atlantic trout, white shrimp, japanese horse mackerel, toro (tuna's belly) and one other japanese fish that I couldn't remember the name...
dessert - housemade pudding/custard with many kinds of fresh fruit - YUMMMM!!

What we had today might not be yours even if you ask for the same four course tasting menu because the chef receives different fish and other ingredients based on availability and seasons, but no matter what you have, i'm sure it'll be just as amazing.

Oh, please do not expect to see little bottles of soy sauce on the table, everything is perfectly seasoned upon arriving at  our table, all you got is to enjoy it :)

I can't wait to go back!!!
