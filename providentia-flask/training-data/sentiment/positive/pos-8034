This is a hidden gem in Las Vegas and we are glad we found our new favorite place for Mexican food. We are definitely coming back and bringing friends & family when they come to town. 

We ordered the char - broiled chicken which reminded me of my mom's barbecue back home. We also had the 2 green Chile pork enchiladas. Did I mention the delicious chips & salsa you get once you get seated.

BTW, service was excellent. From the hostess to busser & our waiter was very friendly & informative.
