I stopped in to this local joint craving some Greek food on my lunch break. (Hello, pregnant salty cravings!) I grabbed a gyros pita with fries and a side of garlic sauce, which I honestly could've inhaled. The fries smelled so amazing I had to eat them in my car dipped in the heavenly garlic sauce. (Aren't fries what make or break a restaurant?!)

The pita sandwich was awesome: simple, full of flavorful gyro meat, savory tzatziki, and veggies. The entire meal was almost too much for me, and I'm an eater. 

Highly recommend this place for their friendly service, crispy fries, and big portions!
