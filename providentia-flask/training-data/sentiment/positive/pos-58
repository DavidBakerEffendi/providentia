Stumbled upon this spot with the hubby.... for starters they have some amazing bottomless complimentary salsa, that has just the right amount of spice. But I wasn't ready for the amazing flavor packed into the "Too Big Taco Salad"! Amazeballs! I mean this salad was amazing and one of the best taco salads that I've ever had. I know some of you may be thinking "a salad,REALLY", but this was no mediocre taco salad. There was a layer of tortillas at the base, but not your ordinary tortillas. These tortillas were thick cut and super crispy to withstand all of the flavors atop of it. Next there was black beans, queso cheese, romaine lettuce, fresh cut sweet corn, tomatoes, chilli lime dressing and I topped mine with a piece of grilled chicken. Yoooooooo.... this salad was foodilicious!
