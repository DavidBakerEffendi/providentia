Loved the purple rice.  The rolls are beautifully arranged and at a good price.  Sushi in this area are usually overpriced and small.  My friend and I ordered two rolls each, miso, and edamame (miso and edamame free with yelp check in!).  Way too much food for the two of us.  I will be back for sure!
