I seriously love perfect pair! The atmosphere is super laid back and super cute. Their food is really great too! The last few times I've gone I've gotten the peanut coconut curry quinoa bowl. The first time I asked for the sauce on the side (not knowing if I'd like the sauce or not) it's great! It's kinda spicy but it's really good, the curry flavor really stands out without being overpowering. The dish comes with quinoa, cauliflower, broccoli, roasted red peppers and cabbage. I asked for it with shrimp and they absolutely do not skimp on the added protein which I love! The shrimps are large, juicy and extremely fresh. The second time I got the peanut coconut curry mixed in. It comes pretty heavy on the sauce so the second time it hurt my stomach a tad so I recommend it on the side. My friend got the Toni's perfect pasta. It's rigatoni with zucchini, spinach and mushrooms. It was seriously to die for. (I ate more of it than he did!) The sauce was rich and creamy, topped with cheese like how much better can a pasta dish get? Service is always super nice and helpful as well!! I love perfect pear and will be back soon!
