Absolutely amazing food and service. Searched Yelp, and saw the great reviews. We got the lunch specials. DW fried rice, which had shrimp and chicken in it, as well as spicy red curry with shrimp. 

Both were so flavorful. I have never had such good fried rice. The staff was super friendly, and the place is very clean and inviting.
