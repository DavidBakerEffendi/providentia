This is quite possibly the best Thai food I've ever eaten.

I'm from North Dakota, so I don't have many options...but still.  I dated a girl from Thailand many years ago, so I've tried my share of the cuisine.  And this place is solid.

Everything I've tried here has been outstanding.  Pleasant presentation, complex flavors.

The owners are very kind and take great care in making sure the customer has a good experience.

One last thing:  be careful with the spice levels.  I had to convince Mr. Wong into letting me have the panang curry at level 5.  It was probably the equivalent of a 7 or 8 at other places in town.  My parents had take out recently and ordered at level 7 - that couldn't have gone well!  :)

Stop by if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed.
