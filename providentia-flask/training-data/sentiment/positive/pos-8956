I am extremely picky about Thai Curry, and since moving here my wife and I hadn't been able to find a place with suitable curry. Until Tum Nak! This place absolutely nails everything that is right about Thai Curry: the creaminess, the balance of spice and salt, the sticky rice. I was thoroughly impressed and will be returning often. Plus, the lunch specials are under $6, which is incredible.
