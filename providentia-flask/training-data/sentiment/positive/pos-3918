Mmmmm another great experience at Pizzaria Libretto. I have only been to the Ossington location and this was my first time at the Danforth location. I love how it looked inside or the restaurant and the food was delicious. We had the arugula and kale salad to start, both fresh and delicious. As an entre I had the sausage pizza, it had the perfect spice and I am a sucker for their tomato sauce. I can't wait to indulge in a pizza dinner again!
