Great midtown spot to hit weather it's for a group gathering on the patio or to just belly up to the bar for lunch, dinner and or libations.  Ryan, Megan and the rest of the staff are extremely service oriented, and really know their stuff!   At this point I believe I have tried almost the whole menu.  The stand outs for me would be the roasted veggie plate, and the wings for the small plates, and as far as main courses go the Pork Chop and the Foie Gras are both on point.  The carmelized bananas are off the chart.  At the end of your time at Joes, the bill comes in Garbage Pail Kids Books and it makes for a fun ending to the outing.  Go try this place!
