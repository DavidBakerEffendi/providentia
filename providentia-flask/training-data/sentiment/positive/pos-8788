This place was UN REAL!!!! The decor is very evening appropriate (it's quite dark) but very nice. The service was good and the food was un. Believable. SO. GOOD!! I got a dish with vegan duck and I swear if someone would of told me it's real duck I would of believed them. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. I highly recommend this place for vegans and non-vegans, I think anyone would love it.
