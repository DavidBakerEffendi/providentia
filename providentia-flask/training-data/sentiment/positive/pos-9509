This place was amazing! Went for lunch and ordered from the happy hour menu. Great selections! Everything had great seasoning which is a big thing for me. I love flavor!! We had a chance to meet the owner/manager and he was very welcoming. Thank you we enjoyed our meal! Will definitely be back for dinner.:)
