Wowzers! This place. First, I checked in with Yelp (of course) and saw that Lazy Dog has a free with check in item and I love when a place does that, it is a thank you for being here type of thing I love!
The waiter was fantastic, made us feel right at home, explained the menu, was prompt and attentive.
The food.. AMAZING! I had the chicken salad sandwich, and my husband had the chicken dinner. We never have dessert, but we thought why not? WOW! SMORE was also incredible! Have the dessert, life is short, so just do it.
They have a patio, where your best pal (doggo) can also come and hang out, very European.
Lazy Dog is large inside. Bring all of your friends. The restaurant is clean, the waitstaff was knowledgeable/helpful/amazing!    
What are you waiting for? Get in here!
