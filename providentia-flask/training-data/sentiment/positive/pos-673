GB Hand-pulled Noodles serves Chinese-style hand-pulled noodles (in soup) and they do it well. For the uninitiated this is distinct from Japanese ramen, Vietnamese pho and Hong Kong-style wonton noodles. The noodles are made to order (they literally make it right in front of you) so you are always getting the freshest stuff available!

The noodles are chewy and there is a lot of choice between the sizes you want (from thin as a rubber band to thick as a sheet of lasagna). There is also a good amount of noodles in each bowl; but having gotten the "MEGA" size, I feel like it is not actually a lot more than the large. The soup base is very flavorful and compliments the noodles very well, so make sure you get a spoonful of soup every time you eat some of the noodles (that is how you're supposed to eat noodles-in-soup anyways!). I will admit that the soup base is slightly salty, but that may be personal preference as none of my friends have ever had problems with it. The beef slices are very soft and tender and also taste great. Overall, they do everything right here and the price that you pay for what you get is well worth it (especially considering this is probably one of the only hand-pulled noodle places in the downtown core) and it is a great spot for a quick lunch or dinner.
