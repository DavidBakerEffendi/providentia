Good authentic food is hard to find in Charlotte. What I have found is that if its really good and authentic, not many people want to "talk about it". Why, because when the "secret" is out, the restaurant will get so busy, they will have a hard time getting a place at the table. Lang Van stands true to this theory and I completely understand why. The owner who literally greets every table at one point or another, is so warm and welcoming. I wasn't sure what to order other than the delicious Fresh Summer Rolls (highly recommend), she ordered for me. What was it, I have no idea but it too was delicious. The dish had chicken, broccoli, carrots and it was in a delicious sauce. She told me to have some of the peanut sauce on the side in case I wanted it. I had about three different people come to my table to either ask me if I was ok, if I needed anything or to put more water in my glass. Service was FAST but I never felt rushed, just attended to. I can't wait to go back but this time, order on my own.
