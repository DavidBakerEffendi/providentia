Thank you Bonnie for this great find!  I've spent the last two days there. They have a different brew available everyday.  Yesterday had a Brazilian one and today a Peruvian one. They were both delicious, but, the Peruvian one was a bit strong. They do a little blurb on where it comes from located on the dispenser. Very cute touch!   The wifi is great and a pretty fast connection.    However, on busy days its kind of a fight for the plugs as there is only 2 on each wall.  I even thought of bringing a multi-plug wall adapter to share with everyone. next time gadget next time!  Staff is young and delightful.  oh and a clean bathroom is a plus. :)Definitely going to BE my new favorite cafe!
