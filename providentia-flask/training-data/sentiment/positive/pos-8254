Loving the menu changes with new topping options, and despite past confusion as to whether or not the buns were vegan (and some snarky responses on social media explaining that the joint doesn't specify what is vegan because there's too many varieties of vegan) lo and behold they have a separate veg menu now! 

Fave toppings include: garbanzo bean chilli, chipotle ketchup, pimento mac & cheese, & momocho habanero sauce. not necessarily all on the same dog. oh and chimichurri for the tots.
