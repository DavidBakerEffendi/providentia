Oh Lumiere how I love thee, let me count the ways. Don't let the strip mall exterior fool you on this one. It simply doesn't represent properly the atmosphere once you walk through the front doors. The chef is legit talented. Food and drinks are fantastic, but I'm uber impressed each time I go with the level of service. Educated and informed servers really put this spot over the top.  
On a recent visit, our mussel appetizer was delayed slightly, so unprompted, our server brought us a complimentary wine pairing to go with the mussels along with an amuse bouche to tide us over. The seared foie gras appetizer was incredible, and the seafood bouillabaisse had giant pieces of lobster, mussels, clams and shrimp. This definitely isn't the sort of place you go to all the time (I wish!), but if you have a foodie in your life or are looking for a special evening out, Lumiere is on my short list.  
Join their email list!  They send 1 email a week on Monday detailing the specials for Tuesday-Thursday. The seafood bouillabaisse I had was one of the recent specials and came with a glass of Cote du Rhone for $25, which is ridiculously good pricing.  Till next time, Lumiere!
