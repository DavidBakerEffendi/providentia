Wow!! Don't let the store frontage detour you away from this absolutely gem. I was in the mood for Thai, and have to admit I almost didn't go in, and then when I did I still wasn't sure.... wow am I glad I stayed. Service was good, but the food was absolutely AMAZING!!! By far one of my top 3 of all time!! Will make this place a weekly must!!! The pineapple rice dish was so good!
