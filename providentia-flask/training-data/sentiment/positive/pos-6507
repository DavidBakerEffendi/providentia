We were referred here by a friend so we decided to check it out (we live in dtlv btw and drove the distance). My husband got the 2 taco hard shell shredded beef combo and I got the beef fajitas. His tacos were bigger than most Mexican restaurants in the area. They were brilliant with their presentation because the tacos were laying on a flour tortilla to absorb the juice so your taco stays hard and doesn't fall apart when you try to pick it up. My beef fajitas were soooo good too. Oh, we got guacamole as an app and it was delicious as well. Great service, reasonably priced and best tasting Mexican restaurant style food in the LV area that we've had in the 10 years living here.
