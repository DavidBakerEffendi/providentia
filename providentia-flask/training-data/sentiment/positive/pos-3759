Date night brought me here and I didn't even eat the massive and decadent desserts.  I did order chai vanilla tea without sugar which was delicious.  My hubby had a crepe filled with chocolate ice cream. Service was quick and friendly and topped off with more chocolate treats to walk away with.  There was a line up but we were seated pretty quickly and there was a line up out the door when we left.  Wow. Pics included in this one!!!
