3 words can sum up this place.. AWESOME, FRESH, CONSISTENT. This grill "Handsdown" is the best place to dine in or out (it all tastes the same). I live in Ballantyne area and will drive across town for this food. Although the Customer Service is quite Blahhh the food is worth it!! The lunch special Chicken and Shrimp is my fav and NO other place has better rice than them!!! Try It!!!
