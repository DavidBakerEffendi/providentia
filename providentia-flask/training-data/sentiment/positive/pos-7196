Had the 6 oz. Wagyu steak and seafood appetizer.  Tried my first, and only, fresh oyster.  The steak was very tender and flavorful, a bit soft, I thought I was chewing fat.  Definitely something to try at least once.  Presentation was great, so was the service and atmosphere.

The meal was great, desserts were nothing out of the ordinary.  Dessert ordered: donut, cr√®me brulee, s'mores and something with banana in it (banana foster?)
