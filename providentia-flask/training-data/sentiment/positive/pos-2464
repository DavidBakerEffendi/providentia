I came here after working a long day down the street and was greeted with a friendly bartender as well as a few locals. The bartender recommended some wings that were great, few beers on tap and a bunch of TVs to watch any game. I was full off the special of wings and a pint but I would come back to try the ribs, pork or any of the sandwiches. I would recommend it to anybody in the area
