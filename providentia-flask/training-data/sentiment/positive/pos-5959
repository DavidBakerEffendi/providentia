This past trip to Vegas was the first time that I really walked down to Bellagio and watched the fountains.  Love it! I don't know whether it's wonderfully choreographed or extremely well sound actuated, but it's mesmerizing to watch!  It's one of the best free activities in Vegas and everybody should see it at least one.  Absolutely beautiful!
