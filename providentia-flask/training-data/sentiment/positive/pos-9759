I love Rikishi.  It is a true 'hidden gem'.  I used to ride my bike by it all the time and think "ew, I wouldn't want to go for sushi there" - proving once again you should never judge a book by its cover, or a restaurant by its faded sign and dated decor.   MyJapanese friends recommended it as one of their favourites in the city so we tried it and were delighted.  It seems to be a small family run place with a grandfather-like figure who makes all the sushi.  My friend said it reminds him of a true Japanese neighbourhood sushi house.   The sushi is fresh and fantastic.  They have a whole vegetarian sushi menu too.     It's not fancy - but delicious, friendly, affordable, and homey.
