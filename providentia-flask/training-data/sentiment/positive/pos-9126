My husband and I went last night for dinner.. What can I say ... Ambiance- beautiful, service- excellent, food was delish(my husband had the filet n I had the baked chicken) they tasted so good that it felt like we never tasted chicken or steak before.. Yup that good. And DESSERT what can I say the bread pudding to die for (and not drowned in liquor) and the Brookie omg;) oh I forgot the tomato salad and creamed spinach was so tasty! We will definitely be coming back to try everything else.. And to think this place is close to home and we've been bypassing all this time!
