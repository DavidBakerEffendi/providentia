We've been going to Wong's for years.  The food was always excellent,  The service was outstanding. They recently changed ownership, and we were concerned the quality may change.  We were just there last week.   It is still one of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley.  The quality and quantity of food is exceptional.  They maintain consistency and you can always expect an excellent meal.   If you want an even better experience ask for Mei to be your waitress.
