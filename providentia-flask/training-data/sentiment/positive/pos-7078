Oh man. This is the fastest Taco Bell drive thru ever. In the drive thru line there were two ahead of me, but once I ordered 2 things those cars had pulled away and at the window they already had my food. Order correct and delicious (for Taco Bell) asked if I wanted sauce. Included a spork. A-ok. Short review, but it's Taco Bell! I got a cheesy bean and rice burrito and triple layer nachos. They were out of chicken taquito roll-ups FYI. Now I'm just being silly, but they WERE out of taquitos. It's Taco Bell!
