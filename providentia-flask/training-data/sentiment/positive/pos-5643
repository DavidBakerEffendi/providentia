I know Hooters isn't exactly fine dining but the service is always so friendly and nice that it deserves a good review. This is where we go for wings and a beer, they are good. We aways get the regular hot wings, the medium sauce is more like margarine or something. Sometimes the boneless wings are dry. 
We bring our kid with us and the girls always stop to say hi to her and give her a balloon. 
Love the service, always great.
