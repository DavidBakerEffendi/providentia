A must try in the plethora of average to great restaurants located inside the Venetian/Palazzo. Samba is located on the second floor of palazzo, right up the escalators in the middle of the casino floor. 
The food is seriously so on point. In my opinion, the best way of eating here is the omakase. Pick a price level you and your guests want to pay, $75 pp will  get you a great meal, and let the chefs create a dining experience for you. Naturally, there are a few things that can't be missed. Lobster tacos, rock shrimp tempura, salt and pepper squid, beef gyoza, scallops on shell, and some sushi rolls. Note, when the rolls say they have crab, they actually use king crab in the rolls. Not some random imitation crab that you'll eat at your normal sushi spots. Lastly, my favorite favorite dish that you can't go to samba and not order is the Chilean seabass. It is hands down the best Chilean seabass ever, blowing Nobu out of the water. They skewer it and put the most delicious Peruvian corn on the side, the meat is super delicious and a serious dream to taste. 

If you're in Vegas, this is one restaurant not to miss.
