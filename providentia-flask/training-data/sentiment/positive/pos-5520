I think Buca just became my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto. I had the brigoli and the pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce was perfectly creamy. My friend had the lobster angel hair pasta and let me tell you, if you want to spend $50 on a meal this should be your splurge. I literally had an orgasm when I took a bite out of it.
