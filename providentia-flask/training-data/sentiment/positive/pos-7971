Pure class.

I love this hotel and every time we go to Vegas, I ask my parents if we're staying here.  Everything is so clean and beautiful and the architect is just amazing.  This is where the high rollers should go.

It's pretty much in the middle of the Strip so it's accessible to everything around you.  Plus the 2nd floor is a bunch of fashionable shops to go to with the Grand Canal.

Major bonus when you stay here, you get free passes to TAO.  Totally helpful and worth the pay.  

We usually get the Bella suites and DAMN are they roomy!  Everything is super elegant.

Bathroom is huge thank god. But the doors don't lock.

My top pick for hotels in Vegas.
