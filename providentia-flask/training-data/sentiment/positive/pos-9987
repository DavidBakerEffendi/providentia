Today. I stopped in & picked up lunch from here to take home. It was my first time trying Gandolfo's. Mike has had it many times & loves their food. He had the I  New York sandwich with Nacho Cheese Doritos & a large Diet Pepsi. I had the 6-inch Brooklynn Bridge  & it was very delicious! Accompanied it with a bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos & a large Sierra Mist. I really enjoyed my meal & would definitely order this sandwich...& from this place...again!

The ONLY drawback? They serve Pepsi products...I'm a Coke girl...so that was the only strike against them.

If you love delicatessen sandwiches & meals, Gandolfo's is the place for you. If you haven't been there before, give them a try!
