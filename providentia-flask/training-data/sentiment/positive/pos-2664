I have to say that I am sooo excited to find an Indian restaurant in the area that is not only good, but authentic.  I had the chicken tikka masala, and other people with us had the lamb, the prawns, and the boti tikka.  Everybody loved the meal.  I also have to say that the naan bread was some of the best I have had in a long time.  I will go back for sure, many times.
