I love some Pepe's Tacos. Tacos are full of meat, and the menudo is really good. Service is always friendly, and they are open all the time. Super convenient and their salsa is pretty good. I especially love how they switch up the music, one spanish song, and then an english song song. My boyfriend is white and when we walked in, the music changed. Obviously, it was not on purpose, but still super funny. haha. Love this place.
