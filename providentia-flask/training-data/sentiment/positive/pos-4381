If Korea and America got together and had a lovechild they would name it Buldogis.  
This is my fourth time eating here and I really love their food.  Went today 11-11-15 to get take-out.  
This restaurant is located on Fort Apache and Sahara across from Chicago Brewing Company.  
$41.51 got me some euro fries, bulgogi fries, a bulgogi dog, a chicago dog, a regular dog with cheese & bacon, and a small order of fries. 
The euro fries were so tasty...the yellow stuff on the top tastes like the top of the cheap garlic bread you can find in the freezer section in Walmart.  
I got nothing unique to say that the other 500+ people haven't mentioned...just come try this place!
