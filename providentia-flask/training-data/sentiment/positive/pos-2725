Whenever I get the chance to stop over in this great city I always try to swing by Monte's. The service is friendly but don't expect to be looked into every 2 minutes. Which personally I prefer. This has a very local feel and the prices are just right.

I had the Blue Plate special with egg whites. It was wonderful. Not greasy. The artichoke sandwhich is also off of the hook! Very good down home food all the way around and extremely reasonably priced. Especially coming from the West Coast.

The other added bonus is Monte's is located in the Willy Street area...the more eclectic part of "downtown".
