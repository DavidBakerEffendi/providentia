I love Futo Buta, and I love their new southend location! The new location is quaint so be prepared to rub elbows with your neighbors and wait for a table if it's busy. At night or weekend, definitely be prepared to wait. The new location is right off the rail line, so it's easy to get to. Parking isn't available, but you can park somewhere in southend and walk to it.The miso ramen was absolutely delicious. The rice crispy squares appetizer is a MUST order. It is presented perfectly, but is a light and airy dish with the ahi tuna that you place on top of it.  Futu Buta means "the fat pig" so i recommend trying a pork dish! The low country smoked pork belly is to die for.
The service was great, the food was delicious, and we left with full stomachs. The service was a little slow because of how packed it always is, but if you're enjoying company, what is their to complain about?
