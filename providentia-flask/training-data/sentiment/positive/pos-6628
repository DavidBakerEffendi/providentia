Food was awesome. Fresh ingredients. Definitely will go back. Only disappointment was we ordered 20 min ahead via the app, it said 15 min max, and when we arrived they hadn't even started it. It took 15 minutes and we were late to our movie. cashier did not show any remorse.... BUT. awesome tacos and this will be our new spot.
