WOW! Word that this place is back to normal for Happy Hour has definitely gotten out. They were so packed this time we had to sit in one of the private rooms (not that that's a bad thing). The service was exceptional and the experience felt like we had our own personal wait staff attending to our needs while we were sitting in our own living room. How COOL is that?

My kids love the Fries here, as do I, and with good reason. I don't know what they do, but they're even good the next day cold and that's coming from someone that hates reheated or cold fries.

Everything else on the HH menu is superb and maybe someday I'll get past ordering the Pound of wings. Best part- On the wings, you can order all drums if you prefer (and I prefer)...WOOHOO!

After my second review, I was contacted by the owner who mentioned he was glad to have us back...(See first review). 

BTW- On at least 2 occasions prior to this, they were always out of the local hefeweizen. Glad to see on this visit, they had enough to go around.

Even though I have been here tens of times, I must say, the most recent experience was the most memorable.
Thanks for listening Management.

Of course the ONE down side to this place now- it's hard to get a table on Friday night again. :-)
