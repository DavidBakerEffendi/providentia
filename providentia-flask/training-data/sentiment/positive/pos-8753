There has been a lot of attention for this new bakery off of Stephanie and the 215 and I'll quickly chime in to add my experience with them.
We visited the weekend they first opened and things were still new, kinks were still being worked out.  However, I did enjoy that first visit with the tasty pumpkin cheesecake.  
A month later, I ordered a custom birthday cake for good friend, Shirley B., who's a big fan of Gimme Some Sugar.  I e-mailed GSS with my requests for a cake with a Hello Kitty and SF 49er theme because those are two of Shirley B.'s favorite things.  Ashley responded promptly and we coordinated on the details.  The resulting birthday cake was just the thing and the surprised look on Shirley's face when we presented the cake at her birthday dinner was priceless; she loved it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gimme-some-sugar-henderson-3?userid=7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA#xMTMOVBqAc0YKsVJaeUGEA
First-rate customer service from the beginning to the end with Ashley and her shop.  That is a rare thing indeed and I give them five stars all the way for filling the order above and beyond.  I'm a fan and we'll definitely be giving GSS more business in the future.
