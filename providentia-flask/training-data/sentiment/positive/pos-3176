Idk why I didn't start my review earlier if this place because SERVICE was PHENOMENAL and FOOD was so flippin' AMAZING and DELICIOUS. I have to say I wasn't expecting too much since the place is pretty hidden from street view and relatively small and seriously empty when we got there. But it BLEW ME AWAY!! 

Now I forgot our server's name since time passed; but phenomenal service. He was so down to earth, great with giving us suggestions. And totally understandable of our two little ones. He brought out kids cups, extra plates and napkins without us even asking. He even brought my two year old fresh home made cinnamon chips with some bomb Nutella whip sauce to go with it. My kid went crazy over it! My inner kid secretly did too. Haha. 

Loaded Potato Nuggets- bomb appetizer. The potato nuggets were nice toasty fried oozing with the toppings. The bacon bits added a nice touch. I recommend sharing between more than two people because I was getting full just from this. It's pretty fried and heavy. 
BiBimBop- huge serving and so much galbi! So tender; so delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about it. And the use of colored carrots - nice touch
Miso pork belly burger - I can't say much about this, but my husband couldn't stop raving about his burger to me. But his tempura sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious. 

I'm going to have to come back and try their brunch and the rest of the menu. The food is pretty pricey, but definitely worth it. If you are ever in the area, there are tons of parking. It looks like a small cafe, but man does the food pack a punch full of flavor.
