I love falafel (one of my favourite foods) and I just so happened to pass by on my way home and decided to pick up a meal to go. The person prepping the food was so sweet. It was near closing and he took his time and asked me what vegetables I didn't like on my salad. 

For the price it's crazy good because I'm so used to paying over $10 for a falafel plate (halal guys, villa madina, ali babas). -- I paid $5 for the same thing. Only thing is the rice I got was plain but it was still delicious! 

I also got a serving of curried chick peas and I also love indian food so that was a plus!!

Will come back if near by
