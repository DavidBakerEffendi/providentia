Years ago I used to work in the area, and ALL of us at the office would eat here weekly, if not more. To this day, Fusaro's has my FAVOURITE salad of all time (and I HAAATE salad): the insala di tonno. It is the best mix of greens, roasted red peppers, shredded carrots, halved grape tomatoes topped with tuna in olive oil. It USED to be served with bocconcini and it is now served with asiago... call me nostalgic, but I still request the bocconcini instead. The BEST part? The balsamic dressing. The best anywhere. I don't know what they do differently from anyone else. I've tried taking a peek to see which olive oil and balsamic they use, or if they have any special way of mixing it that makes it the perfect blend of sweet and acidic to no avail... I think I once tried their pasta in lieu of the salad, and it just wasn't the same. Don't get me wrong, the pasta was great! But Fusaro's for me IS this tuna salad.
