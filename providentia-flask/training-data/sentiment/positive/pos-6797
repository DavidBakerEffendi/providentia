There are some great things happening in Ayrsley and Carolina Beer Temple is definitely one of them. What's to love about this beer joint? Starting from the first impression we had a great time when we visited. The first thing I did when I walked in was to marvel at how clean it was! And not just how spick and span the floors and tables were but also how they had little tea candles in pint glasses on the tables and bars. Whoa - a beer place that could double as a date spot? Great! 

The selection of beer is wide and the bar staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. Just as importantly they were generous with the samples. The bartender recommended a beer in the sour family for me to sample and it was the first sour beer I didn't hate. Their store selection of beer was great too with plenty of selection from around North Carolina. Fortnight and Bull City Cider were some of our favorite finds.

Lastly - the snack situation. I genuinely have no idea why more bars don't do this. For $1 you can get a scoop of an assortment of snacks ranging from the traditional pretzel to the eccentric fruit loops. If you are really hungry they sell sandwiches from Rooney's. And while I didn't want to be that girl that disrespected the beer temple and ordered wine when we went I did notice a solid selection (6) of wines by the glass if beer isn't your thing.
