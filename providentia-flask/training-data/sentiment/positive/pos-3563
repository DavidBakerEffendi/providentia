Love love love this place. I've been a customer for a couple of years but recently went again last week for dinner. We arrived slightly before the dinner rush so we grabbed the comfy corner table by the window. They have fresh sushi and delicious ramen. On my most recent visit, I got the sukiyaki udon served with rice and my boyfriend got the tempura udon. Although the sukiyaki was a bit expensive ($17), it was delicious and rich! It comes with an assortment of veggies, tofu, udon, and thinly sliced beef. It's a great spot for a date too! ;)
