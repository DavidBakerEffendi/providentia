I really like this place and I am SO upset that they closed down this location for good. Please come back! Phoenix is great and all, but all of us in the East Valley need you back. So please find a better location and re-open. I'm fairly certain that the bizarre location was what did it for them. 

At any rate, if you visit the Chinos that IS open, here is what you should order:

Emerald Chicken Quesadilla
Jade Red Chicken
Jerk Fried Rice
Refried Beans

You can thank me later.
