We had an early dinner at the bar on a Sunday. We were surprised to hear that Sundays bottles of wine are 1/2 off. The restaurant is beautiful with a view of the massive open air kitchen. The short rib beef raviolis were outstanding, and the crab cake was all crab..the centrally staged bar is the main feature of the restaurant.. the service staff was very accommodating and responsive. A good dining experience.
