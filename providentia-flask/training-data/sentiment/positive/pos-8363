This review is for the baked goods. I had the pleasure of buying a pack of 4 cupcakes and boy were they delicious! The cake was moist and the frosting was just the right amount of sweet. Each flavor was unique and scrumptious on its own. If your looking for good quality baked goods, look no further! I can't wait to come here for a sit down meal! 
I hope this place stays in business forever!
