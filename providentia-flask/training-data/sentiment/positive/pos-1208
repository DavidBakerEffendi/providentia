I've dined in Istanbul, Turkey and never thought I would find another restaurant as good as the ones back there but this place was absolutely amazing. All the meats were cooked perfectly and very delicious. The service here is also perfect. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone and will eat here every time I'm in Cleveland. It was one of the best meals I've had in one week of being in Cleveland.
