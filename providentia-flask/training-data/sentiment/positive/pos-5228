Lovely outdoor seating area, very dog friendly. Don't sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there. Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours. It was a pleasant experience. Didn't order food this time but next time I will, because every dish that came by looked magnificent! All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion.
