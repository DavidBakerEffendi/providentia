I love eating here when I have no qualms about dropping $25 on lunch just for me. That might not seem like a lot to some, but when I was 13; $25 a week was my allowance. That was the full amount if I didn't get docked for things like not washing dishes or whaling on my little brother. When I started earning my own money, I tried living on a lunch budget of $25 a week and that doesn't stretch very far when even fast food places get you for $8 per visit. Hello, learning to be a decent cook!

Never mind the price. Sitting in the middle of an art gallery while eating a panini you watched the chef lovingly prepare for you (and come up with on the spot, since they don't have vegan paninis on the menu), sipping on an Italian soda and watching foot traffic go by the window just makes you feel fancy as hell. Even if you rolled in wearing a white t-shirt, jeans and scrubby Chucks that have seen better days. The great thing about the menu is that a lot of it is organic and/or locally sourced. A couple of years ago, I went here for a friend's wedding reception and the buffet they offered was impeccable. Something amazing and delicious for everyone! 

So if you're having a bad day, or feel like being swank for no reason at all, or just want to shove an amazing panini in your face; come to the Vue Caf√©.
