Found this by accident and what a find it is.  This place is small but the waitress was great and the food was terrific better by far than at more expensive places.  I had the  Chili Verde was very tasty without to much heat, my wife had the Chimichanga and she totally loved it and the albodigas soup was great full flavor without overdoing it with the meatballs.  Will be eating there very often.
