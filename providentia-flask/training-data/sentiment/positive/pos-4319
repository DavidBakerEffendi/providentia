This place simply has excellent food and excellent service. The free chips and salsa always come out very quick and fresh. The quality of the food is really good, and they give you good portion sizes. I always order one of their margaritas, and they definitely hit the spot. I highly recommend the fajitas of course, and they come with fresh tortillas that are made in house. This place is definitely a must try, and surely it will not disappoint.
