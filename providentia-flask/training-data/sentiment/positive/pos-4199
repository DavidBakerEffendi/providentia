This place is great! We went on a Friday night about 6:00 with a party of 5 and waited about 30 minutes. The dining area is very small, but worth the wait. We ended up creating our own since my family is not the most adventurous, but I would definitely return to try the specialty pizzas at another time. One pizza we created was sausage, roasted red peppers and black olives and the other was pepperoni, bacon and green pepper. Everyone thought it was great pizza! It has a thin crust with the end being chewy. The best part for me is I am not a huge fan of pizza sauce, but theirs is delicious. Most of the time it is applied too heavily for my taste, and is bitter. Not theirs! It is just very tasty and I am thrilled to have found a place that I like the sauce. They have a nice wine and beer selection also. They seem to do a big carryout business and they also direct people next door to the Public House to wait until their pizza is ready. Wish they were closer so I could carry out.
