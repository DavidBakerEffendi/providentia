Excellent steakhouse in the western suburbs of Cleveland. This literal cabin is worth the trip. An elite intimate dinner experience, you won't be disappointed here. The cabin in the woods motif is a nice departure from the chain and name brand restaurants in the surrounding area. The lobster bisque does live up to the award winning expectations!
