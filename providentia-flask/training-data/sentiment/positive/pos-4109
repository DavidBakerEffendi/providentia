First time to the new location in Cornelius. Live entertainment was great. Good beer list. Great staff.  Had the wings and they do them perfect. Crispy. Have couple options on how wings are prepared. I put them up with the best of them. Great view of all the tvs. Not sure why it took us so long to try it? Nice patio for outside seating. Def give them a try!
