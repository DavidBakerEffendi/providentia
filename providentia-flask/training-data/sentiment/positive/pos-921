This place goes on my top 5 ramen restaurants. Loved the authentic ramen and the variety of ramen.  They also have soba, which I don't really see in other Japanese restaurants.  

I had the Shoyu Ramen and my mom had the seafood ramen (forgot the name).  Looking forward to trying the other dishes.

Met the owners, very friendly and the place as spacious - plenty of room.  Not small like a typical soba or ramen house.

I highly recommend this place on your to go list!
