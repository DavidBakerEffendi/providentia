I love Templetons - I was initially lured in by the patio, but I've returned so many times since.  

They have an adorable little patio, with larger picnic tables for groups and two-people tables for smaller groups. Their drinks selection is very good and they have a daily drinks special every single day of the week - usually it's some sort of discount on their jugs. I've included a picture of their weekly specials menu. 

Their mixed drinks are a bit hit and miss. 

The peach mojito is definitely very good, but it's not really peachy, or much of a mojito either. It's made with vodka, so it doesn't really have that punchy rum flavour to it. It's also not very minty - I definitely like my drinks a little stronger in general. I don't think it's very alcoholic either; the last time we ordered a jug I think I only saw 2 or 3 shots get poured into the drink. This drink is definitely very light, almost watery, and you can definitely taste that it's mostly juice and club soda. However, it's pretty good for a starter drink, or if you just want something cool and refreshing on the patio. 

For the sangrias, I definitely prefer the taste of the white wine sangria over the red. It comes with quite a bit of fruit but I'm pretty sure those are added in afterwards - I feel like this is more of a "wine mixed with fruit juice" kind of deal than a real sangria. If you order a jug of the red, they put orange juice in the bottom half so it's a very pretty ombre orange and red color. You're supposed to mix it before you drink. On the weekends they have freshly squeezed orange juice!

They have mimosas on the weekends made with freshly squeezed orange juice (but they run out of the orange juice pretty quickly). It's pretty good, and definitely very affordable - a liter carafe will run you about $21. Their brunch is pretty awesome too - they serve it every day until 4.
