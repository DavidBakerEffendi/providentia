Its a PACKER BACKER BAR!!

Packer themed drinks and cheese curds. Of course, game nights filled with green and yellow. Sipping on a sweet packer punch drink.

Had the turkey club in a spinach wrap, it was stuffed. Cheesesteak meat finely cut with melted cheese on white hoagie bun. Added grilled onions.

Loved the overhead trains! Love those things!!

Great service, easy parking and fun comaraderie!
