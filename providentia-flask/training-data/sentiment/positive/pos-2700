First off the owner of the business is a sweetheart. The staff is really nice and the food great!!! I had the buffalo chicken fingers with fries, we had the fried pickles as appetizer, chocolate molten cake desert and the BF had the canal street. Although everything was great I fell in love with the fried pickles. 

The place is decorated with sports memorabilia and tv's playing sports are everywhere. They have live entertainment on weekend and a karaoke night. This is definitely on my repeat list and will bring lots of friends to boot!!! :)
