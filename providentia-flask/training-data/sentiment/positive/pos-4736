This is our local, go to spot. Great drinks, food and service. Seriously, their fries are bomb and their prime rib sliders are pretty good for a sports grill! My favorite waitress is Jennifer (I am pretty sure that is her name! (we share our love for cats and Jagermeister)  The bartenders have great beards and personalities so that's a plus. 

Price wise, I'd say they're fairly reasonable. I indulge in their moon valley trashcan (don't judge me, it's like $7, huge and gets you smashed.) Its basically an AMF with redbull. SO. MUCH. LIQUID. GOODNESS. :) 

I have yet to try their wings, but it's definitely going down on my next visit.
