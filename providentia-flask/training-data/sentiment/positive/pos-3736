Came here on a Friday night for dinner and drinks with my girlfriend.  I have to say from start to finish the service was exceptional. They went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome and enjoyed ourselves. Sorry I forgot the names because I am writing this the following week. Our waitress introduced ourself and asked us if it was our first time there (which it was) so she went over the menu with us highlighting the popular options. She left to give us some time to decide and the manager came over with complimentary house braised short rib fire cracker appetizers because she heard it was our first time. She said they are the most overlooked thing on the menu and boy was she right. They were the last thing I was thinking of ordering but probably one of the first things I'll order when I go back. We also ordered the parmesan truffle fries, short rib tacos, fish tacos,  smokey club flatbread and social punch. Everything tasted good but the short rib tacos were the standout. I specifically want to come back for those and anything els that has short ribs in or on it. The social punch was also a very nice fruity drink that wasn't overly sweet. The manager and waitress made small talk with us throughout the night and checked on us periodically to make sure we were satisfied. I  am extremly impressed with the professionalism and quality of the food (everything is made in house ) and I look forward to coming back to try more things on the menu!
