Came for brunch at 11:00 today. The line was wrapped around to the side hallway where the bathrooms were! A couple behind me asked an employee walking out of the side door about how long it would take to get to the front.. He responded an hour (a few minutes later the couple left the line). To my surprise the line moved quickly and only took 30 minutes to get to the front. I got the "slut" and my husband got the cheeseburger. Both cooked to perfection and full of flavor. Well worth it! Don't let the line scare you away.
