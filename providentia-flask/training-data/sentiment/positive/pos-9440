This restaurant had been open all but a week when I walked in for lunch. Albeit was Sunday I don't believe they have built their traffic to where they have regulars quite yet. So the restaurant was very empty. Walking into this establishment, I got the sense of what they were trying to achieve. The ambiance felt very upscale and I thought the decor was on point. The chairs had alligator skin on it and it looked very shick.  The food was great. The appetizers were delicious. We had the 3 meat kabob with fries, hummus and rice balls. It was very good. The reason they earned my 4 start as opposed to the 5 was due to the wait time of getting our food. They're still getting their timing on check, but I fully expect them to have a handle on it before my next visit. Great service, good food, wonderful decor, what else can you hope for.
