Great service, nice servers. Great variety of food for lunch time. The price was not bad for a lunch buffet. The awesome thing was... the live cuisine. Good guy always smiling and nice and very quick at cooking
Nice ambiance. Love the nice feel of Asia with their fish  in the tanks and the small pool. 

Worth going in again
