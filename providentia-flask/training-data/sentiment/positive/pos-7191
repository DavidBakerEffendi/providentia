First the staff is so friendly they make you feel like old friends that haven't seen you in a long time. Second the food is very good and what I consider authentic not any of this Asian fusion thing we're finding everywhere. We had the Pad Thai mine was shrimp and hers was seafood and they were both wonderful. We went with medium I believe which left me just a hair sweaty but perfect to my wife's liking. The Jasmine tea was wonderful. Wasn't sure if I would like it but it was refreshing. They even gave us to go cups. Overall I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes really good Thai food and great service. We will be back.
