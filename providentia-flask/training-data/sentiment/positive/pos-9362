Finally, we found a place on our side of town with delicious, fresh Thai food.  They have recently renovated the dining room to make it cozy and modern as well.  You get the feeling that this is a family run business and as a bonus, everyone speaks English.
My favorite is the stir-fry linguine and he loves the Pad Kee Mow.  We are both so happy that we don't have to go downtown and deal with the crowds at Le Thai anymore.  Pan Asian is just as good---delicious--and far less expensive.
