I love this place. I always have tacos! The very few and  the only bad reviews I have seen were for breakfast or something other than tacos. I can't say  anything about the other food. The dinner comes with rice and beans and those are good. I am so addicted to the green tomatillo sauce, I purchased extra to take home. Our family loves it!
