Came here Friday afternoon for lunch.

Great place for Korean, Hawaiian, Chinese fusion foods.

We orders Kalbi plate, neangmyun combo and champong chajang combo.

Decent smount of banchan served. Large cups of water. Great service. Food came out quick.

Kalbi was sooo good. My bibimb neangmyun was really good. Mool neangmyun was decent. Champong was full of seafood and pretty tasty. Chajang myun was decent.

I gave an extra star was awesome service. Our server guy was super nice, gave us bottled water to-go and nicely packed up our Kalbi leftovers.

Looking forward to visiting again! Thank you!
