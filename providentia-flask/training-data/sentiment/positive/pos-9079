Not my first time of visiting a baja... but definitely the bestest. This review is mostly based on the level of customer service I received. 

The moment I walked in the door I was warmly greeted by Gisela with her gorgeous smile asking if I was ready to order or needed more time. she respected that I needed a few minutes to decide then came over. She also patiently took my annoying order "little of this, none of that, don't forget..." she repeated it back perfectly and even asked personally, "Are you having a rough day.. to which I just said I'm looking forward to my next day off. Still, who asks about your day anymore?! awesome stuff. 

Not to stop there... as I found a table to sit and wait for my burrito, she came over and apologized saying "I might have sprayed a product with bleach here. sorry" well I don't see any stains on my uniform and it's not like it was her fault anyways. 

I even watched her as she told the cook precisely how I wanted everything prepared and it came out perfectly and tasty. 

Excellent customer service! she even mentioned "have a good day & come back here soon" I'll have to take her up on that since I work nearby. 

I know it's just Baja Fresh, but if you haven't visited this location or had the pleasure of meeting Gisela then you're missing out on an awesome guest experience.
