This is one of my go to buffets in Las Vegas. I've tried a number of times to get into Bacchanal, but the line is worse that lines at Disneyland. I ate here this past Sunday around 7pm and to my surprise, I was able to walk all the way to the cashier without having to wait in line.

I LOVE the food here. It's the only buffet that I am aware of that serves poke. They have both tuna and salmon poke and it is absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!! I also love the fact that they serve king crab here. Most of the buffets I go to serve snow crab, so it's not very often that I get to eat king crab. 

Table service is very prompt considering how busy this place gets. Dirty plates are picked up just about as soon as you are done with the plate and drink refills come around before you even finish your drink. 

There is a carving station that I like, but sometimes it's a hit and miss. The prime rib is usually ok, although sometimes it was too overdone for my liking. There was kobe beef at the carving station during my last visit, but it was WAY to well done for my liking. I like my beef red, especially if it's kobe.
