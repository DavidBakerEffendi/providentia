Everyone got insulted, everyone got hats and everyone had fun and as a bonus most of the food was good too. I even got some insults in as well, one of my longtime favorite things to do. This was a lunchtime roast and the waiter got most things right, calling out one lesbian, one guy who wasn't getting any action and a few older folks jokes. It was everything we had expected to happen and most of us will remember (or forget) it forever. 
    So, the various versions of mac and cheese were all pretty good. Those twisty noodles and long strips of flavorful chicken elevated this dish to a good level. The guy getting no action also enjoyed his fish and chips. Personally, I had a liquid lunch with a giant margarita for $16 - true tourist stuff. Enjoy the show.
