Pasta da Panza doesn't look like much from the outside but once you come in you'll be surprised by how tightly things are being run, the quality of the food and the service you receive dealing with them.

This establishment is firstly an Italian caterer but they also serve food for patrons like myself who stumble inside. The food is freshly prepared and I excitedly waited for my meal to be cooked. I went with their daily special which was rigatoni and sausage with rapini. I generously coated my plate with freshly shredded Parmesan and went to town.

As someone who grew up eating Italian on practically a daily basis my expectations were high but I'll be pleased to report that the food here is authentic and made fresh. The plate was delicious and I had to stop myself from licking the plate. #Delicious

Mom would be proud.... but don't tell her....

My coworker went with their polpette (meatballs) and he's been busting my chops about going back almost on a daily basis.

Pasta da Panza caters as well and we're pretty excited on possibly using them in a few months for one of our community lunches at work.

The price-tag for lunch was a good deal and I hope they're to stay as I'd like to come here on a bi-weekly basis and enjoy some more of their pasta.
