4 years later & Pizza Libretto is one of the most consistent, authentic pizza restaurants around! I've been here over a dozen times and have never been disappointed - ya, it's busy, just make a reservation. They are true to them & you won't wait even a minute for your table. 
The calamari is to die for - a MUST try - as are the desserts, do not skip even if you don't have a sweet tooth! Of course, the pizza is fantastic as well.

We've been here with friends, family and out of town guests, and everyone is always happy. It's casual enough you can walk in in almost anything & not feel out of place, but also nice enough to celebrate a birthday or something special. It's just plain awesome food.

There is a semi-private room for around 10 & it's perfect for a large group - but reservations are a must.
