I came here for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner with the almost in laws. We enjoyed happy hour drinks and appetizers on the patio to start, and what a great start it was! We munched on tater tot-like pom fritos and the sausage plate, which came with assorted pickles, mustard and pretzel bread. 
Next we moved into the dining room and our table of choice was next to the fireplace. So cozy! We were all starving so we ordered another appetizer, the shrimp pepper pot. That definitely didn't disappoint! The shrimp was incredible! It reminded us of the mo rockin shrimp from eddies house. Delish!
For dinner I tried the pork tenderloin and absolutely loved it! It was perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. My man had chicken enchiladas and those were nice as well. All in all, we were more than satisfied with our evening at el chorro, and will make it a point to return for happy hour and dinner more often!
