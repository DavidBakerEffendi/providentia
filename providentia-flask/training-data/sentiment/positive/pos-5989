I really want to give this 5 stars, I really do.  They know me by name. They have great wait staff that are more than "looks". The food assortment is nice and they will even reheat your food while your nursing your beer.  The TV's precisely placed with great selection from basketball, football, racing (witch these people love),  news and premium sports channels.  The only problem is for a sports bar, I wish the bartenders, waitstaff and owner would pay attention to the sports world. I go in there and the TV is on the same channel as ot was for the game last night. Maybe Im just a compulsive sports nut.

***On second thought they deserve a five
