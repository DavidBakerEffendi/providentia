What a great treat dining here was!  The food is excellent.  Everything came out piping hot.  And after sampling everyone's dish....there wasn't one thing that wasn't delicious.  My mother even would have liked the food here, and she was one Italian woman that could COOK!  Wedding soup - amazing.  Eggplant Parm - delish.  Pasta with vodka sauce - wonderful  The meatballs - awesome.  Spinach lasagna - oh em gee.  And that was only what we had at our table.  The place is small and intimate which I loved....you can actually hear conversation at the table without a lot of overdone "background" music of tons of other people talking to overpower what you hear.  I just loved the place.  Can't wait to go back - which I definitely will be!
