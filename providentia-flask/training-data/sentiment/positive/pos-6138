This place was wonderful. My boyfriend and I had a very quick night in Vegas. The night before we went to the High Roller which everyone should do and had dinner from a taco truck. So around 3am (we are from the east coast so my sleep schedule was all screwed up) I woke up hungry. So around 330 I had woken him and convinced him we should go to breakfast since we had an early flight out that day. 

We were staying at the SLS and asked an employee downstairs of some breakfast options. The hotel had a breakfast but the guy said Peppermill was great so we called an Uber. It was maybe less than a mile away so we ended up walking back. 

Once we got there, we felt sort of old because apparently everyone is just awake at 4am in Vegas - like from the night before. And we are showing up sleepy since we just woke up. Anyway, the place was packed but somehow we got seated very quickly. 

Our waitress was over right away and showed us the drink specials which I could take advantage of but bf couldn't since he had to work that day. So I decided to rub it in and ordered the scorpion which is huge. I think she said six shots are in it. I can't remember for sure because I had six shots of liquor. Whatever it was, it was tasty and gigantic. 

Our food even came out quickly which we didn't expect given how crowded they were. I have no idea what I ordered - I can't find it on the menu but there is a pic and it involved eggs and peppers and chips. It was fantastic and I don't usually love breakfast at 4am. Bf had the chorizo and eggs and ate all of it. 

We ended up walking back to the hotel which made us feel sort of better about ourselves given the amount of food we just ate. Anytime he's working here again I want to come back and try some of their regular menu. It's a great place. Food is good and service is wonderful even though they seem completely busy even at 4am.
