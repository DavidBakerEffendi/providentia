Choolaah please come to Minneapolis!

I loved everything about this place, and I suspect a lot of you do too. All sorts of groups were eating and taking out on the night I ate at Choolaah, and this hits a wonderful sweet spot of being easy/safe enough for the people in your life who may not eat a lot of Indian food (Hi Mom!) and a full kids menu for your pizza needs and being purely awesome for those of us that just need get our tikka on. The menu is obviously not as complex and varied as a full Indian restaurant (and with good reason; Indian dishes are often harder to master and more complicated to cook than many cuisines) but what they are doing they are doing very very well.
