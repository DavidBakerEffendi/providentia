Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, and super friendly staff.

My biggest impression of Morris Ramen is that they care a lot about making an authentic, high-quality meal. You can watch the staff give really careful attention to each bowl that comes out. I had the chance to speak with Matt Morris (the restaurant's namesake) who was busy behind the bar preparing the bowls. He was super friendly, and seemed really eager to make a great dining experience for every guest. He even told me this great story about where he got the gigantic knife he uses. 

We went at around 6pm on a Monday night, and we were immediately seated (we chose the bar). We ordered the Satsuma Fries as an appetizer. If you've never had satsuma fries, they are very similar to sweet potato fries (a bit milder in flavor than the typical bright-orange American yam, but the same texture). They came with a really addicting, mildly spicy sauce.

I ordered a beer (they have Sapporo on tap) and my girlfriend ordered the Spiced Pear Saketini, which was tasty. It has a slight anice-y flavor, which I'm typically not a huge fan of but the balance of it worked really well here.

We both ordered the Morris Ramen, and I got mine with Nori (seaweed) and Kikurage (thinly sliced, small mushrooms). The noodles had a great firm texture, and the broth was fantastic. It was incredibly flavorful. The pork was fine, but I'm not sure that I would have missed it if it wasn't there. I'm glad I added the additional mushrooms and nori, but it wasn't essential to the experience.

I'm definitely going back. Delicious, filling soup to warm you on a cold day!
