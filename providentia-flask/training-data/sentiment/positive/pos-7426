If I lived in the University area, this would be my office every single damn day. Great, now I have to start making up excuses to drive up here. I can see it now- "Yes, I would love to have our meeting uptown by your office, but wouldn't it be more fun to drive to University and drink bubble tea?!"

I fell in love from the moment we walked through the door. I love the big, white flowery looking light fixture. Morgan F and I each got one of the mason tea jars (mega mango and wild berry fusion), some edamame, and a banh mi. All of the mason tea jars have fresh diced fruits, chia seeds, and jelly (of some sort). On top of a huge seleciotn of teas and bubble teas, they also have Vietnamese coffee, French press, and fruit slushies. They also have a snack type menu, banh mi sandwiches, and a dessert case. I restrained myself from getting green tea cheesecake. 

Free wi-fi. Clean. Cute little flowers on the tables. I saw a couple people playing board games. So, what really put this place over the top for me? Customer service. He helped us order and explained menu items. When we were leaving, we both still had drinks left. We were about to leave them behind, when he came up to offer making them to go cups. Sealed, new straw, and everything.
