Definitely our favorite Summerlin restaurant.  Service and food is consistently good.  Elizabeth Blau is a master at developing restaurants and we're fortunate that she decided to open one in our backyard.  

We've had everything on the menu and its all really good.  The filet, the New York, Nana's curry, the salmon, the burger...  Their starters and salads are perfect, as are their cocktails and desserts.  

The reason we frequent this place is because they have the best kids menu in town.  Reasonably priced with good quality choices.  The kids especially love their build-your-own sundae with Oreo crumble dirt and gummy worms.  

This place is always packed but service is always on point!!  

The only request from a regular is that I wish they would either offer a more seasonal menu that changed more frequently.
