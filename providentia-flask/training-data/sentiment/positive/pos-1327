Tried this place for the first time today and was very pleased. We made a reservation for a co-worker's birthday lunch and were a group of 16 people. The restaurant said that they get very busy at noon so we had to book it for a little before noon. It was perfect, because the place was getting very packed right at noon. Great selection on the menu. Service was friendly and fast. I am surprise that they did not make any mistake when they brought out the food/bill, they knew exactly who were having what which is quite impressive since we were a big party. Food was really good. I had the Margarita flat bread and it was delish! Everyone from our group also really enjoyed their food. The waiting for the bill was a little long, but understandable considering that it was their lunch rush. WIll definitely come back.
