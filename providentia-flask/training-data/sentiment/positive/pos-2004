If you like tapas style dishes with a Hawaiian flair, then 808 Tapas is for you. They offer a variety of hot and cold dishes as well as sushi. Service is always great and don't forget to check out their lunch and happy hour specials!

Favorites include:
Snow crab with mango, avocado, tomato and onion (formerly the snow crab stack) - light and refreshing with a slight citrus flavor 

808 sliders - beef sliders with mushrooms and taro chips (awesome!!)

Poke nachos - tuna poke on top of lotus root chips

Spicy garlic edamame - the name says it all

Kaiser sushi roll - imitation crab roll topped with raw tuna and mango

Tonight was probably our 10th visit (maybe more) and the menu has changed slightly. Most of our faves are still there, but they did remove the tako karaage :(
