When I visit a restaurant, select a dish of my preference, and the dish arrives hot and tasty, I am a happy camper.  My selection was the Seafood Bayou with tilapia and shrimp both grilled to perfection.  The steaming hot entree was served over Tavern Rice with a side of fresh fruit that was absolutely delicious.  Being in a Tavern, I had to order something to drink.  I opted for the hard apple cider which tasted pretty much like an apple martini with a bit less punch.  It was quite tasty and I had to remind myself to sip rather than drink!  For dessert, the chocolate cake sounded delicious but I could not stuff any more into my mouth.  Although I drive by regularly, I had forgotten Hickory Tavern was at this location.  I enjoyed my meal and anxiously look forward to my next visit.  This lunchtime visit was superb.  

I almost forgot to talk about the sweet potato fries!  They are fabulous with honey drizzled on top (or you can have it on the side)!  If you are not afraid of something that tastes good, give them a try.

NOTE:  Since the hubs and I had the kids with us, an evening meal in a Tavern would have been out of the question.
