I have seen multiple shows in Vegas, but the Bellagio fountains hold a special place in my heart. A visit to Vegas isn't complete without seeing at least two fountain shows. I just looove how in sync the fountains are with the music. I always feel so happy watching them and it's one of the first things I look forward to doing every time I'm in Vegas.
