We recently visited Bottiglia for the first time. We pleasantly surprised with the brightness of their interior and decor. There are TV's throughout and they have outdoor seating with misters. The staff was very friendly and we were checked on often by them and the management. Their menu is not pricey and have some nice food & wine selections. We had the Halibut & Risotto and Chicken Parmigiana. The halibut was moist and flakey, risotto was perfect and the chicken was moist and flavorful, not dry like some other places we've patronized. Dessert was a tasty Tiramisu with Cookie. A very good dining experience and we look forward to returning again.
