Great pizza! I like coming here for individual pizzas because my husband and I like completely different toppings. This was our second visit and just as good as the first time. I got the roman crust this time, because the pizza crust is my favorite part. It was perfect! I also like that the pizza is cooked throughly. No wet droopy middle like other places with similar pizza. Friendly, quick service as well.
