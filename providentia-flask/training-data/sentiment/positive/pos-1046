What a great place! The staff to customer ratio is nearly even. Small and quaint, great service and amazing food! Leave room for the tempura cheesecake!! We had an appetizer, two entrees, desert, hot and iced tea-$40.
The service by David himself was worth $1000!
Puts the high end B.S Asian eateries to shame.
My vote for the best!
