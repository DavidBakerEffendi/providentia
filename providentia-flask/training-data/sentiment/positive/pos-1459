This place is quintessential 514:( joie-de-vivre)^inf. Testament to the high fun quotient of the entire island, this gem is not located downtown but is in one of the northern 'burbs. 

You're not seated until everyone in your party has shown up but that just builds up anticipation as you see others having fun.

The decor is tacky fun: dragon heads, rustic lamps, very woodsy, supported by appropriately clad wenches and minstrels!

The food is hearty, tasty fun: bison, boar, fries et al. It's been a while since I last visited but the garlic fries left an indelible impression! The menu is a bit lacking in the vegetarian department, but  vikings and kings didn't dine on fiddleheads and arugula!

The entertainment is uber fun: it's very participatory as the waitstaff amble up to you and target you in a gentle roast or an awkward dance! The minstrels provide the background score to add to the ambiance.

I've had many great memories in this renaissance themed restaurant: being asked to belly dance with another random patron, having friends asked to entertain the room at large, singing with the slightly tipsy waitstaff ( they drink while they serve you)!

The Red Dragon is a bit on the more expensive side, but then again, no one said that entering the belly of the dragon wouldn't come at a price!
