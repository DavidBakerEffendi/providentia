First time here and we loved it! Great food, great atmosphere, great music and great dessert! And to top it off we found out we can bring our dog and sit on the patio. They even have a small menu for your fur baby. We will definitely be back...with our fur baby next time. Our Server, Michael, was so awesome and was the one who gave us all the information...which is why we will be back.
