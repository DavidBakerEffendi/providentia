Lordy, where do I begin?? I have been enjoying Nancy's cookies for over a decade now so it's just amazing to me that I have never been!!

Meh fianc√© and I decided to stop on a cold day last week. We thought this cookie would go well with our coffee. Well did we end up with a treat!! The nice gentlemen working brought fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. They were out of this world!!!!!!

We also sampled the chocolate covered chocolate chip cookie, very good! The buckeye and sugar cookie were very good, just not made the way I prefer. 

I can't wait to go back and buy more of these  cookies fresh out of the oven and see the friendly workers!!
