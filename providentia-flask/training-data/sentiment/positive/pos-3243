Loved this place! I went on a Saturday and didn't have to wait long for a table. It's good for small groups but wouldn't recommend for larger groups as the seating is a bit tight. 

The food was delicious and the atmosphere was so quaint! My friend from Montreal was visiting and she felt like she was back at home! They did mix up our order so our food took a long time, but it was worth the wait :) Definitely will be back.
