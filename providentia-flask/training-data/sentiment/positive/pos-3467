They bring their spices from India. They specialize in South Indian food. They are serious about it. Best Indian food I've had in Montreal. Having been to Southern India 4 times, I vouch for the authenticity.

I recommend the different dosas and the biryanis. The curries were also very flavourful.

My colleague from India picked this place, and what a place it is! Story goes that the owner, a consultant working in a large firm,  started in the restaurant business as a side job, in a little alley with 4 tables. Today they have a mid size restaurant with a private part room, and are planning to open a second restaurant somewhere downtown in the spring.
