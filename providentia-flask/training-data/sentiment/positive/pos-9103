Best fried/fast seafood spot in AZ. They don't try to compare themselves to ritzy fresh seafood joints. You are getting what you pay for.. A yummy cheap seafood grease party in your mouth. Huge fan of the fried shrimp and cocktail sauce. I would recommend eating your food there as take out orders don't taste the same after the drive home. I've read some of these other reviews, these folks are just missing the concept. As for all the million cars in the drive thru and long lines at the window.. These people get it and for some reason don't write reviews. I just wish you all would open one in the north valley!
