I really love Peppermint and it is a real treat to go for lunch. It is really clean and has a better decor than any other Thai restaurant I have visited. The stadd has always been friendly and the service attentive. The first time I ever had Pad Thai was here. I tried it somewhere else afterwards and then determined I would only get it here. Their crab rolls and spinach potstickers are very good. Panang curry is where it's at for me. I have had it pretty spicy here and have enjoyed every runny nose, too.
