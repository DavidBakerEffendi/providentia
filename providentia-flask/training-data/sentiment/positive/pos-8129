This place looks like a total dive from the outside and is in a difficult to access parking lot. However, the food was so good! I had the Carolina Gold pulled pork sandwich. My dad had the Chicago Dog. We are thinking about going back again the very next day! I didn't notice at first but there are model train tracks running all along the ceiling. How neat to watch the trains go around.
