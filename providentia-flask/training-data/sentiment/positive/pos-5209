City Oven now delivers! Luckily nothing was lost in the short journey from Banksville Road to our home in Beechview. The pie, adorned with black olives, bacon, and minced garlic remained as wood-fired crisp in crust as it had been when we dined there 2 1/2 years ago. The wings were as meaty and well-seasoned as ever. 

We were told that City Oven no longer carries gelato, which is probably a good thing (see my previous review).
