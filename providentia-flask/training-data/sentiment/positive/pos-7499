Food is super tasty and beautifully presented, service is very nice!

Came here early for dinner one night on a weekday and the restaurant wasn't busy, but towards later in the evening, the restaurant was full. So come early. The drinks menu has the 12 Chinese zodiac themed cocktails which was super cool. Just find the year you were born and order the drink that correspond to your year. 

Our server was very nice and gave us a bunch of recommendations on the menu items and also explained the menu and portion sizes. We ordered a bunch of small plate appetizers to share as tapas style. The menu is extensive and the choices is abundant, anything your heart desires. Out of the 6 appetizers we ordered, EVERYTHING was delicious!! There was not a single dish I didn't like. Duck quesadillas were super tasty, the jicama and mango salsa was perfect. The minced thai lettuce wrap and the ahi tuna shrimp lettuce wrap were both delicious with perfect flavoring. Crab cakes were also super tasty and full of real crab meat. Calamari steaks with jalapeno was flavored beautifully, and we got a sushi roll that was full of fresh fish and no rice for those of us on a low carb diet. Well I was also saving my carbs for dessert which we got the variety mochi ice cream and my favorite the fried banana with vanilla bean ice cream. yum!

Service was superb, sweet and attentive. Bathroom is outside of the restaurant in the casino. Great experience, highly recommend!
