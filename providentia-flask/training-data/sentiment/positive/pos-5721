First off, I will let everyone know that this location is WAY BETTER than the Lindsay location. The atmosphere inside is 100% Southwestern. Lots of cool colors and they have booth seating UNLIKE the store atmosphere of the Lindsay Avenue location.
Now, for the food. We had ordered the weekend special Pozole. $6.99. With awesome fry bread. When we ordered it, the manager came over to us (guy manager) and told us that they were out of Pozole because it had been a busy day and offered to make us fresh Pozole and also said if we would want a snack like Nachos and he would take care of it. That was very nice! He said we could have any meat we wanted. We chose Machaca ( dried shredded beef). It was a huge order. It had cheese, Machaca, guacamole, beans, sour cream and poco de gallo. It was DELICIOUS!  We of course wanted to save room for the Pozole so we boxed it up and ate the Pozole. It was Fresh and hot! Came with onion and cilantro mix. Was very good and we WILL return due to the food and great customer service. Thank you guy manager! It was appreciated. It was worth the wait for the Fresh Pozole
