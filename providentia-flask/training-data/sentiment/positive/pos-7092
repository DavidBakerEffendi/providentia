This was my first time at this place... amazing. I was a bit disappointed not to get the butternut squash ravioli but they don't  start serving pastas until after 3. I got the seasonal butternut squash salad and it was fantastic! Service is much like Panera. Order at the front take a number and they bring food to your table.
