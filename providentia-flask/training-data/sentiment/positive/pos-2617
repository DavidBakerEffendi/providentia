Another restaurant I went to purely on Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. If you showed me photos of Smoky Jon's, handed me a review, and even gave me some sample BBQ; I still wouldn't have believed this place existed in Madison. Jon's feels lifted straight out of another state, further to the South, and full of BBQ. 

Their "In" door and wood corral will lead you straight to the counter to order. Take your food with you and follow the rails and the trail of framed BBQ awards to the "Out" door. Or sit down at one of the dozen 2-top tables with red checkered cloths. Short ribs, brisket, turkey, and chicken all come with enough sauce to cause heart problems. The ample sides of mashed potatoes, coleslaw, brown beans, and sweet bread won't help your health either. But it will taste good.
