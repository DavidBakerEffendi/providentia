I love Aladdin's just so so much! Came here for my birthday lunch yesterday and the service was outstanding and the food so so delicious, as always. I had the beef shwarma rolled and the baba as a an appetizer. Gotta love those pickled veggies on the shwarma! This is a standard choice for Mediterranean and I will always come back.
