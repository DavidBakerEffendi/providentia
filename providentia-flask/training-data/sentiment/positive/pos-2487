Lucky Foo for happy hour today! 1st time here & it's fantastic. The staff is super friendly. The bartender Miguel recommended the Ebiyaki: 5 Japanese shrimp battered balls, deep fried with red ginger, creamy Kisho aioli & bonita flakes. The sushi chef Gabe made me the Lasagna roll: crab salad, avocado with yum yum sauce, cream cheese, eel, sriracha, micro greens & fried shallot. Wow, both are taste explosions. All around phenomenal! Will be back to try much more!!
