Absolutely delicious!!! My burger was better than any other burger I've had at any restaurant. It was huge and juicy and cheesy. I got a Deluxe Burger with mushrooms and bacon. It was the best. I got onion rings and cheese sticks. The onion rings are battered not floured and the cheese sticks were just okay for $8, but $10 for the best burger I've had...I'll be back! Plus they're open late!!!! My new spot!!!! I wish I could have shown you a picture, but the dang thing was gone before I could even think about it! :-)
