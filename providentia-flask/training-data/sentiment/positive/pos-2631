Wow... who could've thought something so simple could be so good. The concept - everything involves eggs in some form or another. Came to the LV location inside the Cosmo hotel for breakfast. Got in line around 945AM and it was already wrapped around but we noticed it moved quickly. After about 15-20 min we ordered. Gaucho sounded great so that's what I ordered. The egg was cooked perfectly and the beef inside the sandwich was well marinated. You could actually taste the salt/pepper and other spices on the beef. The bread was something I had never tasted before but sort of a croissant/bagel as it was fluffy like a croissant but not greasy. 

Service was good food was amazing... only 1 problem, there's no location in/around/near Washington DC
