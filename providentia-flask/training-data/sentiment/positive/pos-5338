Listen I've said it before and I'll say it again: BEST VALUE AYCE IN WOODBRIDGE

There is not a single AYCE place on Woodbridge that can match this place for quality, freshness, speed, and price point. When we have places charging near $30 per person this place is still tremendous value at both lunch and dinner at $12 and $19 respectively. 

The real value lies in the selection of rolls which are $3, $4 and $6 depending on the list you get them from. Unheard of ordering a la carte. Their best values lie in their take out platters.  No other place can give you that amount of quality maki rolls for that price. Not that I've found anyways and I've nearly tried every place in Woodbridge and Markham. 

They've won "best of Vaughan" awards and owner is all about volume and quality. If you understand this is Chinese made AYCE, then it's really hard to do better than this place. 

My favour place and I try to make it a point to come here for take out or AYCE everytime I visit my family in Woodbridge or go to Vaughan Mills.
