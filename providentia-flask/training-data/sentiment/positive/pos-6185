Under new ownership. Things have improved greatly. Awesome customer service wings still great actually have improved, slight price increases but if I didn't eat there on a regular regular basis would not even noticed. Met new owner he is very customer oriented and that shows in his staff. As I said Wings are excellent, subs and sandwiches are very good, have not had the pizza yet but talking to folks who have they are pretty good. Remember this is a mom and pop place not a national chain so your supporting local business the money stays in local communities not stuffing some corporate big wigs pockets.
