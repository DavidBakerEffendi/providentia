My coworkers and I came up from Kingman, AZ for a work event and we decided to try something new. We came in and our waiter, Manny, instantly sat us and got our drinks. His personality is unique and I appreciated that he called us by our first names the entire time. The wait on the food was minimal and the presentation was impressive to say the least. This was a perfect option for those times when everyone wants something different. The cook/owner Matthew came out to introduce himself and got to know our names as well. Overall, this is a great new restaurant and we definitely plan on returning.
