Came here just because the Chicago style tacos caught my attention.  As soon as in went inside I was welcomed by the owner who was super nice.  I got the  3 taco meal with rice, beans, and a drink for $8.99. The tacos were delicious and the chips and salsa was very fresh.  I recommend this place if your into street tacos.
