Service is always great at the drive thru, went in for the first time tonight.  I didn't get his name but the guy at the register was really nice.  He let my daughter try horchata for the first time - she loved it! My taco salad was perfect, my 14 yr old son devoured his tacos.  He came up for air long enough to say he thought the guacamole was just made & my daughters burrito was well, you guessed it - SUPER! This tired Mom is happy she made a good choice for dinner!  Thanks for cooking guys! We'll be back!
