Lunch with my Pop and he really likes a sandwich for lunch - nothing hot.  We both ordered the small Bobbie.  You get a LOT of sandwich for a "small" (it's 9 inches and STUFFED with goodness).

Think cold turkey that was freshly made, stuffing, and cranberry too (mayo too, which you can always opt out of if you wish).  Mmmm...
