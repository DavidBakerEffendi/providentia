Great traditional punjabi /  indian food at a great price.  The customer service was great and they accommodated all my requests. I had butter chicken with garlic naan, it was very tasty, and my thali also had a delicious veggie mix of potatoes. Great food, great service, awesome business and would definitely recommend.
