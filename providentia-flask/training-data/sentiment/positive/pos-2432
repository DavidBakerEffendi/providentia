Went back again today & everything was spot on.

Of the specialties, had the beef buns, the pot stickers & the beef pies. Added the cold, spicy noodles with cucumber & the cumin lamb.

Everything was fantastic. 

The dumplings & pies were hot and the super tasty. I love what they do with the fillings. Great flavors. But they are really amazing with the dough parts. The bun of the beef bun itself was fantastic. Chewy, crispy, perfect. The dumpling wrapper of the pot stickers was also wonderful. I know they do XLB at times & I need to try that. I've heard it's gotten better from when they first started. If it's not fantastic yet, I have hope that they'll get there.

Everything just seemed so much more dialed in than my last visit. That was a good while ago.

I definitely won't be waiting as long until I return!
