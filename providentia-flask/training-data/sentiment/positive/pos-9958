Wow!  Highly recommend this spot if you are looking for a burger experience out of the ordinary.  To start with,  they have about 25-30 different shakes to start off...and they come in half sizes so it won't fill you up.  You get to build your own burger with about 25-30 different options.no extra charge!  We ordered the combo fry/onion rings basket which was as good as everything else.  As for the staff, super friendly!  They have only been open a week, so get here and beat the rush that is sure to ensue!
