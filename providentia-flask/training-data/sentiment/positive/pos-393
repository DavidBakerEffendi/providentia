We came here for an office dinner. We had 20 people for dinner on a Friday night at 7pm.... the wait was 45 minutes which is far better than other places we have gone such as Dave and Busters (2 hour wait) and Bennihanas (1.5 hour wait)... the food was amazing, the waitstaff was efficient, accurate, and friendly. The best part was with the reasonable prices even with 20 adults we didn't have to break the bank. I would recommend this place to anyone. I love many items here but my favorite is the Italian stuffed grinder. (Or sub sandwich as I guess some people call it)... and a must have is their pizza cookie.  The only downside is their parking situation. Be prepared to park and walk since their actual parking lot fills up fast.
