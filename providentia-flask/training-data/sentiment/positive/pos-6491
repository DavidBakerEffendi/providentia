I love this place! It has solid 4 to 4.5 star food. They make, without doubt, the best Philly I've had east of the Mississippi. And they make it any way your heart desires. My sandwich fave is the Italian Philly. I get it with extra grilled onions and mayo, hold the red sauce. Their french fries are also really tasty. Everything is hot and fresh.

So if the food is 4 to 4.5, why the five star review? The staff, flat out. Everyone who works there is family and they seem to think I'm family too. Now we all have dark hair and a somewhat swarthy complexion but I don't remember any of these people at the Thanksgivings of my childhood. Doesn't matter. They treat all their customers as if they're family, and like they're family that's actually loved and missed.

If you have the opportunity, try a Philly at Philly's Famous. If you're a Philly fan you'll be really glad you did. Oh, and don't be surprised to pick up some new relatives along the way.
