My very first visit to AZ Ayesha took me to Oreganos for some pizza and a beer after we hiked up and down a Mountain. It seemed like a good way to reward ourselves for the hard work.  As I prepared to return for a quick valentimes whistle stop return, my one request was to sit outside again in the warmth of the desert and drink a beer at Oreganos.

I didn't quite get my wish, as we decided on dinner rather than lunch, and at that point it was even too cold to sit outside for this Michigander.  But all that melted away as we ordered the Picasso.  A finer, tastier deep dish pizza you will never have.  Not Chicago, not anywhere. Yes it takes 45 minutes, but we were surrounded with fantastic company and drinking delicious beers, so the wait flew by.

So while I normally eschew the chains, I make a large exception for this local AZ wonder.  Can't wait to return Oreganos - next time we dine al fresco.
