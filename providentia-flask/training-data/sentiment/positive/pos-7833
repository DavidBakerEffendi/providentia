We went in tonight and had a great experience! We did the call ahead seating, which again is ONLY call ahead seating. This is not a reservation, even if you call ahead, you'll probably still have a short wait.

We called ahead and were told 25-35 minutes. We got there about 30 minutes later and only waited 10 more minutes and in those 10 minutes we enjoyed a beer :)

JB was our server and he was excellent, I had some concerns about the steak options and he made great recommendations. Kept our drinks full and had a smile the entire time!

We will definitely be back soon and we will be requesting JB's section!
