While out cycling we stopped at this Fired Pie, we'd never had eaten there before so we thought it'd be a great quick carb snack and back on the road. They had an outside eating area in the shade and they were kind enough to allow us to pull our bikes in beside our table since there werent any bike parking in the entire shopping center.

The staff was very friendly and very helpful, the place was nice and clean inside and out; the food was off the chain; Loved it. We will certainly stop in again.
