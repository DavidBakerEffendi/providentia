Fresh Cup is basically my second home. I am here at least two days every week. The staff is also super friendly that I've actually become friends with most of them! Their boss is also a sweetheart!

This boba-smoothie joint is probably one of the very few places that you can get drinks for UNDER $3 or $4, AND it's actually pretty freaking good. Most cheap boba places suck but Fresh Cup knows how to make great drinks. 

My usual orders are: Thai tea smoothie, milk tea, green tea smoothie, and a strawberry-banana smoothie
These are my top favorites and they never do me wrong. 

This place is also a great spot to study and do hw because they provide free wifi! You also have entertainment with the tv's that play K-pop shows. 

Fresh Cup is my favorite place to grab a tasty drink, relax, and stare at epic Korean dancing/singing/fashion (mild humor).
