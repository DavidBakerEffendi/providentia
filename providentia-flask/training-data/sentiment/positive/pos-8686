Rather than doing a lot of things and doing them mediocre, I prefer to do a few things with excellence. That is exactly what Nancy B's does.  They do cookies and they do them with excellence.  They are best known for their chocolate chop cookies. They shop them all over the world. They don't use preservatives. They use real butter. They are huge in size. Two people can share one. One bite and you are hooked. 
All of their cookies are incredible. They sell them like crazy-especially around the holidays. If you don't like to bake but need cookies for an event, call Nancy B's. 
It's a tiny place in the bottom of a building. The entrance is on the backside of the building. It's 2 cookie counters and enough room for 4 people to stand. They take CASH ONLY.   Hit the ATM and go indulge.
