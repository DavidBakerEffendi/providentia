man, this place was good. after a few drinks down the street for cinco de mayo, we walked over to cien agaves for some tasty food.

despite being quite full, we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival. you have to ask for the chips and salsa, and we did, and they were possibly the best complimentary chips and salsa i've ever had! the salsa's were even hot! as in spicy....

3pm rolled around and we started our happy hour drinking. 3.50 for house margaritas...not the crappy pre-made mix kind...the good stuff! and boy were they good! so good i had 2, could've had more, but the day was young. i ordered the cheese enchiladas and unlike most "mexican" restaurants, ay chihuahua, these were awesome! the tortillas were cooked evenly..no rubbery ends to gnaw on. the cheese was gooey and plentiful and the sides of rice and beans were a nice filler. 

service was fantastic...kept the water coming and despite the place being packed, she checked on us constantly throughout our hour long stay. 

i can't wait to hit up their daily happy hour again, 3-7pm!
