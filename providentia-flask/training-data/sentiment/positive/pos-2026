Excellent restaurant. Not an expert on authenticity but definitely an expert on taste and the aptly named Gou Bu Li steam bun tastes simply amazing! Out of this world even dare I say!

Other dishes mostly tasted good to great. Duck breast was yummy as well. Their Signature fried rice was light and low on sodium which is how I like mine.

The restaurant atmo is clean and fairly bright. They have an additional loft area on the second floor with a more private setting as well as the main floor tables and VIP room.

Overall I really enjoyed the food here and will be going back for those yummy buns.
