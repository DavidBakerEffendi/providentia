Beautiful space and delicious fried chicken. I loved the minimalist design, white walls and huge windows letting in tons of light. 

The fried chicken is breaded with matzo meal I believe, which gives it its unique texture. The meat is juicy. I highly recommend the thighs out of the three types of fried chicken. The sauces are all made in house which is crazy! 

We tried a variety of other dishes besides the fried chicken...including collard greens and milkshakes. I highly recommend the strawberry milkshake. Fries were okay, next time I'll get them plain instead of loaded. Alcohol offerings are a bit limited, but since it's a fast casual restaurant I will forgive them.

The Bluebird sandwich is this location's exclusive sandwich. My friend liked it, but I'm not a fan of blue cheese so I stayed away.
