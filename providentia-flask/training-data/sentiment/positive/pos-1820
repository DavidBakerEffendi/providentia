I have gotten take-out from here twice in the past week . It's a little hidden gem just off 71st and Shea ( on Becker) tucked between Handle Bar J's and a strip mall. Their sign is barely visable under a great Misquite Tree and only signed from the east side view. Sounds complicated, but once you find it, you will be dancing in the streets! 
The pizza cooks in 90 seconds ( literally), so if you want to take dinner a little slower, don't order it right away. The appetizers I have tried while ordering my take-out have been great! My family and friends CRAVE this pizza! I live in central Phx, but it is so worth the drive. If you get take out, trust me and order 2 pies. I  got two bites of the last pizza I brought home. They see the box enter the door, grab and run!! It's comical and scarry! I try and live Gluten-Free and have yet to ask them if they can come up with a crust for GF pizza, but weirdly enough I don't feel bad after eating it and didn't gain any weight. My friend said the same thing of her experience with their pizza. That made us both happy! I rarely eat pizza, because I have never found one I like in the valley. Now I found one I LOVE!!!. Il Bosco is  quaint &  hip with super simple deliciously yummy food. Ciao!
