we went for dinner on saturday. the line was so long. i think we waited for about an hour or so. it was about $36 +18% gratuity since we had a party of 12. one of the guys was like 'if they dont have beef wellington, we're going some where else" so he walked in and checked. good thing because that beef wellington was so good! so tender and flavorful with the sauce on top. the shrimp cocktail was also good. their crab legs are cut long ways so you dont have to fuss with any cracking or getting your hands dirty. their creme brulee was also really good. they also have soft serve, one machine with vanilla and chocolate and the other machine with peach and raspberry sorbet. the sorbet was really good. they picked up our plates pretty fast and also refilled our drinks promptly. i think the bellagio buffet is still one of the top buffets in vegas.
