FRESH...TASTY...SO MANY CHOICES!!!! I honestly wish this was a fancy dine in place because of the extensive menu. It is more of a on the go/take out. There are places to sit though. The ladies working are very nice! I've tried a bunch of various rolls from here and they're always A+! My friend swears by their poke bowls, she say they're the best in TO!! Well done Sushi Shop!
