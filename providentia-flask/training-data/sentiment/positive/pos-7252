What a fun place to go, I came for lunch with a friend during work, so we weren't able to stay and test out the games - he got the burger with sweet potato fries and I got the chicken salad, grilled instead of fried.  The food was awesome and pretty big in size.  There was a good amount of people, but the restaurant could have held many more.  Looking forward to going back at a time I can grab a drink and relax/play some games.
