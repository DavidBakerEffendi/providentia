Moving to LV from Texas 12 years ago one of the things I've missed the most was good Tex-mex. When I saw the sign that Los Cucos was coming I was so excited. I have eaten at their Katy Tx. location several times and am a huge fan. For months I anxiously waited for them to open, telling all of my friends how amazing it was compared to all of the other Mexican places here. I have eaten there 4 times since they have opened, each time with a different person and every time they tell me how right I was.  On each occasion I've ordered different things and each time they come out fresh, hot and perfectly seasoned. The warm chips and red and green salsas are so delicious and truly addicting. The queso with beef fajita meat makes you want to lick the bowl. They have great lunch specials with huge portions and the stuffed avocado is sublime. They have a great chicken dish that is covered in a mushroom wine sauce that will make you dream about the next time you can get there to have it again. Everyone I bring here can't get over how awesome the fajita meat is. It's so tender and seasoned to perfection. I know some people are not fans of Tex- Mex and that's okay you can keep your Lindo and  Leticias, all of my friends and I will be at Los Cucos!
