The best kept secret in town!! An established restaurant that has proven over and over that the food has to be top to come back years after years to a restaurant!
The chef owner Mostapha really cares about the meals and the combination as well as the quality of food. The meat comes form an elevage out in the country where he knows where the animals were raised and fed. The service is excellent with experienced staff, which makes all the difference. PLUS it's not everywhere that the chef comes out and check on you to find out if you liked the food. Nice touch!
The Bring Your Own Wine is a great concept if you want some value dining out. 
This restaurant sits in my top priority list of restaurant in Montreal! Great location and lots of windows. They also have a second floor. 
Hurry and try it!!
