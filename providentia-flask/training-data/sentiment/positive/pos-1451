I typically hate everything in Old Town, but who can hate a Mexican restaurant that's open late, serves a huge variety of drinks, has great and imaginative tacos, can accommodate those who eat clean.

The lean green bowl is black beans, Greek yogurt, roasted veggies, tomatoes and lime quinoa. It's outstanding and even better with shrimp for a few bucks more.

Ahi tuna tacos also are terrific.
