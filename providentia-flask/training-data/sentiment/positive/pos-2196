Delicious food with fantastic flavor. We loved the mix and match sliders (we had one meatball and one fish) and the Bloody Mary kabobs for our apps. The meatball was delicious and the fish cooked just right. The kabobs with the saut√©ed mushrooms were perfectly cooked and full of great seasonings. Next was a Caesar salad with dressing that tasted like a mix of traditional dressing with a hint of Italian. It was great. I had the Steak Diane which was amazing with mashed potatoes, fried onion strings, green beans and mushrooms. So good it won't soon be forgotten. My husband enjoyed the shrimp and chicken Cajun pasta with the best flavors we've ever tasted. Not too hot but very tasty. If you haven't been here you're missing out!
