I dined on the Mezzo floor of Sienna Mercato (second floor). This place features wine, charcuterie, and pizza. We had a reservation for 5 pm; however for the first 30 minutes of our meal we had essentially the entire place to ourselves. We had a seat right against the window and it was a beautiful location. 

We started with the small charcuterie plate and the small artisanal cheese platter. I highly suggest getting both of these together. We split this appetizer between the two of us, but it could provide a little taste for up to four people. We paired this with a glass of primitivo which apparently is made from the same grape as the red zinfandel. This wine was great once it had some time to breathe. 

For dinner we split the Tartufo pizza which has ricotta, fontina, roasted mushrooms, truffle, parmesean, farm egg, and chives. This pizza was so delicious. It is split into 6 pieces and we almost finished the whole thing between the two of us. The mushrooms are very meaty and the hint of truffle really adds another level to this pizza. Unfortunately, we were unable to have dessert because we had a show to catch; but our server gave us complimentary coconut cookies to go.

Our service was superb. The server really knew how to sell the menu and create combinations that customers will enjoy. He was very attentive but not too overwhelming. In addition, they didn't start our pizza until after our appetizer was finished which was wonderful. the pizza was fresh from the oven! Our entire experience came in at $65 which was a great value. I think two appetizers, dinner, and wine for that price is worth it. 

I can't wait to come back sometime soon and try their other cheese plate!!
