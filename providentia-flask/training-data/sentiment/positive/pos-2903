I have dined here for Sunday brunch a few times and was always impressed, but I finally got round to having dinner here last month. And...OH MY GOSH. Without a doubt one of my favorite dining experiences in Phoenix. My parents were visiting from out of town and I wanted to wow them with somewhere fantastic, El Chorro did not disappoint. We sat outside on the patio - what a great setting with some great music playing in the background.  Our server was fantastic (I wish I remembered his name, shame on me!). It was restaurant week and the $39 for an appt, entree and dessert was a steal of a deal, but we opted for the regular menu. A little pricey, but worth every penny. The sticky buns are to die for. El Chorro is the total package and I will, without a doubt, be going back there very soon.
