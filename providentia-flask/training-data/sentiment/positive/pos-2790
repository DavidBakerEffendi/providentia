This place is perfect!!! Very kind and courteous staff and it is very clean.  Not only do they provide prompt and excellent customer service, the are very helpful in explaining the different dishes and comparing them to something similar.  Their Szechwan Shrimp and Sesame beef are to die for!!! I'd recommend this place to anyone coming over to Avondale for a visit!
