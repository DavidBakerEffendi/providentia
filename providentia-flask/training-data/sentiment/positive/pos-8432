Wonderful experience!  The food is amazing: tasty, steaming hot, and inimitable.  The service is great, too;  we always get a table quickly, are waited on immediately, and they always pay extra attention to us.. In fact, we go once or twice a month and now know the owners, who are very friendly.  And they even know us by name, which comes in handy when we happen to place phone orders.  
Before you even order, they start you off with hot tea, if you desire.  After we place our order, the soup is served piping hot, with those amazing crunchy pieces to put in the soup, or, as my young son does, to dip in the red sauce often used for egg rolls.  And speaking of egg rolls, Dragon Palace has the best egg rolls I have ever tasted anywhere.  Their entrees are exceptional and huge; we always have a "doggy bag" for leftovers when we leave.  The atmosphere is conducive to what you should get at a Chinese restaurant, with decorations, lighting, and music.  One time, when the music was not Asian sounding, my son asked the owners to change it to their usual music, and they did as he requested.  Dragon palace is the best Chinese restaurant anywhere.
