Footes Valley Farm is KNOWN for their fresh sweet corn. IMHO some of the best sweet corn in NEO. What you may not know if that Footes has amazing homemade fresh pies, tarts, bread and strudels. 
I love to come and grab a Fruit of the Forest (strawberry,black berry, raspberry and blueberry), black cherry, peach or apple pie for an occasional treat or the perfect dessert for BBQs, family dinners or parties. 
Stop by for corn stay for the pies!
