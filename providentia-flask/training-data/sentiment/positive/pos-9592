Tried Fat Ox during Spring Restaurant Week. We made reservations for a Sunday evening via Open Table. Got 2 text reminders. 
Hostess was warm and welcoming; we were a few minutes early, so we sat at the bar -- interesting  and unique drink list. Friendly bartender. 
Dinner service was well paced, helpful and pleasant. I think we had a team of 3 working our table. I had the house salad to start, and it was one of the best, most interesting side salads I've ever eaten -- spring greens, frizzled prosciutto, walnuts, blue cheese, pomegranate. Delicious! DH had the veal meatballs and really liked them. For dinner, I had the jidori chicken. It was perfectly cooked and large enough for 2 meals. It comes with a flatbread, caramelized onions and greens. They serve a couple of sauces on the side. DH had the skirt steak w/pan seared mushrooms and onions. He loved it! Serving size was "appropriate" --. Not too much food. 
He ended with  tiramisu, which featured roasted banana and Nutella. I snagged a bite. Very sweet but a nice riff on the classic. I had lemon Panna cotta w/raspberry sauce. It was thinner than I expected but I enjoyed it. Both desserts were petite sizes, perfect ending to our meal. 
They have an Italian-heavy wine list w/very few choices under $100/bottle. We had a Barolo that was $75 and quite nice. 
I want to come back to try their pasta dishes. All in All, a very enjoyable evening, both because of the food and the service. I'd go back!
