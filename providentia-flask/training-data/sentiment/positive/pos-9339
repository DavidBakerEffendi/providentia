I seriously think this place gets better every time I go! Went again last night. We split the crispy shrimp tacos and the short rib barbacoa. SOOOO good! I like the dressing they put on the shrimp, but the sauce for the barbacoa was also great! This time I veered from my dark and stormy to get a mai tai that was delicioso.
and I can't get over how much I LOVE their chips and salsa (normally I couldn't care less about chips and salsa but here I continue to eat them long after I'm full of tacos, rice and beans!)
