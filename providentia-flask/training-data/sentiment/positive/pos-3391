I tried this place a long time ago (maybe 3/4 years ago) and the owner and his daughter were incredibly friendly. The customer service was unbeatable, they even offered us complimentary drinks. However, I wasn't so impressed by the food. I got the chicken pho and asked for veggies in it. I was told they didn't have veggies like broccoli and carrots to add to my soup. So, sadly, I didn't return. 

Fast forward to tonight and I was craving pho. I drive by this place all the time and finally decided it might be time to give it another shot...I'm so glad I did! The customer service was still top notch, still got a complimentary drink, but this time I got the well-done beef pho and they had the veggies to add AND the food was perfect! It was flavorful and hearty and totally hit the spot. Plus, maybe the best part, it was only around $7! A deal that's impossible to beat. Can't wait to try it again!
