My wife found this restaurant on Groupon, and we have eaten there at least almost 20 times since then.  Every time we go my wife has an internal struggle whether or not to eat the freshmade gnocchi.  My wife spent some time in Italy during college and is an Italian food snob.  I on the other hand do not have an internal struggle, I always get ravioli.  My wife and I love it here.  We go on special occasions or just drop in cause we are hungry and they always have table, but never look empty.  All the servers are great and know their stuff.  Rarely in all the times I have been there, have I not seen the owner walking around the tables, checking on diners and greeting.  This is one of the few restaurants I offer as suggestions to friends, and they have always reported back they loved, and some have become regulars themselves.
