My partner and I love a good curry (he's South African and I come from a West Indian family), and we're also lazy, so we order in a lot. We've tried every Indian place that will deliver to us, and Apalla is the only one that consistently pleases both of us. I should also mention that I'm veg and he's most decidedly not. Yet. 

We've tried several dishes and they've all been winners, so I don't think you can go wrong here. And he portions and prices are both very good, which is part of our criteria. 

Note:  We've never eaten at the restaurant itself, but I walk by all the time and it looks quite nice. 

Delivery takes about an hour, but we know that so it's no big surprise. This isn't mass produced pizza, after all. 

4 thumbs up from the vegetarian and the meat-eater!
