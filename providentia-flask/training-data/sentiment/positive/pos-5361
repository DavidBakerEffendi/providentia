We tried The Buffet for Breakfast this week, using my points from MyVegas game on facebook.  Breakfast for the 2 of us was $20 and change. (it was a BOGO)

This would have to be the best breakfast buffet we have eaten at in all of Las Vegas.  The server was absolutely outstanding!  Even though it's a buffet, the server can really do a lot to add to your experience.  And she did.  I wish I would have thought to get her name, just so I could give her props :)  The selection of food was incredible and fresh and delicious!   There is quite a bit of thought put into this buffet, right down to your very own little jars of jelly for your toast.  

We completely enjoyed ourselves here, and will be back next year to enjoy it again!

Thank you for a really great experience!
