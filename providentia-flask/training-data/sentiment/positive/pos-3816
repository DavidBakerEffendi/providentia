Ok, fun hot dogs, great tots, chimichurri, oh yeah.

The thing I love most about this place is the bartending staff.  One bartender in particular-- a woman with short hair and tats, always in some flannel-- is a beer genius.  Tell her what kind of beer you like and she will come up with amazing, on-point suggestions.
