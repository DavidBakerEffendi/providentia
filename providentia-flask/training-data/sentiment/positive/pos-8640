Jason, you are THE MAN! Thank you for making both this time and last time an incredible experience.

Returned a month or so later, eager to try it out again next time I came back to Vegas.

I think this round somehow exceeding my experience last time. I got a lot of the same dishes, as well as tried out a few new ones and I was not dissapointed.

Our waitress was incredible and service was quick and enjoyable...even the parties next to us had a great time and sparked great conversation. The ambiance is hip and sexy while still being inviting and enjoyable.

In addition to last time, we got the Chuchumber cocktail which wasn't too sweet but amazingly refreshing. We also got the phyllo-wrapped scallop which at first I assumed would take away from the taste of the scallop but instead the combination of textures was just awesome. 

We wanted to try one of the Peruvian ceviches, so we went with the ginger/soy yellowfin one, which was pretty tasty but not quite up on the same level when it comes to crazy flavor profiles. 

The other new dish we got was the Samba Strip roll. As somewhat of a sushi afficianado, I was excited to try it but not expecting a whole lot. Crazy enough the lobster and mango combination with the peanut curry sauce was really crazy good. The roll also was made with some crispy rice and served with a meaty lobster claw so it was a solid choice. 

The sea bass, sashimi, and little kobe taquitos were just as good as I remembered them and was not let down.

Thank you to everyone at Sushi Samba for making it such a great second experience. I've already sent a number of friends over and I will definitely continue recommending more your way.
