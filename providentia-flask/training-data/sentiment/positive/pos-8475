I ate at this place around the time that it opened and although I can't remember what exactly we ate, I do remember the bread pudding bringing me to cloud nine! We shared among the three of us and I low key wanted my own after the first bite. The interior is super cute with lots of decor on the wall. I loved how they offered this hand salt thingy for extra moisture. I've been wanting to go back to this place and I'm sure I'll leave as happy as I did the first time...if not happier!
