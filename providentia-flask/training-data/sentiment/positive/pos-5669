Love Bertha's! My husband is a regular here and probably hates me reviewing his well kept secret, but Bertha's is just so tasty that I can't resist. Their sandwiches are phenomenal , but for those of us who feel the need to eat salads but never feel satisfied, you will love the salads here. They're nicely sized portions will fill you up and not leave you feeling quily. If you go at lunch, get there early. The line starts getting long around 11:30. The only negative thing about this restaurant are the people who let their co-workers cut in line during the lunch rush. Does this bother anyone else out there???
