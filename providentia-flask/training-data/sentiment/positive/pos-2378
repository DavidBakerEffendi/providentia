This IS the best Mexican food restaurant in the valley. I was seated instantly on a busy night with my family, was given hot chips and cold drinks after a few seconds, then all our food was delivered after a good 15 minutes and it was THE BEST food I have ever eaten. I can't wait to come back for my birthday.
