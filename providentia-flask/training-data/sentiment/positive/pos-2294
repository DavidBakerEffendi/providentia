Me and my girlfriend take our dog Pablo to lazy dog every couple months, the first time we went.. he won cutest dog award and they gave us a free dog meal next time we go :p

The quality of the food is very very good, the service is friendly and fast. We eat on the balcony every time and always enjoy ourselves.
