Hot-biggity-burgers this is one fine grill. I hope by now you've had a chance to experience the charm of Burger 320 in Bridgeland, but in case you haven't: burgers crafted of fresh brisket, ground daily on-site from locally raised beef, with fresh local farm ingredients served inside fresh-baked, branded buns, (deep breath...) with gelato to boot, all inside one super tiny, beyond minuscule shack of a building.

The new Kensington location rocks the same concept as the first, but with one big change -Â no more tiny shack! Epic burgers, to-die-for parm fries, delicious gelato, all in a space that you can kick back in and relax. They're licensed and carry the full lineup of Unibroue beers from Quebec. I'll let you in on a little secret: Beer and burgers go really well together!

With the bigger size comes and increase in menu to go along with it. They've added waffles to the list and feature a list of sweet and savour concoctions ranging from a s'mores waffle to a philly cheese steak waffle. My favourite so far - chicken and waffles. They're expertly crispy, juicy, and come served with a white gravy, maple syrup and some dollops of Sriracha. It's a comfort food flavour explosion.

Fave burger: The Wickens - beef patty, wicked good bacon, block cheddar, aioli, arugula and BBQ rhubarb onion chutney.

Go here. They're open late too.
