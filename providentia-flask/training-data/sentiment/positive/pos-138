Love me some fantastic Mexican! Whenever we have the free time--which seems never---we head over to Coyote for lunch and Happy Hour. They have some incredible deals on Margarita for HH in the from of my favorite: jumbo 36 ounces for 10.00. Cannot be beat. Also, Mexican Beer for 3.75 is a steal and my husband happily loves this part of our trip. The lunch is super quick and easy in terms of getting a table and making it out in under an hour. We usually have the quesadilla or one of the specials. Typically these run about 7 dollars each and this is a steal as the portions are very large and we almost always leave with to go boxes. The service is super quick and friendly and the place is very clean. Love it here and it is so fresh and authentic. Can get a little crowded during HH, but so fun with all of the people here  and the lively nature of the crowd. Great little place in Bainbridge.
