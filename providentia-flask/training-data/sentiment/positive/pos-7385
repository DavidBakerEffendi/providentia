LOVE the food here. Been coming for years but was prompted to write a review after my recent visit.
LOVE, love, LOVE the setting at this unique little organic farm in South Phoenix.
Wonderful place to bring out of town friends and family or visitors in the workplace. 
Food is expensive but everything tastes so fresh and just a bit different than what you get everywhere else (such as Dates on the BLT and Butternut Squash in the Creme Brulee)..and all that greenery! Even in summer. 
One of my Favorite Spots in Phoenix for sure! Bring a blanket. Bring the kids...enjoy!
