A true gem! This place has been around for over 20 years, in the same location. Not knowing what to expect the first time there, you're blown away by the authenticity of a true Argentinian restaurant. The empanadas are the best in town, and the meat is everything you would expect. Service was great, and staff are friendly. But the atmosphere is so relaxed you want to stay past dessert. Simple and good. Wish I had come here earlier in my 10 years in town!
