The fountains of Bellagio is a great place to relax and enjoy people watching.. The fountain show runs about every 30 min before 8:00pm and every 15 min after 8:00pm. I usually come here to clear my mind while watching all 8-12 different versions of the show. This is a great place to bring your friend from out of town, because in between the shows you guys can catch up and talk the night away making the breaks in between fast. I also love people watching around this area.. You would see the most bizzare things the strip has to offer. From Elvis impersonators, cast of toy story, to alot of drunk tourist, you will be entertained! In fact if you are a sociology major you may be able to write your thesis on the things that go on in front of the Bellagio Fountain! haha! Overall this is one of my favorite free shows on the Las Vegas strip. they say the best things in life are free, this is definitely one of them!
