This attractive, industrial-style restaurant had a wide variety of interesting poutines. We went for the steak-au-poivre and Szechuan style -- both came out quickly and were delicious!

This is a great place to sneak away from the stadium or gardens for a quick snack; we'd definitely come back again.
