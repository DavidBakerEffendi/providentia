There is a good reason why Zagat choose this place as best restaurant in Vegas, as well as earning best of Vegas awards from various establishments.

Gaetano is a full blooded Sicilian who take personal pride and works at the his restaurant of 9 years.  Nice guy with a thick Italian accent who sell any item on the menu to you. 

It beats over hyped Iron Chef Batali 2 restaurants in the Venetian hands down, and in addition been to Italy several times and know the real deal ...
Not to mention some of my favorites in NYC, SF, and LA.

Kids and I had their hand made pappardelle pasta with Fillet Mignon tips.
Both just melts in your mouth.. so tender, first time I thought gumming food 
was pleasurable.

Lobster Zuppe De Pesce (omg) over Linguini... the BEST ever.
I've had many others and nothing like this!

Clearly it doesn't get any more authentic or better than Gaetano's.
This is going to be my favorite Italian when I am in town.
