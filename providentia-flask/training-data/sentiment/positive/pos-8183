What a DELIGHT! I wanted something sweet so I pulled up my go to application for restaurants, Yelp! This little hidden gem popped up first. I'll make what could be a long review about how much I LOVED this restaurant short. It was clean, the owner( I assume she was anyhow) was SUPER friendly, the options were plentiful and the food was SO GOOD! I ordered a waffle with vanilla icecream, strawberries, Nutella, chocolate and caramel. The waffle was hot and fluffy, the strawberries were fresh and the icecream was just sweet enough. I'm happy to add this restaurant to my list of favs! :)
