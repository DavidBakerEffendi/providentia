I was lured into Beer Bistro by the promise of great fries.  My partner is a Fry Monster (think a cuter, less blue, more-human-y Cookie Monster).

It did not disappoint.

Seriously, I'm sure the rest of the food we had there was great, but all I can remember are the fries.  The first time we went, there was a miscommunication between the waitstaff and the kitchen and our fry order got missed, but they handled it beautifully, getting the giant cone out to us in record time and then comping them for the inconvenience.

They are sooooo good.  The fries (technically Belgian Frites on the menu) by themselves are incredible, but with the homemade mayo and ketchup are to-die-for.

I think a lot of people attribute the incredible flavour to the duck fat, but it's not the whole story (other places with "duck fat fries" come close but don't match the unctiousness of these beauties), it's that they blanch them using BOTH duck fat AND beef fat - a double punch of savoury richness.  This is now what I do at home with our potatoes, and it really is an unbeatable flavour profile.

Come here, order whatever you like (there's big emphasis on beer selection and proper pairing).  Just don't let anything get in the way of your Fry Experience.
