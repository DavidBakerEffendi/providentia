I was visiting my best friend in Vegas and met her for lunch here. I let her do the ordering because she obviously knew what was up (she comes here like once a week!). Honestly, I had low expectations because it's totally unassuming, but OMG their pad thai is sooooooooooooooooooooo so so so so good! Saucy and flavorful and so damn fire, I loved it!!! Might even be better than the pad thai at my favorite spot in Thai Town, LA! I also really enjoyed their tom kah. Would highly recommend Pan Asian for anyone in Vegas craving bomb Thai food.
