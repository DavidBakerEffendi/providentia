We had a lovely evening at swirl this past Saturday.  Our waiter was Ryan (I think) and he was super friendly and attentive in the right way, not overbearing but there when we needed him.  There were choices of wine in all price ranges which I liked.  We selected a cheaper bottle and we both enjoyed it, it didn't seem like a super cheap bottle marked up just because they can.  We had the meat and cheese tray - the only complaint was that the runner didn't tell us anything about our selection.  I like to know where we're eating, but we were hungry enough that we dug in and enjoyed everything.  We split a pizzette and requested a bowl of just the pulled pork since we had enough carbs already and Ryan came through and got us a mason jar full!  It wasn't crowded and very comfortable and we throughly enjoyed our night out.
