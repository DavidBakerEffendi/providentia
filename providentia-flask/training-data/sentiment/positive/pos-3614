Came here for the first time yesterday. 

Got take out: chicken tikka masala & paneer masala. Both came w rice & naan. Both dishes were super flavorful, and spicy. You can tell this is HOMEMADE food not prepackaged. Very delicious & portion size was perfect. 

I also got a scoop of the mango fig ice cream. It was a perfect blend. I feel like the fog really mellowed out the mango so together it was refreshing, sweet, but not overpowering. 

The guy who helped us was very friendly, helpful, professional, and patient. 

Had leftovers next day along w ice cream I didn't finish. Perfect snack w the ice cream as a little dessert to cool off the spice! Sooo good. 

Will definitely be coming back to try other options
