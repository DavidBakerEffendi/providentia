Holy cow why haven't I come here more often!!!! 
It's been years since I sat down in this place. Today they killed it with the chicken cheese steak hoagie. As good as Philly or jersey. I was shocked!
Shredded chicken with American cheese on a really good roll with lettuce and tomato (hold the onions) 
I mean sounds pretty simple right? Well people screw it up allllll the time (especially in the south) 
Not here! I'll be back in a few days for another one!  Goodness gracious it was soo yummy. 

The service was good. There are tvs everywhere, they have A LOT of beer on tap, a big menu to accommodate your whole crew(even the picky ones), a patio and its conveniently located right on park road at the corner of Montford. 

I also like that they are open In between lunch and dinner, as often as I'd love to eat at 12, work or life pulls you in other directions so this is good place to come.... I mean today we had lunch at 4 lol and they accommodated and had a nice little crowd in there catching up on Indy and Coca Cola 600 news! Ya know what?
I might just become a regular 
This place is great!
