I had my first meal there which consist of spring roll and a bowl of pho. The quality of the food is amazing. it was probably the best Vietnamese food I had in Brossard and I am extremely picky on Vietnamese food. I will recommend it to anyone to eat there at least once because the food is worth your money. I will come back soon!
