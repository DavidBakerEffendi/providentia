We got winners, we got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got yuppies, we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars
But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just trollin' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge, come as you are -Toby Keith Lyrics


I'm in love with this place. This was my 1st time and I can not wait to come back and try the steak entree. 

I ordered the meatloaf and was more than over joyed with the abundance of flavor and how tender and fresh the entire meal was! It came with your choice of one side, fresh vegies, corn bread, and rolls :) 
They offerer a lighter side menu, which includes a turkey burger that looked to die for,  and came with the most amazing french fries!!! 

The service was the sad part of this experience, the waiter was neglecting our table to say the least. He had a few larger parties he was dealing with at the same time and focused on them a lot. I will not knock a star down because of this one waiter in there restaurant because the rest of the waiters looked on point and were nothing but friendly. 
There is a large bar area, and some room for dancing, large screen tvs for country music videos and plenty of pictures of Toby Keith :) There is also a gift shop located right next door that has a bunch of cleaver take home gifts and reasonable prices. 
What are you waiting for all you country fans, and food junkies..go go go!
