In Vegas for the weekend to attend a wedding. We've had enough of buffets and pastas, so it's time to go Asian. 

Found the Fish N Bowl on yelp and gave it a try. To keep this review simple, the food, service, taste, variety, and prices are worth the 5 stars. 

Service was top notch. Very polite and friendly staff. Glasses consistently refilled. Dishes came out in a timely manner. They were also willing to accommodate our orders. 

From Poke to Udon, sushi, sashimi, and bacon tempura, Fish N Bowl has something unique and delicious you must try. 

This place is not a big restaurant, but a nice quaint little cafe.
