I get cravings for their curry chicken salad! Its the perfect balance of curry chicken, rice, salad and fried pita chips. I usually like to try different foods at different restaurants, but this is one of those places where I have a favorite and I get it each time. I haven't tried too many other foods here, but I do like their differnet hummus and salads. Service is consistent and its a kid-friendly spot which is a plus for us.
