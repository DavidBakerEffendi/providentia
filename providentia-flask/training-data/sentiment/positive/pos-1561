Love this place! Having eaten at many of the sushi burrito joints around town, this one is my favorite. The service is always on par and the fish always tastes fresh (and they give you a very good amount of it). Also, when I have ordered online to go , my order has always come out accurate which is what put it above my other well-liked sushi burrito place.  Not sure why it's never busy when I go, but I like not having to wait !
