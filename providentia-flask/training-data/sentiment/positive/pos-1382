This is my favourite Indian food place in the city. And even better they deliver on Just Eat. We normally order the samosas which are crispy, flavourful and come w a great sauce. The butter chicken with rice (standard I know) which we get medium and it's pretty spicy! And the mild roti korma curry which has tofu, green peas, potatoes and cauliflower. So so so good. And makes for great leftovers! Pro tip: order a few extra garlic naan to soak up the sauce
