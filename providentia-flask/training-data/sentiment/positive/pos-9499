Decisions, decisions! When you get here, choosing which flavor you want will probably be the hardest decision you'll make for the day. 

When AOF became the new hot spot for dessert, I was really hesitant. I was never a big fan of gelato. I was always an ice cream person. I never liked the consistency nor did I like the taste. Everyone kept telling me that I had to go, but I was still apprehensive. One day after the CMYE at Gold Spike, Cathy suggested that we go. I thought it was a perfect time to try it out, especially since it was down the street. 
 
Desyree is so warm and welcoming. Every time you come in, she gives you samples of the flavors of the day. Even if it's your 1st or 10th time visiting, she will still let you sample as many as you like. I tried it, and now I'm hooked. It's not what I expected at all. The consistency is like a cross between gelato and ice cream. I don't know a better way to explain it, but that's the best I can do. It's light and airy, but still has that richness of ice cream. It's made fresh everyday. And the flavors are so unique and amazing. She uses ingredients that you would never think of to use in gelato, like red bell peppers, rosemary & olive oil, and pear & gorganzola. She also has traditional flavors like chocolate and strawberry. Every day there is a different flavor of the day. My favorite so far has been pistachio and chocolate chili, TOGETHER! Omg so freaking good. 

You can definitely see the pride that Desyree puts into her gelato. I support small business owners and this will definitely be one of my top dessert spots! So if you haven't gone, then I suggest you go!!!!!
