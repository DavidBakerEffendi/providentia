Well holy crap. I just visited this place the other day and a lot has changed. I came back here to check reviews and found out that I was the first to review this place back in 2007. How about that? 

Well, I'm glad to see I posted a solid rating back then and left room for improvement because let me tell you - they improved it... lots.

This is one of the most beautiful and unique places in the Valley. The current owners have clearly sunk a lot of money into the place to restore it to better than it's former glory. It's absolutely stunning inside. I walked around it during the day and I was awestruck. It's such a gorgeous spot with so much character. 

Perhaps the best part about all of this is that the roof opens up again! It was forbidden for about a decade, but no longer. 

They broke ground recently next door on what will end up being a swanky multi-story ultra lounge, and next to that they opened a new pizza joint - K.I.S.S. I'm anxious to give them a try.
