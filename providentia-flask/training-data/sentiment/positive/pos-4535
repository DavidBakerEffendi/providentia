I love that this place reminds me of so many hole in the wall spots from home (totally a compliment I swear!). It's hard to find if you don't know where to look, which adds to its appeal. There a ton of vegetarian options, which can sometimes be hard to find around town. I had trouble deciding on exactly what to eat and will have to go back again and again to try everything I want. Make sure to sign up for their birthday list so you get a free entree every year. BTW - the flourless chocolate cake is mouth watering!
