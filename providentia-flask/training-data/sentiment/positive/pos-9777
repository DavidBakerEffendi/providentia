This place is a great spot if you love Korean cuisine, it has great food and a large option of the traditional Korean side dishes. The service is great friendly staff always attentive and friendly. I found it on yelp and have always enjoyed Korean food so figured I'd give it a try, it was worth it! Great prices to!
