I took my husband here for his birthday. He has been wanting to try this place since he is a fan of Rick Moonen. We went on a Sunday night, fairly early and it wasn't very crowded. We chose the downstairs section. The area was nice, it opened up to the mall area of the Mandalay shops but it was a quiet section.

The waiter was very fast and gave us a lot of information on the food and drink options. We ordered a bottle of wine, there was a huge selection with many price options. For an appetizer we had the soup of the day, an amazing butternut squash with smoked salmon plus we chose the chard octopus. They split the order of soup for us which was nice. The octopus was cooked perfectly. So tender. 

For the main course I had the Baramundi and my husband had the ginger crusted halibut. The sauce on mine was terrific, the fish was nicely cooked with the skin just a bit crispy. We also had a side of brussels sprouts, plenty big enough to split. They were amazing, I was never a fan before but I could have had those as my main dish they were so good.

The manager stopped by and checked on us and we chatted a bit. He later sent out a free dessert for my husbands birthday, a very nice touch.

I really found nothing negative about my experience here, a very nice place, terrific food, great service. The price is a little high but worth it for the quality of food.
