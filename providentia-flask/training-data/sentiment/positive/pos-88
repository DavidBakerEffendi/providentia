I LOVE this place, especially with the new chef. My family is from Italy and I can honestly say the pasta, especially the lasagna and linguini, are delicious.  The management is friendly, fun and professional.  The restaurant is run very well. I love that they now use REAL martini glasses! One minor critique - on the charcuterie board, I wish they could find a substitute for ham.  Eating San Danielle prosciutto along side of ham is like having a filet minion and skirt steak on the same plate. Overall, you can't go wrong with this place.
