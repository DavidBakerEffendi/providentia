Coming home from a LOOONG day at work, the wifey surprised me with a dinner courtesy of Greenland-Bulgogi, an assortment of banchan,  and some kind of egg battered meat patties which all hit the spot. That's one good thing I like about Greenland-You can buy great tasting Korean grub and enjoy it at home...you'll also have leftovers for the next day which we also enjoyed....ALOHA!!!
