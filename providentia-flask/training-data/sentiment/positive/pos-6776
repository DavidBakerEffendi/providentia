So im working all day doing a gorgeous backyard landscape install and my client recommends i swing over to The Coronado for the deep fried cauliflower tacos. She loves them because shes a vegan. I think, okay, I'll go and see what else they have, cuz I'm starvin marvin.

Cool lookin place from the outside. Cool inside. Wait staff are hip, cute, and friendly. I pick up a menu and peruse. Meanwhile the two people ahead of me order the cauliflower. I figure, why not, but I'll probably still be hungry. I'll just get dessert too.

I grab some of the fabulous coffee and boy does it have a mighty kick. 2 cups is all I can handle.

3 cauliflower tacos come out...gorgeously plated. I devour two and have to slow down for the third. Delicious and filling. Bringing the family back for dinner later!
