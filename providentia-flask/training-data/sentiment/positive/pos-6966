My son-in-law Matt hosted a birthday party for my daughter Nadia here last night. 
They discovered this place while visiting Toronto a few months ago. 
Nadia is from Toronto and likes to visit frequently to see family and friends. 
Matt worked here for a few years and likes to touch base with friends he made at that time. Now that they have two children, Nadia likes to introduce my grandchildren to her favourite places she remembers visiting as a child.
The restaurant has a semi-private back room, which although noisy, can handle 20 or more guests allowing some privacy for a party. 
The owner greeted us all at the door. Street parking is available. Washrooms are located at the bottom of some steep stairs on the lower level. A small patio is off to one side of the restaurant allowing those wanting to eat outside a nice place to do it.
We were greeted with platters of cheese, bread, fruit, chutney, shaved meat and popcorn and edamame bowls as starters. The selections were printed on a private birthday menu with my daughter's name on it, which was a nice touch. We were offered the choice of a half chicken or baked halibut dinner. Both were delicious. The appetizer was a wonderful mild curry soup. Staff were very attentive and gracious. Our drinks orders were taken and filled regularly according to our requests. 
It was a wonderful night. I would return in heartbeat for another meal if I lived closer.
