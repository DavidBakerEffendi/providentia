This place is amazing! Just discovered it. The guy who owns the place is super cool and he really likes to bake and it shows. The food is delicious. He has 3 different savory baked bites and some sweet ones as well. The to savory ones that I tried (burrito and green chili pork) were delicious!

I definitely recommend this place. He makes everything fresh, from scratch. It's great to support a local business and this one is legit!
