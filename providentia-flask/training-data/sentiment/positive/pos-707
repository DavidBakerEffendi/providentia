This is my main 'go to' brunch place! As previously, I often do take out, but I have had a chance to dine in.  Nevertheless, it was great! Due to my back injury,  I require high/bar tables and conveniently they have a table at the window with stools. Thanks for being so accessible :) During my dine-in experience, service was great. We were seated right away and ordering was quick as you just select the items you want on a sheet. The food is served fairly quick and food is made fresh and served hot. I always ask for recommendations when they have a new item- the dish is always spot in.. So good!  
Recently,  I tried their Laksa and I would definitely recommend it. Often when I have had Laksa, the broth would be heavy and I would not be able to finish it. The laksa here is flavourful and delicious,  and the dish itself isn't overpowering. 
You can never go wrong with their sandwiches as those are my 'go to'  items when I do takeout. 

Another shout out to the staff as they are super friendly and nice. Thanks Breakfast ING for being to accommodating (to my back problem) as it is quite difficult to find an accessible 'dine in' place to eat at an Asian restaurant.
