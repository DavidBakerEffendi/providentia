This is, hands down, the absolute best sushi place (not counting the fancy shmancy or seaside places). It's a bit hidden because it's located inside a higher end grocery store (that they also own), but once you find it, it's like a hidden gem that you either want to keep for yourself or show off to the whole world. I kid you not, I make the trip down to Montr√©al whenever I can, just to eat here. The owners are such good people, and their great characters show through the carefully prepared dishes, which by the way are also presented in generous proportions.
