In regards to Lane L.'s review, there are a couple misrepresentations. We were here this night and the man that climbed on the bar was extremely out of line. However the staff stopped serving him once he was obviously intoxicated and then removed him from the bar. It is not the staff nor the bars fault this man was acting a'fool.

Overall, this place is absolutely fantastic. My friend finally convinced me to come here after raving about how great it is for ages, and I finally caved. The margaritas are hella spicy and their food is (literally) fuego. Come here and you will not be disappointed.
