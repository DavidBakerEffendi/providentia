Situated outside one of the more expensive, most beautiful casinos in town you will find the Fountains of Bellagio, one of the best free attractions on the Las Vegas Strip. Over 1,000 nozzles make the water dance to music every 15-30 minutes, depending on the day. If you watch from the sidewalk outside, find a spot 5 to 10 minutes before the show starts to ensure you have no one standing in front of you.

The shows are set to a variety of music, my personal favorites are the more Vegas-y classics like Luck Be a Lady by Sinatra and Viva Las Vegas by Elvis. Since there are over 30 different songs that the fountains will dance to, this is one feature that it is worth making repeat visits too!
