My brother, my boyfriend, and I dined here at about 7pm and oddly enough, there was no one else here at the time. 

We were seated quickly and given water and menus. David, the extremely patient and welcoming gentleman waited as we flipped back and forth with our menus, unsure of what to order. (I think David is the owner of this establishment, and if he is, he is doing a great job! He's so nice!!) 

I ordered Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp to share with my boyfriend while my brother orders Basil... rice? Or something like that! We also ordered Calamari and a bowl of rice on the side because initially David told us that the Pad Thai came with rice but then he told us it actually did not, so we ordered rice to sort of absorb all the oils from the noodles. Everything, to me, seemed to be in large portions so it's a good thing I shared my Pad Thai because I still couldn't even finish my half! David gladly boxed the rest of my food up for me.

Overall, the food was great! (Although the Calamari did taste a little plain) Everything was delicious and also presented very nicely. The service was exactly how it should be AND bonus points for not even batting an eyelash at my service dog with me!-- right now, they have cute simple Halloween decorations in their restaurant and the staff in the kitchen seem to be in a very good mood :) the whole experience was so good that you can count on me coming back here!
