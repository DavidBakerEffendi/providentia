This is not fancy place, but they have good comfort food and friendly warm service.

We came here for lunch during the #redfored teachers rallies at the Arizona State Capitol, it was very convenient.

They have basic all Americans food and it was good. I had spinach mushroom omelette generously came with some sort of hash brown and toast and it was under $10, loved it!

This place is kind of cute located in the corner of W. Van Buren St and N. 17th Dr. This neighborhood might be not the safest area, but during the day is pretty safe.

Will definitely comeback next time.
