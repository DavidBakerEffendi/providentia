What a great rustic wine bar. Great place for happy hour, girls night, or date night. They have a huge outdoor patio and also a 2nd story balcony so plenty of seating. Great atmosphere and great location. This place does get very busy so make sure to use Yelp to get your name in the waitlist early! 

They have an awesome special on Monday and Tuesday after 8pm, $20 for a bottle of wine and board of bruschetta. Great wine selection and ton of delicious bruschetta options. Great to share! 

My favorites of bruschetta are:
- BRIE & APPLES WITH FIG
- BURRATA, BACON, ARUGULA & TOMATO
- RICOTTA WITH DATES & PISTACHIOS
- ROASTED PEPPERS WITH GOAT CHEESE

Tip: the only bruschetta I would say that I would not recommend is the plain Jane: mozzarella tomato basil. Honestly it's a little dry and boring. Be adventures, try something new! It's way worth it. If you like that classic flavor then try the burrata bacon. It's similar but with butt loads of flavor. Ya..... your welcome! (: 

If you are looking for a great sweet white wine, the "PERFEKT" Riesling was delicious. Looking forward to coming back with some friends. Great service and excellent food and drink.
