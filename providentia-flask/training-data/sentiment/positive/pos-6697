Had dinner here tonight. Buy one free one free to redeem loyal points of Vegas game from Facebook.  It is so easy to redeem, you just stop by M-Life counter and they will input the coupon into your M-life card.  You need to show your ID and code redeem.  The food is good and no complain,  there are a lot choice....sushi, seafood (crab legs, salmons, shrimp....), desert, meat....Definitely I will go here again if I am in Las Vegas.
