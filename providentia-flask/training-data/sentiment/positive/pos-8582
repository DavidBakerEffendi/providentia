I have been conning here for ten years. He's old and loveable gentleman from Japan. His bento boxes are great to go. His yakitori is known to cause drooling. His ginger salad is light and yet robust. His food is classical Japanese you cannot find anywhere else. No gimmicks, no bull rolls. He serves cold noodle dishes in the summer which is fine cusine a lot of Arizonaians have never tried. I recommend his udon, dipped in the perfection, with sprinkles of seaweed and scallions. His green tea is actually matcha which is ceromony grade Japanese tea. For the last ten years he has brought us a quality from Japan no one else can compare. He is even the featured culinary contributor to the Masturi (spring festival). If you haven't tried his food you are wrong. Buddhist and Vegan friendly dishes have kept me coming back for more. I have never been disappointed by his dishes. He takes pride in his work and it shows. 

Also try his octopus balls.
