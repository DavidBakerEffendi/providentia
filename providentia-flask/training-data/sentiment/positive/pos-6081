I'm so happy to have a Five Guys near us now. This is located in the plaza near Target, Jimmy John's, and the old Costco (now becoming a Winco). It is a classic Five Guys setup with peanut bags and all.

When we went, it was crowded but service was efficient. We sat in the back and enjoyed the music and watching people use the fancy new Coke machines. The burgers and fries were delicious and we enjoyed it very much.
