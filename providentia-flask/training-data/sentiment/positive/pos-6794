So we found this place by mistake.  We were looking for another friend that works at a bar.  So while I went to the lady's room my husband was asking about our friend and the beer's.  Well she dosn't work here but we have some beer for ya!  So by the time I got out of the ladies room my husband already picked out a beer I would like......OMG  This beer was soooooo freaking good!  Don't ask me the name of it.  Then the bartender gave us a couple of other samples, and OMG  3 beers that taste so amazing!  We will be back, and we will bring our beer drinking friends.  And the food menu looks good to!  I can't wait to come back, B-fast or lunch you will see us again!
