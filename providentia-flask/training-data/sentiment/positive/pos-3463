My friends and I made it to U.S. Egg yesterday for brunch.  This place was absolutely bustling!

Luckily, our wait was great -- only 10 minutes.  This gave us time to go over the sizable menu.

I had the Sonora Breakfast burrito.  It was SO freakin' good!  Lots of chorizo -- which was surprising, because that seems to be the first thing they skimp on.  It also had peppers, eggs, and several other very yummy things.  It came with potatoes that were really good too.

My friends got one of the veggie frittatas, and thought it was fabulous.

Our waitress was sweet, chatty, and very helpful.  

The only thing that wasn't great was the coffee -- it was just OK.

This is one of those places that should become a weekend routine!
