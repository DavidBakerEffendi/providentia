We have heard a lot about this place and were finally able to go.. Service was friendly and fast and food was good. We got the jambolaya and the fish and chips which were both really good. The best part of our meal was the dessert.. We got the salted carmel pudding and it was sooo good! We would go back just for that dessert! Everything tasted nice and fresh it was excellent.
