Anthony my server made this first timer feel welcome and appreciated as a customer.
Today's visit was just for coffee and a cinnamon roll. BTW this maple glazed cinnamon roll with bacon crumbles is a whole new level of awesomeness. I'm a cookie fanatic and am happy to report that my free cookie with CHECK-IN was delish.

I'll be back soon for breakfast, especially after Jennifer the shift manager is going to the tables making sure the customers are happy. Great service trumps much for this YELPER.

I like this place. The decor made me think somebody loved collecting random chairs and opened a cafe so they could display them. Goldilocks would have a field day. This place is cozy but also urban hip with a dash of industrial. Chatty crowd here for a Friday near mid-day, gives a good vibe.
For the neighborhood this little shopping center (40 Palms) is very nice. I've reviewed three great eats in here already.

They have full breakfast and lunch menus in addition to the off beat bakery selections.
