We found this on a whim while exploring off the strip one day, and it's some of the best poke I've had. Now, every time we visit Vegas, we stop here. It's not too far of a jaunt off the freeway, and it's well worth it. 

My favorites are the spicy avocado and the spicy ahi, but we've tried quite a few, and they all win.

Next time, we are going to bring a cooler to take some back to CA with us! Haha.
