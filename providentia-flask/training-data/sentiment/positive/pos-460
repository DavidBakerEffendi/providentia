So after leaving my last review, the owner reached out to me and he genuinely cared about what I had said. We just finished giving them another chance and it reminded us of the first time we went, amazing. The food tasted great and their customer service was so friendly and nice. 
After giving them another shot, we were very very happy and now we will be back again and that's why I'm updating my review from the last time because I wanted so badly to like them and I love them!
I'm glad we were given the chance to give this place another chance, the owner is amazing and so are all of the workers.
