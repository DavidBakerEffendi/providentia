Sushi! Sake! Ramen! Yum!

A friend brought be here after we worked a booth at the Small Business Saturday together for her new Business (Pet Wants). What a cute little place. The interior has a tiny dining room with long community bars that people can sit at, just like the ones in Japanese Ramen bars. The patio outside is awesome, even when it's cold (they have heat lamps out there). It has a great view of the city at night and the little train goes right by. 

They have a great Sake selection. We asked for a recommendation and we had one that had hints of lavender, nice and dry - just sweet enough. The crispy rice squares are killer, the pork steam buns are amazing and the tuna nigiri = OMG! 

We shared some ramen as well and it was the best. I've had ramen in a house in Japan and this was just as good, really quite nice.

They also do soft serve with cool flavors - like Green Tea and Honey. Totes yummy!

A little gem of a place! I will be back!
