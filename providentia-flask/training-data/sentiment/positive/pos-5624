Ordered the provolone hoagie and bacon cheese fries. They were piping hot when they came and were delicious. Fazio's has some awesome Italian dressing for their subs. I ordered my food for delivery and it was there in 30 minutes as most places can take over an hour sometimes. I have lived in this area for 3 years and regret not trying Fazio's sooner! I will definitely be a repeat customer.
