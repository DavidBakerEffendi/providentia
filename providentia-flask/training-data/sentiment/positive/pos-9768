Love this place! My friend and I have made this our Sunday meet up spot for beer and wine. Jason is almost always our bartender and is absolutely amazing. He remembers what we like and has suggestions whenever we come in, knowing what we've tried before and what new things we'd like. I guess we come too often! He's friendly, knowledgeable, and always makes our visit a good time. Wonderful, ever-changing selection of wines and beers and great happy hour specials. Check it out!
