THIS IS OUR FAVORITE PLACE FOR BOAT NOODLE!!!! yes.. this phrase has to be in caps! We are very close and I honestly felt like I was missing out all these years of being in Vegas!  We haven't tried everything on the menu but the Boat Noodle and the Grilled Squid Salad is now my 2 favorite items so far!! the broth is always HOT (very important) and the kick of the Spices is just perfect!! and who doesn't like grilled squid?? Most importantly, Chef David is just always pleasant to be around with!  you'll see us there on Tuesdays at least once a month!!
