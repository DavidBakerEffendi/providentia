First (and foremost):  sublime pizza.   Crust outstanding.  Toppings innovative, nicely proportioned, and the blends of flavors that result are truly inspired.

The Forestiere was genius: the cr√®me fraiche took on the flavors of the mushrooms, herb, onion, and bacon lardons and was a smooth, subtle masterpiece.  So delicate, but such perfect, satisfying flavor.

The Forza seems like a familiar tomato/pepperoni/cheese at first bite, but then the accents come through - - and the peppery heat comes on.  I thought the ricotta was the only miss (too plain and dominant), but still a great slice.

The Fig & Bacon was, well, interesting (though our least fave).  You get a burst of sweet from the fig, you get a punch of blue from the gorgonzola - - it's like a prize fight of flavors more than a blend, and the bacon almost gets lost!

But what a treat up and down, and the recommended Barbera di Asti,  though pricey, was fab.

Speaking of pricey,  the real curious thing about the Salvatores on E. Johnson in Madison (not complaining - - it's just curious),  is the contrast between some serious price aspects (completely worth it - - monstrously good pizza & wine) and the spartan "dining room".  When we got there at 530pm (given, it was close to zero outside) the place was a cold - - and the tables are just plain spartan.  Once the room filled up (and the food came) it seemed warmer (and when the tables are covered in pizzas, it seems less spartan!)  but the odd coat and even hat was still evident.  You might not want to go to Salvatores for the atmosphere and decor, but that is not why you go there.   The specials all sounded spectacular too, but we went with the regular menu.  I'm going back real soon to try the Pizza Carbonara.
