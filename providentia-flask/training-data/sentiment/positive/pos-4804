I'm always on the search for a good coffee shop to enjoy the atmosphere, coffee and some WiFi to get some work done.   Bunna meets them all!  Their delicious Fair Trade coffee and friendly baristas made it an enjoyable experience and I'll definitely be back now that they are open later, I'll have to try their Toddy that folks are talking about.  Now I'll have to make more excuses to visit my client in that area.
