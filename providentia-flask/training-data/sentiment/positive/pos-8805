What can I say. I'm an east coast Italian/Irish guy! This place is great! And I've gotta say I've got a man crush on Chris. Such a brilliant and really just a nice guy.

I've had all the pizza's there and admit to loving the Rosa, the wise guy, but obviously the margherita. 

The pappardelle bolognese? YUM!
There was a gnocchi dish he had some time back, YUM!

Great place, ambiance is warm and somewhat rustic, service is great and the food is fantastic. I love that he doesn't try and OVERDO it. Simple is very satisfying!
