The manager runs the kind of establishment you wanna patron, seriously. It's a nice neighborhood staple that I really wish I had found earlier. They have great food specials, daily drink specials, and a plentiful array of food options. The pool table, bar area and HH 3-7pm and 10-2am make this the ideal after-work or late-night spot.
