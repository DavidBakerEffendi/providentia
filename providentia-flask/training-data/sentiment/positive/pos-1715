I don't know what night any of the other reviewers went, but holy fuck, did we have a good time here.

Im used to the one in Boston and this place did not disappoint. There was yelling and singing and dancing and consumption of alcohol on a preposterous level. The best part is, just when I think Im getting kicked out, the manager hands me a card and says to give him a call the next time we come back..

Cheap eats, decent booze pricing and a joint that encourages insanity. Im sold and Im always coming back.

Long live TACO.
