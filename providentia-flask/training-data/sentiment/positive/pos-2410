I gave it 5 Stars because this place is soooo fun!!! The food is just whatever nothing too great, muuust try the fried catfish it's pretty good. =)

So anyways, me and a my girlfriends went to this place for lunch/dinner and I was expecting something totally different, but it was so much fun. I guess there was a birthday the night we went and the security guy/MC was going to give the lucky birthday boy a lap dance. It was THE funniest thing in the WORLD! All I can say is SUPERMANNNNN! =) 

Well anyways, you get these paper hats and they write really evil things on it...I was sad....

The girl sitting next to me had a hat that said "Herpes Infested Slut" and an arrow pointing at me...Then I get my hat and all my friends' mouths drop. I ask them what it says and this is what they read "My Meat Curtain is like a stinky pinata waiting to get beat" I was offended, because all my friends had something stupid like, "some girls spit, some girls, swallow, I gargle"...i would totally wear that rather then what I had to wear...jeeeez, so I was a herpes infested slut who had stinky pinata like meat curtains that was waiting to get beat. 

hahahhahaha. Our waiter was cool and not that rude =)

We had a LOT of fun!! I would totally recommend this place to anyone who's visiting Vegas and wanting to eat at fun place with their friends. 

BTW, it's located inside Excalibur.
