Came in here late on a weekend- so glad we did! The macaroons are amazing, probably the best I've had. They weren't dry at all like other places, and the filling was just enough to really bring the flavor around. I tried the chocolate, raspberry, vanilla, and salted caramel. Honestly, I loved every flavor! I am definitely going to make this my go-to treat spot!
