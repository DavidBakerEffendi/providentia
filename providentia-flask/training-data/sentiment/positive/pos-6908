This place is incredible. As everyone has stated, the food is just delicious and fresh as can be. I don't know how they are making money since the sandwiches don't cost very much AND they donate a sandwich for every one sold. This place is just unreal.

The atmosphere is really cool, all kinds of restored old train and farming parts, really cool light fixtures and all the employees are super helpful in explaining the menu, keeping the place really clean and also just being friendly in general.

The entire business model is super charitable, but I just can't get over how ridiculously good the food is. For 6-8 bucks you get a giant breakfast sandwich, or a full size prime rib dip or incredible stuffed French toast. 

This place can't be beat, I hope they open even more locations!
