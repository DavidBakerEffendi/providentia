AMAZING. 

As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to find somehwere with veggie hotdogs. And the toppings! Oh goodness, there are so many that your head will spin. That's the only bad part, it's hard to decide what to get!  The food is great though so you can't go wrong.  

Solid beer selection and live music some nights, which is very fun. A must see in Cleveland. I recommend it to all of my friends.
