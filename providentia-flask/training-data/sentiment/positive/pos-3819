This is my favorite local sit-down mexican restaurant. I wish it was closer to my side of town. The new location is on W. Flamingo/i-215.  The  waiters are the best - always very friendly & attentive. The food is soooo good, very fresh & authentic. Everything I've tried has been wonderful, my favs. are enchiladas, beans & the breakfast plates. I always bring family/friends from out of town here & they all ask to come back when they visit.
