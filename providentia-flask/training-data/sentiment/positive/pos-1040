Whenever someone needs a suggestion in Downtown Las Vegas, the first spot that comes to mind is Gold Spike. This fusion of an adult playground, bar, lounge  and restaurant caters to all (21+) and has a little something for everyone. Love that this place doesn't have cover, has great craft beer selections, and always plays great music. The lounge part is super spacious and has tons of seating or dancing room depending on what you and the squad are feeling up to. On the inside there's pool tables, life size connect four, and a couple of other arcade games. However, the best part about this place is the outside. Out back, there's a massive backyard type of set-up with even more lounging, life size beer pong, corn hole, tether ball courts, life size Jenga, life size chess, and a stage for live music. When I recently went there they had also just added a late night food spot to satisfy your drunchies. Overall, if you are looking for a unique spot to grab a drink, dance, play games and eat then definitely go to Gold Spike.
