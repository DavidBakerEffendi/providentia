We have a 1/2 off marathon special. For $32 for 2 people this was the best value (marthon special rate) and great food. Everything fresh unlike the bellegio experience. Free beer. Great service. 

They also have some tv's although small to watch football. 

Third time here although we're staying at bellegio but each visit had been better than the last.
