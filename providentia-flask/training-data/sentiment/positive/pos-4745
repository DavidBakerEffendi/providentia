Very good quality Thai food on the south side of town. Having been to a few places in the valley, this is quite a good one. Service is excellent, restaurant is clean and the food is great. We ordered the Pad Thai and the the Drunken beef noodles. The beef noodles were absolutely delicious, top notch really. I was not swept away by the Pad Thai though. Despite it being really good, it's not my favorite version. It seems to me that there are two versions of the Pad Thai sauce, one sweeter than the other. This happened to be the sweeter one which I'm not a big fan of. The food is quite spicy so be careful what spice level you order. I ordered my Pad Thai mild and it was slightly on the hotter side for me. I happen to like spicy food but honestly, my tolerance has gone down recently so you be the judge. Portion size is pretty good. You don't have to ask for your cold water, it'll come to you in a nice jug with glasses and it doesn't taste like tap water! Overall the food is great therefore we will be going there again any time we make it to Chandler!
