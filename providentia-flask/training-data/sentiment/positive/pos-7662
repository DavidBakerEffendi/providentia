My friend ordered to go and as usual, I was not disappointed. There are alot of kabab places in montreal but Chateau Kabab is amongst the top ones. Their Guy location is extremely convenient and the one is west island has a nice seating. Yes it is extremely cheap for the portion you get, I don't understand people that complain about the salad when you get it including your meal, any other restaurant would charge it as an entr√©.  It took a while for us to get the food but again when they're super busy, it`s quite understandable. The Kabab is super juicy and the shawarma is great as well. Overall, I recommend it :)
