I've been coming to dine at Konnichiwa for a long time (since I was a kid, for at least ten years now). It has changed slowly over time, but the dining experience has remained true to how it was when I was a youngster. I came here with a friend recently just before they wrapped up lunch service. (They close for a couple hours before reopening for dinner.) I ordered the soba noodle soup with shrimp and vegetable tempura on the side. I've been getting this dish for years and it hasn't changed at all (that's a good thing). So delicious and comforting on a cold winter day. My friend ordered the chirashi. I snuck a piece of squid.. it was delicious and I don't normally even like squid. The highlight of the meal was definitely the sushi we ordered. (two pieces inari, two pieces uni). The inari was great and they were HUUUGE. But the uni.. best uni I've ever had, to be honest. So creamy and sweet, not a hint of bitterness. I wish I could have some right now. If you're on Baldwin, try this place out!
