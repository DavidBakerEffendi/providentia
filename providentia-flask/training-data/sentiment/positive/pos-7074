Do NOT let the outside of this place turn you away!! It is a total hole in the wall, but we found this place because of Yelp!!
Born and raised in AZ, we were visiting family and were craving some good Mexican food and tacos.. We decided to give this place a try, and we are so happy that we did. We went with the daily taco special, and it was fantastic!! Totally hit the spot! The quality of the meat was perfect. We will definitely be back when we come back to the Valley of the Sun.
