We travel back and forth from NJ to Fla. and back, and we're delighted to find this gem. We have been here twice and both times we were very pleased with our food, the service and the atmosphere. The Pho was great, sushi delicious, the manicotti and lunasagna were great also, but the sauce appeared cooked Some advise, don't order a salad because the entrees come with a salad, and they are heavy handed on the sprouts. All in all- it's wonderful!!
