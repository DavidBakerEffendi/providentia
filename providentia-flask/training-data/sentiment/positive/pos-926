I was so glad this location opened up since the one on the strip is a hassle to get to and I can never hunt down the truck. I was also happy to see that business wasn't too slow on the weekday night that we went for dinner. It's the perfect size. The music wasn't too loud either.

Food-wise, these burgers are the most juicy, greasy, delectable splurge that I can possibly get for those times I just want to ruin myself in the best possible way! They are a little expensive, but not so crazy that I could never stop by every now and then. 

The fresh vegetables they have in some of the burgers do make me feel responsible for my health and balance it out though. I found the tamago burger was lovely in its sweetness but just too much protein/grease overall. The karai burger is a favorite if you like spicy and I've had the mushroom and original lucky burger which are both good. I'll try the rest once I get the craving back for a good burger!

Their fries and sauces on the fries, I'm not really crazy for, but it makes a nice complement to the meal overall. 

When my burger was under cooked at my last visit they replaced it for me without any question and apologized. The replacement was cooked perfectly, not overdone or underdone, and hot and juicy! This moves me to give them 5 stars when its all said and done. 

My only suggestion for the place would be to add subtitles/captions to the programs that are run on the televisions. Though I understand it could just simply be a part of the aesthetic decor to have colorful animations playing on the screens.
