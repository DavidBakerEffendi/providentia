I try to make it out to Vegas a couple times a year, and whenever I do, my splurge meal is at N9NE. This time around we came for a bachelor party, and had Robert serving us. Easy ordering, help with the menu when my friends needed it (I literally have dreams about eating here, so I was set.) My only disappointment was that the 3lb lobster thermidor had been taken off menu, a sad fact mitigated by Robert offering to have the twin lobster tails cooked thermidor style instead. Seeing as everyone else was going with steaks, I figured I'd follow suit and got my 22 Oz ribeye, rare (warm, red center), and got it oscar style. First bite almost made me cry. This is how steak should be prepared. Pure perfection. The crab was excellent as well, although this time around was a touch skimpy on the bernaise sauce. This was easily overlooked by the sheer quality of the rest of the meal. As always, the lobster mashed potatoes are a MUST. Giant chunks of lobster amid fluffy, buttery potatoes. Delicious. Friends around the room also loved the gnocchi and lobster Mac and cheese. I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'll eat at N9NE every time I come to Las Vegas. It's the best meal you'll have for a long, long time.
