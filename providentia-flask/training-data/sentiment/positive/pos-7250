Location is a little iffy, but the food and service top the list! 

Any dog you get will be amazing! I had the sloppy joe dog with yellow mustard. And some tater tots with 5 different dipping sauces.  Great selection of beer, wine selection is red or white, not the best, but most people don't go hear for the wine selection.

Great for groups, every 3rd Tuesday of the month is classical music day.
