This is my favorite place in the OCAD foodcourt, and easily the most popular place with long lineup everyday. Food is very cheap for its quality. 

I love the sweet and sour chicken especially. Most dishes tasted like Chinese food, except they also offer cook-to-order Thai specialty food (e.g. pai thai).
