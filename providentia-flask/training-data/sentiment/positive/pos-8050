Brand new spot just opened (next to Sprouts) offering Chicago style chicken and more. If you're like me you've probably been waiting YEARSSSS for an authentic restaurant to open and Fatt Bellyz delivers, Wings, 1/2 chicken, Pizza Puffs, Gyros burgers you name it, is here..but that's not the best part of the place they have *wait for it* 


MILD SAUCE...not ketchup, not bbq sauce, not mumbo sauce..real chi-town style mild sauce.

My order: "LEMME GET 6 WINGS FRIED HARD, SALT, PEPPER AND EXTRA MILD SAUCE ON MY WINGS AND FRIES" this is how it's done back home.

The verdict  omgggg taste just like home, wings fried just right, sauce on point..I seriously had to stop myself from overeating..please keep in mind this isn't your usual Wingstop or ATL wing dings..those 6 wings are 6 FULL 2-section wings.

They close at midnight Mon - Wed and 3am Thurs - Sat....MAKE YOUR WAY TO THIS SPOT.

The owners were so hospitable and treated everyone that walked in like family. I'll definitely be back - hope to see you there.
