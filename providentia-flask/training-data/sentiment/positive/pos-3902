In -n-out is crack in a bun. No not those kinda buns and not that kinda crack. Like the crack I have never smoked really.. The kind all the bad people in tv go out to find..

This place is always busy no matter what time of day. Crack burgers are good business. Number 1(double double) is my go to when I am extra hungry. Number 2(regular cheeseburger) will do the trick though. Always ask for grilled onions and ketchup. They have great shakes too, vanilla, strawberry or chocolate. I'm not too down for the animal style.. Don't judge.. 

I am just so glad they have In-N-Out in NV and i don't have to drive to CA to eat it. I may have just not moved here! It's that good!
