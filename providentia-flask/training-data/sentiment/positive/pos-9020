Brunch on a Saturday or Sunday morning is EXACTLY what I need after a night of hardcore partying. Whether you're there during the summer or the winter, Terrance Pointe's got somethin' for you. It's a special little tucked away treat that you can only get in Vegas. 

First off, the ambiance here is amazing. It's tucked in a less-traveled corner of the Wynn, so it's not your typical eatery. The couches... the couches. So good after you've been in heels for 4+ hours and slept about the same. You can kick off your flip-flops and just relax.

The service is also beyond expected. The staff knows their stuff, they engage with you and make you feel welcome. They also make amazing recommendations. 

The food and drinks are why we keep coming back, though. Americano fan? GET ON IT. Plain ol' drip coffee connoisseur? Also an excellent choice. In the summer, opt for something lighter like the granola-yogurt-fruit plate. They won't serve you melon; they've got berries and mango for you. The French toast plate -- while not the leanest option -- is well worth it, with ham, cheese, hash browns and eggs to boot. We ordered the eggs over medium and they were served exactly over medium. In the winter, you absolutely must do the tomato soup with grilled cheese. MUST. It'll warm your soul and you'll learn the true meaning of that phrase. 

I look forward to visiting Terrance Pointe every time I go to Vegas, hungover or not. I recommend you make it part your routine too.
