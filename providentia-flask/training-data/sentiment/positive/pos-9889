Really yummy fresh chicken. It's probably the most juiciest chicken I've ever tried and the fact that it came from a semi fast food restaurant that serves fresh food. That's awesome. You can taste the difference between this chicken and other fast food places. Gives me kinda of a California Chicken cafe vibe, but with fried chicken lol best way I can describe it. We tried the most basic thing, their chicken nuggets and also their zucchini fries. They were good, wasn't a big fan of their fries. They  were just really floppy and looked kinda dead. 

I still think I might like chick filets nuggets better. But the fact that this place is all fresh everything, including their sauces is pretty amazing. Definitely will try something different next time.
