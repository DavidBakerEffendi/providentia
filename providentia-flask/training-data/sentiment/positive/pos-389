I ordered the Jun's Special with kimchi and cucumber kimchi. I am not sure where to start. All the flavors were familiar to me, but I got hit with one wonderful flavor after another. The grilled beef was delicious, yet it took on a surprisingly new flavor with the kimchi and it became something else, still wonderful, as I added a bite of the salad. 

I am a huge fan of Asian food, but, this was totally different in an unsuspecting way. I experienced an amazing treat! This was like trying out Thai food for the first time. I am coming here again.
