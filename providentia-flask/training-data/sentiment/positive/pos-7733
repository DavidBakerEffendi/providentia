Had dinner here and I must say best and fresh Indian food at such reasonable price in entire North America that we have tried. Ordered Dal Makhani, Paneer Tikka Masala, Onion Kulcha, Naan, tandoori roti( never had this good before and I reordered) to finish with we ordered Gilar Jamuns and this blew us since they were so fresh reminded me of back home India. We asked for the chef and congratulated him for such great food and how much we appreciate his cooking. He was super nice and polite. Highly recommend this place and really hope that they maintain the quality.
