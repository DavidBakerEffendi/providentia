My favorite Korean restaurant in Arizona now.  We were leary to try it because we arrived at 830 on a Wednesday night and the open sign was off and there were no customers at all.

Also, the yelp reviews were mixed but we decided to try it anyway.

The Kalbi was well marinated, it wasn't overly sweet like most restaurants.  All the small Kim chi dishes were the best I've had at a Korean restaurant in Arizona.  I always complain that the Kim chi in AZ restaurants suck.

This is a very authentic Korean restaurant with many dishes I've never seen offered at most Korean places.

With that being said...be careful when ordering some of the more interesting dishes because you may not be used to it.

For example, we got the stir fry octopus which I LOVED! But it is very very chewy...so it's not for everyone.

We also got the cold noodles with skate and squid.  The skate is like a salted raw fish with all the skate cartilage intact.

We LOVED it and will be back!!
