Three years later and I'm still in love.
Is it the best sushi?  No.
But for the price, flippin' awesome.  
I can eat me some salmon nigiri, and at this place, it's completely acceptable quality with an unbeatable price.

We typically call for takeout, like, 2 times per week.
If this place ever closes, I don't know what I'd do.
