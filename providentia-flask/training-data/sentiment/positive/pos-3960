Just tried the catfish and brisket stack in the last 2 days. The catfish had a fantastic Cajun spice and was really tender and a great size portion. This morning I got the half brisket stack. There's a choice between lean and fatty brisket. I'm a fatty meat guy. It was melt in your mouth tender and the hash brown it sits upon was amazing! The sauce and egg were a perfect accoutrement!  Words don't do this dish justice. Try it and you'll be full till dinner too!
