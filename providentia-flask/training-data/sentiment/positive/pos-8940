I had dinner at Beso over the weekend, and it was fantastic! I had family in town, and wanted to try something new. I LOVED it. Our waiter was amazing - he made the experience memorable. I had a steak and it was delicious. The sangria was such a great break from wine, and made for a more reasonable dinner tab, too. 
I look forward to going back.
