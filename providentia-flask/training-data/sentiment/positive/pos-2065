By far one of the greatest but not well known breakfast places in Vegas/Summerlin area! Food is spectacular, prices are fair, and reminds me of New York more than any other place. Excellent bakery too! Totally recommend if In the area! Service is always the best as well, always helpful, and willing to bring out whatever you need! Excellent!
