I do not understand the negative reviews of this place. My husband and I went here last night to celebrate his birthday and it was honestly one of the best meals that we have ever had. Granted, this place has quite a scene starting at around 8 o'clock on a Saturday evening but it ends pretty quickly. If you can get beyond the half-dressed women and their ridiculous male counterparts that only Scottsdale provides I think that you'll find that this place is actually fantastic. We started with cocktails which word delicious-some of the best that we've ever had. For food we started with the Buffalo mozzarella which had a delicious citrus flavor and progressed to the lamb Ragu which is a must try and the butternut squash ravioli which had flavors that were totally unique. While the portion size of the pastas could have been larger our waitress Amanda was attentive and knowledgeable and guided us appropriately through the menu including the wine list which she knew perfectly. She recommended a bottle of nebiolo which was affordable and fantastic! Apparently you can make a reservation and request a waitress-- I would highly recommend requesting Amanda she was honestly wonderful. For our main course we had the half chicken which was totally unique and delicious and the salmon which was cooked perfectly. They generously recognized my husband's birthday by providing us a dessert on the house, a delicious tiramisu that we devoured. Again it was an absolutely fantastic evening. There's nothing that I would change about this place. If you have time to have a relaxed dinner and you're going out for special occasion I would give this place a try. It's very special.
