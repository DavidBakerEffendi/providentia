I love this place! Literally everything is 5 stars: service, ambiance, food! I usually get the chicken bbq bowl with tikka masala and naan. It's the perfect amount of food to make you feel completely satisfied bordering on too full. The perfectly spiced chicken is so tender it's falling-apart. If I'm feeling extra indulgent I get a chocolate truffle, they are seriously amazing. Better than those I've had in actual chocolate shops. I eat here way more than I should admit, it's on my way home from work and goes great with a stop for groceries at Trader Joe's down the road!
