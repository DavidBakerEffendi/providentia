The best sushi restaurant I have ever been to.  They have a wide variety of rolls that go beyond the basic California roll.  My personal favorite is the pink lady.  The sauce served with it is so delicious you will be scraping the plate.  This place is great to take new sushi eaters as their menu come with a picture book.   It's much easier to order based on the picture book then the menu.   Thus is an absolute must sushi place  for all clevelanders.
