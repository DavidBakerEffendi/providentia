It's not ramen... But that's okay.

Despite the misleading name (probably due to some chinglish translation) this place serves one of the most authentic hand pulled chinese noodles outside of Markham. Like most place in the area, seats are cozy and limited, service is quick and efficient, but quality hasn't wavered. The noodles and delicious and have the fresh traditional texture of hand pulled noodles. The broth is authentic, not too obnoxiously strong, and complements the noodles and desired topping. I ordered the bbq pork with my noodles: a fair portion of good quality cuts. 

On a street full of cookie cutter ramen and bbt shops, this restaurant stands above the rest. Would go back again and would even line up for it.
