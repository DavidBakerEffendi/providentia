While struggling on where to eat lunch last weekend we came upon Original Hamburger Works.  Read the reviews here on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  I am sure glad  we gave then a shot.  We walked in to the dinning room which was pretty full (a good hing) and up to where you would make you menu selections. The great thing is you walk right past the grill where you see what is the beginning of your burger.  Awesome to see this right out front.  Kind of a honesty approach to how we build a great burger. So we order a Bacon Chess Burger and California Burger both the largest size burger.  Both burgers were exceptional and the prices were low to what you receive. Extremely affordable. The staff was great and our surprise the location is about 3-4 blocks from where we live. A win win! So if you want a extremely tasty, affordable, very large portion and just a all around awesome burger the hit these guys up. You will not be disappointed.  Just a great little gem on N 15th Ave. Once again you will not be disappointed at all......
