Favorite place after my week in Toronto!  Went here with a huge group of work people late on a Thursday night and we ordered a ton and they smiled and took it on with a great attitude.

Not every place is that welcoming.  We drank liters of beers and ordered meter sticks which was awesome to see.

The food made me think Octoberfest in Decemeber and it was great!

Cool cool locaiton....stay classy now!
