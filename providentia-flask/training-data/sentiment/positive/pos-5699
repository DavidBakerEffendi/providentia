The food is spectacular! My family has been going to Byblo's for at least 16 years. Their family style, quality and service never waivers. I would highly recommend this place! We always start with the Hummus with Meat & Pine Nuts. My son loves the lamb platter. I've tried both the lamb and beef kababs. Both are excellent. If you live in Tempe, you must try this place.
