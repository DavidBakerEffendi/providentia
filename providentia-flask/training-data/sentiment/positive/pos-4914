I love this place.
It is the really only true vegetarian restaurant in the area.

NO booze.

They have tea, water and coffee.

The ambiance is amazing, being in a thrift store and all. 

The food? Freaking delicious. Seriously.

I want to eat here all the time and I would if it wouldn't be so creepy.
