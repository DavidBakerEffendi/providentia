Not a very romantic place to eat at the end of nine day trip visiting my lover, but perhaps for the better since there was little room for sadness or moping. However the food made up for it. Highly creative and perfectly cooked. Especially the whole chicken which was juicy and highly flavorable. The wait staff were passionate about each and every item on the menu. It's no wonder that a friend of mine told me it was his fave restaurant in Cleveland.
