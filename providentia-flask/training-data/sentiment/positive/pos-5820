I have to admit to being very skeptical about trying any place that has their sushi fish sitting out pre-cut in refrigerated bins, but to my pleasure everything tasted very fresh and delicious.  I went with a couple friends for lunch and we each made custom bowls with various fish, seaweed, rice, vegetables and sauces.  It was such a good experience that we all agreed we'd make this a regular lunch spot.  The prices are quite fair and with an unlimited soda dispenser, there was not much more we could ask for.
