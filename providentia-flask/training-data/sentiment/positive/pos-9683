Let's just say that Chili Man IS The Man!  The guy takes the time to make his own ketchup and spicy mustard so that should tell you something right there.  The dogs he serves are seared to perfection on his carts flat top and my goodness, he's not called Chili Man for nothing.  This is some darn good chili he puts on the dogs.  

As others have noted, if he weren't Chili Man, he would be Chatty Man because the dude has never met a stranger and you are guaranteed some lively conversation as he works on your food.  An A+ street food vendor and his work is much appreciated.
