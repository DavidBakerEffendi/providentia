Oh, Sacks, you lovely lady.  Everything I've had from you has been great.  You're a doll early in the morning, letting me feast on a chorizo, avocado and pepper jack all mixed up on egg sammie.  At lunch you tantalize me with your specials, how do you keep coming up with new takes on the same old sandwich?

Is it that your location is on the way to my office?  Is it that your selection of ice teas numbers the amount of fingers on my hand?  Your varying kinds of breads including tomato basil and something-chive?  No, no, no, it is the freakin cookie you put in my bag with every order!  It's like you're my nanny, girlfriend and second home all in one.

If I have a gripe with you it is this, well, I don't know how to say this, but... your coffee sucks.

***Edit: Sacks now has great coffee!***  five stars now.
