When I was a kid, the attraction to see was the Mirage Volcano, but Vegas has evolved and Bellagio has step up to provide extravagantly majestic shows for free. Throughout the year, I like to go watch it from time to time to see the changes, but my favorites will always be Time to Say Goodbye or My Heart will Go On because of the family and friends I see it with. My sister has an unnatural love for Celine Dion. I appreciate and cringe a little because of that.

When the weather is nice, a stroll down Las Vegas Boulevard and witnessing this breathtaking display will always be a must.
