Valentine's Dinner was amazing. Service was awesome. I wish I could have tried the whole menu. The salad was great and I had the onion cannelloni which was amazing. I was so full though that I couldn't finish it. The table next to us had the flounder for two and it looked great. This place is wonderful for a date night.
