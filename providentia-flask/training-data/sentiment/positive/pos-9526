My husband and I were looking for a place to grab a bite after playing volleyball at Gardens Park and found Biaggio's on Yelp.  Having moved here from NYC, we've had all kinds of great pizza and are pretty picky with what we find in Vegas.  We started out with some fantastic garlic knots.  They were perfectly seasoned on a pool of olive oil and also came with some tasty marinara sauce.  Take your pick on which to dip them in!  I did both!  We had a medium-sized (6 slices) "Art of Chicken," which had chicken, artichokes, roasted tomatoes, garlic, and black olives.  Delicious!  The pizza dough tasted great.  I love artichokes and roasted tomatoes and these were as fresh as you can get.  It's great having a slice of pizza with quality ingredients.  We got to speak to the owner while we dined at one of the outside tables and you are immediately aware of the passion he has about his food.  I love to cook so can appreciate that.  Service was really generous and nice, too.  We'll be back next time we're in the neighborhood to explore the other specialty pizzas on the menu.  This place doesn't take pizza for granted.  5 stars for quality ingredients and quality service.
