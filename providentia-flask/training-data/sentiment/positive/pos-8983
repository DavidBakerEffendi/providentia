ART:brgr is hands-down my favorite restaurant in the Plateau. Not only are the burgers monstrous in size, but the tender patties and creative toppings are enough to have you drooling well after your meal. 
For me, however, it's the hummus that takes center-stage. Coming from an Israeli family, I've always been skeptical of any hummus made outside of Israel. The owner makes the hummus himself in small batches and doesn't share the secret recipe with any of his chefs. After years of living off chickpeas, I can confidently say that you don't know good hummus until you've tried ART:brgr (provided you haven't visited the holy land)
The decor is modern and very appropriate for the size and shape of the location. The pool table is an extra touch of class and invites you to come just once more to play a round with the boys. I know I will.
