This place has THE BEST Shrimp Fried Rice....hands down!!!! I absolutely love their food here. It is so good & definitely worth the wait. You can always choose to order ahead if you dont want to wait or even order delivery!! Very delicious & well worth it. Plus their prices are super fair!! You are definitely getting the best meal for your dollar. I recommend this place to everyone.
