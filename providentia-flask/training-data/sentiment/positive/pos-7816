Juan's could be one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to.   This is a family owned business. The food is authentic, prices are cheap, service is great!  A friend of mine suggested that we go there because they did very well with the health department inspections.  What a great treat.   If you did not know it was there, you would never stop in.  Do yourself a favor, stop by if you are in the hood (16th street and Thomas)!  You won't regret it!
