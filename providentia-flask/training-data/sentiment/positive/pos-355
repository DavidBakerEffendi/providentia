This has got to be one of my favorite coffee shops close by work and on my way from early morning classes. You've gotta try their Vanilla Java Smash or their Green Tea Smash. Absolutely delicious, creamy, and not too sweet. Their setting is amazing and it's a quiet place to chit chat or enjoy yourself. The baked goodies look amazing and most are vegan. They've got a great variety for everyone. Try it!
