ORDER ONLINE!!!

Came to Cleveland to watch the baseball game (Toronto vs Cleveland) and decided to grab lunch here on our way out of town. While viewing the menu on their website, we noticed that you can order online and choose what time to pick up! So glad we ordered online. It was packed when we got there (Sunday at noon). We walked in and our take out order was ready for us behind the register. I

We ate in the car and noticed that people would park their cars in the parking lot...walk in...and walk straight out because the line-up was too long.

Reuban Sandwich (with corned beef) 5/5 - Russian sauce was packed on the side. LOADED with corned beef which was very moist and flavourful. The bread was perfectly toasted (panini style) and the cheese was assembled between the sauerkraut and bread so, the bread was still nice and toasty when I ate it!

Corned Beef Sandwich 5/5 - LOADED with corned beef. Similar comment as above.

Potato Salad 4/5 - Tasted like old-fashioned potato salad. Looked like they used egg as well! Was a little too creamy (too much mayo?) for my taste but, it was still great!

Coleslaw 4/5 - Tasted great! Was not watery but similar to the potato salad, had a bit too much mayo for my liking. 

Pickles - not your typical pickles. They were not vinegary/ pickled very long but, I really enjoyed them! They were crunchy and has more of a cucumber-flavour because they were not pickled very long...? The pickles were packed separately (packed in a little sandwich bag with a twist tie) within the takeout container which was great because it prevented the liquid from making the bread soggy.
