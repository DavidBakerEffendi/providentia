This has been by far one of our favorite Indian restaurants. We have been in there so often, the host/server said "welcome back" as we walked in and noted that we hadn't been by in a while.  This is my husband's favorite cuisine and he chose Origin India for his birthday dinner. As always, the food and service was great! We only had one very small issue: my husband and daughter ordered Vindaloo and the waiter told them it was "very spicy". My husband is very familiar with the dish and told him he knew the level of spicy and it was okay. The waiter , Tony, took it upon himself to tell the chef that it should be toned down. He did the same with my Chicken Tikka Masala when I told him I wanted it medium, not mild. As a result we didn't get the same Indian experience that we looked forward to; spicy and delicious. 

To those that think it is high priced have you ever considered that is more than just casual dining? Cloth napkins, change in plates and silverware between courses, etc...this is not casual dining.  It is a treat for us because it is not in our "everyday" price range, but I do think it is reasonably priced for the quality of food and level of service.

We will continue to choose Origin India as our go to for Indian food as well as recommend it to others. My Favorites: Chicken Manchurian (appetizer), Chicken Tikka Masala & Garlic Naan.
