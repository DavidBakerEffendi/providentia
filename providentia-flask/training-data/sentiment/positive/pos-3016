Walked right by this place without even realizing I had missed it!  Walking inside, it looks like it might just be a take out place, but then you realize there are tables in the back.  The kitchen/cash area doesn't look like much.  In fact, I don't know how they manage to cook such great food in such a small area!  A friend and I ordered two different soups, and two different wraps so we could share.  I ordered the butternut squash soup and the curried lamb wrap.  She ordered the flank steak wrap and the corn chowder soup.  Everything was good, but the corn chowder soup was the clear winner, and the curried lamb was really, really good!  The butternut squash soup could have used some extra seasoning, however pairing it with the curried lamb, which was seasoned very well, was a good decision.  I can see why people return here as the food was very very delicious, and made with quality ingredients.
