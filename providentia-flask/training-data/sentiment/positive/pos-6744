We have been here a few times, because of Easton, that used to take really good care of us at his previous job. The first time we stopped by Juan was our server and he was very friendly and accommodating. We have stopped a couple of other times to say hi to Easton. He is great and always takes really good care of us. We will be back. Food has been good too, we like the cheese/spinach dip, and also buffalo chicken salad has been good.
