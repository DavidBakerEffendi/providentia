Went to Sushi Samba last night for dinner with eight people and absolutely loved the restaurant.  The decor was very Peruvian and exotic than your normal Sushi titled restaurant.   One thing is for sure though, the sushi is AMAZING.  Had the El Topo roll and some of the sushi sampler platter.... both the warm El Topo and the cold sampler platter were of the finest grade sushi I've ever tasted.  I would have to saw the overall food quality was everything I expected from the Palazzo.  The plates are more tapas styled with the Lobster tacos and Apps being very tiny in size but gargantuan in flavor.  

I would recommend that if you go with a large appetite to look on the menu for the "large plates" section lol.... the 3-meat and 5-meat for $40 and $60 respectfully will be filling enough for 2 people and not break the bank if your on a budget... don't sleep on the sushi rolls and bring your own Sake and have them cork it.... Sake prices in the restaurant are silly.
