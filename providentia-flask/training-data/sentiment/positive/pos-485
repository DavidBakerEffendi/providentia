The first morning that we attempted to eat here in the Cosmopolitan, the line was so long. Obviously, there is a reason for this: the food is amazing. We went back to second morning and were not disappointed! We waited in line for about 25 minutes, then waited another 10 after we ordered. Though there are few tables at the Eggslut, there are other options for seating around on the hotel. We had an exceptional nice server who took our order. Coffee was kind of expensive for such a small amount, but I didn't want to stand in another extremely long line at Starbuck's. 
There is an Eggslut in LA too.
