This place really hits the spot for me. Authentic handpulled noodles in tasting beef broth with surprisingly high quality sides, wish we had this where I live! You are even get extra noodles for extra $2 to share. The sides we got, a cold chicken dish and fried short ribs, we're both amazing in their own respect. The noodles were exactly what I remembered in China, chewy, meaty soup, with black pepper for a tang. The meat tasted a bit weird though, tastes processed, not sure how to describe it but it was off. Still definitely the spot to go if you are craving lamzhou lamian!
