My husband is a huge bangles/buckeye fan so you can't beat this place. Good food and cheap beer. Ask for Alex as he'll always take care of you at the bar. This place generally has about 7 customers max but as soon as football season starts back up I'm certain that will change!! If you decide to stop by look for the guy sitting at the bar in the Boomer Esiason and tell him his wife sent you. ;-)

Oh and definitely swing by on For Mexican Mondays for $1.50 tacos that are pretty awesome and $3 margaritas!
