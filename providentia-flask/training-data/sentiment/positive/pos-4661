First time trying this place after coming across it on Yelp. Hubby and I got two meals to go, food was delicious. The portions were very generous. The owners were super friendly and made us feel welcome. 
The scallops were tasty and my hubby loved the BBQ short ribs! I will try the lobster next time :):)
Very happy to find this place in Pickering! Would highly recommend.
