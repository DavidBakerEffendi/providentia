Best halal fried chicken ! I love to visit this location when craving some fried chicken. The service is quick and the crunch of the chicken is very consistent. The fries are tasty and also have a nice crisp to them. The seatings are very limited but dont let it a turn off, take the food to go and sit by the benches in front of concordia (right in front of the A&W and tim hortons , coner Guy and Maisoneuve) 

If poulet bronze is too far and you are craving fried chicken check out Basha Fried Chicken in Montreal Est.

Cheers n enjoy the comfort food
