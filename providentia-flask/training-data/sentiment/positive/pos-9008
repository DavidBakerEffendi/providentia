Absolutely love this spot. I feel like like it's still a hidden gem. The ice cream sandwiches are impressive. The milk shakes are epic. I am on a mission to est my way through the entire menu. Service is always great as well. If you have not been in there, please take some time to go and check out what they have to offer. You won't be disappointed.
