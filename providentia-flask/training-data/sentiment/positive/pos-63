The wife and I were at the Wynn for the weekend, and had an early start on Saturday.  We wanted a small, quick bite to eat....and being a Vegas veteran, I was pretty sure we were looking at $60+ if we stayed in the resort.  In making a move to go across the street, we stumbled on the Terrance Pointe Cafe, inside the Wynn.  We checked out the menu, and I was floored at the reasonable pricing...

The wife and I both ordered eggs and bacon...$8 for the breakfast!  The eggs were excellent, the bacon was cooked the way we liked it - the coffee kept coming, and they even had Cholula's...wow!

Gotta give them a thumbs up.  Great food, great service, and unbelievable pricing (for a Vegas resort).
