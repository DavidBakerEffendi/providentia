The Sushi here is prolly the best in Scarbro/Markham area. 

The size of the rolls are generally pretty good. it taste fresh and healthy! They have lots of sushi options. The restaurant is quite new..its LARGE. Probably one of the largest sushi places I have seen lol its nicely decorated and they have booths, group seatings, double and singles. Take out is kindof slow tho, so instead of trying to get the sushi to go...might aswell stay there and eat. The dining service is quicker lol
