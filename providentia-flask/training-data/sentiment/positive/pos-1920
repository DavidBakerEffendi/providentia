Sloppy Joe's serve the biggest and best wings of anywhere in Toronto that I have eaten.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are wing night60 cent wings, 3pm to midnight.  Minimum 10 each order and you can order in increments of 5 after that.  They are amazing either with sauce on them or sauce on the side.  They also have a really great Greek salad, the owner told us the dressing they use is his Grandmothers recipe.  They don't have a veggie plate on the menu, but will make you up one to go with your wings if you ask.  They just recently updated the interior, it's now much nicer, lots of large screens.  They do have a patio but it's quite small and filled with smokers.
