I just had my 38th birthday dinner here in the middle of January. I had 30 guests, and hands down was the best experience ever. It's hard accommodating a large group in general, especially when there's separate checks (which they are so accommodating about, btw). Usually service can slack a bit, etc. Not here! When I called to inquire originally, every single person I talked yo was knowledgeable, super nice and made me feel like whatever I needed, they would make happen. The management is fantastic and that also explains why their servers were so great as well. Starts from the top! Especially Kristen, the manager, just fantastic and super excited. On to the servers... we had a few whom were 100% on the ball at all times with smiles on their faces. Such a wonderful experience for regular small party dining and for large parties as well! I would highly recommend Lazy Dog for parties! Their food is wonderful as well with beautiful presentation. We were sitting by a nice warm, large fireplace as well, so the ambiance was perfect. Thank you to everyone!! Again, amazing experience!
