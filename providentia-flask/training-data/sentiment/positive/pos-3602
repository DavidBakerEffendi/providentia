Excellent service at the bar.  Food is dialed in.  The Crispy shrimp and peppers appetizer comes with a mildly spicy aoli. This is my favorite thing on the menu.  The grilled salmon entree is very good, but it is not the biggest dish so don't just get that if you have a big appetite. I don't have a big appetite so it's a go to for me.  The fish tacos are also very good.
