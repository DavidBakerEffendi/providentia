This has been my go to place for Chinese food near the Concordia area for so long that I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it yet! The food is quite good and if you know what to order, there are definitely certain dishes that are absolutely amazingggg. (Hint: try the japanese tofu w/ eggplant). 

The staff have always been super friendly and the prices are very reasonable. Is this a perfect place for date night? Definitely not. But if you're out with a bunch of friends and craving some Chinese food where you actually want to sit-in and eat, I'd definitely check this place out!
