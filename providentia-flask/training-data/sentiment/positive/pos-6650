Awesome bar with oyster happy hour from 3-6. $1.00 oysters of the day. Bloody Mary is the best I have ever had, comes with a vast cornucopia of garnishes including a colossal shrimp. Old bay rimmed glass with a very horseradish infused mix.  Burger is good as well. Bar tenders are very professional and know how to mix drinks.  Bar itself was imported from France and has very old school comfortable feel to it. Great place to hang out and watch the game the mirror for the bar is actually 4 huge flat screens. A nice oasis in the middle of the chaos of the strip.
