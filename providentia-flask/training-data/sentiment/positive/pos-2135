Ummm where do I start? Atmosphere - check (old church with great art on the wall) Wine list - check (a billion) menu - check (basics, classics, specialties, and specials). Seriously. This place has it all. There are rooms for parties and the dining room is open and fun. The bar is cozy and busy. Bonterra often represents the Panthers and Charlotte at Taste of the NFLPA at the Super Bowl. 

Opened up with the charcuterie and it was a great place to start. Waiter suggested a bottle of wine which was perfect. Wife had the fried lobster tail which is a dish famous here. Really good dish. I had the ribeye which was cooked perfectly and loved the sides too. Dessert? Forget it about. Awesome special which was a strawberry souffl√©. I need to get here more often. Remind me.
