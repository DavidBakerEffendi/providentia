We had a wonderful family birthday dinner here last night.  My Mom's choice for her birthday dinner last night.  She had the dinner special seafood chile relleno with rice and beans.  She loved it!  I had the panuchos - similiar to a tostado - 3 mini tostado like black bean, chicken, avocado slices and lettuce on flat corn torillas served with black beans (refried style smashed) and rice -very tasty.  A nice evening.  The birthday song with Mom's Mexican hat and complimentary flan made her night - thank you!
