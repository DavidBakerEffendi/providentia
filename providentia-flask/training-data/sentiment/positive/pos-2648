Beef Wellington, all you can drink (for an additional $12 per person), Kobe beef, amazing sushi, creative and delicious desserts, piles of King crab legs so high you can't see over them, paella that's better than we've had in Mexico, and tons and tons of other options that were all SPECTACULAR... Even the lo mein was something to write home about. Only thing I can think of that wasn't amazing was the long wait but hey good things come to those who wait! (And I would do it over again any day to have that food again!)
