This resto is really easy to miss if you just stroll down Ossington.  There was a small blackboard outside the restaurant and we missed it twice even when we were deliberately looking for it... I came here a while ago but a sudden craving for Korean fusion food led to this postdated review

While it looks a bit dingy from the outside, once you go in, the unique deco makes you feel like the most hipster Korean-American gangsta foodie ever.  (the bartender was pretty cool)

The menu changes from time to time, when my girlfriends & I went, we tried:
- "The Loosey" - nothing like the classic Juicy Lucy, but still quite delish - you should try to find out! 
- Tempura Chicken with Devilled Eggs - two nothing-special items combined together made one great dish.  I wish the devilled eggs I make tasted like that, still trying to figure out what seasoning they used
- Bulgogi Cheesesteak - not bad, but just tasted like bulgogi with a lot of cheese.
- A dumplings dish I really can't remember - it was nothing spectacular though and I didn't get the fusion element in that one.
- Rice Bowls with Pork Neck (+ some fancy seasoning I can't recall..) - you need to order one of these if you want to feel full after the meal, we really enjoyed the rice bowl :) The server mashed the rice with the ingredients together for us!

I recommend going in groups so you can try different dishes and share these Korean bar foods.  Most items are around $7-$15, but the rice bowls were at $20/each with different choice of meats and seasoning.  Not sure if they are still offered on the current menu, but I fell in love with this restaurant when I went and would definitely go again.
