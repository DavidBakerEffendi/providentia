A grocery store and Middle Eastern bakery all in one! Shamy (Pronounced Sham-mee) has ridiculously cheap, freshly made flatbreads and pies, as well as freshly made desserts. We ordered a few flatbread items (Zataar with cheese and Safiha armani) and a spinach pie. 

The breads are all made fresh on the spot in their brick oven and only took a few minutes to make. The zataar with cheese had a great balance of the zataar spice with cheese and the flatbread was lightly crisp. The safiha armani was also tasty, with an even layer of well seasoned ground beef with vegetables. I enjoyed the spinach pie as well. It had a generous amount of spinach with a tangy flavor (I think maybe there's some pomegranate in it). The flatbread was $2.99 and the spinach pie was a whopping $.99. :D

We browsed in the grocery section too, which had lots of unique candies, cookies, herbs, condiments, and syrups (Just to name a few). 

What really set this shop apart from others is the very friendly service. When we entered the shop we were immediately greeted and the lovely lady at the counter explained to us the menu in detail and was very open to answering any questions we had about the menu or any items sold at the store. 

So for great service, reasonably priced delicious food, and unique items in their store, 5 stars!
