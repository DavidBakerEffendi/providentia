Stayed here over Labor Day weekend with my boyfriend.  It was his first time, my second.  I was here years ago when they had their grand opening.

Always loved this hotel.  It's clean and the rooms are huge, well worth it!  The staff is super friendly and the hotel is beautiful.  Love the restaurants, shopping, night club, location, etc.  

We especially loved the more hidden pool area in the 12th floor.  It's a nice relaxing spot after a much needed break from partying.  

Not a fan of the extra hidden fees but that seems to be standard no matter where you go.  I also wish they had more perks for guests when it comes to their restaurants and Tao.

Would love to stay here again.
