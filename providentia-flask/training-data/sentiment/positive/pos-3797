Great service, casual, upscale atmosphere, delicious pizzas for the price.  Tried the Hunter's special & Buffalo Ranch on Monday Night Football.

Come in between 5 - 7 PM or 12 - 2 AM for happy hour. 50% off pizzas & drinks. 5 star service. Our Waitress was cool, I forget her name though.. Dark hair,  tats & tan.  Total sweetheart made sure all the drinks were full.
