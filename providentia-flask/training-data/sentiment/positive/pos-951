I picked up a to go bagel sandwich before work this morning.  It was so fresh and delicious!!  It had sliced tomato, egg, and a fresh bagel.  The eggs had such a light and healthy flavor, and this was the freshest bagel I've ever had. It came with hash browns on the side, and a glass of orange juice that tasted freshly squeezed.  I would like to go and have a sit down breakfast here, and try some of the great variety of dishes that are on the menu.
