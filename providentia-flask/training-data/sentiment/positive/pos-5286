This place is excellent.  Komol will always be my favorite Thai restaurant for vegetarian food, but Pan Asian is the place to go in Vegas for their Massaman Curry, Pad Thai, and Papaya Salad.  So many other things are delicious on the menu too- you really can't go wrong. The owner is amazing too- he has an incredible memory and always remembers you... never writes down your order even if you're with a large group and always gets it right!  How does he do that???
