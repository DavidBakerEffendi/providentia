First dinner at Vegas -- we decided to head over to this buffet. $42.86 per person on a Wednesday night (including tax). We made reservations ahead of time since I was traveling with a 40 people group, but the line was not that monstrous at 8:00 p.m.

Although the selection was not as vast as I envisioned it to be, the food was still of excellent quality. The miso baked fish was so good. Other dishes that left an impression were the prime rib, salmon/tuna poke, and pesto tortellini. Oh my god, the poke. I have never tasted ahi tuna this delicious. I've definitely been missing out all my life.

The dishes are replaced pretty often, and everything tastes fresh.

They have a good array of desserts, some of my favorites were the banana foster (hint of alcohol flavor) and the creme brulee. Their cheesecakes were okay, and the soft serve melts pretty quickly. By the time I had walked from the dessert bar back to my seat, I already had a pool of vanilla around my rapidly melting ice cream.

Great buffet! Can't wait to try out some of the others around the Strip.
