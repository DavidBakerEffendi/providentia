Found this place on yelp and was amazed by all the five star reviews. Finally went in last week with the wife and sat at the bar. 

Food was great. We had the two pizzas. One was the fig and arugula and one was red sauce with pancetta. Both were great. I'm picky about pizza crust and this place nails it.

The owner seemed super nice added to a great experience. Looking forward to going back to try other pizzas!
