I went here on a Saturday evening around 7 after having spent a few hours at the pool followed by a burger at Grind Burger.  Anyway, there were 2 or 3 other parties relaxing and smoking when my group of 4 arrived.  We were promptly greeted by the hostess/waitress and seated in the main lounge area (they also have some private rooms in the back).  I ordered Blue Mist for myself and the hubby and my friends ordered fruit loopz.  We all agreed the Blue Mist was way better--it's one of my favs anyway.  Before 8pm hookahs are $12.  The "hookah guy" was very attentive and came by frequently to check the coals.  The four of us sat and talked for about 2 hours, intermittently smoking and sipping our Fiji water ($4).  Mind you, these type of places don't serve water in a glass for free; you ask for water and you get a bottle.  This is my new favorite hookah lounge in Las Vegas.
