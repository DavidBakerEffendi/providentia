Deliciousness - 4/5
Happiness - 5/5

What a fun little spot. There is probably more wine than square footage here. They have a huuuuuge selection - local, international and from all over the US. One of the co-owners was serving and was really accommodating, helping us pick out each selection. We sat outside, which is almost a must given how small the location is. I do wonder how it will fare in the summer with our heat in full force. 

The other customers were nice too. A few brought left over Easter candy (which really complimented the wine) and there were all sorts drinking there (from people in gym clothes to hipsters). 

They do have daily specials and happy hours, so be on the lookout for that.
