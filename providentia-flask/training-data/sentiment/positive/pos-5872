I found this restaurant thanks to yelp. Lived in Cleveland a number of years without ever knowing it was here, Called for a reservation and talking with Junior was like making a new friend on the phone.

Arrived hungry at 3 when they opened with no preconceived ideas, which I recommend all first-time diners do here. You know about the relaxed atmosphere and long wait so don't come and then complain on yelp.

Had planned to have Gumbo, Etouffee and Jambalaya but ended up with Chicken Remoulade and Jambalaya. I had to close my eyes when I tasted both as it was so good I'd only dreamed of Cajun/Creole food being so delectable.

Did not order any alcohol. I wanted to stay on my chair! Nor did we have rum cake. Couldn't hold another bite.

Junior's place is larger than a reviewer mentioned (5 tables.) It could easily hold 25 diners and a group will make for a fun time. This wonderful man cares deeply about his food, his restaurant and his guests. I admire him for who he is and what he does.
