Comfortable & quiet.  I feel nurtured in this joint.  I eat in the bar so I can feel close to the piano (weird, I know).  I don't go for the food, but it is enjoyable.  The chicken marsala has an eclectic sweet taste which is refreshing.

PS.  Don't call old Vegas tacky, it's Fabulous Las Vegas, not "7 shades of Beige" Las Vegas.
