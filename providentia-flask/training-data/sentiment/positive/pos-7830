Eggslut is an addiction! There is always a huge line for this placed! Would recommend coming before they open to wait ahead. Their sandwich is so delicious! What's unique about eggslut is their signature 'slut' which is caged free bird poached in a jar. It's seriously a different concept and I've never seen or taste anything like it. 

For their 'sluts' in the jar you have to mix it up well and then you dip the bread into the jar. It taste like potatoes, but very delicious.
