My first tip of advice - order something in addition to the Slut and OJ. You will still be hungry (ps. I eat like the average person). The Slut was amazing! You can spread it over the baguette (you can order more baguette) and it was gooey yumminess. Be prepared to wait in line as it is a popular place. OJ is a little on the pricey side for $5, but hey, it's Vegas. After you get your Slut, you can fight for a place to sit.
