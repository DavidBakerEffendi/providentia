I live very close to Village Square and was doing a search for happy hour's when I found 808 Tapas. Expecting a generic sushi experience, though slightly confused by the word, Tapas, usually associated with food from south of the border, I was blown away with the food and the service.

The food is an Island Fusion including the ambiance of Hawaiian/Jamaican background music.

I have since tried many of the items from the full menu but the happy hour menu is off the hook.

I usually order the UFC, which consists of a center filled with various cubed raw fish encircled with shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber and red caviar. I like the Chef Yoshi Roll which includes shrimp tempora, yellowtail tuna, cucumber, jalapeno, cilantro, yuzu soy and siracha.

The owner is there most of the time. There is next to zero turnover from the waitstaff. And it has a family feel.
