Fast and good!

I got the seafood with vegetables on rice. WHOA the portion was huge! It was enough to feed another person and maybe a half person LOL 

Seriously it was that huge! The flavors were like Starburst. I wish I was with a group so that I could've tried more but if I am ever back in town, I will most def go here for dinner and try out other things. Maybe even lunch. 

OH YEAH I had it to go. The seating is very limited here but then again, most spots in Toronto are like this.
