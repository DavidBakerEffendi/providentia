Had dinner at Bottigilia last night for the first time and loved every second of it. First, let me start by say how cute the place is and the live music really set the vibe!! It was a Friday night so I was hesitant going in since it seemed a little busy but was stunned at how fast our food came out. The zucchini flowers are a MUST try for appetizers! For my main course I had the linguini vongole and substituted the clams for shrimp. I wish the linguini wasn't so good because I ate too much and didn't have room for dessert :( MUST TRY FOR YOU ITALIAN FOOD LOVERS
