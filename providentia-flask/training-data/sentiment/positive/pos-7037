My friend and I bought a groupon on Sunday morning and checked this place out for lunch that day. There at a few reasons specifically that I loved this place. The atmosphere was great, the service was phenomenal and thorough.

First, I am highly allergic to mango/ which is a frequently used ingredient in a ton of modern Mexican restaurants. I asked one server, not ours about the salsa flight, just in case. Not thinking about it when our server came back he said without missing a beat "oh and ma'am there is no mango in the salsa flight." I asked what he recommended and he provides options in every section of the menu in depth and when I chose his favorite, the chilled steak salad, he checked that there was no mango in the dressing either. He was consistent with water refills and checked on us just the right amount.

Second, he was super knowledgeable about the groupon. He let us know which foods and drinks counted and didn't act like we were any less of customers just because we had a groupon, though we wouldn't have minded paying full price/ it was worth it.

Overall it was an amazing afternoon, great food, wonderful service and we will definitely return with friends.

Well done Julian, well done!
