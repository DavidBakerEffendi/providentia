Finally got to try the brick & mortar 
After seeing countless instagram posts, figured it was time to try this place for myself. 
Menu is straight forward, went with the Chicken Katsu burger combo which comes with fries + drink (yes, refills are free) 
The customer service is chill and the place is clean overall. They have some board games/cards if you want to stay longer than the meal :) 
Eating area is pretty small, so you'll be close to everyone around you. 
The food was SO GOOD. I'm usually not the type to get chicken for a burger....but it was chicken katsu. And it was amazing. Garlic fries are what come standard with the meals, I'd recommend the jazz fries if you want something new (you're welcome) 

The food was made quickly and worth what I paid. 

If you find yourself visiting often, get yourself the reward card to get them points. And don't forget to tip so you can get some tip jelly :))
