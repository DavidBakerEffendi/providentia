There are not a lot of bars open on a Sunday night in downtown Cleveland, but this place was so we walked in.  Glad we did.  Bartender was pleasant and fast, and the tacos were great.  You write out your order on a form and hand it to the bartender, which is genius!

Will definitely come back next time I am in Cleveland...
