Living near South Scottsdale, I'm delighted to have such a nice restaurant so close to home! I really had no idea the extent of this place before I came here for the first time with fellow, famed (Tampa) yelper Steve E. The Salt Cellar is, literally, located in a cellar underground and has been an area staple for almost 40 years. They have mostly seafood as well as steak, and the food and service are excellent. On my first visit I had the ahi tuna with couscous, which was amazing, and there was enough left to snack on the next day. Good choice Steve!

I recently returned with my boyfriend for his 28th birthday celebration. As expected, the food was astoundingly good - this time, ahi and crabcakes - and the service was top-notch. They comped our dessert (the chocolate and caramel gelato, a repeat for me) which was much appreciated.

This is a great option for an upscale date or business dinner. Make sure you get a reservation and give yourself some time to enjoy everything. You won't be disappointed here. I'll be back!
