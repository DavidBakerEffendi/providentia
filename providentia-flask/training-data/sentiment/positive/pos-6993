A MUST GO TO PLACE!!!!!!!!
2 things... Ate at the coffee cup last Sunday it was ok and would definitely pick this place over them again. The chicken fried steak was a home run. I think of myself as a chicken fried steak connoisseur and this place is the closest I've found to my moms growing up. You can tell its fresh and not frozen and deep fried like everyone else. Service was spot on and even had flavored creamer for coffee. My fianc√© had pancakes and bacon which I tasted and was good. Great menu to choose from. When I do go back it will be again the chicken fried steak. OH AND EVERYTHING IS HOMEMADE 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!!!!!!!!!

I also got the 410 breakfast wrap thats like a big breakfast burrito. Had half this am and would recommend as well
