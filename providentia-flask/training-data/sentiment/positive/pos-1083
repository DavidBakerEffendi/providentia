Wonderful smelling, small, charming store. 

This place is right up my alley. The minute you walk in it smells amazing of chocolate, tea, coffee beans and all sorts of other goodies. The store is very small, but pack quite a few yummy products to look through! There is not much parking for the business, but it is totally worth the short walk if you are already downtown!
