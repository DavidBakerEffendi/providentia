This place is all.....YUMMY.. OmG, the interior of the place was classy and it's small but every thing has a spot.  

Let's start with the food..... WoooooooW! I ordered the salmon, can I say tender, light with skin seared cripsy...  it was swimming in a tomato and bean sauce which was so awesome I could've had it by itself.  

The appetizer was a caesar salad with the old school anchovies salad dressing.... yes, finally a ceasar salad worth eating!

And the best thing of all was the dessert, a creamy tirimusi with a layer of chocolate at the bottom......woooooow!

I would definitely be back!
