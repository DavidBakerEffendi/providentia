Amazing. This is hands down THE best pizza I've had since I've moved to Vegas (wings too!) This was delivered to the office over the weekend, along with Caesar salad and garlic knots and the staff couldn't get enough. You know a restaurant is good when you want to rave about every item you had not just one thing in particular. 

Surprisingly, living in the area I've never even heard of the place but now I'm addicted, I'll be back with my husband this week. 


(So much for losing that post-baby weight, it's worth it!)
