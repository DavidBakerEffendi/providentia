Yelp challenge 2016 (84/100)

I have been to a lot of buffets in my short life and this buffet has to be one of my top buffets . Places like Caesars Palace have a big price tag and a very fancy set up , but most of their food is very mediocre . Of course this place serves your tradition crab legs ( always good ) and prime rib ( above average In addition you can get sushi , sashimi , and handrolls along with caviar , steak tartar , or wagyu beef . The dessert is quality too . The only reason why I say his buffet is worth the $40 price tag is because it serves expensive food that you usually don't get in one sitting . Come early to beat the food rush . Bring friends as always , and fuck shit up . If you read my reviews or follow me , you are a true homie . My food adventures are always honest . I don't mess with that whole hype this up cause I'm nice
