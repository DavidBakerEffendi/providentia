Hands down the best meal I have had out in a while.  Service was fantastic and each dish was fresh and full of flavor.  
I split two appetizers and an entree with a friend.  We were trying to keep it light since we had another stop to make, but all that and a glass of wine was more than filling and very reasonably priced.  I am already planning my return visit to explore more of the menu.
