I don't usually give 5 stars but this dinner really was as good as it gets from excellent service to meal presentation and of course the food was fantastic. Glad we made dinner reservations as it was pretty busy for a late Wednesday night dinner.  Went with a few friends and after a round of red wine, martini, and pumpkin beers(the drinks are a little pricey) the group started with the special soup of the day, a crab vegetable.  I skipped having a starter and ate some bread with whipped chive butter to hold me over until our entrees came out. Yum and loved the butter. I went with the pork for my entr√©e which was grilled with a chipotle rub and raspberry sauce and melted in your mouth. Also served with grilled squash and mashed potatoes.  My date choose the sword fish which came with clams and sausage.  Our friends got the duck and shrimp and everyone was very happy with their choices. The food came out quickly, was hot and looked beautiful. Next time I will make sure to save room for dessert as they had a lot of great ice cream options!

On a side note in October they have a 5 course pumpkin menu for $40. Looked pretty good.
