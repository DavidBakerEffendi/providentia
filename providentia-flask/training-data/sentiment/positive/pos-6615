My go to breakfast place has been Allo mon Coco for years, but after trying Petinos, I have a new favourite! The line ups during the weekend are usually insane, but if you go during the week or after 11ish on the weekends, the wait isn't too bad. 

The service is fast and great. I had the Canadian eggs benedict and it was sooo good. My sister tried the Macedonia eggs Benedict which she loved and my husband had the mushroom, shallots and cheddar cheese omelet which he raves about as well. Their breakfast potatoes are a little different and have onion in them but they are out of this world. I also highly recommend the waffles, especially the strawberry, Nutella and English cream ones, sure it sounds like dessert but it has freshly made waffles so that's breakfastish right?!
