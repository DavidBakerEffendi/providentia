I came here on a whim and I'm so glad I did. This place is off the chain (not a dog eating joke). It's about $20/person when you do the "all you can eat" option. I have never been to a place that served food in this manner, but wowsers... I like! The waiter comes and you order about 2-3 selections per person, you finish that, the waiter comes back, and you order again. This process is repeated until you are stuffed silly.

Can you imagine ordering all the chicken katsu, spam musubi, and kalbi you want? CAN YOU?! Plus, all the food is made to order (I think), so it's steaming hot when it gets to your table.

I didn't try too many of their sushi options, but the cream cheese roll tasted flavorful and fresh. Unlimited drinks are an additional fee and they have a fridge in the lobby where you can get up & grab as many drinks as you want, changing it up each time you go.

To top it all off, customer service was awesome. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. It was seriously so yum yum!
