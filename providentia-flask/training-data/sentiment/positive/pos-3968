If you like Pho, this is the place for you. It's the best I've found in the Phoenix area to date. Their other dishes are all excellent. Great egg rolls as well as Pad Thai. Now for the bad news. This place is fairly small and there is often a wait. Coming here in the middle of lunch or dinner can be problematic. So, get here early or late. Or be patient, it's worth the wait.
