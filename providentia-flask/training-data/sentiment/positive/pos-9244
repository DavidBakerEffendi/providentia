So I haven't been to this place in a long time and we decided to stop here for dinner before heading to downtown Pittsburgh for a show. I made reservations a head of time so we were seated right away. Our waitress was excellent great service and my drink was always refilled quickly. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and the Shrimp Monaco for dinner. The calamari was delicious some of the best I ever had! The pieces were big lightly bothered and melted in your mouth. The house made marinara and mustard sauce that accompanied it were superb. 
As for dinner we split the Shrimp Monaco it came with 5 jumbo shrimp with lump crab meat on top. It was just enough for both of us and ended out meal perfectly I will be ordering it again!

Came here again and hit up the early dinner menu tried the Salmon Wellington. It was different but delicious and the price couldn't be beat!
