I love the Root Cafe.  It's a great place to hang out with friends, play cards, eat awesome healthy food and drink fabulous coffee drinks.  The staff are also very friendly, personable, attentive and go beyond what is expected.  Great customer service.  I have also had the opportunity to meet some of the chefs.  They are just as sweet as the front of the house staff!
