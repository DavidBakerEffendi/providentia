YUMMMMM!!! $7.99 for unlimited toppings pizza. Think of it as chipotle but w pizza. A couple things I'd like to point out-- there is thin and double dough if you need a thicker crust, they have ANCHOVIES (yasss), they have dessert pizza (I don't think pieology has this option), and hey have beer and wine available here! I really enjoyed my pizza. The service was super nice. I can't wait to come back next week!
