Bestow my heart! Found out about this bakery at the farmers market ( Phoenix Public Market)....was so excited they were located only minutes from me in the west valley. 

Mom and Pop came out from the bakery behind the counter to greet me...I wanted just bagels (by the way she gives you a bakers dozen) but I walked out with cinnamon popovers and a monkey bread loaf she modestly calls a white bread. 

The loaf is amazing. Looks like a pull apart bread lightly crusty on the outside and light, fluffy deliciousness inside. It's so big it pops up high, right over the pan. I didn't even need butter....be careful though, this bread can be addictive and it's hard to put down! She has a jalape√±o and a garlic variety, which I can tell you are crazy delicious. 

I've had the cinnamon popovers which are to die for, and today she had chocolate chip popovers....which I passed on. 

I was close to wiping her out of bagels...she has plain, everything, salt, garlic, poppy, sesame and a couple of others. Mom tells me she doesn't use preservatives, so everything is fresh and goes fast...come early.

The bagels are this close to tasting like a NY bagel and they freeze really well. Slight baked crunch on the outside, light and airy on the inside.

Mom and pop sells Boarshead meats/sandwiches and has a few other items on a short menu. She also had phyllo triangles stuffed with spinach and cheese along with other bakery items.

The restaurant area is cute and small, set up with a few tables and a soda machine refill station. Tucked in the back of a strip mall right off the 101 and Union Hills, a little hard to find the first time, but your radar will be on once you're ready to go back.
