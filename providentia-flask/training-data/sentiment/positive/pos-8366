What an amazing experience! I got the honors in hosting my cousins Gender Reveal Dinner here and the staff was fabulous! From waking into the door... From leaving. 

Customer services was on point. I felt like our party (16 adults & 12 kids) was the only one in the restaurant. They were on top of everything. 

The food was amazing!!! Omg soooo yummy!!!! Everyone enjoyed them-self. 

It was a perfect place to announce that she was having a baby girl! 

This restaurant is great for all events. From taking someone out to dinner or a group of Buddy's drinking at the bar. 

The owner was very nice. My severs were amazing!!!! I totally recommend this restaurant!
