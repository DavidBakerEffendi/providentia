We have eaten at Jewel's twice in the past month for lunch and so far, we love it!  After learning of a gluten sensitivity I needed to cut it out of my diet for a while and it is so nice to have a restaurant where I don't have to search the menu for only a few items that I can eat.  The brownies, cinnamon rolls, and vegan cupcakes were delicious as well!  The kids meals for $5 are perfect and my son eats all the grilled cheese and fresh fruit that it comes with.  Great job, we will keep on coming in!
