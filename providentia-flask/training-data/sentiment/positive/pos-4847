This is a wonderful, hidden treasure!  I've driven by there a thousand times and even went to the Liberace museum when it was still open.  However, I didn't think to try the restaurant until my mom bought a dining deal.  I went with my parents and had this old school, throw back Italian meal.  My mom had the lasagna, a la carte.  Huge piece came out!  I doubt you could eat much more than that portion.  She took half of it to go.  My dad ordered a shrimp and spinach dish (I can't remember the name of it).  I tried a couple bites and it was very good.  I had this shrimp and garlic dish (can't remember the specific name of it either) but it was very good.  In fact, I took a piece of bread and mopped up the rest of the sauce!  Every meal comes with a side of spaghetti and marinara.  I was too full to eat it but my dad said it was very good.  

A couple weeks later, my husband and I went for their Thursday night happy hour.  It's so wonderful to go into the bar area.  If you like anything that sparkles, you'll love this place!  The bar is a white piano and sparkles from the ceiling to the floor!  They also have live music on Thursday nights.  Not sure if they have different acts, but the night we were there the people were very talented.

Minimum, my husband and I will be back for their happy hour.  I'm sure we'll make it for dinner too!
