So this morning I was minding my own business when out through the windows I see a guy bringing in 3 BOXES of donuts. At that moment in time I had no clue about the gluttony that was about to occur.
The receptionist and I both look at each other, we look at the boxes without pause we look for a box that had not been closed properly. Dang, they were all taped up and it was in that moment that I knew I had two choices, 1) walk away 2) break into that mother... you guessed it, without even a pause I broke into that box. Upon opening that box, I saw things I never thought I would. In those boxes were some of the most incredible looking donuts I have ever laid my eyes upon. It was in that moment that I fell in love..... Really, it was that true moment of love at first sight. I knew we were meant for each other. A chocolate covered donut with FRUITY PEBBLES and a single lone Lucky Charms Marshmallow. 
I can't even begin to describe how delicious that donut was, soft and fluffy like I was almost eating air, sweet but not too sweet and the fruity pebbles and that single marshmallow really just made it so much more. 
I could sit in a dark room all alone and eat a box of those donuts all by myself, and maybe one day I will!
