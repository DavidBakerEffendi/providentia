I love this place! The sushi is super cheap and the food quality is pretty good! I have always wanted to try a revolving sushi restaurant but I feared they were expensive. Not Teharu, almost every plate is under three dollars...the problem is controlling yourself from overeating because of the prices. I don't think i've ever had a bill larger than $10 for myself and thats pushing it. The staff is wonderful and if there is a wait they are happy to seat you as quickly as possible. If the roll that you want isn't on the conveyer belt, all you have to do is order it from the waiter or if you are seated at the bar ask the chef. I also love that they keep a bottle of unagi sauce on the table--I put that on everything!
