This place is amazing! 

Good atmosphere, delicious food, and great service. This is the place you want to go if you want a slightly nicer Thai food experience. Food is going to be in the $25/plate range, but everything melts in your mouth. 

They are well known for their crispy duck and, if you try it, you'll know why. It is perfectly tender on the inside, deliciously crunchy on the outside. Seasoned just right, it is a dish definitely worth trying if you like duck. I usually get the drunken noodles with the crispy duck. 

This is a great spot for a Saturday night date or dinner and drinks with friends. Highly recommend it, you will not leave unhappy.
