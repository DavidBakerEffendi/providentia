What can I say, I love burgers. If your from Akron you know Swenson's. This local chain is an icon in this region and a must try for anyone passing through and a staple to the locals. There are about half a dozen locations to choose from and I have never gotten a bad burger from any. The service is speedy but car hop/togo service only is the only reason I haven't eaten there in a while. I won't let my 2 year old eat in the car. A while back Forbes magazine rated it "The Best Burger in America", and I agree!
