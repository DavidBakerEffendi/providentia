This is my local pub period!!!!!
Yes, they know us by name :) 
Danny the manager is super sweet. Julie and Penny are the day dolls and remember me and all my crazy life/stories. Chris the graveyard shift guy is funny and nice.
Their food is always right. 
Their homemade root beer and Ellis Island homemade drafts are excellent. 
As a gamblers bonus player you get your $5 every week or two and when playing, your cocktails are always on the house. 
Win or lose, ALWAYS leave a tip $20+ for this staff! 
It is smoking in the bar area, so if smoke bothers you, this is not your spot.
Busy during games and on weekends. 
Slow during the weekdays so if you want a drink and play a little during the day, this is your spot! Especially if you want a fun great convo with the staff.
Hubby an I have also sat in the dining area and the waitstaff are very kind.

I love this bar......
