I found this place by chance.  I was driving to the mall and always come off the 101 side.  I happen to be coming from the west and saw it.  I made a U turn and went in.  I tried a couple of their tarts.  I ordered the lemon and chocolate tarts to go.  I got home put them in the fridge for a hour before I was able to eat them.  The chocolate one was good.  The lemon was fantastic.  The whip cream was nice and soft not hard like it was in a cooler over night.  
This trip we decided for breakfast.  I had the quiche with ham.  It was pretty good.  I wish it had more ham in it though.  The croissants are yummy too.  Everything seem to be fresh.  What a great place.  I will be back again to try a different quiche.  I will ask I can pay for more ham or bacon in the quiche.
