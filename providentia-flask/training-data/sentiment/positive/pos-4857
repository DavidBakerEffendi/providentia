This small local Italian restaurant has a strong following. On Friday or Saturday night, don't be surprised if there is a wait. 

I always order the steak and cheese hoagie. The steak is seasoned well and the peppers and onions complete the sandwich. Today I tried the sweet potato fries and they were topped with cinnamon and sugar with a dipping sauce. 

The restaurant is reasonably priced and it's great to support a local business.
