My spouse and I enjoy the chill atmosphere, and delicious pizza! This is our favorite date night spot.  I love the great vegetarian/vegan options at Pizza Heaven.  The food is delicious, and the service is always consistently great!  Try the Veggie balls with hot wing sauce or the Vegan Delight pizza.  These are two of my favorites
