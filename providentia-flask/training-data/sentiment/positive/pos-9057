We make it a point every time we go to Vegas to stop by SUSHISAMBA for dinner and love it every time.  Tanice was our server again and remembered us, which was so nice.  She is awesome!  This time we had a vegetarian friend with us but left ourselves in Tanice's capable hands and she put together a super delicious meal we could share that had plenty of veggie and meat options.  We left completely stuffed but happy.  The seabass is still my favorite dish but I've never had anything there that I didn't love!  We will be back, thank you!
