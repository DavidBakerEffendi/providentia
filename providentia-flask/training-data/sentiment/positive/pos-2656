5 stars for this visit. Food was ready in the exact time they told me for my takeout order. All the food we got was excellent. Best Thai food restaurant that we've been to in the Summerlin area - and we've tried a bunch. Glad they got their takeout business on track and glad I came back for a 2nd try.
