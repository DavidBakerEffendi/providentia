Nostalgia dominates my rating.

This place is still excellent, but the prices have crept up and the service has declined.  Even with this gentle slide it is by far my favorite place to get sushi in the queen city.

The pros are they have one of the more imaginative all you can eat buffets.  They have my favorite dish which includes fried crispy spinach and vinegar.  I got my wife into sushi at this very restaurant.

Cons: loud, loud, loud.  Busy, busy, busy.  It is hard to find a parking spot, it is hard to find a seat, it is hard to hear anything not being shouted at you.

If you want to really revel in food and have some nice drinks: RuSan for the win.
