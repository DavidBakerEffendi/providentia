How I adore Maizie's...this is what CenPho is all about!

You have a nice interior that makes this nerd feel hip, and when weather permits a freakin' sweet patio for me to watch light rails drive back in forth without a care in the world.

You have a great selection. Gourmet hamburgers...epic salads...even pizzas! My mood for food can change on a whim...and you've got a lot covered, using great ingredients. 

Even when I'm feeling cheap, you're not beyond my grasp. Your happy hour is amazing, and because of it I'll never ever go back to the Applebee's down the street. $3 beers and wines? $5 apps? Delicious, like the $4 burgers on Monday that are simple, but oh-so good. I thoroughly enjoyed the Hoegaarden on tap, and your selection of chardonnay. $12 for a bottle? Yes, yes, yes.

Service was also swift, and everyone was nice. And me and my lady friend agree: You have really cute staff! 

Good eats, good view, great menu. 5 stars.
