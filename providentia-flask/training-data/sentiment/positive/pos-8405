Great place for breakfast or lunch right in the lobby of the Wynn. It was pretty chilly believe it or not while I was in Vegas, so the outdoor portion wasn't open while I was here but the area looked very nice.
There were booths and tables and we ended up getting a booth which i usually like better than the tables. 
I had the basics, some eggs and pancakes. Very very good. Great presentation as well. 
Its a fancier type diner almost and it shows. A bit pricer as well but well worth it i thought. 
Staff was very polite as well. I'd like to come back and try the outdoor seating.
