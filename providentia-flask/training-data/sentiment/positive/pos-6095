Heres the long and short of it. Bakery Wee makes fantastic cakes! We've been shopping here for 10 years and every cake we get is fantastic! The cookies are always fresh! I showed them a picture of this cake and they made it! The cake was over $800.00 from the cakerie (?) That I originally stole the photo from. I paid under $300 with their reproduction.
