As I eat my left over Ginger Chicken (no mushrooms/extra carrots, spice level 4) I am reminded that Le Thai Cafe has THE BEST THAI FOOD in the Pittsburgh area. Totally worth the drive into the suburbs. We normally do take out, but if you want to sit and eat, it's a very quaint restaurant with great service too. The Crab Rangoon is top notch as well!
