Went to Johnny B's last week in Belmont. When I find myself in Belmont, I always head to Johnny B's. The Pretzel Drops are a must-have as a starter. They are doughy, buttery, and parmaseany, and they come with marinara sauce for dipping. 

I also spring for the Lily Pad pizza. It's a pesto-based pizza with cheese and veggies. They have really good, fresh, doughy crust that I love.

Johnny B's has ample street parking and is in a fun area of Belmont. Service has always been good!
