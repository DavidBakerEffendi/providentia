Ever since moving out to Milwaukee I've had a craving for this place. I wish I could get back to Madison a little bit more often just to make another trip to Smoky Jon's.

Walking in it's clear what your in for. Jon has rib credentials! The walls are covered in awards and certificates the guy has won. Best sauce, best ribs,  best this, best that. You don't get the awards this place has without knowing what you're doing.

I almost always get the ribs (because how can you not?). The sauce has just enough heat to really compliment the ribs. I've tried a few of the sandwiches, but I always end up coming back to the ribs because that's where this place really shines. 

The sides are also very good. The potato salad and coleslaw are my favorites. I'm also big fan of the BBQ Baked Beans. The french fries are good enough if you get takeout from Smoky's (just because they travel a bit better than something like cole slaw), but with so much other great stuff to try you are really ripping yourself off if you stick to them.

This is definitely one of my favorite places in Madtown.
