Im an addict! This is 100% my favorite go to spot in Vegas. I just recently found it about two months ago, and I've now gone over 13 times. If you check in each time with the Belly app you gain points. Once you hit a certain number, they give you a free burrito! Not only is the service always extremely fast but they are so much fun to see all the time. They are very generous with the portion of meat they give you too, which is a huge plus! I get the 3 Amigos and add spicy tuna and cream cheese... I also crave it once a week because it is that good! The prices are very reasonable for what you get. Ive been to a few other Sushi burrito spots and never end up going back to them. This one is forever my go to!
