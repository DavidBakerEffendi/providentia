Boyfriend took me here to try to find another sushi place I would like just as much as the other 2 establishments I'm pretty loyal to, and I have to admit that it's a good place to eat and hang out. 
Their sushi list isn't as large as other sushi restaurants, which is understandable because that isn't the focus of their menu, but the items are still just as creative and yummy. For example, the Lasagna rolls actually taste like lasagna! Their drinks are just as delicious and hit the spot (classic Espresso Martini in the afternoon)! Another menu that I'd like to bring up is their Happy Hour, which is a good size with variety, so I highly recommend going then. 
Something to try that I wasn't able to get was the Funkler (sp?). 
Almost forgot to mention their customer service... It was excellent. Servers and their helpers are nice, some are sociable than most, and they are attentive. Example: They don't wait to clear your table, which was honestly nice 'cause we were ordering in groups, and I like having a clean table. We had a lady genuinely inquire to my first-time experience there too, which was slightly cool.
