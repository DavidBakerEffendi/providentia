Hot dogs, tater tots, and alcohol. What more could you ask for?

This place can get pretty loud when there's live music (obviously) but otherwise it's easy to have a conversation with friends.

I usually get the same dog - bacon, cucumbers, and a fried egg. The tater tots are great with the top secret fry sauce!

It's walking distance to Cleveland Public Theatre, the Capitol, XYZ, Sweet Moses, and some cute shops in Gordon Square.
