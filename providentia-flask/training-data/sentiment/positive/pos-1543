I feel like Barro's is so good it barely even needs a review so I'll keep it brief. I put in an order for pickup, showed up a little early but it was ready to go so I didn't have to wait.  The girl at the counter was friendly and of course the pizza itself (a mini White pizza, perfect for 1 person!) was delicious.  I'm obviously going to be coming back.
