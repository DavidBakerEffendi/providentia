Wow! Bottiglia delivers on all three fronts!
Ambiance- clean modern elegant setting with full service bar and outdoor patio options
Food - High Quality Food with huge entree portions - be prepared to take a doggy bag home 
Service - Zach W. offered excellent service with attention to detail. Ask for him! 

Char grilled octopus - one word - tender and delicious! The flavors were wonderful. I was afraid to order it as octopus tastes rubbery and bland at most places. I PROMISE you won't be disappointed if you try it. 

Charcuterie - the highlights were the bresaola (wagyu beef) and burrata. Fun presentation with mustard and jam. Ask for a couple extra crostinis too - you will need them. 

Papardelle with meat bolognese - pasta was fresh and al dente. Meat sauce seasoned perfectly. 

Hangar steak - cooked to perfection! tender, and very generous portion. 

Spinach lasagna - full of flavor and lots of extra sauce. 

Very happy I found this Italian restaurant. I will definitely be back.
