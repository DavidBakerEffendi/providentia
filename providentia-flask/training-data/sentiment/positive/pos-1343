Went back and the waitress and food were wonderful.  The guinness battered haddock was delicious.  My friend said her coleslaw tasted fishy, but I didn't eat mine cause I remembered I didn't like their slaw to begin with.  My mother had the soup and she enjoyed it, I thought it was bland.  The cake for two was wonderful.  My friend did not like the frosting on it or on the peanut butter cake, but overall she loved her cake (it was the same frosting).  I had the bailey's cheesecake, I loved it.  The waitress was friendly and personable.
