This is one of my favorite Starbucks in the downtown/Westmount area. 

I've visited here 3-4 times during my most recent visit to Montreal, and each time, the counter people have been friendly and the baristas have always gotten my drink right. And my drink is one that is not on the menu and other Starbucks sometimes don't get it right. So it's really refreshing to encounter one that is consistently good. (Hey, when you're paying over $6 for a coffee, you want it to be right. Am I right?).

Furthermore, this store is large and spacious, in a galley-like configuration, with the entire south-facing wall of windows, making for a light-infused interior. Great for people-watching, too. There are small bistro tables for two along the window walls, but also a long rectangular table running the length of the store, in the middle. There are Deco-esque ceramic embossed ceiling tiles over the seating areas,  and a dramatic, heavy deep green velvet drape over the counter, making the place feel a bit like a theater of yore. It has character to it which my mother and I find very appealing.

There are two bathrooms here (you need a code to get in); both have always been clean when we've visited.

Bonus: every time I've visited, this store has played the best music! (I know this is subjective, but in my opinion, it's true!).
