This Starbucks is close to my job so I come in and get some coffee to help me get through the day! The baristas are super friendly and always make my drinks right! My co-workers also go here (they actually go wayyyy more than I do) and love the customer service. Will continue to go here & will recommend all friends and family to this location :)
