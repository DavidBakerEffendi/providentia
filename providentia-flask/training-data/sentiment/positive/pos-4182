This little place serves delicious Vietnamese - Thai food ALL THE TIME! The service s always very attentive, and prices very reasonable. Some of my favourites:
Mango Fish -imagine a whole fish (sans head) deep fried until it is just perfectly crisp yet tender, garnished with delicious slivers of mango and smothered in a delightfully balanced fish sauce/ lime juice/sugar/pepper blend.
Tom yum soup hits all the right notes of salty/sour/sweet/spicy that is the foundation of Thai cuisine.
The house special fried rice s a meal in itself, packed with tasty bits of smoked pork, sausage, shrimp, chicken veggies and scrambled egg!
Pad Thai is made the authentic way, using tamarind sauce not ketchup.
The beef salad s deliciously fresh and filling.
The grilled meat, salad and vermicelli bowls won't break the bank and don't skimp on the Protein. Add some spring rolls and you will be hooked!
If you order a day ahead, they also make deep fried lobster with green onions and ginger that will make your mouth water.
