SushiSamba continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here with a group of 40 on 8/30. The staff couldn't have been anymore accommodating and friendly. The menu options satisfied everyone's needs. Everything was served family style which we all likes. The firecracker shrimp, truffle aioli and the strip steak were so delicious. My friends and family loved the fun and hip atmosphere. If you ever want to have a group meal I think it doesn't get much better than this!
