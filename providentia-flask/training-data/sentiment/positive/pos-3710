Samuel was absolutely amazing in helping us during check in/out trying to keep a room between my wife and I for split reservations. He made what would have been a difficult transaction painless and with a smile. 

Again- Samuel rocks. If only all businesses had a Samuel customer service wouldn't ever be an issue. 

We have loved the Venetian in general for this stay and this moment was over the top. Props to them for the customer centric effort. Will recommend and definitely come back next time in Las Vegas.
