Mizu is a great value for sushi. There is a happy hour every day from 4:30 to 6 pm (except for Sunday). Regular rolls are $3 during this time window. I enjoy the sushi here more than at the lunch buffet at Tomo. Lunch specials at Mizu are excellent and affordable. A tofu bento box is around $7 with miso soup and salad. I enjoy Ginko although I would like to retire between the ages of 50-55. Pacific East is a nice place yet sometimes out of the way. Mizu has a calm atmosphere. The service is excellent.

I looked at the Yelp app on my last visit and noticed people discussing the Parker Roll. Parker Roll piqued my interest. My parents gave me the name of Parker before the name surged in popularity. Now it is acceptable to call your offspring wacky words like Parker. My friend Phil text messaged me today and thanked me for writing such good Yelp reviews. He also inquired about meeting for lunch in the near future because he is working nearby in Independence. He ended the conversation with the following:

Oh. Btw. The Parker roll at mizu is sort of named after you. Nikki n I used to go there all the time and they named a special roll after our kid Parker whom would most likely not have the name if I didn't know u. Mind blown?

Try the Parker Roll in my honor!
