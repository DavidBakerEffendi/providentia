LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. I would give it 8 stars. 

This place is so GREAT, so much that it deserves ALL CAPS OH MY GOD. It's basically set up just like a Greek chipotle and the food is soo delicious and fresh. For basically the same price as a burrito bowl ($8.50 with tax) you can have truly delicious Greek food.

I went for the rice bowl with lentils and chicken. They give you a huge portion of meat (no skimping here!) and all the greek yogurt/veggies/feta/olives you want! Be careful though, olives are not pitted. Sorry molars ... 

And when I teetered back and forth over getting a side of hummus, the gal putting my bowl together said to just get some hummus in the bowl since it comes with pita, so I didn't' have to pay more. (My wallet thanks ye kind lady!)

Super excited to go back!
