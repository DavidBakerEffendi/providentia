Fibber's is always our go-to in town bar when we don't want to deal with Mill or Scottsdale. 

You may be surprised when you enter the strip-mall storefront when you are confronted with authentic all wood paneling and tasteful Irish decorations. You can sit at the bar, at a table, or at one of the large wooden kegs that seat up to six. In addition to offering the best Guinness pour in Phoenix, they now have several craft beers on tap as well.

I've been a regular for several years now, and their service and food has stayed consistently excellent. There are no rude servers or bartenders at Fibber's, and if you're not happy, they'll make you happy.

I don't usually write "glowing" reviews, but Fibber's really is that good. Check them out.
