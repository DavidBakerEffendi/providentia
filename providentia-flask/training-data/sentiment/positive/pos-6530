We went for brunch on the recommendation of some friends that live in the area.  What a great choice!  The setting is fantastic....you're just outside in a great little garden area.  And the food was amazing.  I'm a bit of a champagne nut (I think I mention champagne in every review I write....) and I loved the fact that they give you a mini bottle and a mini carafe of oj to mix yourself!  I also found it funny that the woman at the table next to ours used all of her OJ and I used only a little bit....mmmmm...its just to color, right? ;)
