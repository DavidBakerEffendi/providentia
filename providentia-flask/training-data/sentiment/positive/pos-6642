Man, the service at this place is phenomenal! 

As soon as we sat down, we were asked for our drink orders and were served a complimentary chips and salsa/bean dip. All of that happened even before we can open the menu! It's a bunch of different servers working together. I think that's one of the things that made this place stand out for me. We have one server who took our orders but there were a bunch of other people working around making sure our drinks were filled, our dips were not running low, the used plates were out of the way, everything they were on top of it!

The food was excellent too. I got shrimp fajita that came with a side of rice, guacamole and beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I was excited to see them light it on fire! It was surely entertaining! If you order the combo on a Tuesday night, instead of paying $12, you only pay $10. The portions were huge and the sauces they provided were abundant. For two people, it was definitely a feast. We made room for desserts and ordered churros. It was sooooo good. Maybe because I have been craving them but seriously, with a little bit of whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup, those churros were melt in my mouth good. 

Also, I love it when the whole restaurant sings when it is somebody's birthday. It makes the ambiance more friendly and festive. I was definitely a good change from my boring Tuesday nights.
