Wow. Someone pinch me. I think I am dreaming.  Block and Grinder was just as great the second time around as it was the first time, almost a year ago.  The idea that a butcher shop can also be a fantastic restaurant is cutting edge, in my opinion.  The reservations are super easy to make and they are very welcoming when you arrive.  Parking is plentiful with handicapped parking within a few feet of the front door.  There is an outside area for dinning that is covered and warmed in the winter.  If you enjoy their burgers, you can ask for a Block and Grinder bacon cheese burger kit that will have everything you need to grill out at your next outdoor picnic.  

The waitstaff are knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to each table they serve.  I was very impressed by the quality and flavor of the meat of my bison burger.  It was DELISH!   

I would most certainly come back and look forward to tasting some more fantastic dishes.
