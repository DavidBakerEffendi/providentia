Yes, I'm a fan.  I have stayed here probably 3+ times and each time I'm fairly pleased.  The most recent time, my family came to vegas to celebrate my mom's 65th birthday.  

We made our suite our home.  Both my brother and I worked out of our suite, we ordered room service, ate at all the restaurants as well as the food court, and even received spa services in the spa.  

I would totally stay here again.  It's really easy to rack up your hotel room bill and forget that reality will eventually hit and you have to pay for everything.  But at the end of the day, it was a good hotel experience and I would totally go back.  

Actually, I'm planning on going back in May with some girlfriends.....
