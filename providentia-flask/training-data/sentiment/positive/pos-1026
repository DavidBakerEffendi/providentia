Yes!Yes! and Yes! I have been trying to try the one in LA for the longest but I can never seem to make it time before they close so this place was a must in Vegas. 

I came on a early Saturday morning and as U expected there was a line but that didn't stop me from standing in it. I ordered the Slut and omg guys it was soooo good! It is like mash potatoes and eggs runny style, just the way I like and the taste is pure blissfull goodness! 

I have to admit i was expecting it to be all hype and no good but boy was I completely wrong. I am definitely going to have to get up early enough to catch the one in LA, this is a must! I you're on the Strip stop by!
