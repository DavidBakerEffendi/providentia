It's always been our thing to eat Asian food no matter where we travel.  We usually try at least a few of the local cuisine, but always default back to what we enjoy best.  We were in search of Korean in Montreal and Mon Ami popped up closest and highly rated to us.  However, they were closed on Tuesdays.  So we were able to find this Express location.

They are a small location upstairs in a suburban neighborhood.  The staff consisted of 3? people.  Lucky, we beat the dinner rush, but we ordered the soy garlic Korean fried chicken, the spicy pork rice bowl, and the tofu soup.

The Korean fried chicken was superb! Some of the best I've had ever.  The skin was super crispy and the sauce was flavorful.  The spicy pork bowl actually came with a lot of meat, the spice could have been kicked up a bit.  The only weird part was they put way too much dressing on the salad that came with it.

The tofu soup was solid flavor, just the seafood they added could have been more.

Overall, a nice little gem to get your Korean fix if the main location is closed.
