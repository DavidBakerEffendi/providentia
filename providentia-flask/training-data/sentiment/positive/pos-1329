We love coming here for Brunch. They have incredible tasty gluten free bread for their bruschetta. Their toppings are delicious all of them. My husband loves their French Toast and gets it every time. Great location in Kierland. The staff is great. They mixed up my order and there was a small wait so they took off the whole order. Cannot beat that!! We are regulars now
