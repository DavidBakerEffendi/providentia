Food was amazing! You get complementary wine, soup or salad, cappuccino at the end of this your meal, AND garlic bread ! Can't beat that anywhere... Literally !!!! I ordered chicken parm which the chicken was a huge portion and you get a little side of pasta which I didn't mind because I'm not a pasta fan. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Marsala which isn't on the menu but they made it for him and he ate the whole thing. I ate most of mine but couldn't take it back to the hotel because we don't have a fridge or microwave. The service was great only issue we had was waiting for more bread but it was busy so I'm not going to complain. 

The only issue I had was the stupid old ladies behind us who honestly complained the whole time for no reason !!!! They were so rude about it I almost got up to tell them to shut up. They even said something to a couple that just sat down about how they couldn't get a wine glass for the free wine, they give you a little shot glass to drink from but that's fine ! Not something to complain about. They were being so long about how they were never coming back which is fine but keep it down and to yourself!!! We had a great experience thank you !
