This was our first visit with many more to come.  We were met and seated immediately by Chelsea who turned out to be a marvelous waitress.  I ordered my usual Gin Martini that sets up my palate (Ahem!), we then ordered sandwiches for lunch with soup and fries on the side.  Now, you can go to any sandwich shop and order a burger or french dip; however, these orders were special and prepared perfectly.  My wife enjoyed her beef soup and the French dip.  I ordered the house favorite Ale House Burger that I just loved, the beef, the bacon, the carmilized onions and the cheese just meshed into the most delectable flavor.  The restaurant itself is large and really classy with modern d√©cor and divided into four areas of your choice; Bar and lounge area, regular dining area, group or party dining room, and a large patio; choose your spot to enjoy your individual desired dining experience.  The dinner menu offers a variety of entrees that sound delectable.  We will be back with our friends; we just have to share a good thing when we find one.  Wonderful place, wonderful people and wonderful food; what else can you ask for?
