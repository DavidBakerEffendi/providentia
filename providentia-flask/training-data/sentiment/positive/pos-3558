Opened by the same owner as the Clifton Martini bar in Lakewood, Village Martini and Wine Bar is all class.

It is the perfect spot for date night, girl's night, family dinner, or somewhere to get a drink after a long day. 

It is a great addition to Chagrin Falls. The hours are optimal and serve all with the kitchen being open until around 11 pm and the bar staying open late. 

While we're on the subject of food, WOW!! The food is amazing. I have tried the Scampi, Pizza, Piccatta, Goat Cheese Raviolis, Meat & Cheese Board, & Stuffed Mushrooms. I have yet to be disappointed. The food is elegant, tasteful, and massively satisfying. I would recommend trying ANYTHING on the menu. 

Not only is the food menu outstanding but the drink menu is as well. The drinks were , created by the owner Jeff, or he put his own twist on them. The wines were all hand selected by him. They are great. I had a Red Blend tonight and I wish I would have bought a bottle. 

The atmosphere, food, drinks, and company will keep me coming back!!
