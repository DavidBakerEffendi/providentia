We had a really nice dining experience here. Our waiter, Bruno, was really cool and gave us great service. I like how this place doesn't have an uptight, snooty vibe but it's still nice enough to enjoy on a special occasion, like an anniversary...which is why we came. The large outdoor patio overlooking the pool was such a neat surprise! It was beautiful out there. We relocated to the patio to enjoy our chocolate souffl√© and they happily let us do so. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the shrimp Louis salad with lobster was presented beautifully and was delicious as well! I also recommend the scallop potatoes. Ooh...and the bottles of wine were affordable! As low as $35/bottle. We ordered a $45 bottle of Pinot Noir and it was nice.
