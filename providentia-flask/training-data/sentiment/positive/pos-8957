Had dinner here again for Valentines Day. I was a little surprised (but happy) to see it as busy as it was considering they don't have a liquor license. The fact that they don't offer alcohol was not a big deal to us since we seldom ever order acohol in a restaurant. I feel guilty paying sometimes 4 times the cost of a bottle of wine and often nix the idea with the thought that I will just open a bottle when we get home.  I do believe though that if you do want wine with your dinner and you bring in your own bottle that is ok.

We ordered the Julien to start, I had the Stroganoff and my husband had the Langyet Steak. The service was friendly, but very slow. I don't mind waiting longer for an excellent dinner though and that is exactly what we recieved. The bread and garlic butter kept up satisfied while we waited and was so delicious I had to restrain myself when the waitress offered to get us some more. Both of our dinners were flavorful and delicious. The portion size is good. Not overwhelming but I still had some to take home.

They did have live entertainment (violinist) that night  for Valentine's Day. The owner was very excited about this and offered us another drink to stay and listen. We did stay for a couple of songs and were touched because he seemed to definately be going out of his way to make sure everyone enjoyed their evening as much as possible.
