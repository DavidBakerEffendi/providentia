I have been here many times over the last several years.  Funky and tasty.  But I am currently craving it as I recollect my most recent visit. First of all they have an amazing tuna sandwich.  Apples. In the tuna.  Yum!  And they have a grapefruit martini that is totally incredible. Odd combo?  Maybe. But so good!
