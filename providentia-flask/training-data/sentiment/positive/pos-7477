My first time at this place and I will definitely be back. This was sooooo much fun. Not only was the game great fun but the food was surprisingly delish. They have a nice drink menu with a huge variety. And the staff was soooo friendly. Great customer service! Great fun! I will definitely be back. It's a about $50 an hour to play so it can get pricy with food and drinks. I would recommend going with a good size group so you don't walk out spending hundreds of dollars, unless that's how you roll.
