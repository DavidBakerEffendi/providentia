Came to this location last night for dinner. It was my first time ever coming to a Texas Roadhouse and will certainly not be my last. Right from the start the service was amazing. Hostess was very friendly and polite. Took the liberty of telling me her favorite dishes and recommendations 
 since I had never been a Texas Roadhouse before. Our server, Jett was flawless in every way. Very polite and friendly and always super fast as well as attentive, even though it was peak dinner time and he had a full section. The food was spectacular. Had the cactus onion as an appetizer and the country fried sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes and green beans as my entree. I've worked in restaurants for five years and now manage an establishment and can say in my professional opinion this restaurant is run to 100% quality from the staff to the food and drinks. It was an amazing experience and will definitely be back very very soon. Most credit going to Jett. Management should feel as lucky to have him on their staff as I was to have him as a server.
