I felt compelled to write a review of Thomas Street given the unfortunate press that has surrounded it lately.  I've been going to Thomas Street for about 2 years now and it has one of the most ecclectic and diverse crowds I've seen in Charlotte.  During the week, you will find a less crowded more chill scene, and on the weekend it is usually packed after 10:30 (but not in a way that makes it annoying).  The outside patio has cornhole, and ping pong tables -  inside there is pool and foozball.  

The bartenders are very down to earth.  The drink prices are the best I've seen in Charlotte, and they are poured generously.  

This is NOT a club scene, top 40 kind of place.  You will find a juke box with mostly alternative and classics.  Come dressed down, and be prepared to get comfortable and have a great time.  Oh, and if you are leaving the bar solo at night, a bartender or bouncer is always happy to walk you to your car (in fact, they insist!).

There really isn't a bad thing I could say about Thomas Street.  It gets 5 stars because they also allow dogs on the patio :)

*Please note, I reviewed Thomas Street Tavern as a bar, not a restaurant.
