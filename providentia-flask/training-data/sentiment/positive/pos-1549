Awesome place for a day drinking adventure or just a good, fun night!! Walking in, this can be extremely deceiving. It's dark wood and somewhat old school. But it has a pool table and some fun games with a small bar in the corner. Where the real fun comes is when you step out back. They have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back. Tons of TVs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months  

Overall this is a really cool bar. Locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown. The area has tons of restaurants but Thomas street offers a full menu as well.  a must go if you live in Charlotte.
