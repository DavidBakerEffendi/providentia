WHAT IS BETTER THAN TACOS AND TEQUILA? 

NOTHING. 

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. 

Well, maybe queso too, but Barrio has some bomb ass queso. 

You can create your own tacos, or you can choose from a few menu suggestions. I suggest creating your own. 

Service is always super friendly and top notch. They're also not super stingy over water refills like the Barrio in Lakewood, and your glasses will always stay full.
