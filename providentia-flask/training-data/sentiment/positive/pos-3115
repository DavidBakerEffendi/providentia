This is my favorite bagel spot in Las Vegas.
I'm from Connecticut, so I used to take the train to NYC often. That being said, I know a good bagel! I have been trying to hunt down the perfect bagel here in Vegas for a while now and I think this is it. 

First off, i'd like to state that this place is a hidden gem. LITERALLY. It took us about 5 minutes to hunt it down in the parking lot! (Hint, its to the left of the Omelet House!)

They serve fresh bagels in different flavors, but me being a "plain jane" type I stick to plain. They also have different cream cheese flavors like plain, scallion, strawberry, veggie, etc. 
Again, i'm very plain jane so i get plain or scallion! They have different sandwiches and meats/cheeses but I have yet to try them! There's also a variety of cookies and even coffee cake (YUM!).

The place is never really busy (at least whenever i'm there) so we get our pick of tables to sit at. The wait isn't too long, maybe 5 minutes tops. I also think the staff is great here, very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. 

Now I don't know about you, but I LOVE cream cheese. These guys give you a hefty portion of cream cheese when serving you and I love it!!! My boyfriend is the complete opposite, he likes very, very, very light cream cheese. Craaazy right? 
Anyways, I appreciate a warm toasted bagel with lots of cream cheese-y goodness :)
I have also tried their breakfast sandwich and its soooo good! Perfect greasy egg goodness with cheese and bacon on a toasted bagel....YES! I recommend this place to everyone. It's my favorite bagel spot, and reminds me of home. :)
