Ok came here Mayweather fight weekend so I'm a little late writing my review, let me first say we had the best waiter ever.  I don't know how I forgot his name, I'm bad with it don't judge me LOL.  But, anyway he was very tentative to our needs he recommended several things that we ended up trying, the Green Chile Smothered burrito, Shrimp & grits, Urban Chopped Salad & There Famous Mac & Cheese.  Everything was sooooooo good, well worth the money.  I'm going back to Las Vegas this weekend for my birthday so I for sure will be returning here on my visit.
