I guess the confused looks on our faces gave it away that we were first-timers! The cashier warmly greeted us and gave us a thorough introduction to the menu. This place does hot dogs (and other things) every way imaginable. All of the hot dogs have cute names. Hubby and I both went for the Char Heel Dog that had house-made chilli, slaw, diced onions (we skipped because we both had to go back to work) and yellow mustard. And you can get an all-beef dog! We both made ours combos; fries with cheese for me and tater tots for the hubby. Everything tasted great. And...they give a discount to CHS employees. Score!
