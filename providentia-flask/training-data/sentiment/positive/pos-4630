LOVE their gluten-free menu. I felt pampered and catered to instead of merely accommodated. Delicious, intriguing flavor/texture/ingredient pairings that really stand out from the crowd. And did I say delicious!? I've been here twice in the last couple months (I hop around a lot), and had the Fall Leaves Salad, the Wild Chop Salad and a Fall pasta offering that's not on the menu at the moment. I would go back and have any of them again, and there are 4 or 5 other menu items I can't wait to try, too! I love that they serve the hummus with veggies for gluten-free folks - it's on the menu! Friendly, cool vibe - got to go back!
