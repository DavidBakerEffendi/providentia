We absolutely love this restaurant!  We usually frequent it during happy hour or before a movie, and enjoy the nachos and/or quesadillas.  We ALWAYS have exceptional service, and most recently, Suzie has been our server in the bar area.  She's the most pleasant server we've had in a long time, and I felt she deserved to be mentioned here.  

In addition to remembering what we drink each time, she's always quick to ask us if we'd like another before we have to ask her. Also, if we request a side of hot sauce or ranch or anything else, she or another staff member are always quick to bring it to us.

The other staff members are equally friendly and helpful, and the food is always fantastic. Being vegetarian, it isn't always easy to find quality meat-substitutes, especially in a sports bar and chicken restaurant, but BWW has a tasty selection served with a smile.

Thanks, BWW, for always assuring a great experience with a super staff and excellent food.

We'll be back!
