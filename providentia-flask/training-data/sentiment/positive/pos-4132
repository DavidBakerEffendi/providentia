My wife and I were delighted that Served is open for dinner along with happy hour (which alas we missed).

We LOVE the food for breakfast and lunch and had a wonderful meal for dinner.  I had a BLT with avocado.  I didn't count but there must have been 8-10 pieces of bacon and the heirloom tomato was amazing.  My wife had salmon tacos which were just terrific.

We had chicken wings as an appetizer.  They were with a somewhat asian flavor and without a doubt the best I've ever tasted.  (Of course, this is my reaction to most of what I've been served, at served).
