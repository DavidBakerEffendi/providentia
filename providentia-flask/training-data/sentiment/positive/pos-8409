Rush was a great experience from the get-go. When we arrived, the FREE valet service took our car, then we were quickly greeted by staff at the door. The staff then took us on a short tour of the restaurant, including the bar/lounge space, the two private dining rooms (which can be separate or joined to seat up to 28 people); the private chef table in the back next to the kitchen (which can be booked) and the amazing glass encased 3500+ bottle wine cellar with private cellars for investors.

A nice touch is the in-house created sparkling water, served in tall bottles. The food options were well balanced for both meat eaters and vegetarians. You can choose from a tasting menu with or without wine parings or from a selection of starters, middle and main courses.

Things began with an amuse-bouche and cocktails. Then onto our dinners which were fantastic. The service was amazing throughout with multiple staff serving the table and timing all arrivals and departures with grace. The dessets, coffee and tea were a great way to wind down the evening.

It's not a cheap night out, but you certainly get what you pay for.
