Party of 18. Just as we are deciding our orders the computer system crashes. All orders taken by hand. They handled it very well. All orders were accurate and once submitted ready in a very decent amount of time. 

Very good burgers. Warm inside but crispy on the outside fries. Will definitely be back again and again. Will definitely try the kobe beef burger. It looked delicious when I saw it on another plate. 

Nice environment. Some kid entertainment. Spacious seating. and very reasonable prices. 5 stars well deserved.
