Stopped in while I was waiting for my tire to be changed at Discount tire which is across the street. What a great place! I was pleasantly surprised. Great happy hour great prices and the truffle fries, mahi tacos and the Kobe sliders with Gorgonzola cheese OMG! So good. The portions are large and very well priced. I will be back for sure! Our waitress Sherry G was fabulous.
