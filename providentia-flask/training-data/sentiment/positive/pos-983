I always overlooked Canyon as a place to go for drinks and/or dinner but I'll definitely keep it in mind now. My family and I came here for lunch one day and we were all very happy with the food and service. My dad ordered the garlic shrimp ravioli and the rest of us all got prime rib which was AAA+ Perfectly seasoned and cooked medium rare resulting in a juicy a** piece of meat. My parents don't typically like Canadian food as it's usually bland and crappy but were still raving about their experience days later. New family go-to brunch spot!
