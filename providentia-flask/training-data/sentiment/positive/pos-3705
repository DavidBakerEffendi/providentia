The worker there was so nice. I had a child with me at the time and she made a little bit of a mess with a cookie. Who am I kidding, she made a huge mess. I asked for a broom to clean it up off the floor. The worker looked at me confused and was like, "thank you so much for offering, but we got it." They were so nice about the child and the cookie that I went back the next day! (And ordered a less crumbly cookie.)
