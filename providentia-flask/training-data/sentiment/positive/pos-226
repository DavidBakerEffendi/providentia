Entering the building, I knew I made it to Heaven. The fragrant aroma of chocolate hit me instantly and put an immediate smile on my face. If you are looking for dessert, I highly recommend coming here. 

They had a special dessert that looked like a chocolate dome and they drizzled hot caramel on top that melted the dome to uncover gelato underneath (I spied this from across the way and vowed to return with my husband to experience it first hand). Talk about beauty, creativity, and entertainment on one plate. Unless you have an insatiable sweet tooth, I recommend sharing. The portions are huge and the sweetness is, well, a rush of sugar. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I wanted to order everything on the menu. Instead, I opted for the staple crepe topped with strawberries, bananas, drizzled with Nutella and a side of vanilla gelato. When the order arrived, I felt like I was on an episode of "I'll have what Phil's having" (if you haven't seen it, it's on Netflix and pure joy). 

In the states, places like this would have a line out the door for hours, seriously, hours. This place was convenient to enter, immediately sit at a table, and order. I was able to take all the time I wanted to enjoy and relax and eat chocolate to my heart's content.
