Dinner at 830 Saturday evening 06 Aug 2011, and once again we were not disappointed. To start, we shared the fish and game board, which in this month's version included boar pat√© and bison prosciutto; for mains my son ordered the pork chop, my wife chose the sablefish, and I asked for the steelhead trout. For desserts we tried the apricot cake (wife), panna cotta (me), and fresh peaches on vanilla bean gelato (son). All good. Our server suggested a wine we'd never had before, a biodynamically-grown chenin blanc from the Loire -- 2009 sec Domaine Huet Vouvray Le Haut Lieu, which paired well with the sablefish and trout -- starting off-dry and trailing with a subtle acidity. River Cafe previously introduced us to wines that have become some of our favourites -- another reason we love the place so. Yes, it's on the spendy side, but we were (belatedly) celebrating our anniversary. Worth it.
