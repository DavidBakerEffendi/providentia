Really friendly and helpful staff.  Delicious food!  Spices that are extremely inexpensive (I got a bag of star anise for like $3 with tax, and had about 5x as much as the star anise at Vons ~ and Vons charges almost $10 without tax for it);  they have cinnamon from Sri Lanka (which is hard to find in general!).

While I will say "don't expect a high class establishment," I'll add "do expect some absolutely fantastic food, spices, and prices."
