My favorite Italian/bistro!!  It has everything!!  Great ambiance, great outdoor patio area, super friendly wait staff!!  Wish it was closer to my home. But definitely worth the drive!!  I stop by every time I'm in this area!!  Have never had a bad meal and the garlic bread is amazing in itself!!  Kind of hidden from the Main Street (Shea) hope everyone gives this awesome place a try!!
