This place is so good. The skillets are by far the best I've ever had. They make a new batch of coffee cake when they run out and it's always a different flavor. I wish I had known that before I came because I ended up with strawberry peanut butter and it was definitely very different. It wasn't bad but it wasn't what I was expecting. This little place is about 5 minutes from the strip and it was packed when I came on a Monday morning
