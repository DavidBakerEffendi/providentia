The food was amazing the paneer ticka was spicy and full of flavor and the curry French fries were amazing 

We also had the Samosas and the pistachio ice cream. I wish they offered the calaflour dish everyone was talking about on yelp. 

Can't wait to go back really reasonable and the   chief was friendly and really made sure we enjoyed our food.
