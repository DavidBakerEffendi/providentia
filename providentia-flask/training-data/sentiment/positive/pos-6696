Yoli's Cafe was such a delight - and cute as a button. We walked in and were greeted by a very polite waitress. Our drinks were brought immediately, and lunch followed shortly thereafter.

What a quaint restaurant tucked off the beaten path in downtown Chandler.

I can't say enough about the quality of the food. The applesauce was the freshest, the egg salad sandwich the tastiest, and the fries (my wife let me sneak a few of hers) were the most fresh-cut.

Absolutely recommend and plan to be back - I'll never get enough of that egg salad
