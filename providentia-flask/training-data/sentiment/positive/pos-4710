Donuts always taste better with a big dose of atmosphere. Ideally, you want your donut to have character, a story to tell. And, the orbs at Donut Hut have quite the narrative, and yes, they are delicious. Plus, they have these overnight hours, an interesting, but apparently common feature of a mom and pop shop. When it's time to make the donuts, they open'er up.

I was bummed not to find wood paneling. However, there were walls filled with photos of the owner in full soldier gear posing with all shapes and sizes of American enforcement, from military to police. If they wear a uniform, he has posed with them. In most of the photos, he carries a sign that announces he owes his life to America. He is Cambodian. He was not there, so I do not know the whole story. My imagination believes it must be an epic one. 

Stop #3 on our donut crawl, and the standard glazed were all gone, so we went with the glaze twist. I'll just say I am ready to twist again! The dough was not too dense, and their glaze had a distinct flavor that stood out compared to other glazes. Not sure if there is a secret ingredient... maybe it's patriotism. 

I saw a sign announcing French crullers on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, so if that is your vice, take note.
