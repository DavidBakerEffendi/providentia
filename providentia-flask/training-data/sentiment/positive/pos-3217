After a long day at Wonderland we decided to grab a bite to eat, outside of the park. I pulled pulled up yelp and saw this place had great reviews, and that they have pupusas. I was SO EXCITED. I haven't had a pupusa since I left Austin. I tried to temper my expectations since the majority of the mexican food I've had since moving to Canada has been depressing to say the least. I was so pleasantly surprised. He took the time to explain the ingredients, which was funny to me since obviously I'm familiar, but I didn't want to be rude and interrupt, lol. Food was fast, he gave us complimentary chips, and everything tasted great. It will be our go to in the future for when we're at the park.  The only thing I'd change is having fountain drinks or at least the availability of non bottled water.
