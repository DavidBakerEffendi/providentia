My husband and I went to the Arrogant butcher for our 1 year wedding anniversary! We had never been there before and we truly wouldn't have wished anything different about our evening. 
Our server Gino was absolutely amazing, he was informative, nice, (Not arrogant like tons of the other comments) and check on us regularly. 
We got everything he recommended other than an old fashion because im pregnant and every item of food we received was just amazing. 
Another server by the name Kelley overheard us talking about our anniversary and went out of her way to inform Gino, he then took the liberty to go the extra mile and offer us a desert on the house to share. 

My husband and I are always hesitant to go to "expensive" restaurants because he never leaves full and its just never worth the 100 dollar tab including tip but Arrogant Butcher WAS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!


We share aged cheddar and Cobba meat? I believe that was the name
I got the ribs and my husband got the New York Steak and both were top notch. 
My husband said the best steak he has had at a restaurant including the keg.


Thanks Arrogant Butcher, Gino, and Kelley for making our 1 year anniversary awesome.
