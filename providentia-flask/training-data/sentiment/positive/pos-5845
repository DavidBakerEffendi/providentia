This place is fantastic!! I came by here and did a to go order and the server was very friendly and wanted to make sure my food was correct. I got the pud kee mao with beef and a spring roll. Spring roll was delicious and crispy. The pud kee mao was delicious. Huge portion and cooked perfectly. I 've been here a few times without any issues. I've never had to wait long, I've never had bad service and the food is always good!!
