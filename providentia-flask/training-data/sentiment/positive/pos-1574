I tried this place for the first time and will definitely go back. The filet and prime rib were something special.  The flavor of the grilling technique is some of the best.  I love that you get a whole dinner not alacart. The service was alittle on the slow end but the chef makes up for it.  New favorite spot and the ambiance is very cozy and inviting.
