This is identical to the review I just wrote about the Charleston Location. I used to live close to this location and when I wanted to treat myself, I came here. 

I don't know what you want me to describe, they have every kind of donut. Personally, I go for the twistys and the bars, it seems like you're getting so much more for your dozen. Can't argue the jelly filled, either.

This is as good as comfort food gets, America! they have good coffee that isn't over 5 dollars and they have a unique concept. They sell drinks Small, Medium and LARGE. You don't have to feel stupid about getting the pronunciation right of what size you want.

This chain has better prices of the other 2 chains you've heard about. Those chains got big from marketing and being the new big things in town. Ask your parents where they got their donuts and ask them if they kept the same quality. 

Yes and YES.
