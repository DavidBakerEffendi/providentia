This inconspicuous little place is a hidden gem and is an excellent place to lunch.

Inexpensive Caribbean-themed menu with many choices including curried shrimp or jerk chicken tacos. 

Lots of vegetarian choices as they have vegetarian Chorizo and bean options.

I like the Mexican coke in glass bottles made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup. They also have other Mexican bottled beverages that you wouldn't normally encounter in Pittsburgh.

They've expanded their menu recently to include more entree sized dishes. This place is not for everybody but for us it is a home run.

5 stars for the price, variety, and quality of the food.
