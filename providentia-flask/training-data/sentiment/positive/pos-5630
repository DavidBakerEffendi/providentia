I know I'm a sucker for desserts but their gelato is definitely an art form.  Thanks to Nelson and Sylvia for taking us here.  The strange yet delicious variety of gelato here really took me by surprise.  Jalape√±o in gelato? Salmon in gelato? What weird dessert dimension did I fall into?  I would have never guessed how wonderful the combinations of flavors would be.  Of course there are the usual flavors such as vanilla or chocolate, but they let you sample anything! I settled on a small cup of half coffee and half caramel.  I know it sounds plain comparatively to the other flavors they offer...  but I still loved every bite!  

My taste buds didn't stop there.  I had a small cup of their hot chocolate.  It's not like a regular hot chocolate at all.  It's a thicker consistency and very rich in flavor.   I would almost describe it as a hot chocolate shake.  I know.  Sounds different but it was also fabulous!  

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already.   You'll become a regular before you know it!
