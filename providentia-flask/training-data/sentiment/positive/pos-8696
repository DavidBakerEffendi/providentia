I am totally stoked!!! I remeber in my past review on the one in hillsboro oregon saying they didnt have on ein vegas!!! I am sooooooooooo hapy they do!! I LOVE the garlic sauce they use for the veggie delite and it also comes in family sixe which is XL lol!! Of course i got it and since i have been craving the tar out of it i ate 3 huge pieces!!! DELISH! the delite is my favorite, cuz they have thin crust and tons of toppings...Fresh toppings!

I learned tonight to call them ahead of time for a to go order cuz this place was packed!!! another thing is they give military discount!!! That is ALWAYS a plus! :D
