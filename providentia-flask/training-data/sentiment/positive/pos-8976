Big Guys has done a fine job making a "strip mall bar" a potential favorite. Service was fast and friendly. I did not eat, but friends did and the food looked and smelled high quality. Drinks reasonably priced and good pours. Eclectic crowd... Though gentle mannered and quite a bit of fun! Bathrooms were clean and uncrowded. Flat screen TV's had a variety of events. The open atmosphere and overall cleanliness had a welcoming feel. The tables, however were mildly sticky with paint. 
If you like a non-"clublike" bar with a chill feel this place is for you. Good crowd for a Thursday and seems to fit "all walks of life". Have a pint of a great beer selection and cheers to ya!
