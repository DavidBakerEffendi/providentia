Metro Pizza is home to the stuffed pizza, two pizzas one in top of the other created a giant calzone. The prices are high, but the amount of pizza you receive is unbelievable. It really is like eating two pizzas. Plus, the bread you receive before your pizza is to die for!

The joint is always very clean with kind and intelligent employees and is nicely decorated on the inside. They offer takeout and delivery and have a gelato case.

Tips:

-- Between 2 and 4 PM Monday through Thursday, pizzas are half price for dine-in customers. We always order a large and take the rest home. Slices freeze well when wrapped individually in saran wrap.

-- At 7 AM on Black Friday, the store opens to sell gift cards at 50% off. There is always a long line so be sure to arrive early. Each person can buy up to $250 in gift cards (an $800 value). When they sell out, they sell out and the rest of the line goes home disappointed. 

So, if you get the 50% off gift cards and go between two and four Tuesday through Thursday, you're getting a gigantic pizza at only 25% of the price.
