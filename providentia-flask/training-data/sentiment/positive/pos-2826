Probably my wife's second favorite Korean grocery store!  Only outdone by H-Mart in Tacoma or Federal Way, Washington which is a very long ways away!  Any time we come to Vegas she makes us stop here literally every day that we're here with a longer stop on the last day so she can completely load the entire car up for the trip home.  They have an excellent selection of Asian groceries, fresh produce, seafood, and house wares.
