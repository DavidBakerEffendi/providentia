This is a MUST stop for everyone visiting Las Vega$ (first timers, regulars, etc) because each (free) show that runs is always different. The beautiful fountains play and dance to a different song each time and really makes for an amazing show (occurs pretty regularly, believe more frequently in the evening then the day). 

Real random, but in the movie Ocean's Eleven (this movie was good, just not the sequels) at the end, you see almost all of the main characters watching the Bellagio fountain. And for some reason, that special part in the movie just always make me be reminded of the fountains here.. yea I know that was random. 

But anyways, love the dancing water show and always catch a show each time I come by to Vega$.
