I am a big fan. You walk in and are greeted by a chorus of "Welcome to Firehouse". If it is your first time there, they will take the time to explain the menu to you. I have become addicted to their Italian grilled chicken chopped salad. It has chicken and salami as the proteins. The salad ingredients are chopped and always fresh. It is on their low calorie menu and is substantial and filling. I recommend it highly. I knew I had to expand my horizons so I ordered the Captain Sorenson datil pepper sandwich. It has a grilled white meat chicken breast and is covered in a spicy but not overpowering datil pepper sauce. It is amazingly tasty. It is also on the lower calorie menu and comes in at under 500 calories. I have been back repeatedly and will continue to return. Good prices, good food and good customer service. A great combination.
