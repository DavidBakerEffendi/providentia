I've heard so many wonderful things about Kneaders and I finally got around to trying their famous French toast. All I have to say is yum! Thick slices of cinnamon bread with buttermilk syrup, strawberries and whipped cream. I absolutely adore this place! I highly recommend coming to try it ASAP. I know I'll be comming back with friends and family the next chance I get!
