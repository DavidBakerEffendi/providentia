I don't know anything about Korean food, but this food was super tasty. I had the korean fried chicken sweet, salty, and spicy; my Babe had the korean thin beef thing. Like I said, I don't know much about this food but it sure tastes good. Try it, it's fun that we have all these great ethnic foods to try in Madison.
