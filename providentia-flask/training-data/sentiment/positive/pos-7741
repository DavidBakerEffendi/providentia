This place is amazing. It's usually fairly empty but I think it's because ppl don't know about it. By fast, the best Afghan in the GTA. They keep busy with lots of catering.

Try the naushak and mantoo dumplings- they're very hard to find in Toronto and these ones are the best I've had. 

Owner takes pride in his restaurant. Everyone I've brought here loves the place.
