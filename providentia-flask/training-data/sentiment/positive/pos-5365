This was the best deal on a hotel I have had in my life. I had the 2 room large suite with hot tub next to the bed and rainfall shower for less than $200 a night. All the ground floor rooms have a patio and are less than 100 feet from the beautiful 24hr pool. The rooms have fancy artwork and look like they would cost $700+ a night. This is an easy way to impress your friends and stay in a luxurious hotel for cheap. The AC was all brand new and worked great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. When I arrived at the hotel, I spoke with Rosie at the front about a room upgrade. ROSIE WAS THE BOMB. She went way out of her way to accommodate all my stupid questions and even took me on a tour to show me all my room options. She really went above and beyond to help me decide on the best room option for my needs. 

However, there was one issue that needs to be addressed. The power outlets would not charge my iphone. I had a bunch of portable power supplies with me, and it charged those fine, so I just used those to charge my phone. The outlets charged my friends android phones just fine, so IDK why it wouldn't charge my iPhone. The outlets were also loose and the plug would fall out easily. So they need to fix that.

Other than the electrical issue, the room was amazing and at an amazing deal. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who travels with a portable power supply.
