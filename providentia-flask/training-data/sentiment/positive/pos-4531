When I first moved her it was hard to find good pizza that my daughter liked. This place has great pizza! Kids have fun and they have wine! So mommas happy about that!! Weekends are crowded with bday parties so we come during the week. The prizes are a good value for the tickets earned. I like when it's quiet and I can watch my daughter while I'm eating.
