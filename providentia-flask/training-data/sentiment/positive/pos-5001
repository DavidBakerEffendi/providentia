Busy on a Saturday night, but Sabz and her crew of nutty Québécois (and me!) were able to squeeze in and drink National dry. I'm sorry if you were unable to find National on Sunday morning, because we DRANK IT.

Oh, and FYI, the menu on their website is out of date. They actually *do* have a veggie burger on their menu and it's delicious! Crumbly and messy; I wound up eating it with a fork and knife, but that didn't take away from it's flavor. 

The music that they play on Saturday nights reminds me of my iPod!
