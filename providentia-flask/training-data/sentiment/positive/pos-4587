What a cute lil gem!

Under the recommendation of several of my yelp friends, I finally came here to try the gelato here. I like the interesting flavors this place offers. The day I came, I tried a sample of the basil flavor, yes you read right! Basil, as in the actual herb! and Yes, this store made a gelato out of it and it was very tasty. The other flavor I tried and loved was the pear and blue cheese flavor, and there was actually chunks of blue cheese in it that melted in your mouth along with the gelato base. I ended up getting a 12oz container of that flavor. 

I also liked the fact that none of the gelato is overly sweet, just like the authentic ones I have tasted all over Italy. And the owner is super nice about letting me try as many flavors as I want before deciding. Love it!
