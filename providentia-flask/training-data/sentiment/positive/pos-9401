If you've ever read any of my reviews, you know that I'm not that bright. So it shouldn't surprise you that I embarked on a 4.5 hour hike up a desert mountain with minimal supplies and only a few grapes for food. Or that I got lost on the way down. 

When I finally made my way back to civilization, I was what I like to call "Angry Hungry," Or, "hangry." Meaning, if I didn't eat anything soon I would have to hurt someone.* 

And even though I had reservations at a lovely French bistro later that evening, I knew what I needed, right then and there: a Double-Double, Animal Style. 

It was served with a genuine smile, which I rudely ignored in favor of immediately tearing into that burger like it had called me Stuart.** It was animalistic, indeed. And this thing was not only the best fast-food burger I'd ever tasted, but also a damn good deal at $3 and change. 

I don't always eat fast food, but when I do, I prefer In-N-Out.

*Or more likely, weep uncontrollably until my mommy made me a snack.
**I hate being called Stuart.
