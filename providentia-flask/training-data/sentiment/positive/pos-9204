Online ordering is great. I can order my food and set a later pick up time. Also I can set the flavor and numbers  of wings up to a certain amount of choices. I see the same manager there most of the time. Employees are always nice and he makes sure the orders are right. I was waiting for my order to finish and I saw him check the receipt and the order was wrong. He quickly threw away the bad food and replaced it correctly fast. Also I was five minutes late from my pick up time and they gave me a call to make sure that everything was ok. I have started to choose wing stop over Buffalo Wild Wings now.l because they can't get their act straight in NLV.
