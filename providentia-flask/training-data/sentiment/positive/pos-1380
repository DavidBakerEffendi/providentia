This place is great! I knew from the door at the enterance that I was going to love it. I took my dad here for his bday dinner and we were not disappointed. I had the Morris Ramen with a Spice Bomb added "recommended" and my dad had the Spicy Ramen. Both were delicious. Great pork belly and soft boiled egg in the Morris and tasty marinated chicken in the Spicy. We also each got a Pork Bun, which I would order 2 for myself next time as I just wanted to keep eating them. Drinks are also good. Total bill was reasonable for what you get, 2 giant bowls of ramen with a ton of toppings, 2 pork buns, and two signature cocktails for $55, not bad!
