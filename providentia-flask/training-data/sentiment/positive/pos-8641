a bit of a drive for us, but this was well worth it. we met a fellow foodie couple here. they have cool seating, with all the tapestries and low seating, but we opted for a table because i'd gots bad knees. i had a spinach casserole type dish and it was abso-smurfly delic. my girl had another veggie dish was also quite awesome. and the cabbage salad that came on the side was incredible. we also ordered a sampler appetizer and i loved everything on it....a little hummus and a few other items i don't really know because it was all in turkish. i wanted a turkish coffee but the waitress said it was very strong and since i have an early bedtime, i waited on that one. 

great food and our waitress was super attentive...something i've really come to appreciate as i've "matured". 2 entrees, an appetizer for 35 bucks. not bad.....
