So Brandon is a big reason why this is 5 stars cause honestly I am probably too ignorant to be a sushi critic but I loved the variety and cost not to mention vibe of this place .. they have tv to watch if you're alone (yeah that's me solo rider ) mainly since I can't use chopsticks to save my life lol but they have the trainer ones which Brandon was sweet enough to call them instead of my friends who call them kids chopsticks .. listen y'all I'm
Left handed and life is hard lol anyway the sushi was fresh and came out fast .. I was on a time crunch before seeing planet of the apes it's so cool the theatre is close by so I stuffed myself like a pig and went to the movies lol ... Soda is unlimited refills me they have sooo many cool rolls especially just the way the names make you smile .. appetizers are delicious and most of all service at least with Brandon was pleasant and awesome .. for north town this was a win
