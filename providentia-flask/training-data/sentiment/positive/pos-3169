This casino is PERFECT!!  The Silverton is a nice sized casino..Not too big like most on the strip..It has a very cozy atmosphere that isn't too crowded as well! The slots are all so fun to play and I win every time I gamble! Goldfish 3 and the Big Bang Theory slots are my favorites and pay very well..I won $175 the other day on only $20 put into the machines! The buffet here is delicious and they even have a Starbucks!!! I'm a Silverton card holder and that most definitely has its perks!!!
