Tried this little pizzeria with my wife after reading the reviews, I gotta say it's some of the best tasting pizza we've had in a while. Very nice tasting dough, the right crisp and the right amount of chew. The toppings appear to be more traditional, not bastardized Canadian or Hawaiian type stuff you find at pizza pizza.

The girl behind the counter was super friendly and pretty too!

Good eatin.
