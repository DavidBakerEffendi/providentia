Phillys Famous I am a bit behind on reviewing for this place. The bread is very fresh, vegetables nice, crisp. The belly rub is a very filling, great tasting sandwich. Cute little diner feel on the inside. I have called/ordered takeout from here and have never had any problems or mix ups, but I'm sure their customer service is fantastic with such a nice family team working on the inside. Get yourself some good philly cheesesteak made with love right here!
