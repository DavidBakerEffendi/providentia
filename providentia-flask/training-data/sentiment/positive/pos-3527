So I typically don't review a Denny's, but the food is way better lately. More specially Jeremy, the server has an energy and level of customer service typically reserved for restaurants with 4 dollar signs not 1. So the 5 stars, due 90% to the amazing service from Jeremy, and we now frequent and ask to only be seated in his section. And the other 10%? Kudos to the chef in the back for producing some pretty decent meals that 5 years ago I wouldn't have ever concluded came from a quick diner.
