Tiny curtain's open, and we heard the tiny clap of little hands
A tiny man would tell a little joke, and get a tiny laugh from all the folks
Sitting, drifting around in bubbles, and thinking it was us that carried them
When we finally got it figured out, that we had truly missed the boat

I was thoroughly impressed with Chef's tasting at ShinBay. Unfortunately, they shuttered their doors. Chef Shinji Kurita is meticulous about his offerings. He has a clear vision for each taste/item/course that he presents. He is strict and doesn't allow for common additions such as soy sauce or wasabi...items are to be enjoyed the way he intended them to be. That would turn some off, but I appreciated his precision and intent.

I only write this brief review to acknowledge the incredible meal we were privileged to partake in and to direct well deserved attention to Chef Shinji Kurita. Keep an eye out for any ventures he is a part off in the future.
