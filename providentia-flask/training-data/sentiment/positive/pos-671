This is one of my favorite places to eat. I have gotten lucky with service so far, maybe because they recognize us most of the time since we go here so often. The water is cute, it comes in a large glass jar. 

There is a large menu with choices that range from fusion foods to Korean dishes. We always order chicken. The supreme and soy garlic are our two favorite sauces for the chicken. You can always ask for the sauce on the side. We also tried their kimbab, the shrimp one is the best, so try that one out. Their bulgogi and bacon/potato pizza are really good too, but I wish the crust tasted a little bit better. The toppings are definitely what makes the pizza stand out. 

I'm not really sure what comes with the side dishes, but so far we've always gotten them. The side dishes are really good. I enjoy eating the fish cakes a lot. They change everyday so it never gets boring. Plus there are free refills on all the sides! 

This place is definitely worth a try. I highly recommend it!
