I'm a California Native and there is more of a nostalgic connection I have to In-N-Out Burger as I basically grew up on it. Their menu is ridiculously simple, prices are inexpensive, their ingredients truly are fresh and their atmosphere, no matter which store I go to, is always pleasant. My meal is pretty much the same every time, a cheeseburger with grilled onions, animal fries, and a regular drink. I sometimes add a Neapolitan shake on top of that, from their not-so-secret, secret menu. Always hits the spot for me!
