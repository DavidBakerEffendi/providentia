Amazing food with superb customer service! The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks ; he was able to answer all my questions and didn't rush at all.  

For appetizers, we went for the Shrimp Cocktail and Spicy Southwest Shrimp - which was my favorite!!! I could of had the Shrimp as a meal, it was that delicious! 

I ordered the Filet with a Loaded Baked Potato, and it was definitely LOADED lol. I loved it!! The meat was tender and had so much flavor, I didn't need any sauce. 

For dessert, I ordered the Milk Chocolate Souffl√©, which took 10 mins to make, and well worth the wait. We also ordered the Sorbet - consisted of 3 flavors (Mango, Lemon 'Lemonade' and some sort of berry) with fresh strawberries and berries. Amazing. There was nothing left at the end lol. 

Will definitely be back soon!
