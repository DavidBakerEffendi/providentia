I give them props - out of all the many poke / sushi burrito places that are poppin' up around town, they are truly memorable, and clean!!! Ordered my own sushi burrito bowl, basically ordered brown rice, my protein ( crab + paid extra for salmon protein), fresh toppings, and sauces. It is like the Chipotle line type of service. I also took a look at Ted's favorites, definitely something to look at when you're unsure of what to get. I have to say staff was super helpful, and nice. They get a thumps up!!! Couldn't see the board since I forgot my glasses, they do have a menu on their website, they're in the works for a paper one soon. Sauces were legit! I tried their poke wasabi, very tasty and unique. Only paid $10-$11 for my bowl which is a deal! Felt satisfied post meal, went to another sushi burrito spot and still felt hungry. A+
