They were filming Mob Wives here last night.  I got jealous they were getting complementary food the whole night!

Still though, the food... marvelous!!  Garbage Salad (silly name) is a must for a starting salad.  Artichokes, heart of palm, shrimp, salami... great, fulfilling salad.  Not foofy by any means.

No one has mentioned one of their specialties, the Barry's Steak.  It's a prime rib cap served with onions and shishito peppers.  My goodness what a delicious piece of beef.  Best prime rib I have ever had.

Now go try that steak and thank me later.  Arvin.  Out.
