Best sushi I've ever eaten in Phoenix!  I came here for lunch today with a friend.  At first we were a little confused by the set up because we were expecting a traditional sit down restaraunt.  At this place you either pick up a pre-packaged sushi combo or you order at the counter (at least that's how it works for lunch).

I chose their Sushi Combo A for $10.  It was a great value and came with 2 tuna and 4 salmon and a california roll.  One thing you will notice right away is that their rice is PURPLE!  Unique and interesting, although it really just tasted like regular rice to me.  They have an explanation for why the rice is purple showing on their TV monitor, but I didn't take the time to read it...

For the fish - the quality was EXCELLENT.  The tuna was a deep dark red and very moist.  The salmon was fatty, buttery goodness.

For the service - everyone was very nice.  The owner is very hands on and checks in to make sure you are enjoying everything.  He even delivered a flaming roll to one table, which was quite the show!

I will 100% be back here again.  Can I come back tonight??

The only con - no parking lot.  You will have to find a metered spot on the street, but there are a ton of them right nearby so it's not a huge inconvenience.
