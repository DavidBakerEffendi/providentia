WOW. We were experiencing a spring heat wave and were tired of wandering the streets of Mont Royal looking for a place to eat. I just pointed to Replika (thinking it was a bar or coffee and dessert shop) and said "I'M DONE WALKING. WE'RE GOING HERE."

Well, this was a stroke of luck! 

Since we are vegetarian, we ordered the Simit 2 (see another Yelper's pic of it!) and we loved the turkish bagel and the olive tapenade with the avocado! What a perfect mix! I have been craving it ever since and want to try to make my own version of it here at home (I now live in California.. so can't easily come back here to eat)

We also had the blueberry roll which was delish. I should have tried their turkish coffee along with it!

They also have free wifi, the code is on the board next to the register.

Loved the decor and chill vibe here.
