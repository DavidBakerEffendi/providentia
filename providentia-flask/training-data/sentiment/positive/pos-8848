Came because Jeremy Espinosa was the DJ, and quickly found out the food, and drink are fantastic.

We started with the the short rib, and the shrimp tacos. They were great! 

Next, we had these nachos with wonton chips. They were even better

Finally, I had 3 different drinks. Each one was better then the last. 

Overall I had a great experience here, and will be back
