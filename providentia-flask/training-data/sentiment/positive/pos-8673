I really like Fired Pie. This is not the first one I've been to, but it is probably the largest and most open. When we go, it never seems crowded. I hope this changes because it is my kids' favorite pizza place for design-your-own, thin crust pizza. 

Think of it like Chipotle for pizza (and salad.. but, who wants salad when you can have pizza?!?

My kids like the "sauce and cheese," which is about as simple as it gets: pick a sauce, pick one cheese. Done. My wife has modified that by going with "sauce and ALL the cheese... except gorgonzola" 

There are two tiers of pizza prices: sauce and cheese or BYO. So, you can pretty much put whatever you want on the pie if you want more than just one cheese.  

I have become partial to the pesto chicken, but I substitute bacon for the chicken and put some roasted peppers on it. The bacon crisps up nicely in the pizza oven and gives it a bit of a smokey flavor. 

Oh, get the lemonade.
