I'm so happy to be able to finally review this place! I'm pretty sure I'm the last Clevelander to go to the Happy Dog.  First of all, they get 5 stars simply for having Original Sin on tap.  Yum!  I'm not a hot dog fan.  The Happy Dog changed my mind.  I highly doubt you'll ever see me chowing down on a hot dog at Jacob's Field but the hot dogs at the Happy Dog are so well made and fresh.  I love the variety of toppings as well.  I look forward to going back and changing it all up again.  The tater tots!  I could give a whole 5 star review just on those delicious tater tots!  I look forward to returning!
