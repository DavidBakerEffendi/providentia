So my husband keeps raving about this place . It's a good ol Ma and Pop shop. Literally the Pop takes the order and the Ma cooks it. Because it is that good ol fashion made to order home cooking there is a little wait time. But it is DEFINITELY worth it !!!! I wouldn't go here if you're in a hurry . Anyways my husband went to grab me some take out. Their crepes can be made as a sweet dessert or savory dinner . I am a vegetarian so I had every vegetable they have there thrown in .  It was soooooooo tasty!!!!!!! I absolutely love this food!!!!!!! It kinda reminds me of eating breakfast and dinner at the same time . The inside is savory and the crepe is slightly sweet but not too much. The pricing is very fair also. It was about $9 a crepe and they are very filling . In fact I couldn't even finish it because I was so perfectly full. Anyways Tasty Crepes gets 2 thumbs up . Give it a try !
