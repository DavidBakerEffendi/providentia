Best wings ever....can't remember a better wing. The wings that won 1st place and 3rd place at the NC wing contest were fabulous. Seasoned and marinated. Crunchy fried drenched in sauce and then chargrilled....wow.... 113 beers I had the stop drop and roll twice. I have to visit 112 more times. Service was also great....Amanda did an awesome job explaining types of beers and procedures and recommendations.  Will be in Charlotte much more. Let's go Panthers. Televisions are at every angle you turn your head. Thumbs all the way up. Keep up the great work!
