I really enjoy the brunch buffet every time we go. Especially, when I always have BOGO by playing myvegas. :D

Eggs, bacon & sausages taste much better here than other buffets I've been to on the strip. Lots of variety of breakfast foods & lunch. 

Servers are on point when it's time to cleaning up. If you are thinking about going to a breakfast/brunch buffet in Vegas, Bellagio is worth it.
