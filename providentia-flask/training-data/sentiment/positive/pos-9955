Wonderful!  We had the sashimi/seviche sampler and the Churrasco Rio Grande (with linguica, brisket and pork).  Service was quick, the food was excellent.  We ended up receiving chorizo rather than the linguica with our sampler, the server quickly brought us the linguica in addition.  The sashimi sampler was really the highlight.  Complex flavors, but perfectly balances.  A great special night out.  The drinks were great as well.
