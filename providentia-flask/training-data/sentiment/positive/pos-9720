Loved this little hole in the wall! Don't expect any frills.  Great place for soup, sandwiches and the potato salad was the bomb.  The only negative is trying to get here off Independence. I almost died courtesy of an El Camino trying to pull into the parking lot.  But I'll risk it all again for that hot ham sandwich.
