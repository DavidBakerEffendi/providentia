First time to Lumiere last week and it lived up to what I had heard from my friends. This is definitely a special night restaurant however the prices are reasonable for the experience (a good return on investment!) making it a good "just because" choice as well.
I started with an Old Fashioned garnished with a beautiful charred orange peel (wish he had added a cherry too.) I ordered the Duck a L'Orange which was perfectly prepared - tender and flavorful but not overpoweringly "orange-y" like some restaurants do. It came with interesting vegetables which I always like.
My host ordered the special Steak au Poivre which was flavorful but not exactly pepper-y. It could have used more black pepper according to my dining companion.
My only slightly negative comment is that although I like the size of the restaurant, it doesn't feel exactly cozy - maybe it's the lighting? There also is no bar to speak of and often I dine alone and always want to sit at the bar rather than at a table. I don't know if I would go to Lumiere by myself for that reason.
I enjoyed Lumiere and will certainly recommend it.
