This is a whole in the wall place with great food at pretty cheap prices. They have really good onion rings. They have bbq slaw that isn't as good as RO's but overall the food is better. The ribs are so good they don't need sauce. Simple pork bbq sandwich is perfect. I put both the spicy vinegar based sauce and the tomato bbq sauce on it. My dad loves the hamburgers, and they are huge, but I prefer mine less done. They cook their burgers well done, but my dad says they are still juicy!

It's small and can get busy on weekend nights. There is no hostess, people just keep track of who is next in line and seat themselves when a table opens up. Cash only.
