I came here with my daughter for lunch one Saturday. We made it just before the lunch rush, so we were sat, and tended to quickly. My daughter ordered mac and cheese,  I had the mushroom masala pasta, and a bowl of the coconut chicken curry soup. The food was outstanding, the blend of flavors unique and delicious.  Portions were satisfying without being too big. Friends have been telling me to visit  Perfect Pear Bistro for quite some time now, and I'm glad I finally did. I can't wait to come back and try  more of their menu!
