Went here last month with my friend. We were so hungry! Greeted fast, sat down and a table we got to pick. Order the pou pou platter to start and it was amazing. Consisted of about 5 mini apps and two of each. For example, two spring rolls, 2 teriyaki wings... for dinner my friend got sesame chicken and I got moo shu chicken. Amazing, flavorful and can not wait to come back.
