This is my favorite pizza in all of Las Vegas. You can't beat these pizzas made right in front of you. You can see them stretch your dough to order and they use fresh mozzarella. It's a Neapolitan pizza and people assume it's like blaze or pieology, it's not. The dough is really thin and the workers let you know you shouldn't add more than 3 toppings or put extra sauce because it will get very soggy. They do have a crispy crust if you wanted to pile high on your toppings which cost $1.50 each. Anyway, I love the white pizza! It doesn't have the red sauce so it's really not soggy. If I get the margherita pizza, I ask for very light sauce. The toppings here are great, the spicy salami is the best. They have a pizza called the angry bee and it has the spicy salami, chills, and honey! It's the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. I like the Neapolitan crust. It's nice and chewy and has great flavor. The crispy crust is ok if you like the cracker like crust.
