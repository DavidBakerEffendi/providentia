Hot, New, Fresh! This place won't be a secret for long. Some of the sexiest and friendliest staff in the city! They are dressed to impress yet the atmosphere is suitable for dressy jeans and Blazers. Some even have on shorts just be sure to jazz them up. Joshua was our waiter and he took great care of us. We were able to learn the menu and felt right at home. Nick cooked up our food to perfection and offered up great convo while we waited. The drink menu is on an iPad, chic right? The food works through a lineup of organic flair ranging from buckwheat noodles to salmon. You choose your starch, veggies and protein. Unlimited as long as it fits in the bowl. You head to the iron where it's cooked up to meet your fancy. Don't rush to grab a large! I have a healthy appetite and didn't finish my medium!
