My husband and I ordered two plates - mixed shawarma plate and minced beef kebab (kefta). The shawarma meat was some of the best I've had across Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. You can choose your own sides - salad, grilled veg, rice, potatoes, etc - which is almost unheard of at a flat price. The minced beef kebab was made fresh to order. 

There are many wow factors;
1) well seasoned meat [by far the best I've had; they don't rely on sauces to flavour your meal (even though they have great ones)]! 
2) sides were delicious, fresh and generous
3) the price is very reasonable as you get an unusually large portion - I could only eat 1/3rd in one sitting
4) it's family run and offers warm, friendly service 

I didn't try the garlic potatoes but, damn, they looked amazing and the table next to us was raving about them. 

Come here.
You won't regret it.
