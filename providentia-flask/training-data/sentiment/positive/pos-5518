This is a must see attraction if you ever visit the Las Vegas strip! Day or night, the fountain puts on a show every fifteen minutes for onlookers to enjoy. I make sure to stop and marvel at the night time show because it's so mesmerizing. I love how high the water gets blasted into the air while the show is synchronized to music and lights. I can't wait to watch it again the next time I visit the city that never sleeps.
