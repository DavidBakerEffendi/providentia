Almost exactly the same as Roberto's, except it's called Fausto's. No major differences of note.

However, if you want a California burrito (fries and carne asada), don't order a California burrito. You'll have to order their Nevada burrito. The California burrito at Fausto's has rice and carne asada. The incorrect burrito naming is a bit blasphemous, but forgiveable because both are delicious.
