My boyfriend and I LOVE Squid Ink... It's our "go to" place for sushi.  The atmosphere is beautiful and trendy.  The staff have never disappointed in the dozen or so times we've been.  We love the squid and miso cod appetizers!  My favorite rolls are the Pokemon and the Seafood Dynamite, but we've had the opportunity to try all of them and they're all extremely delicious!!  We have also gone to their Peoria location and am looking forward to trying their restaurant downtown soon!   See you there!!
