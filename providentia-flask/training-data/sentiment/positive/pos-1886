One of my Fav Stephen ave eats n drinks 

Great Staff - Great food - almost everything they serve is awesome -

But I have to complain who the heck takes a picture of a giant Jug of sangria and not mention it. That should be a crime because 1. now i want to go get a giant jug of sangria with not knowing if its any good 
2. that's just a jerk move

YUP this place rocks!
