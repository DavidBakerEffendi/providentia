A wonderful experience on a Friday night. Came here with two friends for a late birthday dinner. We got greeted, got offered to hang our coats, and seated immediately upon arrival. Upon being seated, our waiter offered us sparkling or iced water, described to us the roughly half dozen specials for the evening, and told us to take our time. He refilled our water, checked up on us throughout the evening, and never rushed us to get out the door, even after paying.

We started off with complimentary bread and olives, as well as an amuse bouche (which was salmon tartare that night iirc). My two friends ordered off the prix fixe menu while I had a seafood saffron risotto and a creme brulee. The pan-seared salmon and the pieces of fish in the risotto were moist and delicious, and so was everything else. The portions were nice and there was lots of seafood in the risotto. The creme brulee was yummy but the cookie dough that came with it was so-so, it could have used a scope of sorbet.

I will be back!
