First time! I'm impressed with the staff and poke. I went twice in the first weekend. I didn't get there until later on the Grand Opening day but they gave a discount anyway! Both visits were togo.  The fish was delicious. The vegetables were fresh. I ordered brown rice one day and spring mix the next.  I tried a few sauces and loved them all.  I will definitely be back. Super convenient location for me. Finally something affordable, healthy AND DELICIOUS in that area. The staff make it 5-stars. They seemed so happy and were helpful. I love that.
