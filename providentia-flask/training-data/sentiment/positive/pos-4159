Stopped in for 2/$5 Tuesday Gyro Special and was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. Hubby and I decided to split the special. I was satisfied after 1 but he enjoyed his so much he decided to order seconds! 

Our server was fast and friendly. We found out they have many different league activities going on there from volleyball to pool leagues as well as electronic bowling, golf leagues. They also offer Keno. 

Stop on in if you're in the neighborhood. You'll be glad you did! They have a pretty deep menu, many daily specials, the food is always fresh and tastes great!
