My sister and I held our niece's bridal shower here a week ago and it was flawless. The staff and management worked hard to accommodate every request. A group of 22 women and not one complaint in the bunch. Our guests were asking if we knew someone at the restaurant personally because they were so friendly and attentive. The food was excellent, the prices reasonable, and the ambiance is gorgeous.
