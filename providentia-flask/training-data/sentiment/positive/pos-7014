This place is great! 

Found it from the glowing yelp reviews and it was spot on. 

Nice little shop with great items, the fresh pita bread was soo good. 

-Beef Shawarma Plate: nice portion of marinated beef, hommus and a nie little salad. It was good, tender meat, nice flavor and good portion. 

-Gyro Plate: Gyro meat was spot on, one of the best tatsing in Las Vegas, same sides as beef plate. 

The tahini sauce they have on the side is great, smooth texture and great flavor. They also have baklava as well, I didnt try it but everything else was soo good I would imagine it would be good too. 

I will be back for sure.
