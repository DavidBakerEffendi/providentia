First time here courtesy of Yelp Elite event.  I must say this place is bomb.com! I ordered the wing and finger combo with fries, Texas toast (big piece), and a drink.  With this combo you have 1 flavor, and the wings you have 2 flavors to choose from.  I had the PB&J fingers, I  actually liked this flavor. It wasn't too  sweet, it's a flavor everyone should try. The batter on the fingers are the best I've had! It was very crunchy, I believe they said they used chips in the batter.  For the wings I had lemon pepper and Lou and Ana. The chicken was seasoned very well and fried crispy. The Lou and Ana flavor had a kick to it. The lemon pepper was awesome! The owners and the staff were very friendly, professional, and informative. There's a ton of flavors and rubs to try.  I most definitely recommend coming here! I'll be back for sure!!!
