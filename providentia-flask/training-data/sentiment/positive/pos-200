Our first visit to the restaurant and we were beyond thrilled! 
-LOVE LOVE LOVE that we had a server trained in fine dining and gave an exceptionally level of service to our table for the duration of our dinner.
-Excellent food that while 'American' is non traditional and reimagined for tastes that appreciate culinary technique and new flavors
-Atmosphere was fantastic! So incredible what a developed vision of interior design can do for the dining experience. More restaurant owners should take note and pay a professional! 

HoneySalt gets it right on every level! We will return!
