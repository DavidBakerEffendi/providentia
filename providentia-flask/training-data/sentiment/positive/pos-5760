Tried this place for the first time ever tonight and damn, I am impressed! Being frequent diners at Lemongrass Café, we have always thought about checking this place out and finally got to do so earlier.

It's a pretty small place located in the same shopping center as Lemongrass Café and the Colonade movie theater on Eastern Road.

When we walked in the lady behind the counter asked if we wanted to order dine in or to go. We decided to eat there and check the place out. It is modest, but clean. I ordered the #17 Chicken (7.95) while my friend got the #22 Meat Combo ($9.95). We were only waiting 5-10 minutes max, when she brought our food out to us! Nice!

Omg. That chicken was so scrumptious! So, so ridiculously juicy and full of flavor! The white rice and salad with vinegar oild were nice compliments, but that chicken was so frickin tasty! There was a good portion amount too! (Check out the pics)

My friends Meat combo included bulgogi with kalbi. Wow! I already know what  I'll be trying next!

The service was attentive without being intrusive. Our drinks never reached the bottom before being offered a refill.

All this came to barely $21! (Not including tip). I cannot wait to come back very soon and for multiple visits to try more menu items and definitely get some more of that chicken!

An easy 5 star slam dunk! Loved it!
