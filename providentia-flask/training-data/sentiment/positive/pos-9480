Say hello to the place that has the second best pizza in the valley (Bianco is obviously #1).  I'm shocked that I did not know that this place existed and was very excited to have the opportunity to go here last weekend.  A great unassuming building with a great patio and a small interior space, this quaint little place dishes up some great pizza.  Thin crust with a wide variety of quality toppings (including smoked mozzarella, which is wonderful), the pizza comes out of the brick oven absolutely delicious.

If the pizza didn't already hook you, this place has a great selection of wines at reasonable prices.  You can order them with your meal, or order a bottle to go.  What more could you ask for?  The bruschetta was great, their salad was phenomenal, and they had one of the best tiramisu that I have ever had.

Our server was very attentive and friendly (and cute to boot), the atmosphere of the place was perfect for dates and groups, and I can't wait to come back here.
