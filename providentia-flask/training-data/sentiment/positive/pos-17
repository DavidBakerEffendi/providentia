This is such a wonderful little cafe! I was intrigued by the fact that it is a Turkish cafe.  Only ever having had Turkish coffee at friends' homes, I wasn't sure what to expect, and was delighted to find it just as good as the coffees I've had in the past.  They must put a lot of love into what they do.

All the goodies on display looked delicious, and I will definitely want to try them out on future visits.

The space itself is super comfortable.  Stylish in a relaxed way, a mashup of church basement chairs and vintage chic sofa, perfect for hunkering down to do some work solo or have a discussion with a pal.  There's a buzz about the place, without being particularly loud or too quiet.  It was just right.
