Visited Fri June 30 for dinner. Called to make reservations the day before. Very attentive service, this place is a perfect 5 star! 

Pros
The meal comes with an amouse bouche, don't drink the sauce it has a vinegar taste. 
Tempura moriawase came with 3 pieces of shrimp! As well as seaweed which I haven't seen before. 
Miso eggplant - The eggplant was very soft and tasty, a bit too much miso paste which overpowered the eggplant. 
Rainbow dragon maki -  Fresh and tasty, no complaints. 
White wind dragon - A specialty roll that is torched, a must-try. 
Lots of free parking available. 
You can order delivery from UberEats!

Cons
The server had a bit of a heavy Japanese accent making it difficult to understand at times. 
Edo doesn't have as much of a high-end feel since it's attached to Bayview Village and shoppers can see right into the restaurant. 

Protip - Sushi purists will say that sushi cannot be made with brown rice but my health is more important. Any roll can be made with brown rice for $1. I LOVE places that can make sushi with brown rice.
