I must first preface this by saying that I was fully aware of the "divey" atmosphere and poor service before I ever walked in the door. I went expecting a new dining experience that would be unique to the taste buds and fun for my soul. I got just that. The hot dog and tots were the best. The beer was great. The music was fantastic because it was not the standard Winking Lizard playlist. The juke box had all kinds of music I have never heard. Loved it. The patrons were a great mix of all sorts. My only disappointment was that I didn't have more time to spend there.
