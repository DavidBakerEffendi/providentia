I got made fun of last night for having never been to a Bob Evans... so first thing my friend and I did this morning was come to Bob Evans for breakfast. Our waitress was Barb and she was absolutely incredible. She had such an awesome personality, was super attentive, funny, and non judgmental with our craziness with ordering practically everything on the menu. They had a pretty wide selection of food too! We had a few bites of everything we ordered which was the chocolate chip pancakes, French toast, crepes (yes get these!!!), a customized omelette, and the candied bacon appetizer. YES IT WAS DELISH! We did end up taking most of it home but we will definitely be back soon!!!! Thanks for such great service Barb!
