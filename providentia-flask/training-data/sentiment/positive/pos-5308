Food is excellent!! First you get Crunchy Noodles with Sweet & Sour Sauce.  I had Walnut Shrimp with a delectable sweet mayo sauce on a bed of crispy cellophane noodles.  My wife had Shrimp Chop Suey combination with Won Ton Soup, Fried Rice and an Egg Roll.  Nothing was disappointing.  A gem in a small town atmosphere.
