Monday and Tuesday, full sized tacos $1.50 each (ground beef, chicken, shredded beef), and burritos $2.50 (green chile, ground beef, chicken).  Always delicious. Jalepenos are not overly hot for me, so I love them since i can taste the jalepeno flavor and my meal as I eat them together and my mouth is not on fire for a long time afterwards.  Ladies always very nice at register.
