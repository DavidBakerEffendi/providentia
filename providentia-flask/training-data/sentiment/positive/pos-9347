My son and I dropped in today after he had an eye exam in Chandler. I had read in my Phoenix magazine that BLD was one of the best breakfast places around. Since we were only about ten minutes from there, I decided to give it a try. What a fantastic find. Even though it was lunch time, we were seated immediately...a nice table in the back and away from the front door. Within a minute there was a nice young man who took our drink order (nothing alcoholic but that is available). My son ordered the fried chicken and waffles and I ordered the Monte Christo sandwich. I think it was less than five minutes before two mouth-watering plates of food were placed on the table before us. The fried chicken on my son's plate looked like two nicely battered chicken tenders. He was really thrilled that bacon was in his waffles. From the first bite to the last, he was nothing but smiles and praise for the food.

My Monte Christo instead of being deep-fat fried was French Toast with a delicious vanilla-imposed taste, piled high with shaved ham, raspberry jam, and topped with powdered sugar. There was a warm compote of maple syrup on the side. Also on the plate were fabulously good fried potatoes with onion. They were finely crisped and really hit the spot. They also came with a small container of ketchup. 

Both entrees with two soft drinks came out to around $30 which might seem a bit steep for lunch in Chandler, but believe me, it was worth every bite. 

Being that we live in Maricopa, which is restaurant starved, we will definitely make BLD one of our regular places to go. It's not a bad drive from Maricopa and for anyone in the East Valley, it's on the northeast corner of Germann and Power...close to everything.

WTG...BLD!
