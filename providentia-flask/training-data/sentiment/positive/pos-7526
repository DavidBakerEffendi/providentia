Closed on Sunday! :( 

Best Mexican food in Phoenix!! Total hole in the wall, can end up waiting a long time for your order and 90% of the time they mess up, so make sure you check before you leave. Or if you eat there you can always bring it back up. Order & pick up at the counter. 

They make the tortillas fresh and omg are they delicious. I always get a cheese quesadilla and sometimes a chicken burrito with green sauce (extra onions), enchilada style, with a side of sour cream. Super cheap and delicious.
