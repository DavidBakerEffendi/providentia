In terms of pizza, I really can't ask for more!! This is by far the best pizza I have ever had!!! It is a create your own pizza place. You select your thin or double dough and whatever the toppings that you want! From the ordering to getting the pizza ready only took less than 10 minutes! They were super fast! And the pizza was delicious! This is going to be my go to place for pizza from now onwards!
