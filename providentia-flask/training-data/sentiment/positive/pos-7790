I love this little cafe. It's close to home, serves food that is consistently amazing, and makes a fantastic dirty chai.

Nathaniel and Amanda can pretty much anticipate my order now that I've become a regular and always greet me with a smile. They obviously are passionate about what they do and that's refreshing!

Some mornings can be a little crazy: professionals with laptops and cell phones abuzz. If that's not your speed, wait till around 9am or try another day. I often see students studying here as well. :)
