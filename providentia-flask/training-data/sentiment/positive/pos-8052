Emporio rocks!  I stopped by after a so-so evening at nearby Seviche and loved it.   I sat at the bar (plenty of space) and ordered a Captain and Coke, a chicken parm meatball slider and the tater tots.   One slider and a side really was plenty of food and it was less than $10.   The meatball was tender and delicious and the bun was just enough - can't stand a slider that's all bun.   The tater tots were crisp and salty.   I spied on my neighbor's meal - a meatball sub with pesto and a side of mac and cheese - that's going to be my next order for sure.   Overall, a winner.  Not a big fan of the backless bar stools and the bar service was a tad slow (the place was packed though), but that's the only criticism that I could come up with.
