I work in the area and this is definitely the go to spot if you are craving some good quality sushi. The staff understand that lunch time sit downs need to be quick so you can ensure you can get back to work for your 1pm meeting. Other than the great service, the sushi quality is way above average for Toronto standards. You definitely pay a premium but it's worth it vs. AYCE. 

I will be back next time I have some time for a longer lunch ;)
