This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. With all the great reviews, I don't know why it took us so long to get around to going here. 

We sat in the bar area, which was less crowded than the main dining room. Our waiter, Alex, was right there waiting to take our orders. I try to stay away from mixed drinks these days, but the wine availability is very limited. So I decided to have a small (12 oz.) margarita. Because the kind of wines I wanted wasn't stocked, I was treated to HH pricing and my choice of tequila. It was the best margarita I've ever had, by a landslide. Not too syrupy, just the right amount of ice, and the slice of lime in the bottom of the glass kept it flavorful to the last sip. Next time I won't care about the wine; I'll just go straight for the hard stuff.

We ordered the flaming fajitas for two - chicken for my husband, Mr. Cluck, and shrimp for me. I was so happy to learn that we could have regular or black beans, rice or - be still, my heart - steamed veggies, and could choose two of those in any combination. I swear, in my next life I definitely WILL be a vegetarian! The veggies were a mix of many kinds, and fresh and unadorned, just as I like them. The black beans didn't taste like they came out of a can. The tortillas were the lightest I've ever tasted, which explained why the complimentary tortilla chips were light as air, too.

Those tortilla chips were accompanied by a dish of grilled onions and jalapeno strips, and two salsas and a bean dip. When I tried the bean dip I thought I tasted lard. I asked Alex, and he confirmed it, then asked if we wanted dip without lard. It was replaced before I could blink.

To top off the fabulous service and food, the background was my beloved Mariachi music, making me yearn for the good ol' days, when I was in school there for three summers and then visiting the country often twice a year. Juan's is that authentic, and I look forward to another visit very soon.
