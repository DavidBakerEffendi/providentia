I think this location is now called American Burger.  with the same menu plus a few additional.  I had the Southwest Salad.  Wow.  so savory.  Every yummy texture from the chicken to the crunchy lettuce and soft cheese and the tortilla strips, the dressing was out of this world.  My buddy built a burger on a pretzel bun and with tater tots.  I finished both for her!  I don't even love burgers or tater tots...but they were out of this world, and I ate them cold after they had sat for a while.

The service was friendly and helpful and this was certainly a five star experience.  In fact, I will go there tonight with my two sons.  I love this place.  Nom nom nom.
