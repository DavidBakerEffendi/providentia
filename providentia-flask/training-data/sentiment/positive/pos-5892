I'm typing this review as I eat.. that's how passionate I am about this food! It's kind of hard to impress me but man this food is amazing!! I got the chicken shwarma and I'm sorry to say but it blows pita jungle out of the water. The chicken is so fresh and tender the jasmine rice was a great pairing and the garlic sauce made it irresistible. I opted for salad as the side and that was great too! Service was friendly and super fast. I've found my new lunch spot!!!
