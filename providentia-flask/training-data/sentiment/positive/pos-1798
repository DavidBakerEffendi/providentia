If you are a pizza purist, you STILL might love this place. 

I'm a NY native and pretty picky about my pizza. So, if I want the "real thing," I have to get on a plane, or go to one of the few places that get it pretty close. 

MOD is not trying to be that kind of place. Rather, they give you EVERY choice you could want on a thin crust style in just a few minutes. 

Think of this like a certain sub shop or that burrito place that hollers welcomes when you walk in the door...only with PIZZA!!

They have some pre-designed pies, or you can tell your pizza production person EXACTLY what ingredients you would like to add to your pie. 

When customers enter, everyone proclaims an enthusiastic "Hello!" Or "Welcome!" They wave and smile like you are a long lost friend. Some customers even get in the act and holler greetings, too (we did). It's hard not to smile with all that love floating around. 

A group from work went for lunch. Since the pies are personal size, we could each get what we wanted and even share/taste each other's creations if we wanted. 

For my first time, I decided to go with a pre-designed menu item, so I had the Calexico. Appropriately spicy, it was just what I was looking for. Next time I'll be brave and design my own.

Our group decided that we'll definitely go back for lunch soon.
