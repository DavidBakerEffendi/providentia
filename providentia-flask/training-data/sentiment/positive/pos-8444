I really believe that an atmosphere can make or break a place...in this case I really appreciated all the design and staff decisions. It was like the place walked right out of pinterest .
I ate at the bar (to avoid the wait) with my friend and the service was just as lovely. The waiters are extremely trendy, flannels and facial hair. Great. 
The food portions are small but tasty, Ill definitely return.
