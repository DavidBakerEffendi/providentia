You can never go wrong with the keg. Came here twice during my trip to Toronto. The first time I got the chicken supreme. It came with garlic mash and brussels sprouts which I love. The second time i got the 10 oz filet mignon with a baked potato. The meat was perfectly cooked. The keg never lets me down whether in Montreal or Toronto.
