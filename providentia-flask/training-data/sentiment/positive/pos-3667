This place is innovative!  The moment you walk in, you realize this is not your typical indian restaurant. The building itself along with the marketing deserves accolades.  I found myself wanting to buy their tshirts.  The tandoori ovens are openly displayed and are quite a spectacle.  The menu is concise and you wont find saag panneer or aloo gobi here. What you will find is well executed "barbecue" chicken, delicious tikka masala sauce and nearly perfect naan.  There are no waiters, you order at the counter so its similar to a "panera" concept.  I cannot wait to go back and try the lamb and paneer.
