I have only tried little bites from this place but I must say that my Gf who generally has quite the discerning palate absolutely adores this place. Even though it looks just like any other food court Chinese food.

It is her comfort food which reminds her of home cooking I guess.

Whenever she has had a long day or just wants to waste away a Sunday she orders something - usually something called the "Ji Lunch Special" with hot and sour soup from what I hear over the phone and seems to enjoy it more than life itself. I think its chicken? 

So long story short - give it a shot and if you ever see me in there looking like a confused bumbling fool and asking to pickup a "Jiiiii Lunch Special w/hot and sour soup", don't laugh. I am just grabbing it for her and the people working there are already laughing at me enough!
