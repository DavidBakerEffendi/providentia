A few days ago I was having a crepe craving and we came across this spot. It's a little hole in the wall place, but it was surprisingly good.

The inside is a little empty..and white.. 

Everything is ordered through these pieces of paper. The crepes have all these fruit, filling, topping, and ice cream options. You circle what you want in your crepe. Same for the bobas.

I ordered a crepe with strawberries, bananas, Nutella, whipped cream, powdered sugar, and cookies n cream ice cream. It was bomb! 

We got 2 crepes, 2 bobas, and a large milk for $28, so the prices are fair. Service was friendly.

They have lots of frozen treats too. Chocolate cheesecake, chocolate bananas, etc. The only thing I recommend is having more savory crepe options. I only saw a few.
