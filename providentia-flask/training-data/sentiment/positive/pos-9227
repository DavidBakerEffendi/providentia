Still a great place to eat!  I always like to update my experience to "track" it.  Again, they have hit the top notch!  Very prompt service, food is fresh and servers and employees are always friendly and grafeful you are there and dining with them.  Of course I got the Lentil soup!!  It is fantastic!  And yes, I did go right for the Pitza I had last tme... the Hummus....Mmmmm, Heaven!  We did pass on the dessert this time, although, it was tough!
