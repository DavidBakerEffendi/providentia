I had a tough time deciding where to celebrate my birthday. There are so many good restaurants in Las Vegas. Well, I'm glad I picked Roy's. It was a first, and I wanted the place to be something I haven't tried before. They really go out of there way to make your birthday special. There was a card on the table with flowers announcing it's your birthday. I had several people walk by wishing me happy birthday, catching me by surprise. Towards the end, they took a picture of us and framed it and brought a delicious key lime cheesecake or something. Now on to the food: it was all delicious. I couldn't decide between the short rib or rib eye, two of my favorite cuts of beef. The waiter suggested the short rib, which we both got, He said that's was Roy's signature dish when he started. It was so good and tender. I loved the flavoring and the extra touch of grilling it in the end (they had to do that after it was braised). The mashed potatoes it sat on was also so delicious. Then, to end the night we got the chocolate souffle, which was heaven. Oh, and our waiter was very good and professional. I can't wait to go back and try other things if I can resist getting the short ribs again (I'm very bad at sticking to things that I like).
