This place is awesome! In fact the check for the place is sitting in frobt of me right now as I write this review; I couldn't even wait to get home. To begin with, the atmosphere is incredible. The colors and lighting are soft, warm, and romantic. The food is equally excellent. I ordered a green curry and it was the best I've had. Also, our wine, which our waiter helped us choose, was unbelievable. The service was perfect. Bon, our waiter was friendly and helpful without being overly intrusive. He seemed to genuinely care about making this the the best experience possible. I will come back.
