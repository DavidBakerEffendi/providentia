Food: The highest of quality ingredients. Generous portions. Skillful and artful chef takes standard Italian menu items and makes them extraordinary. The Neapolitan pizza (a high-temp fast bake style of pizza made famous in Naples) is the best Toronto has to offer. The Buffalo Mozeralla is amazing and generous...I had it as part of the Caprese salad which was so flavorful it needed no balsamic and came with a full dop (200 grams) of buffalo Mozeralla cheese. The mista salad was made with a balsamic reduction, and the eggplant parmigiano was fresh and outstanding. 

Decor: a small restaurant where the kitchen takes up more than half the square footage. Casual, laid back atmosphere, is nothing to rave about, but is decent and fits the fact that although the menu is huge, the place is really a pizza joint at heart. 

Service: Our waiter was excellent. So friendly, knowledgable, and very helpful. He seemed overworked and could have used more support from the seemingly large number of managers. 

Overall, I can't wait to go back again. I do wish they took reservations,  but their sister restaurant a few blocks west will take reservations.
