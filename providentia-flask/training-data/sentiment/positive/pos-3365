Been to Miami a lot of times and grew up in NYC and I know how Cuban food should taste.  And this is it,  unbelievable that you can find great Cuban food at a very low prices.  Unlike another Cuban restaurant that charges 3 times the amount that this place charges and the flavors are spot on.  From the cuban sandwich to the bistek milenesa.  If you have a chance and your in the area please stop by and order some food that will have your taste palettes  saying, " where have you been all my life, Lucy u hav sum  xplaining to do." you will not be disappointed.  And really the price!  Wow! Just like if you were in Havana cheap and really good.
