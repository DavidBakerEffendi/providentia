I'm always careful to keep my reviews in context, so let me first point out that even though I'm giving this place a full 5 stars, that should not be construed to mean it is better than the other finest steak houses near the strip.

But...if you want to try a old (1955) rustic, homey (was literally a house at one point) place off the beaten path, with simply the finest selection of beef that is expertly prepared at about HALF the price of other places that feature similar beef...then you're going to love it.

We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms that were most excellent.  The blue cheese dressing on our salads was home made and was simply excellent.  The garlic cheese bread was delicious.  THEN our meat arrived!  I had the 12oz Filet and my wife had the 16oz Prime Rib.  Both cuts were perfectly cooked on their large open grill and had a flavor and texture rarely experienced (and we go to a lot of nice steak houses...minimum 3/mo).  We finished up with a very good piece of Key Lime pie.

I noted that a lot of other people were complaining about service...I guess we just got lucky.  Our waitress could not possibly have been more on top of things.

So in summary...this place is not winning any awards for ambiance, but if you want a super fine piece of beef at half the price it would otherwise take, I highly recommend it.  We live in Green Valley about 45 minutes away, so I probably would not make the trip unless I was already out there for some other reason...but with meat that good, I'll probably find that reason.
