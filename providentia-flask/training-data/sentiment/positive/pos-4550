As a Korean-Canadian, I can validate that this place is serving authentic Korean style soft tofu soup. It is a Mom and Pop style chain located at Hurontario & Dundas. You can adjust spice levels, and they have different types (seafood, kimchi, beef). I always get the kimchi because I am not a fan of frozen seafood. The rice is purple but healthy and delicious. Not as starchy and unhealthy as traditional short grain Korean rice. A meal here will cost you $10 including tax. Other dishes on the menu include bulgogi and bibimbap which I haven't tried, but will be a safe bet if you dont like spicy tofu soup. 5/5 for consistent delicious food.
