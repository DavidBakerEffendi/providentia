I'm very selective about my Mexican food especially being from LA and living some years in San Diego. We've been here once before and it was good but I had only ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito. Today I ordered their carnitas and oh man were they good! The staff has always been very friendly but the guy in the drive through was really nice....wish I would've gotten his name to give him a shout out! I'll be back, only thing is I wish they had received beans instead of whole pintos but I can work around that!
