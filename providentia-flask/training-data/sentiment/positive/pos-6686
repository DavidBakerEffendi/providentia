Some call chicken "the tuna of the turf." I don't, and I tend to avoid those people at social events. They have names for everything and it gets annoying. Where's the boy's room? "The Throne Zone" is upstairs. "The Piss Palace" is down the hall. Ugh, shut up.

That said, I call Rotisserie Romados "the purveyor of the single greatest roasted chicken dinner I have ever had in my entire life, based on my level of hunger, state of sobriety and availability of Five Alive juice drink."

From the millisecond we stepped through the front door, the unreal aroma of those no-longer-egg-laying, piri-slathered, fire-kissed birds and fresh baked bread had us throwing 'bows to skip the line. In our minds, anyway. Other Yelpers talk about the pastry counter that tempts the poultry patrons, but I cannot comment. I wanted - nay, NEEDED - chiggin.

A mere 15 minutes and 18$ CAD later, we're presented with Styrofoam go-boxes overstuffed with tender white and dark meat, a mountain of crispy crinkle-cut fries and a surprisingly fresh salad of mixed greens tossed in a light (mustard?) vinaigrette. We sat, transfixed. I took a picture of chicken for the first time ever. We ate. My soul took a picture of chicken for the first time ever.

Remember those people that name everything? They might also be the type to talk about fleeing the States in times of political strife. "Can you believe Congress?," they'll say, "That's it. I'm moving to Canada." Whatever. Rotisserie Romados, though? Totally worth revoking your US citizenship.

Did I mention they have Five Alive in a can? The Qu√©becois need to adopt me, stat. I'll do windows!
