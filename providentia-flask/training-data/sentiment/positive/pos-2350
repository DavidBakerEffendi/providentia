Stopped in here with my mom for lunch while we were shopping. It is, like someone else mentioned, like a Chipotle for BBQ. That being said, I really didn't set my expectations too high. You don't go to Chipotle for real Mexican food, I wasn't expecting the best BBQ in the world. I was pleasantly surprised though, because we really enjoyed everything we had. You have the choice of a sandwich, burrito, bowl, or a few different meat plate options. We both got pulled pork burritos. My mom had beans, cheese, and rice in hers with beans and mac'n cheese as her sides. I had beans, cheese, and macaroni in mine, with macaroni and corn bread on the side. Both were delicious and completely different. The sides appear small but they pack a lot into those little cups. We both left stuffed and each with half a burrito wrapped up to-go. They serve RC cola products (like Big Red!) and China Mist iced teas. There was also a sign out front that noted they are applying for a liquor license, so hopefully soon you can get a beer with your BBQ! Decor was well done. Clean, but very comfortable feeling, and lots of tables both for large-ish and small parties. Service was excellent. Staff answered all our questions and were very helpful. They only opened this location a few weeks ago so I attribute some of the negative reviews to them likely being in the process of working out some kinks and training new employees. I frequent the shopping center so I will most likely be back.
