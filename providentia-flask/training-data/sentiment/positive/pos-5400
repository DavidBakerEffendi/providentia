I love this place!!! The food always tastes fresh....quality!!! If you choose to dine it, it's a quaint little place, almost feels like a family dining experience... Looks like a house inside. One of my favorite things, is they have call ahead ordering to go or delivery. The staff is very nice! Try this place!!!
