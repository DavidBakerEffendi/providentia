This is our favorite Vietnamese place! The  Pho is awesome, but the many other dishes that they offer are insanely delish!  Every time we go, my adventurous husband orders some crazy dinner from the back of the menu. Every one has been rich, spicy, and unbelievably tasty! If I had my way, I would never eat in another Asian restaurant! The service is always "spot on" and the food is my personal favorite!
