The original and the BEST place for soup dumplings at Arizona. It's local and it's super authentic! You literally see the ladies roll out dumplings right in front of you which is super cool to know it's made fresh every day! 

My family and I have gotten the soup dumplings of course, which is what they're known for! At super flavorful, super hot and steamy, and one of the best things you can eat on a cold day to warm you up! Shoot I'll even eat it on a hot summers day, they're that good! Probably 2-3 orders for 2 people if that's all you're ordering will suffice for a meal. 

There's also so much more on the menu too! We've gotten the cold dish that has pig ear and ham and egg and stuff, super good but super weird if you're not used to eating that Asian stuff!!! The fried pork buns are awesome too! The fried chive buns are amazing! The kung pao chicken is sooo flavorful and crispy! Oh also don't forget to ask for the free corn soup! It's bland but just add soy sauce, it'll make it good. Lol 

The only negative things, which I won't rate them on is it's a little small. Only sits around 40 people max. But it's mostly locals that come here! Also they're randomly closed on Wednesday's. Kinda weird and funny.
