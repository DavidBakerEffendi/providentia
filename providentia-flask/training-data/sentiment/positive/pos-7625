I have been coming to Sushi Tomo for years and they are very consistent with high quality Japanese & Chinese dishes!

I try to get at least one new item every time I come here, stretching my comfort zone far beyond when I first started dabbling with Chinese and Japanese. I can honestly say I have never got an item I did not throughly enjoy. Which is insane to me! 

I love that the green tea is served in a traditional Japanese tea kettle. I love how friendly the staff is, I love how delicious the food is. I love EVERYTHING ABOUT this place! 

Every time Sushi tomo comes up in a conversation I am quick to praise them! Do yourself a favor and get to sushi tomo if you have never been there or if you are having doubts about wether or not it is good because it is!!!! 

This place has the Will Koz seal of approval!
