It was at Fan Expo, some years ago, that I first head of Snakes & Lattes.  They're opening a cafe, Chris said, where you can play board games.  

How quaint, I thought.  I wonder how it will do. 

It has done... Okay.  

That's an understatement.  S&L's popularity has proven to be somewhat overwhelming on occasion. 

Let me back up, then, and go deep into the how of S&L.  They're at their core not a cafe.  That's the extraneous place.  At their core, S&L is a place to play games. They have several walls full of board games, from the simplest Parker Brothers creation to the most obtuse euro game you've ever (or, quite possibly, never) heard of.  

You pay a $5 cover charge, and get full access to their board game library until you choose to leave. 

Now, since it is also a cafe, you can get yourself a cappuccino or latte, or if you prefer a beer or a soda.  They also sell delicious sandwiches; the prosciutto with blue cheese is a personal favourite.

Snakes is one of those places that makes me wish I lived in Toronto.  It is so great, and the kind of place I'd like to be a regular at.  If you're visiting town or if you're a resident, make your way here and check it out.

edit: I should mention that they also carry a wide variety of games for sale, should you find yourself enjoying playing them.
