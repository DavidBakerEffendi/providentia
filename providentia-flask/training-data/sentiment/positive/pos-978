In the past few months, I have seen some new smiling, friendly faces manning the registers and restocking the produce. It is a welcomed change, as my last rating was so low because of the poor attitudes of the staff. The personnel that is still the same has become seemingly happier and more welcoming. Hopefully they have been reading customer feedback and realized life is too short to be miserable. Whatever works! Im happy to adjust my rating because they adjusted their outlooks on life(and the avocados are still the best in town).
