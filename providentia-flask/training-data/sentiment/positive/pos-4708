We live in Lake Las Vegas Henderson, Nevada and we don't have a good local coffee house, wait! One just opened up in Downtown Henderson, called Public House and I can say we now have another  favorite coffee house.  Makers & Finders on the west side of town is our go coffee house to while shopping in Downtown Summerlin. The atmosphere is loud with music and people enjoying their favorite hot/cold beverage.  They do have a full food menu breakfast, lunch and dinner for those of you who are hungry.  Will do another update after sampling the food
