We're visiting from Las Vegas and "what a wonderful find!" Met our neighbors from California who live in Scottsdale and had a wonderful meal in addition to tasty cocktails ( enjoyed the Passionate Mule so much I had 2) and a super server, Julia ~
   The sticky bun are good, seemed odd for dinner but I had no trouble devouring mine. My husbands beet salad looked pretty and tasted as good as it looked. The Halibut was the special of the day and was also quite! QUITE!! delicious and presentation was suburb. The Fried Lobster good with really good remoulade sauce + butter, YUM!
  We skipped dessert, enjoyed coffee/cappuccinos, walked around the stunning grounds, enjoyed the numerous fireplaces, and western decor.
     Just a great, great evening if your any where near Paradise Valley, El Chorro should be a "MUST" stop ~
