Yum! Had their Sweet Potato Pizza and Bulgogi Pizza as well as their popcorn chicken with spicy sauce. Their pizzas are dang freaking good- far beyond what I expected at a Karaoke place... makes me want to go back just for the pizza! Popcorn chicken was awesome too- chicken was big- not mostly batter and sauce was awesome. Seriously awesome. Nice job guys!
