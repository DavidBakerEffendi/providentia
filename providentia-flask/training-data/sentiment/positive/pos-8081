My beautiful wife and I were hungry after a recent movie and I am currently eating ketogenic so we went to try the kabob house again. It had been about a year since we had been here and we were surprised by the complete makeover. Now it is an upscale middle eastern restaurant. 

Service was excellent and the person helping us recognized we looked a little lost and explained that they had converted to the new place a year ago. It is very nice inside. Anyway on to the food. 

We tried the chicken kabob and steak
Kabob plates. We both had all salad although you could have rice instead. They seemed to have many different dishes but we wanted something quick to take home.  We waited about 5 minutes and headed home. Food was amazing. Chicken was flavorful and not dry. The steak was tender and also not dry. The salad was simple but fresh and nice variety. The only downside was the price. The 2 entries were about 27 dollars for the two. This is about 10 dollars more then the last time we ate there. True the food was better, but not by that much. Overall they delivered on the food and service which is what I rate on. I don't score down for price. 

Service 5/5. Food 4/5 for my wife and 5/5 for
Me. We will be back but not as often as if the price was lower.
