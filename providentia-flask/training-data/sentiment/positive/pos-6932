A wonderful little mom and pop restaurant, this is a true gem. Not a glitzy place but nice, warm and very clean.

We came by and had dinner tonight, shared some tapas and a combo plate, everything beatyfully served and prepared and tasting outstanding. Clearly this is people that care about food and what they do which also showed by the impeccable service and family like atmosphere.

If you like Mediterranean food this is a nobrainer.
