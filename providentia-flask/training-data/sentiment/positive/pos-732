This is my new favorite place! The enchiladas are out of this world! Our plates came with Fideo soup which was a nice bonus. As soon as I tasted it I said "somebody's mama made this." You can taste the love in the food. I had 3 enchiladas: chile verde w/chicken, mole w/chicken and chile pequin w/ cheese. The pequin was HOT but I LOVE LOVE LOVE spicy food. It was incredible. The chef even came out and asked who had the pequin? I raised my hand with an empty plate in front of me. She was impressed, even bowed lol. Not bad for a gringa! The beans and rice were spot on too. I usually need to add salt and/or tapatio to my plate but everything was seasoned to perfection. can't wait to come back!!!!
