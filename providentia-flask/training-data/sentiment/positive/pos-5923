I heard of of this via Yelp friends check ins. Lots of people were checking and shared interesting gelato flavors, such as corn. I like to try new flavors and this intrigued me. Not that I didn't trust my fellow yelpers, but I just had to try myself. 

On my first visit, the owner Desyree just kept giving me different flavors to try and was not stingy about it!. I think I tried about 10 different ones until I made my decision....

I had the pear gorgonzola on top of creme brulee. It was nice a savory snack and dessert at the same time. Well, the pear gorgonzola is actually not cheesy strong, it was just light enough that you can taste the cheese but sweet with the pear jam. Creme brulee was creamy and had crunchy bits of burnt sugar. It was soooooooo good.

On my second visit, within 5 days, they had new flavors. They were grapefruit, arancia (orange), corn, rum raisin, and others but I only tried these. I am still in love with the pear gorgonzola so I got that with sweet corn on top. 

I love that the owner is not afraid to try new flavor combinations in sweets and look forward to future flavors. 

If you have not tried this place yet, you are missing out. Go to Art of Flavors now!
