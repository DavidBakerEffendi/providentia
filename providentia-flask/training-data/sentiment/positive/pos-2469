Omg!!!!!!! The owner and her boyfriend are the most rad folk ever!  Even though there is Oakland Raiders stuff ever (GO BROWNS) I love this place!  It's hidden behind a car wash!  I had the fish and chips and my bff had the breakfast croissant.  I can't wait to go back!  Nutso I drive past it daily last three years and have never ever been!   Support these people and this diner!
