Overall, Excellent ... Eat 24 Delivery experience was great. The driver arrived a minute or 2 early. He was friendly & very professional. 

Entrees - fresh and plentiful. Flavor - perfect. 

My entree - Filet Mignon Pho Soup (with medium spice). Comforting with a nice kick. While my soup was cooling off, I took the meat out and cut it into smaller pieces (just a personal preference). 

I also ordered a Thai Coffee since it was a brunchy lunch for the hubby and I. Sweeter than I expected (which is not what I normally prefer) but offered balance to my somewhat spicy soup. It turned out to be a nice treat :)

Hub and I split the Pineapple Fried Rice (mild) with chicken & shrimp, which were the right texture, flavor and size. 

His entree - Drunken Noodles - medium - with added chicken. Large portion with nice flavor & texture. I ate some of the veggies. Fresh and not over-cooked. 

We wanted to give the Thai Donuts a try since it added to the brunchy feel. They could've been cooked a tiny bit longer but that'll just give us reason to them put them in the oven later since the entrees were so filling. We'll definitely have enough of everything for 2 more meals. The donuts didn't affect my rating for our overall experience.
