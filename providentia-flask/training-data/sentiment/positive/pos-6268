Delicious BBQ from friendly, saucy folk. The brisket was as good as any I've had in Texas and the sauce was sweet, spicy and with a little heat. They also offer a number of tempting sides (you get 2 with most everything on the menu) including a great corn, skin on fries, coleslaw, beans and deep fried biscuits that look and taste like the beignets from New Orleans.  

Parking is limited so you may need to park a block away in the neighborhood and just walk over the restaurant.

Located near the Oscar Mayer factory on Packer road.  Definitely worth a visit.  We will definitely be back when we head back to Madison in the fall.
