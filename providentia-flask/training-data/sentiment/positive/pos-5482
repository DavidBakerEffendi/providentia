The wife and I stopped in for lunch. I had the pho and the wife had the Banh Mi Thit Nuong pork sandwich. 
The pho was some of the best I've had. Plenty of noodles and vegetables in a wonderful beef broth. It was fantastic. 
The pork in the sandwich was to die for! My wife said that it had just the right amount of spicy and sweet. It had a great smokey flavor as well.
The service was good and the restaurant seemed to be very clean.
The prices are very fair, especially for the sandwich.
Loved it!
