I love that this location has a DRIVE-THRU!!! I will admit that I didn't order a sandwich, but went through the drive-thru for some cookies. Subway cookies are my favorite and when that sweet tooth craving hits, they always deliver and hit the spot! I am giving this location 5 stars because the cookies I got were cooked PERFECTLY! I highly recommended the white chocolate macadamia nut cookies. Other locations seem to undercook or overcook them. The woman working the window was also very friendly.
