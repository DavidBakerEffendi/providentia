Came in with a friend who recommended this place. Coming in the service was really good the lady at the counter instantly began to clean up a table for us. We ordered our food and the prices are really fair especially for the big portions they give you! We got our food really fast and it's really delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone, it is small so no big groups probably but nonetheless it's a 5 star place!
