Avenue B...I'm very glad to meet you!   My entire party of 8 wanted to lick their plates.   Here are a few things to know about this place.
- Everything we ordered was delicious.  You can't go wrong.   
- They are vegetarian friendly.
- The menu they give you has a very small selection, but then there are a whole bunch of other options on chalkboards (like more options than are on the actual menu).   Now, I do usually hate a chalkboard, but these were pretty visible.  There is more than one and the place is small enough that you can see them from your seat without too much trouble.   
- BYOB, but the corkage fee is kinda high.  $5 for the first bottle and then $2.50 for each additional.   We had 6 bottles and I don't think he even charged for all, which helped.  
- Service was great.  Prompt and friendly, with good descriptions of the menu items.  
- Reservation just took an e-mail.   I requested separate checks with the reservation and the server already had the memo (which is rare).   We were seated on time and had plenty of space.

Overall, this place is a winner and was a great start to my alphabet dining series.
