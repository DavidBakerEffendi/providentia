Number one breakfast/ brunch spot in the Plateau, I promise you. It's my new haunt for Sundays out. Their breakfast cook knows WHAT. is. going. on. with that brekkies menu!!! I could have knelt before her and pledged lifelong allegiance after finishing my goat cheese and sun dried tomato omelette. Plus, I got to eat some of my boyfriend's breakfast, too, and I couldn't decide whose was better - his was a crepe stuffed with bacon, emmental cheese, mushrooms, etc and drizzled with maple syrup. Heaven never tasted so good! Also, you have your choice of classic diner coffee from a drip machine, OR espresso-based coffees to top up your FABULOUS breakfast. 

The d√©cor is a riot - total 50s diner feel, with a quirky twist - I sat next to a giant, wooden, carved... vulture? That jukebox is a beautiful relic. Total comfortable layout to the seating, so that no matter where you're sitting, you feel like you have your own space. The interior doesn't stop at the booths up front, either - keep on heading towards the back to discover the stage seating, along with another smaller, lower section that leads to the hidden outdoor patio. There's plenty of seating here for everyone, despite how it looks when you walk in the front door. The noise level is moderate and reasonable, too - you can have a conversation without having to raise your voice, despite how packed they seem to typically be.

Impeccable staff - we were treated like gold. Now, I haven't yet tried the burgers, but they looked amazing and that's what I'll go back for next. Or maybe, I'll go back for another to-die-for breakfast and stay an extra hour till I'm hungry again, and then get a burger.
