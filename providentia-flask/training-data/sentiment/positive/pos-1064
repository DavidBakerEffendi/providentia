Vegan, nut-free, soy-free and gluten-free. Bravo for making all that happen and still taste delicious.
The chocolate crinkle cookie was amazing and I would never have guessed that it happened while missing all of those ingredients.

The service was very helpful and friendly.

This is a beautiful store that I know my child will adore. Thank you Sorelle for creating such a special place that children with allergies can enjoy with their friends and no one is left out.
