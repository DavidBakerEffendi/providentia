In the words of rapper Roscoe Dash, "I had a Good Freakin Night" at NoDa 101 last night!

As soon as I stepped in the door, I knew I'd found my niche in NoDa. All night long the DJ on duty kept dropping fresh beats and sick mixes that had the peeps in NoDa 101 fist pumping for more! The music playing was a party pleasing mix of techno, dance, top 40's, hip-hop, and a little R & B. So within the music variety there was definitely a little something for everyone to groove to from their bar stool.

Speaking of bar, lets chat about my beverages of choice, and the snazzy bartenders on deck shall we? We shall =) Bee-bopping along with my fellow NoDa 101 bar-mates, the sweet bartender on duty noticed that I was without a beverage, and quickly came to my rescue. After placing my order, I watched as the bartender danced while making my drink. Popping and Locking, snapping and such as he made my Midori Sour and Screwdriver. Amazing drinks, and a show! What-Up!  And he wasn't the only bartender who danced and  attended, in fact the whole staff was in on the jig. Just another thing I love about this place! Perfect drinks, great vibes,sweet beats, and room for rump-shakers like myself!

Taking a seat at the bar, you have your choice of viewing 3 different games plastered across the big screens overhead. Every bar goer's dream, comfy seats and great games! Apparently, NoDa 101 hosts league nights! Sounds like a great future date night for me and my boo! And while tuning into the games, I also plan to dive into the great eats here ! I hear the food is delicious! We'll definitely be partaking in the eats on our next date night,  in addition to our "shaken, not stirred" libations ;) See you soon NoDa 101!  =)
