Food, ambience, service, value: 4-4.5/5

Everything is good to superb. Finally a terrific resto in Baldwin Village. 

This is my favorite Japanese bar by far now. Would highly recommend reservations for 2 or more in advance as this is a cozy establishment :) I can see this place catching on fast.

Other notes: Only alcohol served here is sat
