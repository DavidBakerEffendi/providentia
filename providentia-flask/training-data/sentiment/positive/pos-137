I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I have been waiting for this type of cafe to come to Toronto and when it did... OH MY GOD WHY ARE YOU AT BATHURST STATION???

Whatever. 5 stars anyway.

It's $5 cover but their drinks are amazing. Their hot chocolate comes with a cube of chocolate on a stick and it slow melts into your drink. It's so cute! Their white hot chocolate doesn't have this though. I had some strawberry tea and that was sooo gooodd... Alright I'll stop talking about the drinks now.

So yeah, there are two rooms. One serves alcohol, the other doesn't. Beers and board games are a great combination.

When you enter, you see like two tall shelves of games.. and as you keep going, it's a MUSEUM of board games. There a bunch of SHELVES in the other room too! Shelves of games! It's sooooo amazing just seeing that, it's more than what a toy store has.

I came with a group of about 7 so you could probably understand that we'd pick like 20 games we want to try and stack them on our table like true hoggers as we will stay here until we finish all those games.

We ended up playing only 2. It was like 11:30pm though when we went and the place closes at 2am.

When 2am came and other people left without complaints, we were still there trying to finish our game. The staff didn't ever once come and shoo us away. All they said was, "Last call for drinks" at about 1:30 or something. They didn't say ANYTHING when we took our time to finish the game, we took one last stroll around their museum to gawk at the selection, took 2 more washroom breaks... etc... They were so nice. We officially exited the place at 2:20..? or later?

We got there at 10:30, one hour wait. Not bad right? When we called at 8, they told us 3h wait.
