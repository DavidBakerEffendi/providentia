Love it.
It's like they sprinkle cocaine into all of their food to make it taste better.

I like going between 10am-11am which allows you to get charged for breakfast (14.95), but you get to enjoy lunch and breakfast!!

Many things I had here were the best ever.  For example
-Their scrambled eggs were the best eggs I've ever tasted
-Their eggs benedict were awesome
-OMG, their FRENCH TOAST WAS AMAZING!!!
-Chocolate covered strawberries for dessert surpassed Godiva's chocolate covered strawberries by far

So yeah.
How the hell do they make their scrambled eggs taste like that?  I mean seriously.  Cocaine?  Pampered chickens that recieve massages and squirt out only the best tasting eggs?
