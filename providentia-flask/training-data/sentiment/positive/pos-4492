what an adorable find in the most unexpected of places! my husband brought me here to grab a drink before dinner, and I have to say it was definitely the highlight of my night. the cocktails here are extremely well crafted and I'm just going to say it - among the best I have had in the city. right up there with Bar Isabel, where the bartenders are nothing short of magicians. we also got the smoked cod, cauliflower and aged cheddar, and ricotta with dill pinchos (tapas served on a piece of crusty bread) - which were the perfect accompaniment to our perfect cocktails. 

maman is located right in the heart of the financial district and accessible through PATH, so it gets very busy at lunch. this is how my husband discovered it in the first place when he grabbed some quiche and coffee from there one day. lunch or drinks, you're going to fall in love in place!!! it's the cutest.
