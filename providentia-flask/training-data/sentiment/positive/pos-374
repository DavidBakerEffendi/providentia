Oh Parallax, how I have missed you.  Whether I was in the mood for sushi, or just some yummy seafood (Scallops, yum!) you never disappointed.  Great drinks, wine, food and service makes this a must try for those who have not even gone there.  

The White tuna is absolutely amazing... and I can honestly say I am not one to stray too much from my normal sushi choices, but I have done so at Parallax and was never disappointed.  Some of the freshest sushi I have ever had!  

Keep up the great work.  I know Michael Symon gets a lot of the cred in NE Ohio, but I think Zack Bruell deserves just as much with gems like this and L'Albatros.
