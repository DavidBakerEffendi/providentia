Char heel was my favorite. We went on a Tuesday and hot dogs were buy one get one free! We paid $12 for 4 hotdogs and 2 sides. It was glorious and the food was great. We got the slaw and onion rings as sides, both good choices. We will definitely go back. Oh, and the service was friendly and speedy.
