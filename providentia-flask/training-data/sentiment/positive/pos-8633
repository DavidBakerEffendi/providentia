Fantastic Jamaican place right downtown across the street from where I work.  The jerk chicken was dry and loaded with ginger and allspice.  The sauce had great scotch bonnet peppers that had a sweet slow burn.  Fantastic rice and peas.  The coleslaw was jusy enough and not too wet.  AMAZING rum cake.  The mojitos were good and the live band was fun to dance to.  Kind of love it and not so sure it is good to have Appleton rum across the street from my work.
