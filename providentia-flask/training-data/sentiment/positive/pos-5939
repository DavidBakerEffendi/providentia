Returned to celebrate our 2nd year wedding anniversary!  Mistakenly reserved a table via the "Open Table" app and walked in knowing rsvps were never made. They explained it often happens and the rsvps thru OT were for a restaurant in Minnesota! What?!!! They were so very kind to squeeze us in on the spot and find a table for two. This place never disappoints! Our waitress, Toni, was so wonderful; knew the menu by heart and recommended dishes that were very tasty! We each had a glass of wine red / white- Row 11 Pinot noir and can't remember the Chardonnay I had :(- buttery / oaky flavored- so yum! For appetizers, we ordered 1/2 and 1/2 clams & mussels w/ broth & butter dips, that were very good. Our favorite were the mussels. Was served w/ delicious bread and butter. For our entr√©es, I had the petite fillet, medium, with baked potato and steamed mixed veggies, which also came w/ a house salad. Hubby ordered the Halibut w/ the same sides. Not enough room for dessert, but able to squeeze in a decaf coffee. :) perfect night!

The service and food, once again, PHENOMENAL!!! We can't wait for our next visit! Thanks, Toni, you were awesome!!!
