Wow!  I would give 6 stars to Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina if I could.
Thank you Yelp..never would have found them without you!

Best experience in any restaurant EVER no matter the cost, country or nationality!  From the moment we walked in at 3:15 in the afternoon we were treated like long time customers (that tip very good) It was truly amazing.  The hostess girl at the front desk was so sweet and so nice and our server super nice, helpful and FAST... my only caveat is to be careful with the roasted peppers that come with the chips and salsa...Very HOT! Whew! but I recovered fast...  We arrived in time for happy hour and were happy to see red wine for $4.50 a glass and decided to do 4 different happy hour treats from the special menu.  We do this from time to time at different restaurants as we eat our dinner early so we don't go to bed with a full stomach.

When the food came we were shocked at the size of the portions! they were huge and each came with very generous portions of avocado and sour cream.  We had the fajita nachos and fajita quesadillas, shrimp cerviche and something else I don't recall.  Every thing was delicious and full of meat.  The cerviche was delicious, cool, refreshing and with lots of shrimp and avocado in it.

The red wine was tasty and everyone (including both the manager and the hostess) came by to see if everything was OK, at which time we gave them a total thumbs up!

We ended up packing up enough for us to have a light lunch in a day or two.

I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Excellent experience!
