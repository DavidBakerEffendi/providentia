LOVED IT!

Really great service! They were all super nice, from the young man at the register, to the older ladies in  the back. 

Had the "teriyaki" lunch plates with my bf. He got spicy pork, and I opted for the bulgogi, both were good for the size and price! 

We also got a large boba milk tea with combo pudding (taro, egg, and milk pudding) and it was SO GOOD. 
I love my boba milk tea, and this place was great! 

It challenged my love for Good Foot, as the boba here at Fresh Cup was soft, and the flavor of their milk tea was not too sweet. (Looks like I have two options when I'm craving =o] )

Would go back here in a second. 

The cute decor and constant K-pop make this placer an ideal hang out spot for just you by yourself (I'm thinking study sesh), or with a few friends.
