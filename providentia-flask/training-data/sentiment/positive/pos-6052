Came to Bareburgers with two of my friends, and it was a pleasant experience. The decor is rustic and was very in tune with the theme. They really crammed in the people but we sat at the bar so it was ok. 

I ordered the supreme burger and it was a beauty. What I really like about the place is the different kinds of meat that you could get like bison and other less common meats. My only tiff is that portions are not the biggest, and it doesn't come with fries or a side. We had to order some fries, and without it I don't think we would have been full or felt like a complete meal. 

Service was really great. Everyone was friendly and refilled our water immediately. I would come back here again to be a little more adventurous and try the other burgers.
