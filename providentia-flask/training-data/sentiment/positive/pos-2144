first time here and it was yummy. my friends and i are doing a Daniel's Fast and they had plenty of options for us. Shout out to Cameron and everyone else that provided awesome service. the cauliflower tacos were a hit and the Mexican corn. I normally don't like tofu but the chorizo tacos were good as well. We'll be back even after the fast
