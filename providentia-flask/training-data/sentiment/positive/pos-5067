YES. 

Just yes!!! This place is the bomb.com. 

Their shot tree is pricey ($70) but its worth it! First off you get the cutest Instagram picture! And the drinks are delicious. Like sooo good. And really strong!

The sushi is phenomenal. Everything was so fresh and the service was great. 

I love this place and cannot wait to go back for their happy hour!
