The best ice cream around. It's a bit pricey as far as ice cream goes, but they do not skimp on the amount of product/portions at all. It is worth paying a little more for quality, homemade ice cream. My favorites are the Mustang Meltdown brownie sundae and the black raspberry chip. The vanilla that they make sundaes with is some of the best I've ever had.

I'll take Z's over Dairy Queen or Honey Hut any day!
