This place is always good. Love the food. If breakfast is your thing, you'll find your favorites, plus you get a bagel as well. 

If you prefer lunch, they have great sandwiches, hot or cold. Beware, they are rather large! But no worries you can get half of one or the full thing, but no sharing aloud!

The sides are choice of coleslaw, macaroni salad, or fries, along with a pickle. The soups are chicken noodle, cabbage or soup of the day. And for the traditional kids menu, Hebrew National hot dogs! 

They have egg creme but to be honest, I haven't tried them. I hear they are good. 

If you want baked goods, they have a great selection. Large assortment of bagels and cream cheese, pastries, baklava, cannoli, and rugula. They even have a no sugar added cheese cake for when I'm watching my carbs but still want something sweet. 

Service is good, great attention to customer service. Only thing that is not so hot, parking, it's a busy place!
