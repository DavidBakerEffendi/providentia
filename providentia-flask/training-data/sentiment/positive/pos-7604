I noticed the reviews here were mixed...you either love it or hate it. I had passed this place long before Guy ever showed up and was pretty impressed with their menu. I just never had the chance to eat here because I'm either here in AZ or somewhere else.

Luckily, I was here in AZ and finally got to experience it. Went with a friend and we split the fried calamari and the Italian stallion between us. I had the chicken caesar salad and she had the spinach salad.

First off, hats off to them getting the calamari right - it wasn't over done and rubbery. WOO HOO! Lovely delicate blend of spices and a lovely batter that just left me completely satisfied.

Salads arrived as we were finishing up the calamari and the salads cost about 8 or 9 a plate and were absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that if you're charging that much for a salad, be a little more generous with the greens, ok? I love my salads and I was a bit bummed that there wasn't enough green on my plate. 

Finally...that pizza...The Italian Stallion...holy mother of...oh baby. LOVED the dough. Loved the whole pizza. LOVE LOVE LOVED the fact that the sausage had a surprise kick of spice. It was gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.

Our server kept the table stocked well with water - another bonus. She was attentive without being overly obnoxious and we never had to worry or wait for things. YAY!

Overall, what a wonderful experience...I definitely would come back and I can't wait to go back, too.
