Came here for a late night dinner after an amazing ugly sweater party, which my wife won! gj babe! It was around 12:30am, and the place was CRAZY decorated for Christmas! It looked AWESOME inside! We were greeted by "Rory" the bartender, who was excellent. He was very knowledgeable about everything they offered for happy hour and their regular menu.

$2 Happy hour is Mon-Fri 3pm-7pm & 11pm-3am on Ellis Island draft beers, Wine, and Cocktails with many delicious alcohols to choose from. Also 1/2 off appetizers!
The food was cheap and hit the spot!

My wife got the classic burger, which she said was in her TOP 5 burgers at any bar shes been to. 
I ordered the "Pub Chicken" which was chicken sauteed in lemon accompanied by rice and sauteed veggies. It was a bit over acidic, but good, especially for a bar. 

This bar could absolutely be my wifes and I's new local pub. Good service, good food, and good Ellis Island beers on tap. Great end to our fantastic night.
