Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Some places you can tell are going to be good , just by walking past them and getting a whiff of what they're cooking. Pacos Tacos is definitely one of those places. I tried this place for the first time , after completing a Barre class at a studio within walking distance . I ended up getting a chicken taco bowl ( on the menu it's called a Fiesta Bowl), that was awesome. The fajita chicken was grilled just right, none of that rubbery chicken business. I will definitely be keeping this place in mind the next time I visit the South Park area.
