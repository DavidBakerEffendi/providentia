Heard of this place through friends as the best Pho in Charlotte and it did not disappoint!! Very small hole in the wall type restaurant but the best Vietnamese food I've had in awhile! The Pho Thai and Pho Chan (well done beef and rice noodles) and both were amazing! Huge portions for about $10 and they have all the added sides of bean sprouts, lemons, and basil! Also nice little candy and fortune cookies at the end with the check :) I'll definitely be back!!
