Saw this joint on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and immediately jumped in the car to check it out.  Nestled in Old Town Glendale this is the place to go for great pizza in Arizona.  I'm mad at La Piazza because now I can't order pizza from anywhere without comparing it to this place.  I'm constantly haunted by this place because it's so freaking awesome!!

We ordered the shrimp appetizer and bruschetta, both of which were fresh, perfectly cooked, absolutely delicious and arrived quickly despite poor and confused service.

Then we ordered the Italian Stallion and White Pizza.  The Italian Stallion has several different meats on it, one of which I have never tasted anything like it.  I believe it is the fresh Italian supressetta and Proscuito that puts it over the top -- along with the pepperoni and sausage.  DELICIOUS!

The white pizza is basil, garlic, ricotta and mozzarella and while the combination is simple, the taste is very surprising in that the flavors are robust and fulfilling despite the lack of ingredients.
The first time we went, both of us loved it.  The 2nd time, my wife was less impressed, however I am still a huge fan of this  joint!  Guy was right.

UPDATE:
Went back and tried the baked spaghetti... eventhough we could tell is had been cooked much earlier and reheated, it was very good.  The red sauce is among the best I've had, a classic southern Italy recipe just like grandma used to make.  You can't go wrong with anything at this place... well, except maybe the service.  Let's just say that hiring within the family isn't always a great idea.
