Another find on YELP and so glad that my friend Charlotte and I locked in here for lunch today.  This restaurant was featured on The Food Network last week, and I can see why!  Their menu is creative and original.   It is just not a typical grille!   I had some gourmet chicken wings with blue cheese and hand cut fries.  The wings were prepared with a zesty sauce that complimented the dish. There were a variety of salads and sandwiches, including a shrimp burger on the menu.  It is an intimate space with a magnificent bar area.  The restaurant was sleepy today, but it is vacation season and restaurant week, so I get it.  It's located directly below Jason's Deli adjacent to Park Road Shopping Center. If you don't know exactly where you are going, it is a little bit hard to find.  Absolutely go enjoy the food and the ambience in The Turnhouse Grille.   It could well be your favorite new restaurant, if you haven't already discovered it!   Three thumbs up and I plan to be a loyal patron.
