I love this place.  I've been coming here for years and I never have any complaints whatsoever.  It's always a great time with friends of family when coming here.  In the fall when the weather is nicer, the patio is a great place to converse.  The flat breads are my all time favorite and they have a wide range of drinks and wine tastings to get you a nice buzz.  My most favorite thing about The Living Room is the ambiance and the atmosphere.  Even though I have only seen pics of the new location in Ahwatukee, this will always be the best location no matter what haha.  I'm sure the new location is awesome, probably more lively and open v.s. the intimate feeling of this location.  Keep up the great work!
