I have been frequenting this lovely place for about a year now and have enjoyed every single drop of coffee ordered. The first couple times I had it,I felt like taking my shirt off and running down the street yelling wooo. I don't know if its their excellent beans or the preparation methods but the caffeine content and flavor are high. The Peacemaker is my favorite brew. As far as their food, I have only tried the hand rolled granola and its fantastic.
