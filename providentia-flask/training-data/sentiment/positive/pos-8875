Friendly local owner, check.

I had been referred to Il Bosco by a fellow yelper some weeks back... And finally decided to venture out for a casual lunch. So happy that I did. 

The pizza here is wonderful-fresh ingredients in yummy combinations, straight from a woodfire oven. I tried two different pies, the Caprese salad and their creme brule.  All were well made and the service speedy and friendly. 

 The store front can be hard to spot (blink and you might miss it), but I actually like the "hole in the wall" feeling of a smaller local business. Take the time to seek this gem out!
