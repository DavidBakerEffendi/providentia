I give this place five stars not for the excellent food or exceptional service but quite the opposite. When I eat at Waffle House I expect greasy spoon food and atmosphere which is truly delivered. Nice waitresses and surly cooks greasy breakfast and hot coffee. If I had something I didn't like I guess it would be the gelatinous butter like substance they serve. I prefer real butter. Other than that all the things that are wrong with this restaurant is what makes it right. My order usually includes hash browns scattered, covered, smothered and chunked.
