We had dinner at Sai for the first time tonight. We had the AYCE sushi. Every roll was delicious! (There was very very minimal wait time in between ordering rolls.) The service was fantastic! Our waiter, Juan, was attentive, friendly, and made fantastic suggestions when we were ordering. The price was extremely reasonable. It came to $46 for 2 with the coupon in the 89052 book. We will definitely be back!
