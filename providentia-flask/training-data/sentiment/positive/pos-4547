This is the best little Greek establishment in Las vegas!  My husband and I have purchased their homemade pita bread for over 5 years.  They have the best pits breads in town! Or that I have ever tasted anywhere. They make them fresh and they go fast . He can also hold some aside for you if you call ahead. Today we picked up his fresh made feta cheese and it is just amazing. We also tried a few of the freshly.prepared cookies and the date nut ones were still warm. The cookies are all delicious. Their hummus and other menu items are just perfect as well. I highly recommend this place. Also the owner is very nice and remember's my husband each time he comes in.
