Located right across UNLV next to Von's. I actually really like their pho here, it reminds me of the yummy pho places I'd go to in the Bay Area in California. So whenever I'm craving for good pho, this is my spot! Also, their Banh mi is yummmmy! Ugh, the baguettes are perfectly crispy and soft at the same time and their ingredients are fresh, plus the meats aren't dry. I've tried their bbq pork and their baked chicken and they were both great! What makes a great Vietnamese sandwich is their baguette and some places lack that, this spot doesn't! The only thing is that it's a bit pricey here, but you won't be disappointed, it's worth it :))
