OMG, I love this place! Tiny little restaurant, super cute. We got there at 5 p.m. and we were the only people there but several other people arrived shortly thereafter. They bring chips and salsa to the table and both items were outstanding. Fresh homemade salsa and if I had to guess the chips were probably made there also. I ordered the corned beef hash with egg. The waitress told me they quit serving that item at 2 p.m. however she would ask the chef if he would make it. So glad he said yes! Possibly the best corned beef hash I've ever had. My friend had the Miso Burger that came with sweet potato fries. Well, I couldn't help myself I ate all those sweet potato fries. Seasoned perfectly!! I am so keeping my fingers crossed that this tiny restaurant makes it here in Green Valley because the food was simply marvelous.
