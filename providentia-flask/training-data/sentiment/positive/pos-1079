I definitely always feel the magic in the air at the fountains whenever we go to Vegas. Even so many years after coming as a kid, I still love standing around and watching the show. I enjoy that it's free and even better is that there is something usually happening in front of it to entertain while the fountains aren't going off, such as:  a ballerina, a man "levitating" by holding onto a stick, lots of people to take pics with, and so much more.

This is a must if you visit vegas, you can't miss it.
