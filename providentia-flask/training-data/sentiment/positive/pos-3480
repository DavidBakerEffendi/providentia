I live right by here and go a lot. Staff is super friendly, food always excellent & great selection.  I usually just sit at the bar and order tea and dinner. It's more casual than the dinning area and I go alone often.  It is expensive, but you know that going in and it's ALWAYS worth it. The freshest and best quality seafood in town. I'd rather pay more for excellent than a little less for mediocre. They have oyster specials for $1 through the week during certain times and from 5-7pm a bar bites menu where many rolls and food is 1/2 off. Great time for dinner. Highly recommend.
