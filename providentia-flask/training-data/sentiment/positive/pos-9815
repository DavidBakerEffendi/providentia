Pizza Heaven has been on my list to try for quite some time now & I honestly haven't gone because I initially thought it would be more on the comfort food side rather than healthy quality food, boy was I wrong.

Last Saturday night after I over worked out myself, my body just needed some... CARBS!!! I decided to finally give Pizza Heaven a try. I was hesitant at first & I asked the waitress too many questions. My diet is vegan so I am always used to fresh quality food & as of a couple of months ago, I dropped sugar out of my diet as well. I was hesitant on the vegan cheese, because it stated that it was soy so I wasn't sure if it was non-gmo or if it contained sugar. The waitress was amazing, she brought me out a folder that had all the ingredients of the foods that they use. The vegan cheese brand is Follow Your Heart & it did not have any added sugar nor genetically modified ingredients. I started to be more opened to this menu & decided to order a vegan calzone w/ mushrooms, onions, & spinach. 

Oh my gosh, DELICIOUS! And, it's also huge so I will have lunch for a few days too. The calzone bread was amazing & it only contained four ingredients, sugar not being one of them. It was topped off with EVOO, not butter, so it was just as vegan as it could be. The sauce was amazing, it complimented the calzone perfectly.

I talked to the owner for quite a bit, who is wonderful. She informed me that her French fries are not fried in the same frier where wings or other meat products are fried. That is beyond amazing because not many restaurants will invest in a separate frier to accommodate to their vegan population, not even big cooperate restaurants, & I know this for a fact. She also uses purified water when she cooks & not tap, she is very passionate about her business & the quality of her ingredients.

I cannot wait to go back. This was exactly what my body needed last Saturday. I really enjoyed my experience & the amazing food.
