We love Frank and Fina's! 
We went again last night, a regular stop when we have friends visiting from CA 
Very comfortable home type atmosphere, not to loud to catch up with friends! 
The food is always fast and delicious. The service is wonderful. We love the homemade Salsa, the Carnitas and the Quesadillas.
We will be back.
