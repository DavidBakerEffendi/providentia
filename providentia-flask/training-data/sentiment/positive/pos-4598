This is my 8th visit to this Fired Pie since end of July- our weekly Saturday night pizza night! Each pizza has been great with fresh ingredients. Each week I try to change it up, so last week got the regular crust, oil and garlic spread and a little bit of marinara sauce. Then, fresh mozzarella, roasted onions, tomato slices and basil. I wasn't sure if I would like the fresh mozzarella, but did!!! 

The last three weeks Dionne has cooked my pie, and is a friendly and personable employee. She recognizes me now when I come in. Also, Garauv has helped me for three weeks and is  pleasant and friendly, as well. While it is extremely important that the food is of high quality, so is having the right employee representing one's company- Dionne and Garauv both fit that bill!!!
Already thinking about next week's pie!!!
