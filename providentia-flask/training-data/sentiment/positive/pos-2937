CAN YOU SAY MULTIPLE MOUTH ORGASMS? 

AN EXPLOSION OF FLAVORS AT IT'S BEST. 

IN MY GLORY! 

Wow, I had the pleasure of dining at Opa, when my wonderful friend Ruth from Greece invited us all out. Her hubby is Greek so they know great Greek food and she was right about this restaurant! I showed up early at the restaurant since I live so close. I informed the host I was there for a reservation of a party of others I was meeting, he looked and saw my friend's reservation and said fantastic and led me to the bar for a drink on the house! Yes a free drink while waiting for the rest of my party to show! Mmmm was an awesome long island. A really nice touch! Ok so everyone shows and she ordered our table several items from the menu to try. The service was fantastic, there were six of us dining and we were treated like royalty I must say! The belly dancer was awesome! She danced with me a few times, pulled me to the mini dance floor area. Was soooo fun! 

I was in my glory, a true happy place while feasting on such insanely great food. I was eating, and moaning, and drinking and eating and moaning, not even paying attention to my friend's at the table chit chatting away. It was just me myself and my plate that were all that existed in that moment in time. 

The oven lemon herb potatoes included with the meal were delicious...! 

I had the best fried calamari i have had in my life, honestly. 

All must try's as we did!
