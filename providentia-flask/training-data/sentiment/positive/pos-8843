My late lunch was nothing short of fantastic.  

Our waiter, Evan, walked the fine line between attentive and intrusive, very well. (He also had a really cool, plaid tie.)

I orderd the Soft Shell Crab Po Boy, which came with a side of ff or pasta salad ($10). I chose pasta salad, which was a huge portion, served in a deep bowl. The pasta was corkscrew, a refreshing change from elbows, or bow tie. It was tossed lightly in some light oil, but not greasy or slimy.

The sandwich roll, was stuffed with a tender crab on each half, with shredded lettuce, and a couple of small, fresh tomato slices.

My Day Tripper Sangria was the perfect accompaniment, light, crisp, and refreshing.
