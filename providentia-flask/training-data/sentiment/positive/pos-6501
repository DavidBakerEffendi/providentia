Classic Pad Thai today for lunch special!  Great atmosphere. Attentive service. Located right next to the theater deep in the shopping center. Soup came out warm, not as hot (temp) as I like or should be; but flavorful and full of ingredients. The Pad Thai special is touted as their signature dish. Delicious and hit the spot for me.  Sweeter than the other Pad Thai dishes I've had around town; like Pinkow, Lucky Thai, or Le Thai (my favorite for atmosphere-but small and parking sucks.) I got a 6 on the 1 to 10 spicy scale at Archie's. Medium as it should be at 6. You might want to go to an 8 or higher if you want to clear your sinuses. Nice place for lunch. Quick, clean and classy. Good parking.
