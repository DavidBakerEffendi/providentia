Hooooray!  We finally found an awesome Chinese spot in Charlotte.  Sure, tin tin is great but it is a buffet and I am not always up for that.  My wife brought me here on a Saturday afternoon, it was not too crowded.  You order at the counter and then either wait for your to go or sit and they will bring your your food.  I got sesame chicken, the chicken was crispy in a slightly sweet and wonderfully savory sauce.  I ordered mine with fried rice and an egg roll.  I am a huge egg roll fan in general and these were top of the mountain.   They are pork egg rolls, obviously homemade and fried to perfection!  I cannot wait to go back for the egg rolls.  We also had a small chicken wing, which is only $3! And wonton soup!!  The soup was perfectly thick and tasty.  Two sesame chickens with fried rice and egg rolls, side of wings, egg drop soup and the bill was only about $21!  This is the best Chinese takeout/eat In I have been to in Charlotte.  Get to this place!
