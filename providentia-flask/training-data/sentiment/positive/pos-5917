I love this place!  They seriously have a  special place in my heart.  When I lived in Middleton there was actually a 3 month period when I ate at least one meal there!  They have such a great hot bar and the service is always outstanding.  I don't shop at Whole Foods but I can't imagine what WF would have on this place.
