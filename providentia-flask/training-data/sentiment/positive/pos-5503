Small menu, but that also means good quality!  I got the small beef noodles with flat noodles (there are many noodle sizes to choose from). The small is really filling, I cant imagine finishing the mega size! The beef was also cooked really well. Although I would have appreciated more toppings (ie. vegetables), I would definitely go back in the future especially because of the great service we got. It is a little cramped and busy though, so definitely get there earlier :)
