First time here and won't be the last time either. The veggie ramen that a friend and I ordered was asked on a scale of spicy so I chicken out with asking for spice to be on the side while my friend asked for super spicy. Besides my nasal cavities opening up and crying just a little, the pain felt even better with a cold sake on the side. Our waiter gave us a small note  to read up on what type of sake we were drinking too which was helpful since I know nothing about sake but drinking it.
