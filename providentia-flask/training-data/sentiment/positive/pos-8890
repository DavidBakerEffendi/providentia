I could wrap up this review in one word: decadent. For more explanation, read on!

We had a 6:30 reservation on a Saturday night; we arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated in a booth. We had thought about having a pre-dinner drink at the bar and were immediately glad we didn't when we saw that the bar only had 3 seats... this is definitely a meal-only place, but what a meal it was! Booths line the wall and there are tables in the middle. The decor is sparse but modern and cozy. A trip to the restroom also revealed a pretty extensive wine cellar in the back of the restaurant.

We started with a duck confit appetizer and bottle of Rhone that our incredibly knowledgeable, patient, helpful, and friendly waitress suggested. Neither the fella nor I know anything about French wines, and the list was as extensive as the cellar! The duck was incredible and was preceded by a lobster bisque amuse-bouche and light, buttery, steaming hot rolls. For dinner, I got the wild boar with truffle mac and cheese, and the fella got the rabbit. After tasting each others, we couldn't come to a conclusion on who had picked the better entree because they were both so amazing. Since we were in a "blow it out" sort of mood, we then ordered the creme brulee for dessert. Mmmm... there just aren't words. After that, our waitress brought us some complimentary marizpan petit fours for one last, sweet bite.

This is definitely a special occasion place with special occasion prices, but it is well worth the trip. The service, ambiance, and food are out of this world, and Lumiere has officially become one of my top fine dining spots in Charlotte.
