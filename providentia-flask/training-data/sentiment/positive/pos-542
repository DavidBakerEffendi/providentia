Best dam hot dog place in Vegas.  It was everything I wanted and more.

I was skeptical at first because the thought of mixing "asian slaw" (usually nasty) into a hot dog didn't sound too appealing but lo and behold...it turned out to be amazing.  I think the key part here is their bun.  A dry and incompetent bun usually ruins hot dogs for me.  Buldogi's buns were nice, soft and big enough to fit all the goodies.

I'm coming back for sure to try the ANGRY KIMCHI FRIES!!
