I was looking around the area for restaurants to try, and when I saw this on Yelp, I knew we had to go give it a shot! I'm a big fan of Peruvian food, both the roasted chicken and the sides that are offered - fried sweet plantains and yucca!

It wasn't too crowded when we arrived, so we were able to sit down pretty quickly and made our order shortly after. The food didn't take long to come out, and it smelled and tasted great! We got some roasted chicken and an order of fried sweet plantains. It looked like a good amount, but we were able to put it all down because it was delicious!

I'll definitely want to come back next time I'm in the area!
