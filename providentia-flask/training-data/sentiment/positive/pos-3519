I love this restaurant! We've dined there, and picked up food to eat at home, dozens of times. You may have read my prior reviews that include the best pastas, appetizers, and more. We usually always get the Cannoli for dessert because, they are legitimately homemade mini Cannoli and are fantastic.

BUT this time we got the BEIGNETS for dessert! I just died and went to heaven. They definitely know how to make perfect, light, flaky beignets dusted with powdered/confectioner's sugar. The raspberry sauce and chocolate sauce are both amazing on them.

You haven't lived until you've savored these light pillows of flaky sweetness!
