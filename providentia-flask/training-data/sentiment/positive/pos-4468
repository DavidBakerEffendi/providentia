Tocilog: Basic Filipino breakfast raised to awesome heights.  Tocino, garlic fried rice, and egg.  Simple right? You'd be shocked how bad some places make this.  Not here.  Matt gets garlic rice like I haven't tasted for a while.  Tocino was just right in fatty goodness. 

Pork Belly burger:  see photo  this belly busting goodness is breakfast and lunch.  Henry said it was perfect but huge  He was just mad he couldn't fit it all in his mouth.  Juicy and sumptuous

Tempura battered bacon and pancakes:  I didn't mean to order this  I really just wanted the bacon but I don't think server understood me  I wasn't as clear as I could be  but no regrets.  It was amazingly baconey.  Pancakes had an amazing batter.  Bisquik batter it was not.  It was elevating. 

Ono plate: Chicken wings and spam and garlic rice(upgrade).  Perfect meal.  No chili for me though. 

I can't say enough about this spot other than eat here and I will be back when I'm in town next.
