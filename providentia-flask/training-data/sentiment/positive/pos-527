Four star eats but they get an extra star for seriously nice customer service and attitude.  

My husband is a royal pain at times for restaurants - ordering in advance, insisting on rapid service, etc.  In his defense it usually works out really well and he makes our life awesome.  BUT, I can see where restaurant staff would be like "wtf". Anyway, he ordered to go and then we showed up and decided to eat in.  They unpacked the food and gave us great service without any complaints or problems even though over the phone he had insisted they have it ready in 3 minutes. (Lol).   Then he asked for ice for the free mango lassi and it took FOREVER.  He was starting to get annoyed until we looked over and one of the staff was coming in from outside with two bags of ice.  They actually sent someone out to hurry and get ice for just us (they had just opened).  It was one of those man-did-I-have-the-wrong-idea moments.   

We ended up eating here three days in a row, which I am not suggesting but my husband loves tikka masala and he is like a 12 year old who could eat the same thing every day of his life.  The butter chicken, which is basically the same thing, was better than the Tikka masala so he ate that the other two days instead after trying mine.  

Everything we ate was good.  Service was stellar.  The place is packed with Indians, so I'm assuming that suggests authenticity although I've not yet visited India. 

Hit it!
