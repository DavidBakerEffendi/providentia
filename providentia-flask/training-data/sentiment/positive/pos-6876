Wildflower is a good alternative to Paradise if you like bakery style places but are tired of the same old thing. This location is very clean and the service is friendly and prompt. They've never gotten an order wrong or kept me waiting too long. Everything I've ever tried there has been excellent, especially the sweet potato sandwich. I love that the side of fruit comes with some yogurt and granola on top! I will definitely be back.
