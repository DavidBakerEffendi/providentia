Le Neuf cafe was a gem of a find! I felt transported to Paris.. or at least it felt like I wasn't in Toronto. It was so refreshing. My friend and I both ordered from their selection of Sandwiches on a Baguette and split the Campagnard (salami, brie, dijon, cucumber, lettuce) and the Basque (prosciutto, tomato, fresh mozzarella, basil pesto, arugula).

I preferred the Basque over the Campagnard but that waa probably due to the stronger flavours of the prosciutto that overpowered the lighter flavours of the 2nd sandwich.

I did not get a chance to try out their tempting display of dessers this time around, but next time for sure. i can't wait to go back for some authentic Parisian cuisine and experience. Decor was chic and lovely (I couldn't stop looking at all the trinkets), staff was friendly and I loved how they chattered amongst them in French!

For lovers of Paris and all things French, Le Neuf is the perfect escspe and ideal spot to spend a lazy Sunday with a good read in hand, musings to jot down, or brunch with your partner or girlfriends! It's definitely one of those cafes that I wanted to keep as my little secret... :)
