Really good food. Period.
Bread and saucy dip that comes with ..yum. Ceaser salad with cashews, yes please. Pizza with the freshest mozzarella ever? Yes. And the Lobster ravioli, totally great, the sauce is awesome. We have been twice, once with groupon and once with yelp coupon...very accommodating both times and phenomenal food and service both times. They have a decent happy hour menu with $5 Dishes and drinks and a lovely outdoor patio. I want to try something different next time, but the white pizza and the lobster ravioli are too good!
We've been on a weeknight and a weekend night...pretty busy both times, might want to call ahead on a weekend.
