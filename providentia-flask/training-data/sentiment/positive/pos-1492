This place is really good.  Worth it to stop in and meet Manny he is super friendly and great customer service speaks English very well.  This is a family owed business and they take pride in there product. Which is amazing. My husband got the chimichanga burrito. I got the adobda mini tacos and the rolled tacos. Great mexican food.  You know it's good when mexicanas eat there.  When we came up two little ladies of mexican descent where there we asked them how the food was and they said  this was their second visit this week.  I'm mexican as well as my spouse so no disrespect intended. The food was ample portions for the price Manny did say there was going to be a price change but better quality meat. Hopefully those price increases won't be too high.  Overall good quality food for the price and definitely will be back.  Also with your yelp check in you may be able to get a free drink.  It's 100% honored here and Manny gave us a free refill.
