Great little place! The beignets and croissants are the best! Very friendly girls that work there! Desserts are delicious! You can find a variety of hard to come by cheeses and wines. Great happy hour! Lunch and dinner menu's are both incredible with a nice variety of options. Get here early, it gets packed rather quickly!
