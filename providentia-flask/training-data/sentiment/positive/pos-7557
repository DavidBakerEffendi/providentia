Diamonds are not this girls best friend chicken is.   Another slam dunk,  home run out of the park meal.  It should also be noted that the restaurant was way more crowded then I had ever seen before. Good job Chicken Latino.  I am cheering for your success. 

 On this occasion my hubby of course got the shrimp and Tilapia  ceviche . Which is only served during the weekend as a lunch special.  The shrimp were plump and there was a massive amount of lime juice coating the fish and shrimp very nicely. 

 I had the half rotisserie chicken , no sides.  I didn't need any starches or legumes standing between me and that bird.  To the embarrassment of my boyfriend I ate the chicken with my bare hands tearing into it like a lion into a gazelle.  I was playing no games devouring my chicken.  Treat -yo-self to Chicken Latino you'll be happy you did.
