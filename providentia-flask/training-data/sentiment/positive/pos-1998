Oh my G-d!!! This place is a hidden gem.  The food is out of this world, but first of all the service was so amazing that I gotta mention it up ahead.  We've got certain food restrictions and we called the restaurant to make sure we can eat there.  They said that it's no problem so we came, we didn't make a reservation or leave our name -- we just came in.   So, of course, when we sat down we repeated our request.  It turned out that they had recorded what we said, and made sure that we are the people that they had talked to earlier and that they understood everything and triple checked every little thing.  It was just unbelievable -- considering that at other Hungarian places we were told that if we wish to eat their food we better eat it as they make it or not come at all. 

 Well -- now on to the food -- the quality was just superb.  We ordered the cold cherry soup which was lovely -- last time I'd had it in a Hungarian restaurant in Romania and this version was just as lovely as I remembered.  We also ordered the cucumber salad which was a really cool and unique dish -- I've never had a cucumber salad like that.  But the chicken breast schnitzel was what totally won me over.   The meat was so fresh and flavorfull and light and amazing!   I've never tasted schnitzel - and I was curious but a little concerned because all too many restaurants consider breading the meat as a lovely means to hide the fact that whatever animal that meat had belonged to had died a long time ago of natural causes...  But this thing was just PERFECT -- I can't wait to come back.  

One thing though -- the restaurant is really small, so it's better to come early or else make reservations.
