Love it!  

Family owned, all the goodies made from scratch, great prices, and excellent product.  If that isn't enough for you, I dunno what you want?!

Went with the Gelato Sandwich ($4): Freshly Baked Cookies (literally scraped off the pan), with Nocciola Gelato and Hazelnuts! Awesome!  

You choose your gelato, but after one bite of the Hazelnut, I knew that's what I was gonna go for anyways!  I think 2-3 other Yelpers went with the EXACT same combination, so it must have been good!

I got to sample quite a few of their products, and I have plenty of reasons to come back!  Check it out :P
