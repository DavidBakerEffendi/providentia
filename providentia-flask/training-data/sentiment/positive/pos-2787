Mr Johnson must not have taste buds if he claims the food is flavorless.  I mean, come on, it's got jerk seasoning for Pete's sake!

I love this restaurant, and although it can be a bit pricey, the food is unique and very tasty.  The only downside is that I have to drive 20 miles to get there, otherwise I'd probably go much more often.

Oh, and the best part?  The cookies, included with each entree.  Nice.
