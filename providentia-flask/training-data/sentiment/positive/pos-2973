Excellent food in a perfect location. The beer menu is growing and ever-changing (now they have draft beers!) and if you're into wine you can pick a bottle from the shop next door to share or choose one of the great wines by the glass (Silver Oak by the glass!). My favorites: Lobster Roll, Burger, Beet Salad, any Wren House beer ;)
