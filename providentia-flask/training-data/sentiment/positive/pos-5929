Glad I had the fried chicken. Really good. I couldn't touch it for 10-15 minutes cause it was so hot! Freshly made. Crispy skin reminds me of Popeyes chicken but better and not oily at all! 
Now I know better cause I ordered chicken at the stockyards and it was oily compared to this one.

My sister had the burger. Was good. She found it rich. I don't know if they butter the bun or something. It was good but she couldn't finish it.

Fries were awesome! But you have to like black pepper as it is sprinkled on liberally.

Coleslaw was only meh. It was ok but nothing special.

Worth going back for the chicken. I had their house sauce. Kinda reminded me or sirracha but better.

I thought price was good $13 for 3 pieces of chicken with 1 side. Cost extra for the sauce though.
