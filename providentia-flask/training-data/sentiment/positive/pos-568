We scheduled the Sushi and Sake tour.  It was $100 a person but COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!!!  You learned and tasted multiple Sakes and you learned how to make sushi roles.   The hosts were terrific.  The food was AMAZING!!!   In addition to the sushi and Sake, we were treated to appetizers and desert.   I love sushi and this experience and quality of food was at the top of the places I've been to.   100% recommend it!
