Incredible from the first sip to the last bite. I went with a couple of Sunny Slope Iced Teas where there is a bevy of boozes deliciously combined into a glass. Hubby had a couple of 40's and we shared a poutine w/ skirt steak and a Notorious B.I.G. burger. The old school music was excellent. 100% chance of return.
