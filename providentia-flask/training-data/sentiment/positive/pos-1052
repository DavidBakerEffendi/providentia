Amazing food! Just tried it tonight on our way home from skiing. I had a Chicago Dog which was 100pct authentic! Neon green relish and sport peppers! The fries are amazing and they have malt vinegar on the tables which pairs beautifully! The cole slaw was very good and I saw but didn't try the chicken quesadilla which was literally grilled! 
Will definitely frequent seeing as it's on the way back from many places we visit outside the s hills!
