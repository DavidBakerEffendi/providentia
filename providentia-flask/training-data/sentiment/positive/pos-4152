For south Charlotte I would say this was well needed for the area. A good decent buffet with a big section of food. Not overly price and seafood selection was very decent, somethings it's a little heavy on the sauce but hell if your at the buffet line in pretty sure u don't give a damn about your health or WIEGHT so sauce it up bitches and give me seconds bc i can over indulge and get wheel barreled up out of that mofo hahahaha
