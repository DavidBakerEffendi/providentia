This place is absolutely incredible!! When you first sit down they immediately drop off chips with bean dip, two types of salsa, and grilled onions + peppers which was incredible. Not your average and boring table-side chips and salsa. The fajitas are amazing, they flame them at your table and it's a very large portion which also comes with a soup as an appetizer. The amount of food you get at this place is incredible and the prices are great! Our server was incredible. All around, it was an amazing dining experience and I look forward to coming back!!
