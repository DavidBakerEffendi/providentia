Let me start off this post by saying I am a huge CPK fan. I have found multiple dishes that I love and am never disappointed. 

This location is absolutely beautiful. They really did an amazing job putting it together.
That being said, I visited on a Monday afternoon and received amazing service. Really, so quick too! Maybe because it was empty but sometimes you get worse service when that is the case.

CPK offers bread free with some oil and their bread is delicious. On this trip, I ordered the B-B-Q chicken salad and it is one of my favorites... Always delicious and fresh!

Really, my favorite part of this CPK was the layout. It really gives you a great environment to be able to sit, relax, and enjoy a nice meal. You must check out this location!
