We LOVE Maxwell's Tavern!  The food is always fantastic, the service is great and the atmosphere is wonderful.  I typically get the veggie greek pita and it's awesome.  We've also gotten the potato skins as an appetizer twice and they never disappoint.  The Hubs loves the burger options, and we've eaten here several times with friends that love the burgers as well.  Great location in downtown Waxhaw, great food, great service.  Go!
