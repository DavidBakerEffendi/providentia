I tried Bertha's Cafe from a groupon.  WOW!!!  Is the only word there is to describe how fabulously tasty the food is.  I tried both the chicken pesto and the ham and havarti panini and the chocolate chip cookie.  The pesto on the chicken pesto sandwich was seasoned perfect, and the chicken is tasty and juicy without being dry.  The ham and havarti panini combination on this sandwich couldn't have been better.  I ate the chocolate chip cookie while I was waiting for my order.  I had planned on saving it for later, but one bite led to another and then another and it was gone before I left with my sandwiches.  And I usually am pretty good about exercising self-control, esp. when it comes to food.  Next time, I'm not even going to take a bite of my cookie so I can REALLY save it for later!!
