A Sandwich would be the last thing I will say if you ask me what I want to eat. This place changed my opinion. We got the ham and cheese sandwich. I finished half of the sandwich in 5 mins in the car! It was so good! Their pecan pie is out of this world! Food lovers and sandwich lovers, you have to try this place!
