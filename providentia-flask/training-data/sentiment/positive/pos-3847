Beyond being the best philly cheese steak I have had and being run by an incredible family, I had to share one of the most outstanding displays of customer service that I have ever seen. Found myself asking "is this real life?"

There I was stuffing an amazingly soft and tasty cheesesteak (with onions and sauce) when random patron two tables down derp dropped his sammich on the floor. One of the daughters of the owner (I never got her name) swooped in and said "did you drop it?".....patron looked up in shame and said yeah. 

Best part is within thirty seconds and upon utter insistence he had a new one made at no cost. Patron delivered with an extra large tip. I didn't know places were this caring or on too of it....seriously, this is the customer service and care that grandparents reminisce about. 

Keep it up ladies! You are have become a staple on chandler with your excellent food and even better genuine care for everyone who sets foot in your place. One of your daughters told me you all moved from out of state to start a new beginning here.....I hope to be a proud customer for years to come!!!!!
