so I decided to come check this place out and have some lunch since I'm with salmon lover I decided to go with a salmon with a side of vegetable fried rice and the sake sangria.

I was seated right away the restaurant only had about three tables set with people including myself the waitress was pretty fast and friendly all together I say I spent about 50 bucks.

the atmosphere was pretty nice and cozy the food was really delicious and if need be I would definitely come back for another try.
