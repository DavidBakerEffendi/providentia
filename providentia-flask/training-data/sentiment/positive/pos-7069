We just had a great meal with friendly service!  We had the carbonara and it's one of the only places we've found that makes a real carbonara and not just use alfredo sauce. We also had the rigatoni with vodka sauce and it was loaded with a spicy Italian sausage and great flavor. Their bread was so delicious we actually bought a loaf to take home!
