We were greeted by a happy wait staff and treated to a free beer -for a tip- and were able to get a table outside in just few minutes.  My friend and I ordered the London broil pita tziki sauce-recommended by our waitress. The meat was very tender and the entire meal was great! Will definitely be back!  Oh and the ladies room was neat and clean!
