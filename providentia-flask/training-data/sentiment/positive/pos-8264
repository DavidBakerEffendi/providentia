This very busy place lives up to its reputation!  I wanted something healthy and somewhat low carb and settled on the Lavosh vegetarian style.  I had never had Lavosh before and I was pleased!  The vegetables were well cooked and the Lavosh crisp.  I had enough to take home for lunch the next day and it was just as delicious.  Service was quick, had just started talking to my lunch mate and our lunch was there.  When I want something different, I will definitely return to Pita Jungle.
