I've been to this place a handful of times over the last few months and tonight my boyfriend of 4 years dropped some pretty heavy news.

Him: I have to tell you something.
Me: (between bites of delicious creamy gelato goodness) ok...
Him: (hovering over a mountain of peanut butter and rocky road gelato) I think I'm falling in love with the gelato lady.
Me..can't blame ya. Give me a bite of that rocky road.
