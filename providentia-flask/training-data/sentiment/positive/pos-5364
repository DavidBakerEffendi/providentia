Hands UP! Best sandwich in town!  But you do not need me to tell you that! The reason I am slapping down 5 stars is for the unexpected exceptional service.  

I needed to order a few sandwiches for work last week on the fly and of course everyone voted for Vermont Sandwich Company.  It was around 9am and they did not open until 10:00 ...which was the time my starving coworkers were expecting me to feed them. I pressed my luck and gave them a ring and to my surprise I was greeted by a friendly voice, helpful suggestions, and most importantly fresh and ready lunch for fifteen with a 10am pickup... a couple great catered platters of miscellaneous quartered sammies & chips.

Thank you Vermont Sandwich for not being too hip or hungover to take my order! You now have another devoted follower
