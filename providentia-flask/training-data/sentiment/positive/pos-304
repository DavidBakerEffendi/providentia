I was so impressed with our meal at The Good Fork, during a midweek city getaway. I had the Hummus Bowl with Halloumi and was impressed with the amount of flavour and how filling the bowl was! My boyfriend had the slow roasted brisket sandwich and the meat was wonderfully tender and delicious. I also had a latte and can honestly say it's one of the better coffees I've had in a long time!

Can't wait to try it again!
