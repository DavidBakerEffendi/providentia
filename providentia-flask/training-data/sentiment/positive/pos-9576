This place is fairly new and right around the corner from me. I ordered the won ton soup as usual. It was excellent. (I always request extra cilantro - I no longer have to because they know now how I like it) The Hot Basil is pretty much my regular meal there. I ask for Thai hot and is usually comes just right. The cashew nut with chicken is very good as well. My wife got the pineapple fried rice. It was ok. Not my favorite fried rice. But what throws them over the top is they have Pepsi. Not Coke. Highly recommend this place as one of the best Thai in Gilbert.
