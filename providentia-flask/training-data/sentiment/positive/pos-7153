I have been to Bottiglia twice and I really like the restaurant and the food.  Last evening,  I sat on the patio and enjoyed the late summer day in the upper 80s.  The misters were working and it was almost too cool at times when the wind blew the mist toward me.

Michelle was my main server who was later helped by Doug as Michelle had a party inside the restaurant.  Michelle gave me some recommendations before I ordered.  I went with them halfway.  I chose the beet salad (not the appetizer she suggested).  For the main course, I chose the king crab bucatini.

The beet salad was excellent as was the bucatini.  For dessert, I chose unwisely by getting the lemon poppy seed doughnuts--not because they weren't good but because it was so much to eat.  The lemon flavor with the blueberry dipping sauce made a great combination.

Service was excellent.  Between the two servers, my iced tea and water were kept filled, they checked in with me often, and they were pleasant, friendly servers.  The food food, the pleasant surroundings--inside or out--
and the service will keep me coming back.
