We have lived in Chandler for many years and never knew this place existed! Very happy we found it on a random search for good breakfast food! My Hubby and I had a tasty meal on the patio, enjoyed the greenery, and listening to the rescue birds from The Perch next door. Good portions for cost. Fast food, and they were busy! Hub had the morning monte and I enjoyed the cheddar buscuit and gravy! We will return!
