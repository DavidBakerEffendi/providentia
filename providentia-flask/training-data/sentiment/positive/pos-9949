Love Ravi Soups - especially on these chilly/cold Canadian days...

Been coming here for years now.

ATMOSPHERE: Casual and very hipster. It's a small space with a few small tables and one big wooden communal table. Decorations are rustic. The food comes served - as you can see in photos - on a wooden lazy susan, which is fun, but on occasion you get a dud and it spins as you're trying to eat a dripping wrap, or soup... 

There's a small patio in the back is available on warmer days. This place is always packed! There's often a long take-out line. But they're super fast & the you'll get your food in no time.

SERVICE: Service is always quick and efficient - despite the long line at the counter. Order over the counter, and then grab a seat if you're dining in. They bring the food to you. Self serve water.

PRICE: Very affordable for generous portions. Large helping of Soups or a Wrap range from $7.99-$8.99. If you're very hungry then get the soup AND wrap combo. 

FOOD: I love their intense flavours. Some border on spicy/hot. If you're one who prefers milder and subtler flavours  - Ravi may not be your cup of tea/soup. :P

If you order soup on it's own, it comes with this awesome flaky scone, with red pepper jelly on the side (a lovely complement to their soups).


I'm definitely a repeat customer here!
