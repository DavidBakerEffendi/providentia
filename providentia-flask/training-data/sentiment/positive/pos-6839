Came here for lunch. Was greeted and seated promptly. Everyone was extremely warm & friendly. Our waitress was fantastic! Wish I remembered her name. The food was fresh & good. Also didn't take too long despite the place being full. My favorite thing about this place was the decor! Very fun & authentic old Vegas atmosphere. Love coming at night as the fire pits are lit. Love this place.
