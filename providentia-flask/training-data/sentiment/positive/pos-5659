Discovered this by happy accident- and cannot wait to go back! I eat gluten free and finding a good cookie ( that someone else bakes) has been extremely difficult until today! My family  (who eat gluten) literally fought over the cookies--and then I brought out the macaroons... Typically- my husband is the only taker of macaroons- and he likes them particularly when we are in Europe. These macaroons were literally the best my family has ever had! We only got 2  (his favorite- tiramisu) and the peach. We all had the SAME reaction- these were like none we had ever had- anywhere! We will now become regulars- and can't praise them enough! Oh- and very friendly service as well!!!
