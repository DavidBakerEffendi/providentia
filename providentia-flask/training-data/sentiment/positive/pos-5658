Beautiful show.. and also nice it's for free!! It reminded me directly of oceans eleven... that they were standing there at the end of the movie.. wow I didn't rob a casino but standing there with that loud music and amazing sound when the water jumps out which sounds like explosions going off.. looking at the bellagio and realizing 'Damn im in vegas!' That's really a cool and happy feeling !!
