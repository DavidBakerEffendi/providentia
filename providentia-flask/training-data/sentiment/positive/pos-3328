Three of us recently had an excellent dinner here! The staff were all great and treated us special without being pretentious. The food was amazing! We had the formaggi + salumi platter to start and that (along with the bread), was delicious! Our entrees were all excellent. My companions had the Braised Short Ribs (nice!) and the Chicken Piccata (quite good even if the sauce was a touch too salty). I had the Pappardelle Bolognese and it was the best pasta with bolognese sauce that I've had in decades! We were expecting good but not expecting to be as blown away as we were. Good job, Bottiglia! We'll be back!
