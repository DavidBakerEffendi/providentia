I love this place! The food is amazing, reasonably priced, and everyone who works here is super friendly. 

I've gotten the taco special several times and tried a variety of meats, mostly the chicken and beef. I've also had the carnitas burrito and the dry ribs (which are AMAZING!!!). Everything has been spectacular. 

Give it a try sometime!
