STEP AWAY FROM THE CREPE BRITANY! Is what I need someone to say to me on a regular basis. I have been this Demetres far more times then I care to admit. I love strawberries and whip cream and tend to order Blush or the Last Straw. Recently I've decided to branch out and tried Pomme Pilot and Tongue Depressor. They were good but i'll stick to my old faithfuls. For any of you that haven't been the Demetres in a while they revamped their menu last year and now they have options for my lactose intolerant brothers and sisters. I've adapted a yolo attitude so it doesn't really make a difference but I appreciate the effort. Don't be fooled by the famous waffle and crepe pictures they also offer cakes, sundaes, milkshakes, coffee, tea, etc. One of my favourite places to go to satisfy my sweet tooth.
