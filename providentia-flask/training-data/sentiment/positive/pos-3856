finished up restaurant week 2009 with a light but solid pre fixe $30 dinner at Roy's Fusion Restaurant. The bonus? The contribution they make to 3square.org.  Didn't try anyone else's dishes but i chose the appetizer trio of shrimp, pork shortribs and more pork (szechuwan style), came also with a trio of sauces. i was licking my fingers just to savor every last bit.It was a tossup choosing between my favorites:  the pecan crusted rainbow trout or the herb crusted shrimp. chose the latter and glad i did. they served it with a mushroom and lobster risotto that was divine (lick fingers, check, now lick plate! check)  2 friends got the maui onion sirloin and multi spiced pork chop and raved about them. The perfect wine pairing i had was a glass of mer soleil from ca, not a wine connoisseur myself, but it tasted citrusy with a slight smoky flavor.  i was so proud that i picked it myself.  dessert was the perfect fluff end to dinner, delicately light, upside pineapple cake with homemade coconut infused vanilla ice cream. sorry, no pics to share, i gobbled it up at warp shutter speed.

For what it is, can't wait to go back to try their regular menu; even if it's a chain. Service was timely, the food was worth every penny, and the proceeds went to a great cause.  All considered, a well-rounded 5 stars.
