Best "so called" Sport Bar in the valley ... an its in my back yard ...thats why it gets my 5 star attention. 

The moron's that rate it any lower ... stay the hell out of my bar!

They have 4 Peak's beer on tap, stiff pour drinks, great service, a small yet diverse menu (and get this.. grind their own angus beef & fresh dip onion rings. Who does that?

If you like the taste of fresh quality beef, I've found no better burgers in town. Order them with no sauce and revel in there beefy goodness. 

On the lighter side, order the Mahi taco's. If you want to taste the quality of the fish special order them with "very light' seasoning. That mean's no canjun seasoning, ask them for even reduced quantity of their normal salt & pepper. This goes for all their seafood IMO. 

You can thank me later, I'll be at the bar.
