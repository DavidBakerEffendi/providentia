If I could give ten stars I would. I love love love these macarons. I've been everywhere in the country and I always try macarons in each city I visit. While PHM or Laduree in NYC and Paris is amazing, in Phoenix this is the only place to buy them! They're so good. Every flavor is divine and I should mention Abby is the funniest and sweetest woman ever. I love the apricot, the cherry, grand marnier, the strawberry champagne, I had a mint raspberry and almost died...there's a slice of fresh raspberry in the middle of the mint buttercream. I literally tried six today and feel like more. GOOOO! Stop reading. Just go :)
