Right across from Green and Nami, The Coronado is a house converted into a restaurant. Upon entering, they had coffee, beer, and pastries. I ordered from the happy hour menu, which is a huge chunk of the menu, and got my number. I chose patio seating on these huge patio tables. I picked the fried guacamole, which was pretty standard, and the red bean quesadilla. I didn't think this would be good, but it was amazing! It's savory with red peppers and a nacho cheeze sauce on top and they provide huge portions. I only ate half and saved the rest for later - unfortunately, the tortilla got soggy so it wasn't as good the next day.
