One of the best patios.

I've been here several times and each time is amazing. They have an awesome patio, awesome drink specials, and just an awesome brunch in general. I haven't been here for dinner but I will check this place out if I'm around! 

Their Peach Mojito special is sooooo good and not too sweet. Their caesar isn't too shabby, but nothing too special. 

I gotten the squash soup which was around $5 and LOVED it. 

The decor is really cute on the patio as it over looks down Augusta. You can people watch all you want haha.The servers are friendly but not as helpful as I would like. but I'm still going to give them 5 stars because of the amazing daily drink specials and the patio.
