This place is amazing! The avocado curry is truly unique and delicious. The staff is friendly and inviting, even though we mostly order delivery the restaurant is clean, but a little small. They have completely taken me away from the Tempe Thai Basil, which is sad because they even knew me by name there, did I mention I love Thai food... It's sad when the owner recognizes your phone number and says "hello Mr Freeman"
