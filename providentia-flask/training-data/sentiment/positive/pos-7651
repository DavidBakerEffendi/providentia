Cute place in Chefs Assembly hall. They had a small menu but I was intrigued by their Lamb Baklava and Lebanese taco. I've been to bar Reyna in yorkville which was tasty so decided to try this place. 

We decided to try both versions of the taco - reyna spiced chicken and falafel. The falafel taco was pretty standard and the spiced chicken was a bit bland, but what really highlighted their taco was their unique shell! It was slightly crispy but super soft and flavourful at the same time. Definitely a must try! Since we also had some sauces from other stalls, I just added some spicy sauce to the tacos. 

The real mvp of Reyna was their lamb baklava. I have never tried anything like that and I was blown away. From the texture to the flavours to the presentation... everything was ON POINT. I could eat a whole lasagna piece slice of this! Too bad it was just a tiny square but man oh mannnnnnn I wish there was more. Made me wondering where I can get some more savoury baklava's! 
Must try at Reyna!
