Years ago I went to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and while there fell in love with Louisiana cuisine. Po' boys, beignets, cafe au lait, gumbo, jambalaya and the many other dishes that originatedin the region. 

Having said that I visited  Streetcar Po' Boys today and was very pleased. From the moment we entered we were immediately greeted by the hostess (D'nis but pronounced Denise) and sat in our booth. We quickly made our selection starting with a nice cup of cafe au lait and some beignets. Both were very good and it reminded me of the ones I had at Cafe Du Mond in the French Quarter in downtown Orleans. 

My friend ordered the shrimp po boy and I had the catfish. According to the kitchen staff everything they make is made in house and the bread is ordered directly from New Orleans. And you definitely could taste it. 

My Catfish filet was very tasty. The breading was the right amount of crispy and flaky. On top of that they offered us a very tasty banana bread muffin - on the house for dessert. Can't go wrong with that! 

I'll definitely be back.
