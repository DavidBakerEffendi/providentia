This place makes me happy and has a little spot in my tummy. Located in downtown Tempe at the heart of it all Mill Ave this place is usually packed. I'm not going to go into all the reasons I enjoy this place there are too many but I will highlight a few things (1) You can order online and come pick it up (2) They have a great outdoor patio. My recommendations 

Breakfast- grilled wheat germ granola
Sandwich Hot- Portobellini
Sandwich Cold- smokehouse avocado stack
Salad- Original Chop (My FAVORITE SALAD) the presentation is colorful and beautiful, taste is scrumptious, and pesto dressing is amazing 

Only downfall is it closes at 3pm too early for me.
