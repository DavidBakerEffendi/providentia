I've heard nothing but good things about this place so I finally decided to try it for myself. Can't believe I haven't been here sooner since my friend lives literally down the street

Let's start with the food. For appetizers I had the truffle fries, crab spinach dip with pita bread (fried and grilled), and the pesto gnocchi-- all appetizers are a 5/5 rating because they were super delicious! For my meal- my sister and I got the spicy seafood pasta (5/5 rating) with average spice level and it was the perfect spice-- not too light of a spice and it wasn't over the top spice. My sisters boyfriend got the ribeye steak which looked delicious but he said it may have been a little too "fatty" for him.. I didn't taste it so I'm not going to rate it but it looked good to me!

The decor in the restaurant was nice and not what I expected. I almost felt under-dressed walking into here with my leggings and slippers.

The customer service was on point! She was on it with recommendations and checked up on us regularly. 

I will DEFINITELY be back because there was so much more I wanted to try.... like the crab and shrimp ravioli. OH and they do brunch EVERYDAY until 3PM. I gotta try their brunch for sure!! This restaurant definitely did not disappoint me.
