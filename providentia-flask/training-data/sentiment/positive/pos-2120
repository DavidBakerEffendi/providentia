This is my favorite lunch/breakfast spot to eat at when we are in town. I end up getting the same Kayla's Salad. The salad has diced apples, walnuts, golden raisins and blue cheese crumbles. I highly recommend a half salad because the whole one will feed 3 people easily. 

They have several options for breakfast and lunch. Service is excellent and most of them have been there for at least 4 plus years. 

Go early the place gets packed fast once the doors open up!
