I ended up on this side of town one day and Buldogis popped up on my yelp app when I put in a search for places nearby so I just had to try them.  So glad that I did. I have never had such a massive hot dog in my life. I am overwhelmed as I am writing this review about my experience. Inappropriate I'm sure, but I just have to agree with Paola C..."the sausage is so good... Thick and crunchy! " lol. 
They serve korean inspired hot dogs. Which is just amazing as it sounds. So many unique hot dogs to choose from and toppings/sauces to add. The hot dog was so frickin delicious.  

The staff is friendly and very helpful in giving you suggestions on what to order and answer any questions you may have. The shop is cute and showcases all of their press features along the back walls. There are cute dog decorations all over the restaurant...pun on the hot dog concept.  

Do yourself a favor and stop in for some extremely delicious and memorable eats.
