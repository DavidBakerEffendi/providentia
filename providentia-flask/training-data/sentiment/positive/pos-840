Fort Mill needs good food and this one has it down.    I ordered the greek salad with a side of tzatziki sauce and added chicken.  The sauce...is ...well it is much better than mine and I am a pretty good cook.  The salad had big chunks of feta and REAL greek olives.  Was above my expectations.  I did not want to order fries but had heard they were very good.  I let Nick know I would love to taste them. but did not want a full order...he offered me a few and oh yeah...
Best fries anywhere around!  He gets an A+ too for hospitality.  So glad to have this restaurant in our town.
