Came for dinner. Enjoyed our meal on the patio since we brought the dogs. Very dog friendly restaurant and brought our dogs treats. Great meal - had the veggie pasta dish and husband had the ahi hummus appetizer. Mmmm. For dessert we had peanut butter mousse parfait minus the corn nuts. Not quite daring, I know. Still delish!
