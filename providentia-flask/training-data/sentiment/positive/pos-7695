If someone asked me to pick my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, Avenue B would be my top choice. This place has a quiet and intimate setting with not many tables. The tables are close together but I don't find it overly intrusive.

With every visit there is always a new menu with many seasonal items.  The food is always top notch and the service is stellar. Add in the fact this place is BYOB and you have the recipe for greatness. 

On a recent visit with great friends, we had yet another fine experience. This is a great place for a fantastic dinner.
