How have I not made a review for Juan's yet!  Fabulous! The service is always top notch, I love that all of the workers work as a team it makes everything run so smooth! The food is awesome and consistent. The fajitas really as flaming and amazing! Taquitos are good tacos are yummy everything has been great! I don't live in the Southwest at all but go that way just for Juan's! Never had any cocktails there but there's a full service bar which is awesome if we ever go without the kiddos. The only thing I really dislike is their lack of waiting area...you're constantly in someone's way when waiting and often end up standing outside. If they could figure out how to expand that area this place would be perfect!
