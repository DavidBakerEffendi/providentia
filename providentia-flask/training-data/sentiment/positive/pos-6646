I love the green jalepeno tabasco sauce that they have at Chipotle, its amazing with any burrito/burritobowl.  

they are open till 10pm only on most nights while subway is open til 12am.  

Other than pleasing the tastebuds Chipotle meals are extremely healthy filled with herbs, vegetables, healthy carbs...vitamins, minerals and fiber.  they are also a eco-conscious company and use organic and local produce when available.  I love their recent addition of the choice of brown rice instead of white rice.  You can't tell that you are eating brown rice.  

If you'd like to keep the meal healthier, I would skip the sour cream, cheese and burrito wrap and pick a burrito bowl.  not trying to be a health freak but you just feel better when you eat healthier.  :)

Pretty much one of my favorite places to get a meal in Oakland even tho it's a huge chain.
