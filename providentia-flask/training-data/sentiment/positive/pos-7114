My new favorite is the Poke Bowl.  Its a mound of the best freshest tasting tuna, spiced up with chips around the bowl.  After that I like to follow that with the UFC Roll, the Lahina Roll with Salmon inside and out and Soft Shell Crab.  

Everything I have had at 808 is fresh, made to order and with the freshest of ingredients.  The crab in the rolls are all from real crab meat, no imitation crab here!

A nice drink is the Asian version of the Peach Bellini.  It goes well with the sushi.

Chef Chadd will take good care of you at the Sushi Bar.
