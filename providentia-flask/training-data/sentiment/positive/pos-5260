urban beans how I do love thee.

the espresso shots are pulled to perfection and i've never had a bad drink out of the 20 or so i've had so far here. the pastries and sweet treats are delicious. the toffee is to die for. the muffins make me melt. the tabouli and hummus are delish. the bagels are fresh. the goat cheese torte made me lick the plate clean. their smash drinks are amazing and i'm partial to the s'mores one. better than dutch bros sweet coffee treats. hands down.

the best part is that everything in here is locally made and environmentally friendly.  from the cups which are made from corn and totally compostable to the friendly, down to earth staff that makes the place a truly great coffee spot. so many other coffee joints in the area want to claim they are local and environmentally friendly and blah blah blah, but really, the most they can lay claim to is that their coffee comes from somewhere in AZ. virginia, the owner, really prides herself on obtaining everything in the places from locales. with all the coffee options out there, make urban beans your first choice.
