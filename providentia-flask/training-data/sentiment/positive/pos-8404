Just Awesome!  

Went in here for the first time a couple of months ago.  Had the meatball sub.  I love the meatballs!!  Very tasty. While there the owner came by and asked if it was my first time here and I said yes, and then he gave me slice of pizza to try!  It was really good!  It is on the greasy side but that's what makes it taste so good.  I mean it wasn't overly or anything, just more taste than other pizza.  I don't know I loved it.

I also order out from time to time from this place.  The online ordering system is quite easy to use.  I don't beleive they give you a time of when they will deliver like some places but about 45 minutes sounds about right.  If they have any questions for you they will call you and ask.  I know one time I placed an order for meatball parm and I got the meatball sub and called it in and they made a return trip to give me the meatball parm :) that was very nice, I was more concerned that I received the wrong order! 

Very nice...very good on service too.  I've had no problems with them that they didn't take care of me.  Also the prices are not bad, very affordable.  I love eatting their parm, it's like spagetti and meatball but with baked cheese on top that's nice and gooy yum!  Always fresh and hot when it gets delivered...If I feel like staying home and getting some pasta this is my go to place. :)
