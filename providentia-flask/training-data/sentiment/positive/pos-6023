Don't miss this gem! The buffet has a great selection of vegetarian and meat dishes and they're all delicious! The menu items look great but I haven't made it past the buffet yet. I've been here twice and I'm sure I'll be back for more. A nice family run restaurant serving something a bit  different from all the chain restaurants in the area and at great prices.  What's not to like?
