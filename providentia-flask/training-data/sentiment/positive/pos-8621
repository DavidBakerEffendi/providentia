Came here for The Lulaworld Festival and was thoroughly impressed. 

As a clueless white boy, I have little to no dancing skills. After a couple of drinks and a salsa lesson that roped in most of the dinner crowd, we were dancing the night away.

The food and music was all authentic and amazing. It's like going to Cuba except the foods better and there are running toilets.

All in all, a night to remember.
