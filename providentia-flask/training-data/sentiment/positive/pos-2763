Five stars for having the incredible Impossible Burger on the menu, and for cooking it so deliciously. It's so delicious, even my carnivore mom was really impressed. It's a shame your fried foods are off limits because they are cooked in lEd, but props for pointing that out right on the menu. And thanks for the free pickle bar too.
