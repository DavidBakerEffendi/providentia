WOWZA! Who would've thunk it that there were so many awesome ways to flip a chicken over a fire!
I love Huli Huli (Hawaii), Peri Peri (Peru), Rotisserie Tandoori and just plain old BBQ Rotisserie! 
Now I can add Portuguese chicken to my list. 
Carnivores, Romados is a must eat when you are here in Montreal!

Like most great foods Romandos is located in a skech neighborhood (I was later informed that it is in fact a sought after neighborhood to live in so my bad! ) about .2mi away on a side street off of the post St. Denis but man it was worth the risk! As soon as you veer off of the main drag you can smell the chicken! Just follow your beak (no pun) and it will lead you to the spot.

The place looks fresh and remodeled. Judging by the setup, they are prepared for insane lines. Luckily for me there was no line at 8pm and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. 
I got a 1/2 chicken and some unnamed desserts; one tart and another thing that looked like an ice cream come. 
Dude the chicken smell filled up my car and turned me into one of those eating and driving people that we all hate. 

The chicken was awesome! No need for sauce, ketchup or any other dressings. It was nice and juicy and even glazed the fries with some of its awesome. The salad was a bust as the chicken was hot off the fire and caused the greens to wilt before I could eat it. Keep the greens and give me more chicken!

One last note: Cute Portuguese girls that speak French: Mind Blowing!!
