This one brings in a crowd.  The pond spans nearly a city block with plenty of water front viewing space to watch the fountains spray water in motion to like to music.  Trust me the experience is better than the description.  The music comes from a more refined collection of classics or opera...it's the Bellagio, I'd expect nothing less.  The water show happens pretty frequently; between every 15 minutes to every 30 minutes depending on the day.
