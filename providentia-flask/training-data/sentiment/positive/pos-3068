Living in Henderson for many years all my friends drive out to Boulder City to come here.  I am thinking wow that is far but it really is only 15 mintues from my home - go figure.  I finally made it her yesterday with myself and three kids.  I ordered the turkey burger with fries, two cheeseburger kids deal and one chicken strip kids meal.  The service was quick and the food was awesome.  My turkey burger had wonderful flavor and I tried the kids meals and I can say they were all good.  Now, the big hype of this place "Gotta try the fry sauce to Try the fry sauce to fry sauce rock"  Yes! Yes! Yes!  I don't know what is hidden in that secret bottle the fact that they keep it cold and the fact that is had a wonderful taste - I am sold.  We will come out in the future.  Loved it!
