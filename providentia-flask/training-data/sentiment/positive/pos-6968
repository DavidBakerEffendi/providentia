Came here for a late night dinner and had a very good experience. Showed up 5 minutes before close with my girlfriend and the staff were more than welcoming, encouraging us to stay and explaining the menu thoroughly. You can tell that they really take pride in the food that they serve. Complimentary nachos were hot and fresh and the salsas were great. Definitely the best thing I tried was the beef brisket quessadilla, hands down the best quesadilla I've ever had, served with a side of very fresh guac. With pricing similar to franchises like Chipotle and Fat Bastards, it's a no brainier to stop by Ay Caramba.
