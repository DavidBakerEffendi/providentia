Pizza 3000 is by far the best pizza for the price!  Whenever I have a lazy, I-don't-want-to-cook, day I order their pizza.

They have a pick-up special, usually I get the XL, unlimited toppings, for $12.99 +tax!!  The inside of this place is very clean, a good thing in my eyes!  No matter when I phone to order, it only takes 20 minutes for the pizza, even when they are super busy!  It shows how well they have this place running.  The pizza is always piping hot and the toppings fresh.  They do also have pizza by the slice, as well as special prices when ordering 2 or more pizzas.  Their other food options, like bread sticks, garlic bread, wings are all decently priced.  They are closed on Mondays.  They are open until 3am on the weekends! 

I will continue to eat their pizza on a weekly basis, it would be a sin not to!  I highly recommend trying this place, you won't be disappointed!
