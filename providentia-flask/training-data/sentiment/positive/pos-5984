With all the cold weather, and specifically snow, you would think it was time to visit a place with a name like "Olaf" (you know, from Frozen? Come on, people), but I couldn't find one of those - so instead we went with Beauty and the Beast, and Lumiere.

Actually, the movie - and the name, and the climate - had little to do with it. The restaurant had simply been on the list for a while, and it was finally time to check them off. Good thing, as their service was amazing. Though we did not have a reservation, and probably aren't used to such places, they did not mind a bit, happy to take my raggedy self in, and they were great all around - even offering a splash of wine to go with our appetizers (of course, they were likely hoping we would get some more, but we'll get some next time).

To compliment the service, the food was also excellent - not everything was completely to our taste, but there are going to be times when you don't like everything, and that's okay - the fact is that it was prepared really well, and the service was spot on, which made it a great evening, so we will definitely be back to try more of the items on their menu.
