Sushi Samba is in the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Ventian Hotel on the Strip. The food is great, but absurdly priced. Nonetheless, I do think this is a eatery deserving of 5 stars because of the food and service. 

If you want some good sushi at a fair price, keep walking. If you want a fine dinning experience, keep waking. If you are willing to pay, really more than you should, for great food and service in a convenient location, have a seat, your server will be with you soon.

Everything on the menu is fantastic, from the tuna to the shrimp tempura. Their steak is cooked to perfection. The service is fast and friendly. They know the menu well and can guide you if you like. 

Sushi Samba, as part of the Canal Shoppes, is very pretty, but it is not even close to a fine dinning restaurant, yet that is what you will pay. Be prepared to spend $100 for 2 for lunch. Despite the lack of the whole fine dinning show put on in other eateries, this place is just really great. I assume their rent is outrageous and one of the reasons for the pricing. Because of this, I give them a pass on the cost of lunch in a "mall". The sushi at Sushi Samba is as good as any fine dinning place you will find in Las Vegas and you don't have to dress for dinner, so have fun.
