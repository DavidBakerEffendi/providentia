For a grad student that lives in this particular area of town, having a coffee shop has been a godsend! I come in quite often to grade and I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. The staff and owner have been nothing but excellent. I have enjoyed all of my orders. And they serve breakfast and lunch all day long! Some of the other reviews were a bit harsh--not enough of this or too much of that. Relax a bit and just enjoy! I'm so happy to have a coffee shop in town with a Latin vibe and with specialty drinks and food not offered at other locations.
