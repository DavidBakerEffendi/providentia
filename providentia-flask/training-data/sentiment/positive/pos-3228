My husband and I went here for dinner this week while staying at the Montelucia and celebrating our anniversary! I had purchased a Travel Zoo voucher for a 3-course meal for two plus two glasses of prosecco... for $39! Total! So even though I had never been there or heard of it, the deal was too good to pass up! I am regretting now that I didn't buy more as it was an AMAZING dinner and deal!!

We ordered the black mussels, which were so good! Also their Caesar salad, which comes with cashews on it instead of croutons... an interesting and delicious change from the norm! Between this and the bread, we were almost full by the time our entrees came. We both ordered filet mignon, even though it is an Italian restaurant, we were in the mood for some steak. The filets had a delicious sweet red wine sauce and good size! With our dinner we had the prosecco and then a bottle of Shoofly Shiraz...mmm! They have a promotion of half price bottles of wine Mon and Wed which added to the enormous savings we already got!

We had to get one of our desserts to go, but enjoyed the tiramasu there and the chocolate mousse later. 

We sat on the patio which has a lovely atmosphere and our server was friendly, prompt, and helpful! Even though we live in Ahwatukee, we were so impressed that we will definitely be back!
