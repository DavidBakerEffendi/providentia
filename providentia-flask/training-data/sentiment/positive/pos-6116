My husband and I tried this restaurant last night and I must admit I was not disappointed.  The waiter was friendly and helpful and the food was amazing.  My husband had the goulash which was just delicious and I had the chicken kiev which was the best I had ever had.  The little potato dumplings that came with the kiev simply melted in the mouth.  The plates were stunning and colorful with different slaws and fresh vegetables.  Service was a little slower than what we are used to but patience is rewarded with an amazing dinner.  We will definately be going back.
