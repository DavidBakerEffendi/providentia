What a delightful surprise to stumble upon this neighborhood local farm and market after I just ventured out in search of a new breakfast place! The wait for the breakfast restaurant was 45 minutes however after walking the farm, buying some fresh greens, produce and watching a duck lay eggs, I'm glad we decided to head back to the brunch building. We enjoyed amaziny "bltcda" (bacon, lettuce, tomato, chicken, dates, apple) half sandwich with soup ( cream of mushroom and Italian sausage were both amazing), potato salad,  greek salad and some sodas..  Needless to say, I can't wait to get back to Phoenix to try the breakfast with my cute boyfriend ;)
