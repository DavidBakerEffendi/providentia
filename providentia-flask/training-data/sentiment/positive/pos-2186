Took my wife here for her birthday.  I had heard some really good things, so decided to go see for myself - and my experience was amazing.  I've had gnocchi all over the place, and this was the best, most authentic I've ever had, bar none. 

Just as good as the food, was the service.  We were waited on hand and foot by Max, who was professional and polite, and answered all of our questions and met all of our requests with a smile.  The service was probably the best I've ever received at a restaurant.

The price was fair too - I've paid a lot more for mediocre food, so this was definitely a breath of fresh air.  I will definitely be back many times.  Love supporting a local business like this.

I would STRONGLY recommend this restaurant....as have most the other yelpers before me!
