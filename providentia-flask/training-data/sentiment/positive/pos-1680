once i tried this place i fell instantly in love. if you do decide to come to this pizza place i highly recommend to get the "white pizza" with sausage. its amazing! personally i hate really thin pizzas and love this place but its not too thin like other places that i tried. also their caesar salad is fresh and they put tons of cheese on top which is always a plus. because who doesn't love cheese?

you will not be disappointed!
