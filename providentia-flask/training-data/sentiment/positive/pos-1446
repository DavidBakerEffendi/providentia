My boyfriend and I were visiting Charlotte for about a week from Los Angeles, and I can say that the comics we saw at the 10pm explicit show on a Friday Night were more entertaining than the comics we had to pay twice as much to see in LA a month or so earlier. 

Some of the comics were a little nervous, but none of them totally bombed, and most of them were really great, had original hilarious jokes, and kept the night moving along with laughs. 

We only paid $10 each, and laughed more than we would at some silly Judd Apatow movie, so I'd say if you're looking for something to do in Charlotte, check this place out. 

It's also in a very cool part of town, with lots of good bars to check out, so make a night of it. We did, and had a great time.  (It's hidden in a bar called THE NOOK)
