This is my second time ordering take-out from here and both times they have been right on! I ordered the Lava Roll and the Pink Lady Sushi Rolls with the Miso Soup to finish it off. The rolls were a delicious as they were beautiful! The fish tasted fresh and the rolls were neatly assembled w/  plenty of ginger and wasabi to enjoy it with. My Miso soup was flavorful and just what I was looking for. I called in my order and service was quick and easy. Inside the restaurant it appeared to be clean and tidy, with the gentleman checking me out very personable and friendly. Definitely seeing this as my go to sushi spot!! Great food for a great price!
