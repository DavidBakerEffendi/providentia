This place deserves more than 3 stars! I had a veggie burger and was impressed with the quality. Definitely one they made in house rather than a quickly fried frozen one like you find at most places. 

Generally I'd say it's 4/5 stars but let's bump it up considering it's an airport/hotel restaurant and those have a tendency to be awful. The fact that this one is good at all pulls more than 3 stars in my book!
