This place is so addicting! Despite being busy every time I come here, the service has been fast! The food is very consistent and tastes great every time. Choolaah is such a great addition to the area.

I usually get the BBQ combo with chicken, tikka masala, and naan. The combo is so filling! The chicken is seasoned well, tender, and has a nice smoky aroma. The masala sauce is very smooth and packed with flavor with very mild spiciness. The naan is soft and has a bit of crunch on the outside. Eating everything together is such a pleasure! Recently, I've noticed they upped the size on the sauce! Also don't forget to try out some of their hot sauces near the cool hand washing station.

I've also had the lamb and salmon which were all equally delicious but the chicken is go to. I really hope that Choolaah expands to the Westside!
