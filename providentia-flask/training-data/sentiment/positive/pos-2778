Best brisket sandwich in town!!!! After trying different brisket options around town, that is my solid opinion. It's got it all: a perfect bun, sassy pickles, a huge amount of tender, thinly sliced, smoky, amazing brisket. So satisfying in every way! Eating it is a very, very, very good idea. It should win an award. Really!
