Don't wait in line for the indoor bathroom:  go outside and to your right, there's a 5 stall bathroom that never has a line :)

I played 4 square while listening to the DJ play Cupid Shuffle last night. This place always reminds me of middle school recess, but with alcohol instead of Caprisuns. 
Gold Spike is the locals spot. Those guys from High School you hoped to never see again? You will definitely run into them here. You may also run into your 50-something year old teacher from back then too, since a lot of older folks frequent here.  

Gold Spike is fun! Guys don't need to awkwardly stand around the bar or the bathroom to try to talk to girls. You don't even have to worry about having a drink in your hand at all times- I never know what to do with my hands if I don't have one! Play a game, invite some strangers over. No one will call you a creep :) 

I've never had disappointing late night drunk food..... until I had their fries. yuck :(
