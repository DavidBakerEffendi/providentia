Great new little place in midtown. Small but cozy, with some nice outdoor seating too. An impressive wine/beer list too. It would be cool if they had some draft beers too, but I appreciate the extensive bottle selection. Very friendly service as well. They also have a pretty killer happy hour, goes till 8pm!
