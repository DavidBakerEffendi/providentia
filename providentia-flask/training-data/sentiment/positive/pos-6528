I love this restaurant!  Definitely one of my favorites :)  I went to SushiSamba for lunch on my last couple of visits, and both times there was plenty of seating available, including their large comfy booth seating.  My go-to's here are their field green salad, rock shrimp tempura, shrimp tempura roll, and yellowtail jalapeño roll (about a $50 bill for 2 people and definitely a filling meal).  On previous dinner visits, I also had their yellowtail jalapeño and miso-marinated Chilean sea bass.  The food is quite tasty at this restaurant, and service is pretty good.  Our water glasses never go empty, and last time we had a cutie of a busboy clearing our table.  Also on our last visit, we had someone, whom I assumed was the manager, come to our table to drop off a complimentary scallop appetizer which was absolutely delicious.  What a nice touch, and as if I didn't already have enough reason to like this place so much!
