Love Ranch House Grille!
It was right across the street from our apartment so perfect walking distance when we wanted to get out of the house in the morning for breakfasts. My husband LOVES their chicken fried steak and I usually just go for the omelette or traditional breakfasts. 
All are good and the coffee is pretty darn good too.
