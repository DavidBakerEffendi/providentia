Fabulous lunch spot.  Quiet enough for good conversation   Great service.  They were flexible and allowed us to switch some things up on the menu items.  Delicious salmon cakes over greens. I would go back there just to eat the exact same thing.   Parking on the street was easy.  The staff seemed really interested in providing good service and they were personable.
