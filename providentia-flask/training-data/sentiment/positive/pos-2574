Fast + super nice service.
I like to put a lot of salt on the chips.
We always start w a tostada ceviche de Cameron I add squeeze of fresh orange their salsa & ketchup - soo good .. Tonight I Had the carne Asada plate w beans & fries-( came on sizzling plate like fajitas would )omg yummy
Fries are crispy .. Try w a ice cold Modelo or jarritos tamarindo!!
Tostada gets you close to full so we always take home at least 1/2 our dinner for leftovers that I bring to work..we get the flan too it's kinda like a cheesecake had a baby w some flan- my fav dessert anywhere
