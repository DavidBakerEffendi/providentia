I discovered this Wildflower at Seville location after my cycle class next door.   Frank, the  manager is nothing short of AMAZING!  He is always professional, hospitable and friendly! He bends over back to please the dining guests. Coming from NYC we sometimes can be hard  to please. The food is wonderful! And this Seville location is spotless! My mom being a retired health inspector gives a big thumbs up and firm stamp of approval! Keep up the great work Frank!
