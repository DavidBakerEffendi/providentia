Uh. May. Zing!!! We came for a post-wedding celebration and I had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Th Burger itself is a little on the small side, (compared to the classic cheeseburger) but it was honestly perfect for my appetite. The meat was juicy and the burger was stacked high with a knife to hold everything in place. 

We also tried a crispy fish taco and the shrimp tempura taco. Both were big in flavor, but I have to say the crispy fish was the favorite. 

The Misses ended up getting th classic cheeseburger and let me tell you, it was HUGE! (;P) Paired with the flavorful, crispy potato nuggets and the perfect amount of cheese, this burger was bomb. 

We would definitely come back to try everything on the menus. Kudos to the chef and friendly and cool af staff.
