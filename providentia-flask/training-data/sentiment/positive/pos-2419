I just found a piece of lox in my refrigerator. I bought here about six weeks ago right before getting ridiculously sick. Instead of grossing me out, the ancient piece of fish just made me want to go back to the Bagel Cafe to restock on fresh stuff.

It's about 35 minutes each way for me to get to Bagel Cafe, which seems like a long way to travel for bagels, but they are without question the best bagels I've had outside of NJ/NY. Having grown up there, I am very particular about bagels. You won't catch me dead in an Einstein. But these bagels are, in a word, fantastic.

They're oversized, big like real New York bagels should be. The crust of the bagel is browned just enough in the baking process, the crumb of the bagels remain chewy and moist.

Another feather in their cap: Bagel Cafe puts a TON of stuff on their bagels. Getting a dozen garlic always results in a massive pile of loose garlic in the bottom of the bag.

As much as I swoon over their bagels (I also really like the onion, asiago and jalapeno cheddar), there's much more here than that. I also like getting a little hand-sliced lox here - while I haven't had anything else from the deli, it all smells OH so good.

As for the dessert case ... I have to plead guilty here. The massive slabs of tiramisu, Napoleons, moist and fragrant macaroons, and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big) muffins, and best of all, rugelach - chocolate, raspberry, apple cinnamon and almond. Score.

A dozen bagels (which is actually 14) is just $10 here, which is sort of insanely cheap. Unfortunately, all the other non-bagel stuff here is so tempting that I wind up easily dropping $30 or more whenever I walk in the door.

But man, is it worth it.
