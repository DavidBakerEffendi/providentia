Special shoutout and thanks to Marcus, our awesome bartender and Lucas, the man who hooked us up with what Oprah calls "the best-turkey burgers in the entire world" at the bar at DJT. Apparently these "mar-a-lago turkey burgers" are only available for in-suite dining but we were lucky enough to try them this afternoon! (see my posted pix!)

they tasted as good as I had hoped and maybe even better! the ground turkey burger had so much flavor (special ingredients include chopped celery and granny smith apples and chipotle tabasco) and is served on a delcious brioche-like hamburger bun with generous slices of fresh avocado and a side of seasoned fries. YUM!

On top of all that, Lucas took care of the bill for these burgers. Talk about class A service. Thanks again!!!

the bf also had the chelsea cocktail which includes fresh blackberries, mint leaves, sugar can 10 rum, and club soda. that drink was so refreshing and tasty that he ordered it twice.  even the bar snacks were addicting -- the bowl of wasabi covered gobi berries were our favorite.

we will be back again and we will try to eat at the DJT restaurant too!
