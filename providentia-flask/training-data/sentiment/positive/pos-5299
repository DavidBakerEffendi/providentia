This places earns a legit 5 stars. Came here for lunch and was severed endless chips with bean dip and salsa. Chips, dip and salsa were so good we couldn't stop eating while waiting for the lunch entree. They were on top of drink refills and chip refills like some kind of magic from Disney land. It's hard to make me feel like I am on vacation while on lunch break but hey I really felt that way. I got the Mulitas and it was very good. The service coupled with food quality were out standing for the price. I will be back for sure.
