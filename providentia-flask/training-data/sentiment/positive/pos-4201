This place is extremely close to my job so I like to come here when I feel like not being healthy. They do have healthier options, but who can go to a place with such great chicken tenders and walk away with no chicken tenders.

The drive thru was a tad bit awkward for me because I didn't hear the girl tell me to go to the second window to get my food so I was kind of just idly waiting until she gave me this "what're you still doing here look"..oops

I personally like to get the chicken tender meal with fries. I'm sure the small will suffice but I always feel the need to get the meal with a little extra. Also, go ahead and do yourself a favor and different sauces that you haven't tried. I really like their sauces and I don't think you can go wrong with the options. 

The shakes are also on point. I just can't get them a lot because I'm almost absolutely sure I'll have a heart attack if I drink it while also eating all my chicken tenders. They're just that good.
