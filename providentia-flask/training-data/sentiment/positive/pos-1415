I've passed this place many, many times and but never gave it a second look because of it's location. (It's in a strip and I admit that I just assumed it was like every other sports bar because of that.) But a friend was told their food is great, so we went.

Even though it's location is sort of obvious, I'd call it a hidden gem. It's NOT like your average sports bar - there's a seated restaurant on the other side of the bar and you cannot hear the bar at all. 

Awesome service, delicious food, amazing mixed drinks, great atmosphere. I wish I would have visited sooner!
