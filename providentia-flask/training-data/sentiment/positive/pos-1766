Waiting for a conference to start one morning, I was a little early and wanted to find something to eat at the Cosmo.  The wife (M) and I walked by Eggslut and saw a line down the hallway.  "Must be pretty good if people are willing to wait that long for it," M remarked.  We walked around looking for something with a shorter line, but couldn't find anything we really wanted, so we got in line.

30 minutes later, we finally ordered a Slut and a Gaucho. And we weren't disappointed. 

I've never been so impressed with a Slut before, but this one had me wishing I could eat Sluts over and over again. My wife just about pushed me out of the way so she could eat my Slut. I begged her to let me take another Slut home, but she said no. Oh well. 

Eat a Slut and be happy.
