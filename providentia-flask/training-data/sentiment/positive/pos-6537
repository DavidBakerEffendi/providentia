Stopped by for lunch and it was fairly busy. The owner and server were very polite and caring. I ordered the noodle soup with wonton and pork with vegetables. Served in a large bowl, the food was fresh and appetizing. It's a small dining area but comfortable nevertheless. This is a great new place for locals to go for quality Thai food. The owner is very gracious and it's always nice to support a local business.
