Wow. Wow wow wow wow wow! Do you know how to spell Mexican food when you're in Vaughan? Simple - Ay Caramba, Eh! So why am I so emphatic about this remarkable hidden gem located in the back of a plaza which most restaurants would fail in? Because they do authentic street-style Mexican food... simply and do it well. No frill, no weird fusion like Korean beef tacos. NOPE! Just simple true ingredients that real Mexican people would use to feed their families! Muy Bueno!

It's a small shop, with limited seating but don't let that turn you off, these tacos are so easy to eat you really don't need a seat... eat them-them the REAL way, standing up with your head tilted to the side! Then as you mow through your first 3, point at the staff and toss up 3 fingers to signal you want another 3 - you totally will.

I've had every taco on the menu and I can't pick a fave. The beef, the pork, the chicken, even the fish. Light, flavourful, and always hit the spot. 

Other menu spotlights are they make their own hibiscus juice and other authentic Mexican beverages in-house AND even make their own tortilla chips with matching guac and salsa. 

It's a 5-star Mexican experience that will have you exclaiming AY, CARAMBA by the end!
