Nothing like what I expected. Now I know why they always appeared packed! Went for my wife's birthday dinner. Ordered and were seated in the bar until our spot was open. Super cool how you rent for the hour and can hit as many balls as you like in that time. An hour is a perfect amount of time for everyone to get their golfness out and feel a little sore the next day. I don't remember which hamburger I got but it was the one with the egg on it. It was awesome. Fries were great. I would have gotten my hamburger a little more rare next time. Loved it though.
