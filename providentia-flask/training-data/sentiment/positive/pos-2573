My favorite vegan spot in town! I always get the cauliflower tacos with fresh cut French fries. They are the shizz! The iced soy lavender latte is reason enough to come back, it's super smooth and not so sweet. I've also tried the corn on the Cobb during happy hour for half off, I'm not sure what time it was again. They have vegan pastries as well.
