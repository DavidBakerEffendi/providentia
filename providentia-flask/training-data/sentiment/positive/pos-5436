Not Ordinary Asian! 

This was among the BEST Asian food I have ever had in the Las Vegas area. Delicious from the Hot and Sour Soup to the Walnut Shrimp and Crab cakes in between. The food presentation was clean neat and crisp. Service was near the top but not many people there. I had an early dinner. Even the cheap desert was Mangolicious. My bill was $50 for one and while dining alone is not much fun I would do it again. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Keep up the good work.
