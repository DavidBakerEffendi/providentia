A great, yet almost unknown secret tucked away in a strip mall anchored by a grocery store; you would never imagine the culinary delights that await you when you walk in the door. The menu is more than just chicken, beef, pork and fish as each dish is a remarkable blend of palette engagement with bliss. Moderately to expensively priced, and a great place for lunch too! Full bar, lively atmosphere, with good friendly service! This was our 2nd visit.
