THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!  A beer store where you can sip booze while you buy it.

Its great that they finally seem to be getting some business.  They deserve it.  I guess they had too many Harris Teeters in a small area and when this Lowe's foods shut down they wanted something there but didn't need another grocery store.  This place is a beer and wine mecca with some dry and frozen goods as well.

I went last week for a NC beer tasting and the bar area was slammed.  With a great selection of $2 bottled beer I can see why.  I waited a minute or 2 trying to get a beer and just decided to go to the tasting.  Reps from all over NC giving tastings of their offerings.  Most notably, Sierra Nevada had some reps there, concreting their place on the east coast.  That was entertaining but I wanted to figure out what I needed to take home with me.

Me and my counterpart spent a good 30 minutes roaming the beer coolers.  Seeing many of things we had never seen before outside of draft at Duckworth's.  After picking up a couple of selections we headed back towards the bar since the line had died down.  After drinking a beer or 2 we had a thought.  It might be a good wine and cheese kinda night.  And what better place to procure said items.  The wine selection is almost overkill.  So many great choices.  We spent a good 20 minutes looking at Malbecs alone.  Once we had our 2 bottles we put some of the beer down and went looking for cheese.  They have a decent variety of cheeses but nothing special.  Once we noticed no redbox we knew we still needed to stop by a Harris Teeter anyhow so we figured we'd wait on cheese.

On the way out I noticed a pretty legit looking humidor.  Oh yeah, they have beer making supplies as well.

I like it.  Would be there all the time if it was a little closer.
