I love it here.  This is our local spot.  It's down the street and ready for us every time we walk through the wide double doors!  It's warm and inviting and there are lots of seats to fill.  Walk and in and take your pick.  There are TV's in every corner you look so sitting anywhere is perfect. 

There are a lot of regulars here..  and the wait staff is super nice and accommodating.  They are quick to come and take care of you when you need and always poppin' up behind you to refill your drinks!
  
Beer selections are awesome... they even have my fave: Linenkeugal!  LOVE.
Regular or LARGE.  Yes... there are options.  The menu is pretty much all bar food.  But not all bars offer good food.  SIERRA GOLD DOES!  

Gilroy Garlic is THE BEST.  They have lots of other goodies.. like the ahi tuna salad, the wings.... etc etc.  but... the Gilroy Garlic always does it for us.  

Looking for a cool local hangout.. this is a good spot to try!

PS: They have a little room called the VIP room I think... that you can reserve for 20.00 and host a little get together for friends during games and just for fun!
I recently reserved it for my husbands 35th birthday during the niner saints game...
We were able to just lounge and chill on the couches watch the game on 3 tv's.  It was a good comfortable time.  


they also have 2 pool tables! - i think you have to reserve them though!
