Awesome! I've only been here twice but it was delicious and I couldn't ask for anything more for $20 all you can eat. Service was friendly and timely both times I've been. If you're looking for top notch sushi probably not the place for you bouji sushi eaters lol but if you're looking for fresh food and cheap this is the place!
