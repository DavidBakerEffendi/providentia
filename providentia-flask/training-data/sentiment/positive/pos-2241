This sandwich shop is really great.  When you step in it's like going into one of those deli/sandwich places in a big city like NY or Chicago (I'm saying this from my own experience). It's cozy and there's a lot going on.  The prices are totally reasonable as well, you can get a lot of sandwiches for around $5 or less and they taste great!  I don't think most of the ingredients are local, organic or anything fancy like that but this is reflected in the low prices.  I've found a lot of sandwich/burger places charging $10+ for something made with the same quality ingredients. Also, a lot of their stuff is made in house (it's not just dumped from a Sysco freezer bag into the fryer) and tastes great.  A few sandwiches that I particularly like are the meatball sub, the tuna melt, and the Chicago hot dog.  Another great thing about Crostini's is that they deliver for a reasonable price (it's a $10 minimum and less than $2 delivery fee), so if you're feeling lazy or overwhelmed you can get your food brought to your door! All-in-all I highly recommend this place for a well-made tasty sandwich.
