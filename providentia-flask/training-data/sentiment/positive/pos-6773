After seeing multiple check-ins and an UYE that I missed, Art of Flavors was perfectly placed in my mind to try after trying the arepas place next door. Seriously, if you want to impress someone with great taste and not breaking the bank, may I suggest a Saturday night at starting at Viva Las Arepas, then Art of Flavors, and then heading to Dino's (all within realistic walking distance of each other) for cheap drinks and karaoke.

Art of Flavors is a small shop and soon as I walked in the door I was greeted with a warm hello and asked if this was my first visit. As soon as I stayed yes, she started dishing out the samples. She started of with their base gelato. Creamy, subtle, and light in flavor. She told my sister and I that flavors change and are made fresh daily. Before entering, my sister was like, nah, I don't want anything. After a few samples, she changed her mind.

I decided on White Coffee Bean and Salted Caramel. My sis opted for Chocolate Brownie. 

I will definitely be back. Great customer service, unique flavors (gorgonzola and pear, rice pudding) and something for everyone. They have vegan sorbets as well, which were sweet and fruity. 

Summer time is around the corner and if you're looking for a sweet spot to cool down and unique flavors, look no further than Art of Flavors.
