Came in to meet a client, the place is quieter than most Starbucks but then again it could just be the time I'm here (9:15pm). The place is on the smaller side, clean and the waitstaff were very welcoming and friendly. 

I ordered a chamomile tea and almond croissant while my client picked up an iced black coffee. 

Tip: it's a good place for reading and studying
