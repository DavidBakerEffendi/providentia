I am so glad I didn't listen to the reviews on here!!
This place is da BOMB!!
We ordered the Vegetable Korma and Samosas Choley Rais Malai & Keer (desserts) and a mango lassi. 
SERIOUSLY OMG ! BEST ! The desserts were sweet creamy one had a sponge cake thing. Both had cheese. 
The vege korma was so tasty and rich! The Choley was a fried puff with delicious vegies inside.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! We will be back
