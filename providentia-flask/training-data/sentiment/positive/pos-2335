I found this place here on yelp and decided to give it a try,great decision I did,once there was a fast service and heard the story of how this restaurant was made,from one of the owner partner,he told me what each plate was about and suggested me what I order. I'll definitely recommend it,and I heard they got more things up their sleeve coming soon,so I can't wait to stop by again and try something new on their menu! Go ahead stop by and share your experience too!
