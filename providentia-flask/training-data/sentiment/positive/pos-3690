I had a fantastic dining experience for lunch today at Daily Kitchen. The staff was upbeat and diligent. I appreciated how nice everyone was and how great our food was. This is a great addition to the limited healthy choices on Eastern and we will certainly be back. If only just to have more Rosemary Vanilla Lemonade, it's addicting.
