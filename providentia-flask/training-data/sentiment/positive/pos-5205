One of the best egg sandwiches breakfast places. I tried the one in Grand Central Market and that was delicious. So happy they had one in Vegas. The way the eggs are cooked melts in your mouth. I had the bacon sandwich and the chipotle ketchup is a perfect sensation. It kinda makes the flavors pop.  It is a little pricy and the lines are long but worth the wait.
