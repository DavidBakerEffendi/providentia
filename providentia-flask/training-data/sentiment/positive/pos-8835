Wow - very impressed on our first visit to AJ's Fine Foods!

When entering the store you are amazed by the smell of food. To our left was a wonderful bakery with some wonderful assortments of cakes, pies, and desserts. As we continued to roam, we went by the deli, soup bar, salad bar, and many other fine foods. 

The store was clean and very friendly! Prices were higher than average stores, but you pay for what you get as they say!

We can not wait to come back and have lunch outside on the patio - serving BBQ!

Will definitely be coming back and knowing I will be taken care of.
