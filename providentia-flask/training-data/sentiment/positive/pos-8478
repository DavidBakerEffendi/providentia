If you were lucky enough to pick-up a smoking hot babe at the Franciscan Renewal Center (see my review) this is where you want to bring her afterwards..It's right next door. 

Only don't let her fill up on the free cinnamon roll appy's. Huge rookie mistake!!!

According to Dr. Oz, ingesting copious amounts of sugar triggers a woman's pleasure center in her brain, making her feel like she just had one of those tantric eight-hour  orgasms Sting is always bragging about. 
Yes.
The same pleasure center you were hoping to satisfy, only without sugar.  

So for starters, wave off the cinnamon rolls and go for the Belvedere Martini, order it dirty. 
Order another half dozen or so. Catholic girls need loosening up a bit. 

Then skip the meal altogether and head for the nearest Hampton Inn, where tomorrow morning she can have all the sweets she wants from the free breakfast buffet. 

It wasn't easy going to church for the first time, but I'll bet you're thinking differently now.
