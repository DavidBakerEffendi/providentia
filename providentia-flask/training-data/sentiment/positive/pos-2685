Yelp help me find this place after visiting squires castle. I loved it as soon as I saw it. It made me feel like I wasn't in Ohio, as soon as you walk in there's a million things to look at, decked out in the most random of decor. The wait was a little long but that's a given on a Saturday evening. We were seated in a small booth close to the outside with an awesome view of the water and floating bar that looks like a carousel. Our waitress (Angie) was awesome and a hoot! Loved their drink menu and great appetizers to choose from! My fella and I both got the lobster which was delicious. I can't wait to go back!
