Was at nearby Green Valley Ranch when decided to look for near by diners.  Found out about Metro Diner figured give it a try.

From them moment I opened the door and the smell hit me I was happy.  Smelled so yummy.  The service was very nice friendly and knew their menu well.  Asked several questions and answers given right away.  Hate asking questions and getting the old I don't know I will find out.

The burger was soooo good...   Half pound of Angus beef burger topped with lettuce slaw (shredded lettuce, chopped pickle and mayo) in between two grilled cheese sandwiches stuffed with American cheese, ripe tomatoes and our own cherrywood smoked bacon.  Sooo yummy.

Try this place you will love it. I will be going back for sure...
