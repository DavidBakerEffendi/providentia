My Fianc√© took me to the Salt Cellar for my birthday. I love seafood and she does not. Bummer for me or this night, bummer for her. The place is very cool simply because its underground. It makes for a interesting topic of conversation. I ordered the king crab and she ordered a petite filet. Her steak was cooked perfectly and to her surprise it did not taste like seafood at all. I was impressed that the waiter actually cracked all of my crab right at my table. Made it easy for eating. I will return to the Salt Cellar again and again. Great food and great atmosphere.
