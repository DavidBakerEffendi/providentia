Really good food. It is located inside of Sinclair and the food is very good.  Fresh ingredients made to order right in front of you.  The quality of the product is fantastic.  If there was one knock, I would say the prices are mildly higher than a Roberto's, but that is likely because the ingredients are a bit superior.  Each of our burritos was $9 which is not a fortune, but if you are used to paying $7, it is a bit steeper.  However, you get what you pay for... :)
