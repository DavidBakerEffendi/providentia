Some people organize a private party once a year here as part of a convention. It's not cheap, but the all you can eat sushi has been pretty much the highlight of that weekend each year. It is freaking tasty. (I've had a decent amount of sushi; this place is some of my favorite.) I'm not local, though, so I've never been here except for that event; so I can't really comment on the service (it's always great when they're hosting a hundred person lunch party ;)).
