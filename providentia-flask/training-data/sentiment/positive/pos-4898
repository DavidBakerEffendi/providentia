What a beautiful lunch...

I had lunch at The Farm Kitchen where they serve fresh salads, sandwiches, soups, baked goods and freshly squeezed beverages like orange juice and lemonade. 

This has to have been one of the best lunches I've had which had a lot to do with the scenery but the food was also fantastic. 

I had a middle eastern soup with potatoes, chickpeas and spinach which was packed with great flavors and served with a piece of naan as well as half a ham & cheese sandwich that came with a slice of tomato, greens, dijon and creamy avocados. I ate everything up! Your food is served in wooden baskets and that's one detail that adds to this entire experience. And the fresh lemonade squeezed from their own trees was phenomenal. 

Everything comes together with the environment you're in. The setting is so beautiful that all I could think about was painting it. There are shaded seats around the restaurant as well as picnic style tables in the orchards. Birds are singing and the sun is shining through slivers of all the umbrellas. It's hard not to enjoy every single bite of your food here and I know that's a reason it all tasted even better.

If you find yourself in this area check this place out. There are several different restaurants here and they all have different hours and open dates so verify before getting out here. 

They also offer massages, weddings & special events here as there are several different businesses scattered around the farm. 

I really fell in love with this place and I think you'll enjoy it as well.
