Delicious! I'm so happy to have a great Thai restaurant in the neighborhood! I've only gotten takeout here, never ate in, but it appears to be BYOB. I'm a big fan of pad Thai and they have GREAT pad Thai. Takeout is always ready quickly and they get the order right. 
Update: They have a sign up now. When you see it, stop in & enjoy!! :)
