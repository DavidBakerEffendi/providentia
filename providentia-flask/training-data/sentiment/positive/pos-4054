Unique/Fun/Great Experience!
We dined in the afternoon which was a four course vegetarian meal (dinner is six course). This indeed is an all vegetarian restaurant. I am not vegan and never had a total vegan meal but I did enjoy it. Perhaps some people (if you're not vegan) may not be satisfied or feel full as some complain, but I didn't come for the food. I came for the great people I was with, to laugh a lot and for the unique experience and I really loved it.  I won't go into details because the other reviewers already did  but what I was happy to know in advance was to know and prepare myself for pure darkness....no shadows....nothing! When you first walk into the dining room you are like WOW...can't see a darn thing and your other senses kick in big time! It was a lot of fun but also makes you appreciate things you take for granted. Our waiter Willie was AWESOME and will make any anxiety/nervousness you have subside. He guided us through the entire experience and if you lose your way and need help finding a utensil, glass etc. (LOL!) he's right there to help you out. Being with a group of six was perfect because we were able to talk and hear each other easily. We laughed and laughed, had fun trying to find and maneuver things and tried to guess what we were eating. The young lady at the  front desk was super nice and friendly and we met the owner who just great. I hope you go...have fun!
