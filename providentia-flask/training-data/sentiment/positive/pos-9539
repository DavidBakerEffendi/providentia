I slept in this morning and I blame Avenue B.  As someone who's never late, I had to have experienced a certain level of satisfaction to cause this coma.  After years of promising to try this Shadyside gem, I finally bit the bullet with Jonathan D. and headed there for a lovely little Wednesday date night during Restaurant Week.  Though their full menu was available, we both opted for the 3-course Restaurant Week menu which consisted of: Choice of Starter - either Falafel or Mussels; Entrees - Vegetarian Bolognese; Arctic Char and Scallops; and Braised Pork Cheeks; and a dessert of Ice Cream and Bread Pudding.  We both opted for the mussels to start and what a perfect beginning it was.  I'll order mussels anywhere...including places I shouldn't. Though I love them, I'm often disappointed with the broth and/or bread - always left longing for something more. Not this time.  I don't know what they do to those mussels or what that sauce/broth/heavenly soup was, but it was the BEST I've ever had.  I chose the Arctic Char and he chose the Pork Cheeks for our entrees, and neither were disappointed.  The scallops were the highlight of my dish, and while the char could have used a bit more seasoning, I loved it just the same. After tasting Jonathan's Pork Cheeks (not a euphemism), I was equally hooked.  We both ended with the bread pudding, of which I'm not generally a fan. For what it was, it was delicious. 

In addition to the excellent food the service was perfection.  Our server Jessica was attentive, timely and friendly.  At $80 including tax and our corkage fee (hooray for BYOB), Avenue B is one of Restaurant Week's greatest values. Don't miss it!
