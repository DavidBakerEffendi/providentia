Ephesus is special.  Fast friendly service.  Surprisingly comfy and stylish seating and lighting for a primarily take out shop.  A broad, customizable menu with a solid mix of Italian and Greek deliciousness.  Low prices, massive portions, and better prepared, home made, flavorful food than they have any right to offer at the prices they charge.  

Ephesus is not a 5 star culinary experience, but for the casual fare and reasonable rates they offer, I can't imagine a better choice.  Well done Ephesus, you set the bar for all other local delivery spots to try to live up to!
