Super nice ambiance and awesome jazz music! It's a bit expensive but still worth it :) If you're a bit low on the budget, the beers are fairly priced ($7 a pinte) and there are 2 chicken options on the menu that are 14$ and 16$. 

The place is really super well decorated and it has a sophisticated vibe. I was expecting mellow jazz but I went there with friends on a Friday night and the band was super upbeat.
