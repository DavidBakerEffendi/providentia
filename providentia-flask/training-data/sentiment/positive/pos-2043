Came to WingStop on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. Good for business and my wings only took 13 minutes. 

I ordered the 10 piece combo (leftovers!) with fries and a drink, plus extra bleu cheese for dipping my fries. For the wings I got Original Hot and Cajun Rub (1/2 & 1/2).  

The fries at WingStop are always a gamble: sometimes they are perfect, with a fresh batch of oil and done just right but sometimes you get limp, older fries. Mine were the good kind. 

The wings were fantastic. They were hot, crispy, plenty of sauce/rub and meaty. 

The service deserves a shout out. Around 51st Ave. and Baseline, you usually get the high school student who doesn't give a rip about service or the customer. Today at WingStop I received exceptional service, even with 30 people in a place that holds 50. They were pleasant, attentive, patient and did a great job. 

I'll be back for more great wings.
