I was verrry curious about Ha when it first opened on Mont Royal. I finally tried it with a friend of mine last week for lunch. At first, we were disappointed with the limited lunch menu compared to the extensive dinner menu online. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Lunch includes a soup or papaya salad so here's what we ordered in the end: 

1. Coconut soup - SO flavourful. Exactly the mix of tangy, creamy and salty with a kick from a Southeast Asian soup. 

2. Imperial rolls - We shared the deep fried rolls with veggies and fish sauce on the side. Really tasty! 

3. Catch of the Day: Grilled octopus with rice and watercress salad - The combo of all three were perfect in this dish... The smokiness from the grill, the sesame from the rice and the acidity from the salad with watercress and pickled onions. 

4. Five spice shrimp - You can never really go wrong with anything five-spice, and this shrimp did not disappoint. It's super satisfying and goes very well with the rice and sauteed veggies on the side. 

Most DEFINITELY would recommend Ha for lunch! I will definitely be coming back for their dinner menu on a pleasant evening to sit on their terrace!
