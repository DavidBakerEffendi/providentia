A service industry employee's joint.  Late nights are.incredible here and it makes me feel like I'm in a European pub more than a bar on the backside of park road shopping center.  Solid food, great draft menu and cool folks.  Never really liked the tables here because they are so big but it's a perfect place to meet up with a group and order a ton of apps. Especially the goat cheese fritters.
