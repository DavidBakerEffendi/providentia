Sitting at the bar counter today, watching how helpful & friendly the staff was to each other, feeding hungry breakfast & coffee first people, they just pull together.

Through all of these meals being prepared to different tables & types of people, I didn't see one person lose their cool, instead buttered the toast for another person's order, helped run the food out and seemed to care about getting everything right for each person.  I totally respect that.  I highly recommend sitting up there & watch how hard they work to do what they do.  Awesome Eggs Works team!  

I had a friendly & very personable server named Heather who was wonderful!  I never had to look for her, she had perfect timing.  Honestly, when I'm not w/ my folks who like to sit at the table, I'm always going to sit at the bar.  

Today I had the Mexican crepe, next time I'll say no onion, cheese or chiles.  I forgot cause last time it was perfect w/o all of that.  Also the guy next to me had the Works scramble.  He said that's the only thing he gets so I'll try that next time.  Hope you all are having a great morning cause Egg Works made my day.
