My fiance & I are very very pleased with the OUTSTANDING customer service our waitress "Veronica" & Manager Amy gave me.
I signed up for the Olive Garden Email club Online & I received 2 coupons one for a free appetizer or dessert & another one for a free dessert for my birthday
Well I didn't know there was an expiration date on both of them but I explained the situation to the manager Amy, being that this was my first time to this Olive Garden & I never been in this situation before I'm so happy to say I found my home Olive Garden I'm very very happy and my fiance & I will be coming back more often
This is my dessert that Veronica did for my birthday how sweet & creative is this?
Thank u Olive Garden
You'll are the best
