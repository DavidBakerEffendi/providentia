Unassuming Myers Park strip center restaurant is a hidden gem. A little formal, this isn't your jeans and sneakers quick dinner spot. 

Serving modern French food with mature, career waitstaff who take pride in every detail, you'll be guided with confidence and served with pleasure among the neighborhood regulars. 

The various fish specials and soups are my favorites. Great desserts as well.
