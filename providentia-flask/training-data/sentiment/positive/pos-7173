Great pecan apple pancakes!  Superb decaf coffee.  Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling.  Restaurant was clean.  I have already recommended it to another foodie.

IF you park in the public lot, just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes, it is free of charge to park.
