Honestly. My boyfriend and I always try new sushi places. And by far this beats everything. And the price is actually rly good. I went there last night and I was so full the meat was actually delicious and so tender and juicy oh my. It was amazing. I don't live near here but I'm sure gona travel the 25 mins just to come here that's how freaken good it is. I love it
