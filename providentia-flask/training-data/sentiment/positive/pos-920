Great new location by the house! Had been wanting to try it out and today was the day! Had the cucumber salad which was a meal in itself! Great flavors! Had the eggplant chips as well as an appetizer and wow do you get a great amount! They were so yummy too! Thai iced tea which is my dessert and I had drunken noodles for the entree. Spice number 3 was perfect! My Hubby has the lunch special, chicken chow mein and it was delish!
