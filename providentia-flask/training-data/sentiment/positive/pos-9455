I'm not typically a fan of old Vegas/Fremont street but I really liked coming here. There was no cover and we came around 10:30 and the place was dead, but by 11-11:30 it was really busy. 

Blew my mind that on a weekend night they had 2 for 1 drinks until midnight. I was literally buying rounds of drinks for 6 people for under $30, unheard of in Vegas...or anywhere else for the most part (unless you're drinking Washington Apples during happy hour haha). The bartenders and staff were all really cool, a nice change of pace for Vegas. 

They have human-sized Jenga, Connect 4, Chess, and Corn Hole (which is inside). It was a lot of fun. 

I will definitely be back.
