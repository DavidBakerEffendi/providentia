My husband and I had a coupon for buy one foot long with the purchase of a fountain drink, and get one foot long sub free. We were greeted by the employees who were friendly and immediately started putting together our sandwiches. I ordered the seafood sub, provolone cheese with multiple veggies, mayonnaise on wheat and my husband ordered steak, veggies and provolone cheese on wheat. We had our bread toasted as well which added to the flavor of the sandwich.
The sandwiches were delicious and everything that went into the making of our sandwiches was fresh. We haven't ate at Subway for at least 6 months and we were pleasantly surprised. Both my husband and I agree they have improved overall and the bread tastes a lot better since they changed it.
We go to this particular location because it is close to our house. The restaurant was clean as were the restrooms. The employees friendly and caring. 
We will return.
