The service here is top notch. I generally love the service at most restaurants in Toronto but the Keg on York and Adelaide is exceptional. The staff are knowledgable and genuine, and the food is delicious... from the bread (always piping hot and suuuuuper fresh) to the appetizers to the mains. Everything is outstanding. I come here a few times a year but the one experience that really stood out was the time when my friend from New York was visiting and he asked our waiter what he would recommend. (It was between the rib steak and baseball top sirloin) Our waiter recommended the rib steak even though my friend really wanted the baseball top sirloin but he went with his recommendation anyway. Our steaks arrive and my friend barely touched his steak- our waiter felt so terrible for recommending him a steak he didn't like so it was on the house. SO SWEEEEET. My heart melts.  
Recommend: 
- Escargots, mushrooms neptune, crab cakes and scallops+bacon (appetizers)
- Caesar salad... best saladddd. 
- Filet mignon wrapped in applewood smoked bacon or the prime rib.
