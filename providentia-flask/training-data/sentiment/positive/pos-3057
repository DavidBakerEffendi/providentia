Definitely coming back.  Great friendly staff and accommodating for our kids (no kids menu but have some great kid friendly food).  We ordered pierogies, goulash soup, beef tripe stew, cabbage rolls and wiener schnitzel.  For dessert we got the house-made apple strudel and the Hungarian trifle.  The food came out really quick and piping hot.  My son who has been picky of late asked about the dumplings in the goulash soup and the server brought us some extra with the gravy since she overheard he liked it and wanted more!  The tripe was tender and flavourful with the dumplings and the schnitzel was nicely breaded and didn't feel too heavy like it normally does.  The cabbage rolls are classic comfort food.  The apple strudel had a phyllo crust and a different style of filling than a German/Austrian strudel, and it was so good we had to order another one since the kids ate most of it!  It feels odd to say it but I think this place is better than the restaurants I went to when I visited Budapest (but student budget may have something to do with it).  Can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu!
