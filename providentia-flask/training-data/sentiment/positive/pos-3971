What is one of the best Mexican fusion restaurants in these Untied States doing in Beechview, Pennsylvania?  I don't know--but it's there: And it is Casa Rasta.

$3 tacos, $5 appetizers, $10 entrees.  Easily, they could charge 3x as much for each of these delicious plates.  But they don't need to.  They don't even have a liquor license (it's BYOB), and they don't need that either.  What they have is: Great food & an identity.

The identity is the love of culture that is inside each bite of pork, chicken, beef, spicy shrimp, beautiful bean dip, or avocado fries (yes, that's breaded and deep fried avocado slices w/ delicious tomato-onion dip).  Sometimes the food is a little more Caribbean, sometimes it's a little more Mexican, and sometimes it is in exact harmony - depending on what you order.  

But whatever you order -- whether you ala carte it and try multiple tacos, tostados, burritos, and apps... or do a full entr√©e (still only $15 max) and cap the evening with one of their unbelievably delicious and aesthetically-pleasing desserts, you will know you are part of something special that is honoring you, the food, and the concept and practice of culture in every bite.

And you can come back the next day and afford to get some more, because they -- unlike many of Pittsburgh's new foodie venues -- are concentrating on your food experience, not your wallet.
