What's not to love about Postino?  Their food is outstanding, service top-notch, and you can't beat the happy hour deals.  Gone are the days of chicken wing and beer happy hours.  My tastes are more refined now, and Postino fits the bill.  I love the bruschetta board!  Such great variety of flavors, for a great price.
