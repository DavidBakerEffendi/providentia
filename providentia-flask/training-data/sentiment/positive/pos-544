Just left there after dinner, and I am super impressed. Our waiter was Jarric (sp) and he was extremely friendly and a wonderful server. 

We started with the filet bites, they were perfectly seasoned, and prepared. The two sauces that came with accompanied it perfectly.

My mother in law ordered the pork chop, and was silent until it was devoured. She said it was fantastic. My 9 year old ordered the Jambalaya, and was warned it was quite spicy. He maned up and are quite a bit of it. I had a few bites and it was a very strong cayenne flavor. I'm not too knowledgeable on the dish, so I don't want to really rate that dish.

Husband ordered the Black and Bleu salad, and I loved it! It was fantastic! He raved about the dressing. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST! I ordered the shrimp and grits..so yummy! It is one of my favorite dishes, and it didn't disappoint.

My little one (15 months) was spoiled! They brought him a BEAUTIFUL dish of fresh fruit! I was jealous! Amazing staff, food and atmosphere! 

Mother in law said it will be in her rotation from now on.
