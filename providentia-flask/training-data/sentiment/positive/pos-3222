This is as good as a wine bar gets. I would maybe drop it down half a star for the slight wait for our server when we first sat down, but I've been here twice while visiting Montreal, and I really adore it. I just love a good wine bar and this one is busy in a good way, has a chic modern vibe, and delicious small plates. They also accommodated our group of five at short notice on a weekend, which I appreciated. I love their unique bar setting. It actually made it really intimate and fun. The grilled cheese... I die...
