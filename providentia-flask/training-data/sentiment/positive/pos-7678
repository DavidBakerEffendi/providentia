I know these places get a bad rap all the time but this one here is delicious!

My hubby and I stopped by here after the ASU win on Saturday (GO ASU) and just picked up a few tacos. 

They were delicious and hit the spot. I had a beef taco and he had two chicken tacos. Very filling for an after game snack and for around $7 you can't beat it!
