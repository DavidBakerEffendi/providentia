Hands down the best place I have eaten in all of Vegas so far on any of my trips.  This time I had the filet, but also had the sampler plate that has a mix of everything.  Their sushi is good, short ribs, potstickers, desserts ... etc EVERYTHING I have had here is AMAZING.  Do yourself a favor and go there and start picking any and everything off the menu ... I will be back to this place every time I visit Vegas.
