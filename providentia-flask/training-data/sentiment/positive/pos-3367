Oh man, so bomb!! I was sooooo hesitant coming here because the past few months - pizza everywhere we have been has turned me off. Ordered 1 half cheese, half meatball. The other Hawaiian pizza. They were all so different but all so delicious!! The chef/owner Paul came and chat with us even though he was super busy making all the take outs and pizza orders in restaurant. I really appreciate that! I would def recommend this family business to all my friends and family! The price is right, sauce was just enough, meatballs tasted like beef ravioli, Canadian bacon instead of deli ham, lots of Golden pineapples.  mmmm
