What a wonderful dinner!! We had a number of appetizers to share amongst our table such as the sage gnocchi, fish cakes, cauliflower and pork ringlette soup, mixed olives and all so delicious! My favourate was the sage gnocchi and some of the others at the table couldn't get over the olives, fish cakes and soup so all appetizers received top marks!  For dinner we ordered pork chops and the burgers.  I have to say the food is so delicious, fresh and quality ingredients and the chef puts a twist on simple food like cabbage.  The pork chops melted like butter and the side creamed cabbage dish was the best cabbage we have ever had!  The fries with the burger were so decadent and they had a side dipping sauce made with beer that was to die for!!  Portions are just right and you leave feeling like you have had a great meal at a very affordable price.  This is a local, non-franchise restaurant that has great tasting food and service.  It is something that you have to check out.  I will definetely be back and want to try everything on the menu.
