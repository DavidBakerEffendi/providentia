Flavorful Food + Outstanding Service!  Duzan Mediterranean Cafe really exceeded my expectations.  I'm extremely picky when it comes to Mediterranean food but this place was very clean and everything was so yummy!   I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for some delicious food and excellent FIVE STAR service.  Will definitely be back again and again and again.
