Imagine a Subway style for pizzas, that's what 800 degrees is. You select it all, pay & minutes later it is out. The pizza is SUPER tasty & it's fresh. You don't have tons of grease so if you're looking for grease you may want to ask for it or go somewhere else. Also if you follow them on Instragram they show their pizza of the day. If you request it you have to do it order it exactly as shown on their picture. The benefit of this is not only do you get a unique pizza not, BUT you get it for $5. You're welcome! Enjoy!
