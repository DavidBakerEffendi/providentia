Sammy's is probably my favorite chain restaurant. The food is consistently good and the menu offers many healthy options that sound and taste delicious. My favorites are the Duck Tacos appetizer and the Baja tacos entree.

Did you know they have cotton candy?? I didn't until recently. The serving looks huge but it's just all fluffy sugar so you can eat it all! Well... I can ... gulp. It's a fun alternative to their messy sundae.

Wait staff is always attentive.  I've been here many times for happy hour and they'll warn me when the time is getting close when the happy hour ends so I can get in another drink or app on the discount.
