Went to Hoffstot's cafe to celebrate my birthday. This is the second time I've dined here and it was quite satisfying each time. The prices and portions are very reasonable. I ordered the little piggy pork chop that came with a salad and a side of pistachio pasta. The garlic, tomato, pistachio sauce on the pasta was perfect. The banana peppery grilled flavor on the pork chop tasted great. I think I ordered this both times I went. 
The bread and the oil that comes along with it is fantastic. They should bottle up that sauce and sell it. The seafood pasta had a decent flavor and was loaded with bits of crab, calamari, and clams.. I hunk everyone was satisfied with their meals. The beans and greens made an excellent appetizer as well. This place is a great local spot for a decent meal that will leave you satisfied at reasonable prices. The service was great as well.
