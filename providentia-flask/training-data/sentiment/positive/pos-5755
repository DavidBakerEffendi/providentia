Came here because we saw it on blogto and it looked pretty unique. First off, the service is excellent, and it's a very modern, clean environment with large TVs and comfy seating. 

We decided to play wii u because we all had ps4s. Their selection is good: Mario kart 8, New super mario bros u, mario party, and smash bros. We spent most of the time playing smash bros and it was fun. The thing is I feel like the seating should be flipped the other way to be further from the TV. The way the seating is you're very close to the tv and looking at it from a side angle. It's a minor complaint but felt like my neck was sore from turning it for a long period of time. Maybe i'm old though.

The food:

Tuna poke, it was good. It didn't really look like poke but the flavour was good. not hawaii level or style though. It was an interesting take on poke but not sure I would order it again.

Crispy salt and pepper chicken wings: These were pretty crispy and tasty. I could order this again and also try the duck confit wings next.

Chili puff pork rinds: not bad, the chili adds a good flavour and it was a low level of spice

Drinks:

N7: probably my favourite trilogy mass effect, this drink has a blue colour reminiscent of the asari - a good drink that didnt skimp on alcohol at a reasonable price $9. Now that I think about it the powerup bar design kinda reminds me of a mass effect bar/club.

Capital wasteland: I didn't try it but it was based on fallout and it had absinthe and citrus. My friend enjoyed it.

Master chief: didn't try this either but my friend enjoyed it. Strong and citrusy. You already know what game this is from.

Overall, an enjoyable and unique experience worth going to. I'll be back for sure.
