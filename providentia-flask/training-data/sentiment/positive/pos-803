Went to this Chipotle 9/3/15 around 7pm.The team on shift greeted you right when walking through the door. They were so fast in making our burritos and quesadillas! They were all having so much fun working as a team which reflects on the great customer service. They say happy employees makes for better service and this is what was observed at this location. The food was fantastic as usual, overall great experience and will return.
