Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! I found this place after they followed me on Twitter so I looked up what it was. After visiting  their website my husband and I were there the next week. We loved Burgatory, so we weren't sure how we would feel about this place... However, after our first visit a few months ago we have been back multiple times and take friends to experience it each time we go. 

Just like Burgatory, you can create your own Burger/sandwich, but the choices are way better and everything is much bigger and the prices are amazing for the amount of food you get not to mention it tastes delicious! They have specials on different days of the week, but they always have $6 pitchers of Yuengling and $15 fish bowls. 

I have yet to have their milkshakes, but hear they are comparable to Burgatory. If you love Burgatory, this is a must visit restaurant! You'll love it!!
