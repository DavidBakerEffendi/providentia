My wife and I went here for the first time on a Thu. Night. I ordered the daily special of fried chicken which was fantastic. My wife ordered the scallops which were great too? We both sampled some cool different beers. 

Overall great experience.

Parking was right around the corner and they validate.

If your going downtown I highly recommend the arrogant butcher.

Great inexpensive place with high energy super friendly staff.
