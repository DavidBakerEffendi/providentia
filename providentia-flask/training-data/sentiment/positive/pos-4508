I had great service on my trip here. The waitress was attentive and full of suggestions. 
The food was above average. I had the ginger mojito (it's called something else on the menu) and it was the best mojito I've had. Lots of mint and just the right amount of ginger beer!
The mango BBQ wings were perfectly crispy.. Best texture! The BBQ sauce was lovely but I wish there was a bit more on the wings. The actual wings didn't have much flavour and didn't really taste smoked. 
My main was the cheese burger and I upgraded to the truffle fries, which was a $3 upgrade. I was told the other upgrades were any of the four salads. The truffle fries were amazing - very thinly sliced and perfectly seasoned. Super crispy! Amazing. The burger burned my mouth it was so hot. In fact, all the food was steaming! It was juicy and flavorful and had a great bun. It isn't the best burger I have ever had, but it would definitely give me my burger fix any time. You get ketchup, mustard, and relish on the side and the burger itself is served open faced with tomato, onion, and generous amounts of crisp lettuce. 

The only slight downside was that they were out of calamari!
The burger and wings were great, but not out of this world good. The fries and mojito were top of their class, though. So it's a close call between a 4 and 5 star review! If the service is as consistently good as my experience was, then the 5 star is deserved.
