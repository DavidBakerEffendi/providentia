The kebabs of Anatolia Cafe are just perfect. Juicy, tender, served hot and tasty. The servers are awesome and the location in Lee road is perfect. There's parking in the back or across the street behind Phoenix coffee.

I'm definitely coming back for the kebabs as I was skewered with delight. True story.
