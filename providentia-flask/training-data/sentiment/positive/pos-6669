So I came back again to see chef Todd Williams & try his cooking 1 more time before moved on to the next adventure at Bradley Ogden. Under his management as an executive chef here, he earned Bradley Ogden a Michelin Star for the last 2 years. 

This time, another wonderful meal for us:

- Kumamoto oyster & Osetra caviar - just a simple treat but is always my FAV each time I'm here.

- Artichoke soup, with that crispy golden fried, micro green, & the soup pour in afterward, so sweet, tasty & it was a vegan dish, wow!

- Heirloom tomatoes salad, pesto sauce, cheese & toasted bread - refreshing dish.

- Pan Seared Florida Frog Legs, saffron-stinging netlles timbale, herb butter sauce, parsley foam ;-) yummy!

- Oak Grilled Ribeye with Bloomsdale Spinach, red wine essence - juicy, pink, & tender!

The best of all is that I got to try out the 130 years Mussini Balsamic Vinegar, Il Privilegio, 2.39 Ounce bottle. Chef Todd poured me a bit in this tiny spoon, that just made me feel so royal :-)

(A highly selected dressing that was born as a digestant, to be offered on a tiny spoon at the end of the meal. International famous chefs use this product on gourmet dishes such as oysters, foie gras & caviar.)

Service was great as always & the wine list here is Award of Excellence by Wine Spectator, expect nothing less! Great time as always! Thank you to chef Todd.
