The girlfriend says she has heard good things about this restaurant & suggested dining here so we did (Please note this review is for the meal we had on 1/16/16).  
Our wonderful waiter suggested a Bottle of Conquista Malbec & offered us a sample adding they had 1 bottle left because it was the featured wine.  Well, No way to know if we were being suckered but the price sounded right so we went with it.  The girlfriend also had a Blood orange old fashion but thought it was too sweet.  I stayed with the wine.  We started off with the Ahi tuna appetizer which was that day's off menu item.  Now that item we liked for the sauce was quite exquisite.  
For the main course she had the 7 oz filet mignon & I had the 10 oz Barry's prime rib.  We also got the Brussel sprouts to share.  The meal was fantastic for sure.  
The good part is I remember to check-in on Yelp halfway through this delicious meal and for my effort we were rewarded with a yummy Banana cream pie for free!  How about that huh?!  Go, Yelp!
