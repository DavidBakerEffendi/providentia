I wish I had more time to write something heartfelt and honest - anyone who's had coffee at l'Étincelle knows that they deserve the best reviews. Truth is, I don't have time.... because I'm on my third lap of speed-walking-around-the-country-while-saving-the-lives-of-babies (mandatory hero things) and if I keep this pace up, I should be able to finish lap 5, get my butt to Ottawa where I'll convince Parliament to stop being petty, make it home for supper where I'll be perfecting my vegan Turducken-soufflé (come at me bruh!).

All of this was ONLY, and TRULY possible because this morning I decided to brave the cold, dismiss the obnoxious daylight, step outside and make my way to l'Étincelle for an extra strong flat white. These gents (sorry to any employees I might not have met yet) REALLY know how to make your coffee - it's like they grew up as actual coffee beans, taking part in coffee bean society and learning all of their secrets, customs, holidays and taboos. I can't recommend this café enough.
