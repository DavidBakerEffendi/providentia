All I could say the whole time was "why haven't we come here sooner?" The Sunday brunch is seriously awesome. I was shocked at the spread of amazing gluten free bunt cakes, and flavorful vegetarian side dishes came as part of the meal! I wanted to try everything. It was all incredibly good. I could go here every Sunday. I had a vegan almond French toast that was super delicious, it had a mixed berry topping and a side dish with a yummy curry flavor. Great portions plus the buffet I left more than full. The self serve free coffee is yet another bonus. The only thing that might not be for everyone is that you may have to sit at a table with strangers. It gets quite busy and they have larger tables but I didn't mind. Great prices. The atmosphere is so cool. This place is really a unique experience. We spent awhile waking around the antique store after. I love the vibe, you can find hidden treasures all over the place. One time here is not enough.
