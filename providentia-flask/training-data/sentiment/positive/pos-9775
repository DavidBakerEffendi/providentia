Delicious popcorn chicken! $5.99 an order and you definitely get enough pieces to put bbt places to shame (you know, if you ever order from those places). I haven't tried the popcorn chicken from Hot Star yet so I can't compare, but this place is probably the best tasting + value IMO.

If you're wondering where it is, you have to walk through the middle aisles, it's not on the outer shops. Definitely don't wanna miss!
