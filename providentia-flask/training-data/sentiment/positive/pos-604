I typically dine at their sister location, the one called Chada Street, on Spring Mountain Road, but decided to come to this one on 9/20 for dinner.  This one seems higher end with the nicer decor and requisite ambiance. The staff are just as friendly at both locations and the menu & wine list are pretty similar. 
 Tonight I had the Spicy crab curry & the 
Grilled chicken appetizer.  I had a glass of the Turley old vine zin and a glass of the textbook cab.  
The wine and food were simply divine and the prices are not expensive at all.  I can't ask for much: good food at reasonable prices is fantastic to me.
