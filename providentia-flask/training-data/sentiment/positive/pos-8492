Absolutely a five star rating for this place. Yes this is a little hole in the wall restaurant but don't let that fool you. I was impressed with everything on my very first visit. First of all I ordered two tacos which were exceptionally good. The condiment bar was covered and kept very clean. Service was fast and friendly. I will certainly come back here again my next time passing by. Muchos gracias!!!!!
