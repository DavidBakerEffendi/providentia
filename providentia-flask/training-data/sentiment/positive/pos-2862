Ate here last night and it was delicious!  We got the vegetarian feast, Kitfo, and Shiro Wat.  Everything was spot on, we've had Ethiopian food before and this was easily some of the best.   All the veggies were fresh and the quality was outstanding.  Our server was great, we really wanted to try the Shiro Wat so she suggested we just order 1 vegetarian feast, the Kitfo, and Shiro Wat instead of two vegetarion feasts.  That was a good idea, we already couldn't finish all the food and ordering two feasts would have been entirely too much!    Don't hesitate, go here, and if you've never had Ethiopian food, this place would be an excellent introduction.  Looking forward to are next visit!
