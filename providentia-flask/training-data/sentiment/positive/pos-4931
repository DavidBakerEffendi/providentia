I'll start by saying that I am not a fan of hamburgers. But my husband is, so we gave this gave this place a try. I had the truffle burger and have to say this was one of the best meals I've ever had. I love that everything is local. Server was fun & enthusiastic. Great location & atmosphere. Will return often!
