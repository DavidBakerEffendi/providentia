This place was amazing! The ambience was top knotch! There was a jazz band playing the background and their patio is lovely. We got a recommendation from the souvenier shop nearby to come here. Three of us had the salmon pok√© bowl which was so fresh, yummy and filling. I also had the crab cake which was good but not worth the cost. My friend had a pizza which she raved about. The mango frozen drinks were good too. I would definitely come back here.
