Deep down inside I know I have a week spot for anything potatoes.  With my background, when you add dough to this mix, I get week in the knees.  I have been wanting to come here for the longest time, and finally made that a reality.

I do have to say, if you are expecting to come here and have a huge dine in experience, better rethink that.  I'm not saying that you can't, but you really can't.  Let me explain.  You order your food inside at a small counter and then you wait.  You get your food and most people literally roll out of the parking lot.  However, there is a small area outside with a few tables that you can sit at if you do not want to take it to go.  That's what we did.

It did not take very long for our food to be ready.  When I looked at my food I thought that I was given the wrong thing, but it was my fault.  I really wanted the kielbasa but my eyes played a trick on me and I got the stuffed cabbage.  I am not the biggest fan of cooked cabbage, but somehow they made it edible for me.  I really did enjoy it, but don't count on me doing that again.

What I wanted to focus on was the pierogies.  I love pierogies, and these did not disappoint.  They are huge.  I am not exaggerating on that.  These are not the pierogies you find in other area restaurants let alone the grocery store.  These were the biggest pierogies I have ever seen.  It's like they filled the palms of their hands to the brim and then wrapped it all in dough.  And whoever is doing this has some big hands.  Each bite of these I had to keep myself from rolling my eyes back in my head.  I was in heaven.  The butter and onions with each bite was amazing.  I could go back right now if I could.  

If you do get it to go, they do an incredible job of wrapping this up so that it will not leak out.  In a food container, then into a clear bag and then inside another bag.  If this were to leak, then that's on you.
