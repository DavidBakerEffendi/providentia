I remember when this place first opened and I tried their food it was so delicious. 

First off, the place is always clean. The guy handling the money doesn't handle the food and vice versa. I never have to worry about looking for the table with the least amount if food left on it from previous guests, because the staff keep them clean.  

The staff there are very kind and are patient as i always want to try something different so I may take a few minutes to figure out what I want or if I actually want it. The same people are always there and the guy at the front knows what my co worker is going to order when we get there. If you dine in you get bottomless fried wonton noodles which are so good! They are also very quick; when you order, the food is out in less than ten minutes. 

Rice is a big thing with me as I feel it can make a meal taste great or make you want to throw it in the garbage, but can't cause that's a waste. The rice, both fried and steamed is very tasty and not dry which is one thing I hate about rice at other restaurants. Also the rice isn't mushy. I usually get saut√©ed vegetables and I don't want my meal to end. The vegetables are so fresh and crunchy and the sauce they use is so magnificent I love it! Their chow mien also tastes great and I'm not too much of a chow mien person.   

Lunch specials are very inexpensive and are reasonably portioned. I almost always have left overs. The time for the linch specials goes till 4p, so if you go close to that time, you can have dinner too!

Overall, I choose this place over any other Chinese place in the area and I've been to almost all of them. Can't beat the cleanliness, service, prices and of course the food!
