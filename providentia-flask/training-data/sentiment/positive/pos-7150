We absolutely love the Sunday brunch! As far as ambiance it doesn't get any better, just an awesome neighborhood place. Emily is so knowledgeable and knows the perfect time to check in and refill water. Loved the bacon cheese grits!!!  The pulled pork chilaquiles were fantastic and you can order a tapas size or entree size but the smaller portion was perfect. They have games and you can sit, drink and make it a Sunday fun day and don't forget a sorbet infused mimosa. Also you can linger on the back patio and have a relaxing environment, around the fire if the weather is cool. Live music for brunch. Just a great local place with good food.
