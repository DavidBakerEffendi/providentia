I have always had amazing experiences at the Mesa location and this was my first time visiting the Tempe location.

Did call ahead seating and that worked well.

The rolls were not buttery as much as I like them and had to keep asking for more butter and rolls.  The last time they never came.

Was bummed to find that they don't (or no longer?) have a $3 margarita at all times - just during happy hour.

The ribeye, salad and sweet potato were good.

The biggest negative was that the waitress spilled an entire glass of ice water on me and inside my open purse soon after we were seated.  She was very apologetic and it wasn't a big deal - until the end of the meal when I realized my daughters iphone was in the bottom of my purse still swimming in ice and water. I let her know and she got a manager.  They were both helpful and gave me a gift certificate for two free meals.  (Paid for the two meals we had eaten last night.)  I gave the manager my name and phone number and he gave me his and the owner's business card.  Went home and put the iphone in rice overnight.  It didn't help.  The button is not working consistently and there are problems with the sound.  I am hopeful that this situation will be resolved with the restaurant but also still nervous at this point.  Fingers crossed!!

Update that management was very helpful in buying my daughter a replacement phone.  The experience was simple and straight forward.  Thank you!!!
