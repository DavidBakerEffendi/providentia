I've been to Vegas since the early 90's and ever since Bellagio opened, the fountain show is always a must see that never gets old to me.  I love the music that's collaborated with the water show and you always get a front view of the show.  My favorite time to go is during the winter holidays because of the music selection.  I feel so warm, cozy, and lovable inside whenever the show goes on even though it's so cold from the water mist.  

Bonus Tips:  This is a free show unlike majority of the shows in Vegas.  You always have a front view no matter how busy it gets.  Lastly, the show usually plays every half hour on the dot depending on the season.

Interesting Information:  Did you know the person who created the Bellagio fountain show also created the fountain show for Americana at Brand in Glendale?
