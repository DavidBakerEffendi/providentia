This Local is particularly exceptional! I came with a group of 13 or so right at lunch time and as far as I know everyone loved their food. The servers were fantastic and the food came out so fast.

I had the quesadilla and guac & chips. Man, that was the best quesadilla I've had. And I love that they have small dishes so you can get 2 different things if you want.  Other dishes that looked amazing were the salad with ahi tuna, local burger, and of course the fish tacos. The yam fries were pretty damn amazing too.

For a chain restaurant, this place is a cut above the rest.
