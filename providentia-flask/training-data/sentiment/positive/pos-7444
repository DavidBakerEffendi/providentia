Really nice place to spend an evening with good friends, the bruschetta was wonderful, the service friendly and courteous and the atmosphere was really nice, with live music that was not too loud and quite lovely.  They have a really nice wine list with a variety of reds and whites at various price points from moderate to pricey.  I will definitely come here again.
