Nothing short of five stars for service and food for this long awaited diner.
Two friends and I had breakfast/lunch here today and can't rave  enough about both the food and the service.
Janice had a southern omelette that comes  with toast and a bowl of melon and strawberries.
Colleen had crispy bacon,  eggs and crispy hashbrowns that were absolute perfection. I opted for the meatloaf dinner that comes with mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini. The meatloaf,  along with the fried chicken and waffles are their most requested dinners and I can see why. Everyone of us absolutely loved the food....fresh, hot and perfectly done.  The only downside: the coffee could be a little richer with a little more body, but that's how we saw it.

The service is professionally served by people who know what they're doing.Be sure  to ask for Leah or Darlene, both outstanding servers. 
If you haven't been here yet,  be sure to try METRO DINER. The restaurant was crowded on Sunday as it should be; an indication that they're doing something right.
