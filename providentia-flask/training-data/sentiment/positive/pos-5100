Ling and Louie's is one my family's favorite restaurants.  We usually go there or get pick up from there once a week.  Love the atmosphere with very friendly staff and fast service.  

The food is always good with a ton of choices.  My go-tos are the firecracker chicken, Ling's meatloaf, and orange peel chicken.  Although I have never tried a meal there I didn't like.  

They also have a great happy hour and lots of specials in the weekend. You won't be disappointed here.
