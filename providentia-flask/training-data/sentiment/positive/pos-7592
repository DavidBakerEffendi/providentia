First time coming here, very tasty! I am a huge fan of green curry, it was an amazing spice and the veggies were very fresh. My husband had the drunken noodles, also very good. The only thing I would say is that the AC was on, it was very cold in the restaurant, but the tea and food definitely made it!!
