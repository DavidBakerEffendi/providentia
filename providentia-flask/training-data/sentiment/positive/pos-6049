This place belongs in Charlotte, but I am so glad to see a cool town like Cramerton get something like this.    This place is by far completely worth the drive down to eat there.     Food was absolutely wonderful and there were no complaints to be had.   I am the first to critique something, and I got nothing.  

Staff was awesome.   On point the entire time,     Food was Hot and delicious.   Plates cleared and drinks refilled without a cue.    

No complaints.    Well done all around.
