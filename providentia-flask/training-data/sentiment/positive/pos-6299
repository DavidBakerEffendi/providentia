My wife and I have been to Five guys in 4 different states already.
We love them so much, great for gluten free people.
Fries are to die for! they nailed it to perfection!

I compare the pricing:
2 Burgers and 1 regular fries to share - $16 and change
versus in and out
2 double doubles and 2 fries - $12 and change

Five guys burger has more meat and toppings then a dbl dbl
1 regular fries equals 2 fries at in and out, and these are just the right crispiness.

As a certified gourmet chef, both are good but five guys at most locations are very satisfying
