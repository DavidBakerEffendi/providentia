Wow is all I can say from start to finish. This was my first time here and I will be going back. There's not too many Mexican places I can rave about, but this place is. And for those who think Lindo Micochan is So Great - first of all, that place is terrible and Both times I went, service was lousy and the food was not only over priced but not even that good. Anyways! 
My friend and I walked in on a Friday night with no wait, around 8pm. We were brought to a booth with a friendly hostess and no more than 4 minutes later we were brought chips with bean dip and salsa. Both were good. 
Then a few minutes later, we were brought Fideo soup! That was unexpected even though it comes complementary at some places. I have to say, I'm not huge on this soup because nobody ever seems to get it right and I've tried it at a few places. This was by far the best Fideo soup I've ever had and was impressed already. 
Our waiter, Amanda, was So Friendly and pleasant along with being helpful with the menu, it was very comforting along with the great soup and chips so far.
I got the chimichanga with shredded chicken which came with a generous portion of sour cream and some guacamole and pico. I also got a taco with shredded chicken on the side with rice tortilla, fried. It was whoa! Ask for the house salsa with the taco or whatever you get and I recommend mixing in a little tapatio sauce. You'll be happy you did. 
Great portion sizes too! All that and my friend got an enchilada burrito with veggies on the side. I can't believe they serve veggies on the side. That's unheard of, and I'm not talking about a few peppers and onions. No. It was broccoli, zucchini and cauliflower that filled 1 half of the plate and had really nice seasoning on it and it; so good with the salsa too! All that for $28. Go here if your'e craving Mexican food and I don't think you will be displeased :)
