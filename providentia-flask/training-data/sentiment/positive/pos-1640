Went to Squid Ink for the first time last night for our 22md wedding anniversary. Everything was just perfect -- food, service and atmosphere. 

We were well-taken-care-of by our server Hunter, and the rest of the amazing service team, including Sarah (working expo), Kaci (another server who would check in on us) and the General Manager who opened our champagne. 

We are looking forward to our next visit and highly recommend Squid Ink!!!
