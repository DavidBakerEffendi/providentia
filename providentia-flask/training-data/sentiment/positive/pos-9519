I had a great time at the Noodle Ranch. It was recommended by a coworker, so we went for some pho after work. We got some spring rolls and all ordered the Pho. The bowls were huge and they brought all the toppings to add to the bowl. The inside of the restaurant was small but they use the space well. For a drink I tried their prickly pear lemonade. It was quite tasty. I get the craving for pho every now and then, and I'll be sure to be back for my next fix.
