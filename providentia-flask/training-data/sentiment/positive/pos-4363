This was my first time checking this place out. I was impressed by the great service and the excellent food. This place smells so delicious. I was curious to see what the commoners order here and found out that they're especially famous for for their dessert crepes. The tables are comfortable and the music is not loud and their wifi works great too. Excellent for quiet studying and enjoying a snack.
