This location is right near my office, which makes it great for grabbing a quick lunch or even a couple sandwiches to bring home for dinner.  It's not fine dining and I know some people would think "it's a sandwich shop, does it really deserve 5 stars?"  Well for me, yes, because even though I wouldn't go here everyday, when I do go, I do enjoy it.  There are a couple of employees here that I always enjoy talking to, and I believe one is even the manager.  We joke around about my favorite football team, which he is not a fan of.  But we can banter back and forth with no hard feelings, always in fun and we're both smiling when I leave.  This location gets extremely busy at lunchtime and I know that they work hard to get the orders right, and if they don't, they will do what they can to fix it.  To me that is the sign of a successful business - good people working hard and doing all they can to make the customers happy.
