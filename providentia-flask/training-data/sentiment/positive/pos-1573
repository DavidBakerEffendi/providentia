Gypsy Gypsie Gypsee...

So, I tried Gypsie Bar at City Scape recently and I was pleasantly surprised. After hearing (and Yelp reading) a few reviews about it, I have formulated my very own take on the place:

GORGEOUS! The views from this bar are amazing. Especially on the Lucky Strikes Bowling side. I drank my Redbull Vodka happily as I stared into the vast array of buildings at night. The seats/bar/layout are very modern and comfortable. The decor is posh. The lighting was not too dark, but not too bright. It was perfect! 

FUN- There is a bar, a dance floor, lounge, arcade and a bowling alley. I went with a few friends and had a blast. I could dance it up for a while, then stroll on over the lounge and relax. I am surprised that so many are not raving about this place! 

ENVIRONMENT- I enjoyed the environment here. The people were very relaxed, not too dressed up but not too dressed down ect. There was not the "I'm here to get laid" vibe which was amazing! Everyone seemed very chill and there genuinely to enjoy a night out.

STAFF- The staff was very professional and sweet. They were not overly pretentious or rude which is rare for the nicer bars. The drinks were priced about the same price as they are on Mill Ave, however they are bigger and not served a plastic dixie cup (lol).

Overall, I LOVED this place! I will be definitely  heading there once again in the future. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!
