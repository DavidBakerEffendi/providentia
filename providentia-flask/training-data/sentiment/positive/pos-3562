This is one of the best places I have ever been in vegas, I love it.  Drinks are good, love the huge scorpions.  The bar food is best I've had.  The only thing that bothered me was that the heat from the fire got so hot that I felt like I was going to pass out at one point.

Other than that, I wish I lived closer so I can go here more regularly.
