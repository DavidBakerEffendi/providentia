Everyone needs a go-to-quick-fix place and PM is mine!
When all else fails or if I don't know what I really want or it's late and i don't want to think about food there is always PM. Honestly for fast-food Chinese it feels pretty clean and on the less greasy side. My favorites are the noodle dishes the shrimp dishes the beef with ginger and shallots and the short ribs. The duck is going to happen soon!!!
