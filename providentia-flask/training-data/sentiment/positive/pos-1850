Great place to get some work done. Great employees too. I ordered a drink and I was rung up cash instead of with a card. They gave me the drink for free due to the mistake. It was unnecessary but much appreciated. Reading the reviews here, I can see Madhouse really takes care of their customers. I will make this a frequent stop of mine for work and coffee.
