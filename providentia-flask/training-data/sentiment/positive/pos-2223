I have now been here twice and I absolutely love it. On Wednesdays they have a special on bottles of wine so a group of girlfriends and I came in and dined outside on the patio. Everything was great, the service was excellent, and shoutout to the manager Craig- he really made the experience memorable. I had the spaghetti squash again and this time tried the grilled octopus which was amazing. All of the appetizers we had were delicious. I plan to come here more often for their Wednesday night special!
