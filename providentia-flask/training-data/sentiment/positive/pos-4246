Had a lovely dinner here with outstanding service and the ambiance is great!  Turkey meatball appetizer was delicious!  I had the burger which was yummy, my friends had the chicken and red snapper.  All of us raved about the food, great drinks, awesome decor and our waiter was awesome.  Great neighborhood gem and looking forward to going back!
