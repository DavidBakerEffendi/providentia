This establishment is close to the park road shopping center. It is in a really good location. The atmosphere is very sports bar / modern tap house feel. The managers are super nice and really want to make sure everything is ok. Shout out to the management staff. The food is incredible. The portions are what Americans should be using for portion sizing. The food is fresh to order and super delicious. I got the chicken tenders and my boyfriend got a chicken sandwich. Both were phenomenal. As you see pictured, the doughnut holes. Wow!!! Talk about incredible. Crispy on the out and airy in the middle. So amazing. I will be back.
