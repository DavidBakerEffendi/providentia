Yes. Yes. Finally! 

Finally found a place with legit Green Chili!  The sauces were on point.  The ghost pepper salsa with the Red Cheese Enchilada is amazing!  Also how can you even be mad at the small pitcher sizes of drinks??  The service was impeccable, the foot on point.  We sat in the dining room this time but want to poke around to the bar next time!  It looked fun!
