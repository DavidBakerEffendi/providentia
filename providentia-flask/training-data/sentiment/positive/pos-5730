I adore JPH because it is completely unassuming.  The decor is charming and vintage, the staff is knowledgable, and the breakfast/coffee is top notch.  I went in today and had yogurt and granola, and even something as simple as this was presented in such an appetizing way.  The fresh berries on the yogurt made my morning treat colorful and even more delicious.  

I am happy the construction in the area has stopped for now and the only noises that I  hear in the shop are customers quietly chatting/enjoying their coffee and the staff hard at work...

Keep up the good work JPH, we're your biggest fans!
