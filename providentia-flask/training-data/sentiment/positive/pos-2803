I've never eaten at another Brazilian eatery so I have the honor of giving an unbiased & honest opinion (not based off 'comparing' this place to other 'fancier' locations.... It isn't a dang competition folks. You do know it's ok to like more than one eatery!). 

Been here twice now.  Me and my fianc√© LOVED the food!  We particularly love the sausage & filet!  More seafood selection would be nice but I'm not complaining. 

We will definitely return even without a Groupon.
