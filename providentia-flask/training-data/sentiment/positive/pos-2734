Does fuku burger even need my review? What else can I add other than that this humble burger eatery is an absolute must try. TRY IT. The consistency, the quality of the ingredients, and the welcome un-corporate  aesthetic and atmosphere all reflect the founder's true passion for burgers. A passion I hope you'll somewhat share after tasting these perfect paddies.
