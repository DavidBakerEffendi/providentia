Love this place.  The d√©cor is casual/cute but nothing fancy.   The food here is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  My favorite dish is the scallops.  Love scallops anyway, so I order them a lot, but this dish is one of the best I've ever had!  If I could afford it, I'd go here every day and order this same dish.  I guess the only thing I could say negative was they don't have a full bar so my Scotch drinking friend could not get a Scotch.  Oh well.  Big deal, right?  
I'd recommend this place to anyone.
