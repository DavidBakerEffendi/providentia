All I can say for Robby Bobby's is WOW! This place is a World of Wonder...so many choices, generous portions and great service. They have everything under the sun! I shared a pesto alfredo pasta and margherita pizza, but some of the guys had huge burgers and gyros. A hush engulfed the table when the food arrived and I can tell you with this group, that means it's good eating! The pizza was so fresh out of the oven the cheese was just melting off the pizza!

The prices are great too! We will definitely be back...can't wait until next time! I am so happy we found this place!!
