If you want the best King Crab you'll ever eat, conveniently split in half so you don't need to deal with the mess of crab, do not miss out on this Buffet.

Go for the Sunday brunch, they've got everything, even a sushi bar. The sushi chefs will make you whatever you want, you just have to ask. Everything on the buffet is delicious, and the desserts are endless.

Great prime rib, and even Venison.
