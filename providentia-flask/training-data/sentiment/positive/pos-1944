You might not know it from the other reviews, but this is really four types of stores rolled into one.  Clearly, their most popular aspect is the donair/shwarma prep.  For Haligonians missing their sweet sauce donairs, this is THE place to go. The only shortcoming is that the meat is in a warming tray rather than shaved off a spinning hunk o' meat when ordered (like the shwarma), but on the plus side you get lettuce, and the portions are generous.  I would only suggest getting a large if you're returning from an Antarctic expedition and ran out if supplies half way through.  I would also stay away from them all together if you plan on going on a date in the next couple of days, unless your potential partner is turned on by the garlicky miasma you and your vehicle will inevitably exude.  Another caveat is that it can take a while to get your meal during peak hours, but on plus side they provide amusing reading materials while you stand around and wait.

As I alluded to earlier, there are other aspects to the store as well.  A sizeable selection of cold prepared middle eastern foods such as kubbi balls are available to go, as well as an array of baklavas, and various cheeses and olives in bulk.  An assortment of Arabic dry goods can be purchased too, such as sheesha supplies, pomegranate molasses, sumac seasoning, etc.. In the summer, an ice cream parlor is in full force, and you can sit at the few tables out on the sidewalk, or in the upstairs seating area.  As a converted house, the whole experience is somewhat cramped, the atmosphere slightly ghetto, but most importantly the food very delicious.
