Was feeling seafood for my birthday but wanted to try something a little different than popular places like boiling crab and hot n' juicy. We also had a fairly good amount of people in the party so I looked for places with the best prices/options. Like hot n' juicy, this place has family style order options but more value in it, such as more pounds of seafood and higher quality seafood for a slightly cheaper price. The options looked amazing so I booked the reservation and gave it a try! 

We went on a Thursday night so it wasn't crowded at all (although it should be, was shocking that it wasn't). Hospitality was wonderful! The waitresses were very kind, attentive, and helping of our needs. Especially Kim, our main waitress. She also had a great sense of humor. 

On to the food, it was all delicious! We picked just the right flavors and everything tasted fresh. We got the regular and Kumamoto oysters. I am still longing for more of those. We picked 2 of the biggest family size orders. The clams, king crab, and snow crab were killer! Although it was all tasty, those just stood out more to me. One order we mixed garlic butter and lemon pepper with mild spice. The other was the urban mix with mild as well. Both were delicious, just depends on what you feel like more. Feeling a little more spice then I'd go with the urban mix. We also got calamari and a few orders of shrimp fried rice. Everything was perfect and great together! I will definitely be going again and more often. This is going to be my new, go-to for this kind of seafood!
