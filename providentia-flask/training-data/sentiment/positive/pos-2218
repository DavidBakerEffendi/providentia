After dining at this kitchen a few years back, when it first opened, I was hesitant to try it again. But after reading some glowing reviews I decided to give it another shot. And I'm so glad I did! I ordered takeout as I have a cold and was craving some spicey Thai food. It was exactly what I was looking for- fresh, the flavors were perfectly married, and it wasn't too light, too heavy, it was just right. It hit the spot! I ordered the lunch special: the curry puff was absolutely delicious, full of chicken, carrots, curry and potatoes in some kind of pastry. Yumm!!
The egg drop soup was light and flavorful and the small side salad had a nice sesame type dressing on it. The green curry with jasmine rice was amazing! Exactly how a good green curry should be, with crispy tofu (that's what I ordered) just right potatoes, zucchini and bamboo shoots with the perfect amount of crunch plus some yummy Thai basil thrown in. I have definitely found our new Thai place and am so glad have it a second chance!
