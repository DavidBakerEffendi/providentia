This is the kind of restaurant Phornix foodies need to support if our town is going to grow up from a culinary standpoint. Because of the low key location and decor, this place qualifies as a hole-in-the-wall, but this ethnically diverse part of town already boasts San Carlos Bay next door and the amazing Noble Eatery down the street. We were greeted by Abdul and John, our waiter, immediately brought out some iced tea with rose hips followed by a plate of fresh hummus and warm pita. My wife ordered the lamb and I got the chicken. Both were excellent. The lamb had blueberries in it which was unusual but delicious. After, we got a milkshake which had flavors of dates and peanut butter. All the while, we felt like guests in someone's home rather than customers. We experienced true hospitality and a fantastic meal. We will be back.
