Wowzers! It doesn't get much better than The Thumb BBQ. Pig & Grits was sooooooooo good and the epicness of the cheesy pull on the Mac-n-Cheese was ridiculous! We didn't get a chance to try the car wash, but if they wash cars as good as they cook food then I'm sure it's great! Add in the super quirky gift shop to peruse and this is must stop place in the Valley for both locals and visitors alike.
