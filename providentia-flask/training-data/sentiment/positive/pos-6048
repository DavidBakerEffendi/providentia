Let me start by saying our server Jo was amazing! She had a good attitude , super friendly, and did everything possible for us to have a good dining experience. The food was steak and burger cooked to perfection. The bread and butter. Outstanding!!! Jo kept us stocked with our soft drinks and the yummy rolls with the great tasting butter.. She even gave us some of those to take home. We will definately be back.
