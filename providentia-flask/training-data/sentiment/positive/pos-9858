The entrance was grand with the biggest yellow door I've ever see!  This place is definitely trendy and hip.  Everyone was beautiful and dressed to impress. I was here to celebrate my girlfriend's engagement. 

Food:Tomahawk with creamy mash truffle potato and mixed vegetables. My girlfriend ordered it, she said it was very flavorful and  extremely juicy. It was a surf and turf with grilled shrimp which were a little dry but still had flavor.  

Her fiancee ordered a sirloin steak with the same sides, boy did it look awesome. 

All of the alcoholic drinks were awesome! Order the French martini....so yummy! 

Our waitress was Carissa who was attentive and helpful.  Every item Carissa recommended was excellent.  

Dessert: a delicious coconut, chocolate layered cake. 

Make sure you bring money, the tomahawk was $89 but it feeds two people (so why did my girlfriend eat the entire thing herself) lol.. 

This place is a great hang out with the girls, wife or girlfriend date night, side chick date night, the girl your trying to make your girlfriend jealous with.....you know! It's the new must be seen place and with good food too!
