I love this place! The food is delicious and service is spot on!I believe its family run, so you feel welcome each and every time! The guy is pretty good at explaining and answering questions! My favorite is the kalbi combo! Big portions. Sea food soup was delicious too! Its not a fancy place but a place with delicious food! Definitely recommend!
