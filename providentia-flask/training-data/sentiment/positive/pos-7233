Usually don't do breakfast outside the house, but today I said "what the heck" and went for it. I chose Egg Works and I'm glad I did. The second we walked in, our server, Nick, welcomed us and directed us to our table. He was great throughout. Very southern atmosphere in the restaurant, food, music, etc. Overall great experience and definitely will be coming back.
