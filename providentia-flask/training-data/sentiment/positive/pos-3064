A really unique eclectic place - but not in a bad way at all. Really friendly workers who even offered up a slice of warm pumpkin pie for free. I love places with a huge loose leaf menu and this is one of those place - they also sell their loose leaf tea. Their hand made mugs and tea pots make every cup unique and special and some it looked like were offered for sale. A fire place in the back just added to the homey feel and the amazing smell in the air of fresh homemade Palestinian soups and dips. Seating is a mix of random chairs and couches all arrange in a manner encouraging conversations and lingering in the shop which offers Free WiFi. Street parking was easily obtainable on Black Friday so I image any day perhaps aside from the Fest should not be problematic. This is a few blocks south from Mayfield Road hill but isn't too far to include it in your walk around Little Italy.
