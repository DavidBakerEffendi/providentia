In an age of over cooked, dry, tiny fast food burgers, the Pit Stop still makes burgers the old fashioned way, delicious!

We've been going here for decades. They never fails to please us.  I usually get a Pit burger and add a few extras like Swiss cheese and a chili. The BBQ bacon burger with onion rings is good, too. We usually split a basket of fries. Great food.
