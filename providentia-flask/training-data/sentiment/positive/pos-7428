Sorry for the half-eaten photo; I just could barely stop eating to take the picture it was so good! I'm a huge fan of warm breakfasts but I also don't have any time in the morning and I'm also kind of picky, so Kneaders breakfast sandwiches are perfect for me! I highly recommend the sausage/cheese/egg croissant; the cheese is folded into the egg and everything is right in the world when you start your day with this deliciousness. Plus, it's Monday; I had to reward myself for making it here, right?!
