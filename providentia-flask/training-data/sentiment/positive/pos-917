After a few attempts to get to the Pizzeria Bianco downtown, I was so pleased to happen upon this location. I finally, FINALLY got to see what the fuss was all about.

I'm giving this five stars because, really, it's five star pizza. It's every bit as delish as some of my other favorite pizza joints. I'm going to say that it didn't quite live up to my expectations, though. I was half-expecting a religious experience after all the hype. Alas, the sky didn't open up and I didn't hear the angels sing, but I did have some pretty freakin' awesome pizza, and I will definitely go again when I'm in the neighborhood.
