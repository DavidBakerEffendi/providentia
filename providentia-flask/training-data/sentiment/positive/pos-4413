This is our go to place for Pizza in our neighborhood. And that is being said w/ Grimaldi's just around the corner. In fact, I think Grimaldi's is quite bland and boring. 

Love the crust! You can always count on a beautiful crispy char!  This the real thin crust pizza that I miss from NYC!  I think the thing that keeps us coming back is the sauce on it. It's got flavor. It's nothing fancy just good pizza. 

They are always friendly. Always ready in 20! Love the location, since you can put an order in and swing by the rest of Boca Park to finish an errand before picking up dinner.  They also deliver!!  It's consistently good. It's great to have you, East Side Pizza in the neighborhood!
