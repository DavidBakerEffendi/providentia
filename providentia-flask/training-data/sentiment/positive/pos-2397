Listen. So I don't award 5 stars too often, but holy shit man. This place is like a flavor symphony. It's like eating art, not food. I've never experienced such a masterful artistry of fruits, vegetables and grains. People complaining that eating healthy tastes like shit obviously hasn't experienced this place. That's what it is. An experience. The ingredients are unusual, but delicious. Everything is a composition. Their menu is so unique and skillfully constructed. I could really give the chef a hug. No corners are cut here. There is real emotion in the food they make, real passion. It's obvious. Top five favorite in Charlotte, hands down.
