For a casual Chinese eatery, this gets a five star rating!!  Freshly prepared food that was delicious in a comfortable environment with excellent service.  

So much better than any Chinese food we've had since moving here from Seattle 8 years ago.  We ordered the Mongolian Beef, Crispy Fried Beef, the Combo Japanese Udon, and the Pork Roll.  Everything was fabulous.  Great flavor, texture, and large portions.  

Highly recommended!!
