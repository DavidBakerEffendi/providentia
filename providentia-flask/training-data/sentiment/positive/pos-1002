I had the pleasure of celebrating my friend's birthday here. When I first walked in the big sparkly chandelier caught  my eye like most things that sparkle. I loved that the decor was elegant and the menu was affordable. This allowed me to try more items on the menu.

I started with the French Onion Soup which was amazing! The broth , the bread and the gooey cheese made the best French Onion soup I've had to date. I was also curious about grape, basil and ricotta flat bread so I definitely had to order that! It was also topped with candied walnuts, arugula (my favorite)  and drizzled with balsamic. It had that sweet and savory taste to it. I folded mine and ate it like a sandwich so nothing would fall off to the side. It's a great appetizer because it's light and leaves room for your entree. Since I just had my wisdom teeth taken out I needed a very soft entree. I chose the Rice Au Gratin with chicken. It was creamy, rich and fit the bill . The portions were big enough for me to take some home for lunch the next day. 

The Sparklings is a wonderful place for a date and special occasions.The dishes are great for sharing so everyone can order something different and you can experience an array of entree's and appetizers.
