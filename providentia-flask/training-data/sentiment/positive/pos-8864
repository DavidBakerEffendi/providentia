I'm impressed!  We walked in the door three weeks later and the waiter said "Welcome Back!".  Huh? In the United States?  Customer Service to the top?  
Plus he remembered the Sangiovese we'd liked.  I'm just not used to this.
Plus the owner's son stopped by to check on everything!  In a pizza parlor?

Oh, the pizza?  I forgot the most important part.  Great!  Thin Crust!  San Marzano tomatoes. Fresh mozzarello. Excellent....

You know, I'm probably not spelling these words right cuz I've never seen them on a pizza menu before
