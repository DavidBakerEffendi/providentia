My parents and I recently ordered takeout from here last week, and I can candidly attest that IGTM still prepares THE absolute gyro in the entire metropolitan area. Unmatched in quality, its meat is still succulent, its tzatziki sauce still as tangy as it is manna-bound, its batura-like pita bread toasted to achieve the ideal balance of crispness and spongy richness, its vegetables are still farm-fresh, and the entire proto-sandwich is still dusted with that magical, colorful blend of herbs and spices that tempt the eyes as well as the tongue. The obligatory fries are shaped almost like paddles, and the husband/wife tandem of owner/operators will still insist on leaving the brown paper bag open to prevent sogginess. 

IGTM's menu has been scaled down a bit so as to concentrate more on what sells best for them. Stop avoiding Brookline and stop into It's Greek To Me for Pittsburgh's very best Mediterranean fare.
