I've been vegan for 4+ years. I've been in fine dining FOH for 23 years. Needless to say, I know food. Came in with a few cycling buddies after a long ride. Had one of the best tasting veggie burritos AND black bean burger (minus the chipotle sauce add pico) I've had, period. (Yes, I had both!) Tons of flavor. Great value. Large portions. Friendly, prompt and attentive service from host to waiter to floor mgr. Water always topped off and plenty of check backs without being overbearing. My friends really liked their meals too. Highly recommend!
