Lucky Foos makes me smile like a lucky fool!! This is one of my favorite local spots. Let's start with the welcoming atmosphere of the restaurant. I love that depending on what mood I'm in I can choose between sitting at the lush bar, in a cozy booth, at the sushi bar, out in the enclosed patio. I mean, who doesn't appreciate choices? The space is decorated so nicely. Beautiful, vibrant colors, unique kitchy artistry all tied together with an authentic theme. 

Now for the food...aww the delicious food. Some of my favs include the charred shishito peppers (I order these EVERY time I'm here), the chicken robata skewers (so succulent and juicy), and the pork belly ramen (oh. mah. gawd!). You're welcome! Seriously, you must try all three of these items. The forbidden rice is another excellent choice if you're not in the mood for soup. I would recommend you make multiple visits here because after you eat all of my personal recommendations you probably won't have room for dessert, but you HAVE to try the Funckler!!! I've had dreams about this amazing blondie topped with delicious ice cream. 

BTW, they also have a brunch menu! I highly recommend the chicken and waffles. Again, you're welcome! ; )
