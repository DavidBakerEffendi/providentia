So good! I can't believe it took me so long to try this buffet!

Almost everything was delicious! From the salads, soups, meat, side dishes, to the desserts. Amazing! I could've sat there all day eating. What I thought was most unique food they have was the quail and pesto mash potatoes! The quail was a little dry though. They have kobe beef, vietnamese spring rolls, and a variety of sushi rolls here as well. The desserts are amazing!

Definitely coming back!
