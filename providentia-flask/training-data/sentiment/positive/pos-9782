It never fails that I get a craving for a good burger right in the middle of peak meal times for this place.  Thankfully the burger was worth the wait.  I went through the drive thru and they had a person walking to cars to help speed up the line.  I ordered and quickly moved through the line.  I had a double, double protein style.  I love a good burger but hate the feeling of eating a giant bun as it subtracts from the flavor.  I devoured my meal and went about my day.  I hope to get better at planning my trip for food in hopes of not waiting in a huge line!
