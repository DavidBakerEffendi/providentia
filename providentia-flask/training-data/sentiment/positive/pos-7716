I LOVE CANTINA 1511. I could shout it from the hilltops, like Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music. Seriously, folks do-re-mi favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands down.

The decor is Mexi-sexy, with low lighting, booths and tables both, and a great outdoor patio. The bar area is small, but cozy and always well stocked with local and imported beers.

The service = outstanding. Over the years I've been going, I have never had anything less than stellar service. I am one who is a stickler for good service (great food can be made OK when the waiter is a jerk), and this place gets 6 stars in that department.

Foodwise, I've never had anything that didn't make me say "Oh my god, try this!" to whoever my lucky date was. A good mix of texmex and authentic, I oftentimes get the 3 tacos with rice and beans. Now I am not ussually a taco person, but their taco options make it near impossible to resist: a chicken taco with pineapple salsa, taco al pastor with pork and greenchiles/habeneros salsa, a vegetarian hard taco smothered in red sauce with a medely of perfectly cooked vegetables inside that makes you wonder why you ever need to eat meat again, and a carne asada taco with onions that is so good you want to high five a cow. 

Other hits include the pork entree (slow cooked in spices, falls off the bone, right into my mouth, mmmm), salmon (best salmon of MY LIFE), and the Nutella pie dessert. That dessert.... just try it. It will be one of the best decisions of your life besides having sex, getting married, having kids and buying that winning lotterry ticket. 

Can you tell I love this place? If you're looking to go out with friends, a date, your mom or your parole officier, look no further. Cantina has something for everyone, with unmatched quality and superior service.
