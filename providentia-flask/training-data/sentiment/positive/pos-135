I wish I got the girls name that helped us because she was amazing!!we got 3 macarons strawberry lemonade...gauva..and birthday cake...YUMMM to ALL 3. My youngest couldn't decide and wanted something from the gas station around the corner instead!!! Lmaoo...the girl that worked there gave her a birthday cake macaron to try(wich she didn't like...crazy kid!!)so me and my other daughter split hers lol and took her to gas station and she was happy as all could be getting 2 bags of smarties!!!
