It's been a little while since I've been here, but I just recommended my brother head over today for lunch on a business trip and it reminded me of how good this place is.  I've read through the reviews below, and I get that not every place is for everybody, there will always be haters and complainers, but complaining that a place makes you burp?  Or saying Orange Chicken doesn't belong in a Quesadilla?!?!?   One, take a Zantac before you go eat if you're worried about burps.  Frankly, I like burping and in some cultures, I would argue ours even, burping is a sign of satisfaction after a meal!  next, if you don't want orange chicken in a quesadilla?  Don't order it?!?!  Pretty easy fix, if you ask me.

Anyway, the food here is SO good, I love it, I go every time I'm in Chandler!  The fun mix of Chinese and Mexican makes for interesting and delicious mixtures.  If you want something safe, go with the Chile relleno quesadilla - freakin amazing, IF you're not avers to a little spice and/or lactose intolerant as the amount of cheese on this thing is borderline obscene (in a good way).  The Jade Red Chicke in delish, the fried rice is amazing, honestly I haven't had a bad thing at this place.

Bottom line, ignore the few haters and go in with a little bit of adventure.  Pay attention when they take you through the choices and ENJOY it. It's delish.  Totally 5 stars.
