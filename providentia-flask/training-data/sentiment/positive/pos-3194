Hmmmmm where should I begin? The wings were AMAZING and an UNDENIABLE representation of what chicken wings should be. This was my 1st visit and it is safe to say I will return! I had Teriyaki and it was again AMAZING! 

The bartender "Jacqueline" is the TRUTH. She handled the bar, placing orders, and with precision she prepared my drinks PERFECTLY!! The atmosphere was welcoming and the people were friendly and Happy drunks! 

The music was not up my alley but Hey, after the 2nd drink I didn't mind it at all!!
