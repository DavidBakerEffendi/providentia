Kailua pork was awesome! Rice and slaw were a perfect compliment. Amazing how good rice can be when it is cooked just right....wish I knew the secret. Brought home a spam musubi for my son....hope to eat my own next time!

Can easily miss this place! On the north side of the street in what seems like a auto industry dedicated strip mallish development.

Super nice people!
