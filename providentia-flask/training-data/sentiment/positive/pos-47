I only give 5 stars to top restaurants and this surely qualifies. 


My boyfriend and I made reservation for RM Seafood when we were in vegas back in March 2014. We both were so excited to come here. When we arrived, we were seated immediately since we had reservations. The place is fantastic for a nice romantic evening. The atmosphere very intimate. Our server came soon after we were seated and let me just say, I have never met a server who knew the menu as well as ours did. We learned from conversing with him that he had been there for 8 years which would make sense as to how he knew the menu so well. 

 My boyfriend started his meal by eating a lentil soup and I had nice and refreshing cucumber salad with a nice cranberry vodka. I ended up getting the special which was a halibut dish and my boyfriend order a seafood gumbo. My meal was very small! I was kinda amazed that something could cost so much but it was AMAZING! I cannot say I had a better cooked fish dish than this one. Luckily I had a large lunch earlier in the day or I would have still be hungry after the meal. 

We ended the night with splitting dessert which was a strawberry shortcake with ice cream dish topped with a strawberry syrup. I wish I could buy a jar of the syrup it was so good. 

We probably spend a good $130 for the two of us

One of the best meals I've ever had. Hats off to the chefs and our server!
