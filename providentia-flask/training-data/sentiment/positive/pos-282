I've been going to Pita Jungle for years now over 20 to give you a correct number. There is nothing bad on the menu. There might be dishes you don't agree with but then they will make you something you will love usually at no cost to you. The staff is always polite and they have a nice rotation of artwork that is not only interesting but affordable. 

Good Luck, Jason
