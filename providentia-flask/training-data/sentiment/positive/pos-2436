This the place we go to for Chinese!  Always prompt with delivery, hot food, good portions, and the price is great!  When we moved here, we had a hard time finding a good Chinese place but this now our go to!  We tried many different places, but this is the best bang for our buck.  We love this place.  I get a bit of a variety depending on my mood and have always enjoyed what I got.  They messed up my order once, but it wasn't that big of a deal honestly.  It won't stop me from ordering from them!  They usually give us a free egg roll or something so that is always a nice perk, but I would still order from them regardless.
