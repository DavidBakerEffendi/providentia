Man I loved coming here watching the fountains at night with my best gal listening to Frank Sinatra for the first time in Vegas. Definitely come here at night to see the 8th wonder of the world. It's free and it doesn't take to much of your time. We spent at least 15 minutes watching the water dance before are eyes. When I'm in Vegas I always visit the Bellagio for the fountains! Located in the heart of the strip it's real easy to find.
