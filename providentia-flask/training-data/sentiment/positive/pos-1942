Always excellent, service is outstanding, sushi is better than most in the city, the rosemary steak rivals the best steak houses in the city and the sweet and sour calamari appetizer is amazing. Ask about the boxes and towers if you are dining with friends as thats a great sometimes off the menu option. This is always my first call for seafood and the brunch and Sunday 1/2 price wine special is great. Its not a cheap eat but good value for money and the bar staff are excellent if you want more casual dining
