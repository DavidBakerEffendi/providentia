This was the perfect lunch! I got the Sack's Symphony with turkey, bacon, avocado, sprouts, tomato and cream cheese. It was SO SO good. The combination was prefect. There was plenty of meat and toppings piled on- it definitely filled me up. It's clear the place is a well-loved lunch spot- it was a full house at 1:00. I can't wait to go back.
