First time ever having Five Guys! It was a great first experience. Was greeted by a nice guy, he was very patient with me while I figured out what I wanted. They have so many options!! Our food came out quick and it was so delicious. I don't understand why it's taken me so long to try Five Guys, but I will definitely have it again.
