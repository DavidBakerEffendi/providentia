The rooms here are nice, although the phone chargers take forever to charge your phone.  Just bring your own charger and you'll be all set.

The particular thing about the Venetian that I would like to highlight and recommend is the exhibits that they have near the front desk when you walk in.  I have been to both the Leonardo Da Vinci exhibit that they had and the National Geographic's Best Photos Exhibit.  Both were wonderful!

The Leonardo Da Vinci Exhibit was amazing, they took his famous notebooks that he wrote and they built a lot of the items in them so that you can see the concept come to life.  It also features a huge blow up of the Mona Lisa and a history on it.  I am well read on Da Vinci and love him, and there was even information in there that was new to me, like about the water spot under her eye because Napoleon used to own her and hung her in his bathroom (Really, Napoleon, you giant jerk?)  Anyways, it was a great experience.

The National Geographic exhibit was also awesome.  It was a gallery of their 50 best pictures, or top 25, I can't really remember, but it was amazing.  I took my sister to this and she also loved it.  The exhibits tell the background story of the photograph and some include the frames that were shot along with the photo.  The photos are beautiful and the stories behind them are just as beautiful.  Definitely worth going to.

The ceiling in the entryway when you come in off of the strip next to Tao and the Candy Store thing is beautiful, you can lose track of time looking at the beautiful detail.  The Gondola's are also worth seeing.  I haven't ridden them, but they are so neat to look at especially if you have kids.  The St Mark's Square area is also pretty cool.

Overall, its a beautiful casino and hotel, Las Vegas should be proud to have it.
