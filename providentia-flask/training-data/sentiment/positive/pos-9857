I've never been to an African restaurant before and this was a wonderful introduction for me!  I ordered the Fufu and Goat Light Soup and a meat pie on the side.  The soup was amazing!  So full of flavor with just the right amount of spice!  And while most of the goat I've had was served in the form of a curry, I've never had goat this good.  It was so tender and flavorful.  It worked so well with the flavors of the soup broth.  

Now, just an FYI: my enjoyment of food is based almost more on textures than flavors.  And fufu has a texture unlike anything I've ever eaten and it was difficult for my brain to say "yeah, that's food!".  Nonetheless, it is a wonder vehicle for the soup and once I was able to tell my brain to just shut up and enjoy the food, I was in heaven!

The meat pie was basically a fried pastry with a filling of meat and onions.  It was delicious and very large for the price!  I probably could have had a scoop of rice (or a mug of that broth!) and it would have made a wonderful meal on its own!

All in all it was a wonderful experience.  I will order from here again for sure!
