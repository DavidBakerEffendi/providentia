My family has been coming here for YEARSS. So much that even the workers recognized us lol! The service here is so so friendly, I don't understand why some of the reviewers say they're rude because I don't think we ever encounter that now! Tip, order a bunch of stuff then share it with your friends/family because each plate comes with aloot. Thai tea- hands down the best Thai tea I've had! The dishes we normally get are the Whole Fried red snapper, in chile sauce. Omg it's so good, worth the extra $$ I promise! ORDER THE BASIL FRIED RICE, You will not be disappointed my friend!! My family absolutely loves their Shrimp Tom Yum soup in the hot pot, it's good but it's honestly a little too spicy for me lol! So if your a lover for spicy food, I defffinalty recommend that. I really love coming here, atmosphere is nice & the place is super clean too and I don't think we ever had to wait for a table- hurrah! (;
