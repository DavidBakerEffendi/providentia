Carolina's is a classic local Mexican food spot in Phoenix, if you don't like it you probably suck!  It's not the atmosphere that makes this place great, although it is not terrible (actually pretty nice if you compare it to any other fast food joint).  It is not the service that makes this place awesome, although I never have waited more than a few minutes for my food.  I actually recommend calling in your order over the phone so you don't wait in line since the place is so popular many times you wait longer in line (think Chipotle at lunch time).  IT'S THE FOOD THAT MAKE'S THIS PLACE THE BEST!  The tortillas are homemade and I usually get a dozen to go.  The salsa is so flavorful, the re-fried beans are taste, the breakfast burritos are perfect, and I have gotten the rolled tacos, enchiladas, bean burrito, red chili burrito, taco, tostada, & tamale and never once was it ever less than great!  This place is as good as it gets and the prices are more than reasonable.
