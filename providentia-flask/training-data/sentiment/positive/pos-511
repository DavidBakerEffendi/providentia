If you haven't tried this place yet, go now!  The pizza is first rate.  The crust is not real thin nor real thick, but yummy.  The artichoke pizza is wonderful, and the sausage is just right.  The pastas and salads are as good as any.  The outdoor seating and the reasonable prices are the frosting on the cake.  We've been back a half dozen times and the service has always been good.
