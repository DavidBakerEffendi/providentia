Food is OUTSTANDING. Service is OUTSTANDING! Way to go! Great selection of sandwhiches, plates, sides, and tapas. Not to mention fanstastic variety of tap, rotating tap, and bottle selections of beer. The food is so on point it is not even funny. Great side patio. The only downfall is they allow folks to smoke on the patio where you can dine and drink.
