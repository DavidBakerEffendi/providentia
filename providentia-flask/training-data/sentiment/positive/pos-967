Legit Mexican food from a small homey shop.
We had the green enchiladas and the mole enchiladas. Both were delicious. I've been kinda into mole for a couple months, and I thought Mama Maria's sauce stood up there with some of the best I've had. Of course it is rich, so if you like something a little fresher tasting, the green sauce was really excellent. We both commented on the quality of the meat - tender, juicy, not blobby. The enchiladas are served 3 to a plate, with sour cream, pico de gallo, rice and beans. I loved the beans - made me think about the runny beans I used to have from my friends' nana's growing up. The rice is blander and not my favorite, but then rice is never my favorite.
The chips were a pleasant surprise - whole tortilla size, like at the old Supermex (Cantina Jalisco). Light and crunchy with a flavorful salsa.
Prices were good: $13 for an iced tea and the huge enchilada plate, which could easily be split. I might like to see them add a couple lunch specials to the menu (or maybe I just missed them...).
It's kinda in the hood, but that's half the allure of Mama Maria's.
It's close to work, so I'll definitely be back for lunch, and hopefully I can drag the family up here sometime for dinner, too.
Bonus: it's connected to a Mexican bakery, where I picked up a dozen butter cookies to go.
