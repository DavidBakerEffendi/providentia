Found a random post on the gram, same day we went to check this place out. Small shop. Initial thought of the store was questionable. Not really the most organized and the yellow pass sign wasn't pleasing to look at. Not much room to dine in, but on the bright side they had a take out window. Pricing was surprisingly low, from the slices, pizzas, to wings. 

Ordered a large pizza, half veggie and half with just shawarma chicken. Drizzled with garlic and hot sauce at the end. Came to $14.00. 

Despite my initial reaction the food was top notch, the entire pizza was done in a matter of minutes. Perfect crust that doesn't scrape your gums. Generous amount of toppings on both sides.Good cheese. The chicken was as expected well flavored and was great alone. Adding the sauces on top, was the perfect combination. 

Overall would recommend this place, and worth a try. One of those cases where you shouldn't judge by looks. Great experience for a random plan. Friendly staff. More importantly for the price the food is good. Would go again.

** Dont forget to ask for the garlic sauce and hot sauce on top.
