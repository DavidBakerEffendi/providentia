This is a cool little breakfast place on Mill. I'm really surprised this is like the only one. They have done it right. Great breakfast combo's, little bar if you want bloody mary's or mimosa's. Lots of college kids coming in to nurse their hangover. Totally dug this place, awesome place for college town. I'll TOTALLY be back.
