Food: tried a Tuna Melt and a Cesar Salad. The sandwich was a perfect combination of herbs -- including tarragon. The tuna had an ideal texture and arrived on Texas toast. There was a waxy layer of melted cheese over the top of it. It is served with potato chips made in RM's own kitchen. I found the potato chips too oily and would prefer cole slaw or (?) I arrived as the kitchen was serving the last lunch menu items of the day and would soon begin set up for dinner. Waitstaff were helpful and friendly.

Facility: This review covers the causal dining section downstairs. The upscale dining room is on the second floor. When you arrive, you may notice the biggest pivot door I've ever seen. Everything in the dining room was unusually clean. No fingerprints or smudges on the chrome or glass. There were no wayward napkins or vegetables on the floor. Spotless!

Editorial: Altruism is doing something for others with no expectation you'll benefit. Rick is cool because he granted an interview to the 2011 team of Roadtrip Nation. There was some risk in doing this and he got no direct benefit from the interview. This was generous and cool. 

Suggestions for improvement: none.
