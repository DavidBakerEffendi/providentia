highlights:

1. the meat was really well cooked. we had pulled pork and the brisket. both were tender. moist. smokey. (not a bbq salt lick)
2. the sides were great. the beans were flavorful. the rice was soft and the coleslaw was cold and not overly dressed. 
3. the staff was awesome! we went in at 8:45 (they close at 9) and received friendly service and good attitudes. 
4. THIS IS FAST FOOD AND FAST SERVICE! having a good quality bbq meal fast and delicious requires a good review. 

would we go back? HECK YAH! it's the only close bbq joint in town that ACTUALLY tastes like great bbq.
