Had to update my review as the owners took action on a few things.   They got a new chef!!!  This chef is getting the Aji sauce right.  The exact amount of seasoning and the overall food is much MUCH better.  Most Def 5 Star quality now.  Must haves: Llomo Saltado, Aji Sauce, Plantains, Seafood Mixto (Ceviche).  Enjoy!!
