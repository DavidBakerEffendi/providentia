When I lived at Yonge and Finch I used to go to the Yonge street location. Now that I live in Burlington I was ecstatic to learned that they opened up a location in Mississauga. This is one of those places that have only 10 items on the menu and it all delicious. When they first opened up it was $7 a meal but they have since they increased the prices but it's still affordable and well worth the money!  I went with my daughters and they had the broil bulgogi and I had the kin chi tofu soon. Both dish very tasty. I love the purple rice in the stone pot. The starter Korean dishes were very tasty and your can ask for more when you finish. This is my favourite place. Very authentic and the wait staff are so nice. Amazing service. The owner always gives my girls candies at the end so cute.  This is such a great hidden gem!
