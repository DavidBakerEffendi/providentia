Really tasty traditional Italian. I loved Eddie 'n' Eddie so I was initially bummed about the Cerino's switch, but I'm over it now. 

The food here is awesome and the menu has a ton of variety. Cocktails and beer list are great, service is good. I usually expect to wait but I don't mind hanging out at the bar. Their bread is AWESOME and the mussels are my favorite appetizer. Pasta is solid and offers a range of homestyle options to more contemporary dishes. My favorite is the asparagus ravioli, and the crispy gnocchi. 

Very glad to have another solid Italian joint in Lakewood. It's such a treat!
