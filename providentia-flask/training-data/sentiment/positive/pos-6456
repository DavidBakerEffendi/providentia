Spent my birthday dinner at Lumiere and I can say it was a wise choice. It was a Sunday night during Restaurant week, slots went quick. My friends and I decided to take an early dinner. The servers were very at tentative and the dishes were served quickly since it was not very crowded. 
All the courses were very well cooked, seasoned and plated - they served traditional French dishes with twists. The highlights of the night were the Shrimp Bouillabaisse and Duck Breast - they are both Lumiere's signature and didn't disappoint! Portion wise, the dedicated dishes were actually quite filling! After the appetizer and three courses, we were all full but not overwhelmed. Will definitely come back!
