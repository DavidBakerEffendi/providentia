So. I don't know if it is fair to give this resto a 5 star review since I have never been there. I ordered this food delivery. So the review is for the food alone. No idea what the actual physical restaurant is like (according to other reviews the ambiance may leave something to be desired).

I am, however, having a love affair with this roti. 
Butter chicken. Added paneer. Mango chutney on the side. 

This roti has a delicious flavour. It is spicy but not painful. The texture is amazing - not a sloppy drippy mess (which we've all had) but rather a robust roti that is flaky and chewy and a creamy filling with giant chunks of chicken, paneer and the occasional hunk of potato. 

The roti is like a thin naan. I have had other roti that were more like a very thin cornmeal pancake. This is not that. It's like a chewy thin naan baked over high heat. 

The meal was huge. If I had been moderate i could have eaten it over two nights. I ate it all at once. 

I saw a number of comments on google about the price. I paid $24 for my meal including taxes and tip. Is this expensive for roti? Yes. Is it worth it? Definitely.
