This place is a gem! The cakes are always fresh and the quality outstanding. If you have time for a light lunch, the sandwiches and soups are delist. Good, old-fashioned cooking. I especially like their split pea soup and the open-face shrimp salad sandwich. My favorite cakes are the strawberry meringue and, believe it or not, the sugar free diabetic chocolate mousse. I'm not diabetic but I order this cake because it is yummy! Doesn't have an aspartame taste at all. All you can taste is the high quality chocolate that they use. The service is also very good - friendly, fast and very courteous.
