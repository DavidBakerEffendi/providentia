Wow...I mean, WOW!  Just a huge, overly on purpose, extremely melodramatically emphasized, WOW!!!!   Why?  Because they deserve it.  And yes, it's in the "hood" and so what??  This is a legit little Chinese eatery that makes the best, smokiest fired rice I've had in I can't remember.  And I've had some pretty damn good fried rice but this place is just sick off the charts frigg'en amazing.  And the egg foo young??  Forget about it.  

I had to try this place before I left town and I'm so glad, so so glad I did.  What a gem!!!!
