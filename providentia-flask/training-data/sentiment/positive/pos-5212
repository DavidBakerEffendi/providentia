I bought in on the whole gourmet food truck trend and had been to Food Truck Fridays a few times, but I gotta be honest that I was skeptical of pizza from a truck. I'm also not afraid to admit when I'm wrong, and I was very wrong in this case. The pizza wasn't just good for a truck. It was just damn good. Great thin crispy crust and lots of different, fresh toppings. Will definitely be back
