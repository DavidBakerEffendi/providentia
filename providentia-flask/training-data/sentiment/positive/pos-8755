Outstanding destination for modern dining. We went on opening night, and you would think they had been open for years. Busy to capacity, staff was on point in every regard, knowledgeable, their in house sommelier came over to greet us, as well as management. We left the order entirely up to the waiter, and boy did he wow us. I couldn't name the foods we tried because there were so many, but it's safe to say the most memorable were definitely the Steamed Mussels, the Agnolotti and Garganelli. We finished off with a couple of their 28oz Dry Aged Prime Porterhouse, which was undoubtedly the best I've ever had. Wow. And then, just when we thought we were full up, they bring out this extraordinary Bronte Pistachio Gelato that was to die for. I could have indeed died that night and been utterly satisfied. We will be back, matter of fact, maybe even tonight! Cheers.
