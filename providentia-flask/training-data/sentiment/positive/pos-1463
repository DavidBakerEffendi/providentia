Egg Works they live up to there name for sure. I came in went straight to the bar and had service instantly. Our waitress name was Heather and she was very helpful and awesome. I ordered the Stuffed French Toast food was delivered within 10 minutes and served hot. The stuffed French Toast was a good size quantity and just really good all around. Food was good, service was good, and atmosphere is good. I will be back
