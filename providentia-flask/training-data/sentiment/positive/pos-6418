Loved it! I got the twin dragon, and wanted to make a few substitutions on it and they were more than happy to help and accommodate my needs. The final price came out to be about $12, and most of the "sushi burritos" are priced around that price. It was sooo good, I already can't wait to go back. It tasted really fresh, they have a lot of different options, you can customize your own thing, and they also offer bowls.
