Probably one of my favourite family owned restaurants. The workers are great and very polite. My girlfriend and I travel from Vaughan and Mississauga to Koreatown every few months to visit this little gem of a restaurant. The buttermilk Chicken is definitely worth the drive down. I haven't tried the Sunday Brunch yet and that's definitely going to happen sooner or later. Keep it up friends!
