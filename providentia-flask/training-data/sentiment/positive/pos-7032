When my friends said we were going to meet up at Lavo after dinner I figured we can grab a bite to eat here.  It just sounds like an interesting mix of everything I love...Japanese and Latin food. Yums...

My friend and I wanted food but didn't want to be over fed either.  We asked the server what we should have and he suggested the 3 item meat plate (part of the Latin/Brazilian side) and maybe start with a seabass appetizer.  We went with his suggestions and were so incredibly satisfied.  The seabass was amazing.  It was flavorful but light just perfect before our meat combo.  For two girls it was more than enough food.  There was an option for a 5 meat option but I think that would've been over board.  Everything was pretty yummy and satisfying. 

Service was also nice.  Although this place is extremely busy at night and it's pretty hard to see (the dark atmosphere is great for romantic night but hard to see the menu).  Also, the decor was interesting.  I found myself having slight ADD trying to look around at everything from video montage in the background to the fun anime like murals.  Music was a tad loud too but you can still carry on a conversation.

Reservations are recommended but my friend and I just kinda came here on a whim and got in right away.  Given we're only a party of two.  Drink menu was crazy long with an extensive list of sake.  We didn't get any but I sure would think they'd have what you're looking for if you're in the mood to drink. Also, prices can be "steep" on some items but the items we got came to a grand total around $55 or so.  Not bad by Vegas standards and split between two of us that was nothing...we were full and happy.
