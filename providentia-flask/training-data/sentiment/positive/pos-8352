i grew up in HAWAII and a trip to POKE EXPRESS was a very special treat.

we stopped by and loaded up on lots of tasty nibbles -- SHOYU AHI POKE, SPICY AHI POKE, MUSSEL POKE (KIMCHEE style), SALMON POKE with special sauce and TAKO POKE (KIMCHEE style). still one of my all time favorites, PIPIKAULA, a teriyaki flavored HAWAIIAN-style beef flank steak jerky.

hauled everything back to the "resort casino" where we're staying and filled the mini-fridge. 

happy, happy, happy. 

life is very, very good indeed !!!
