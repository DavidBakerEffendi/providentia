My mom and I ate here.  I have been wanting some authentic Mexican food for awhile so when my mom came to visit I decided to come here and give it a try since it had so many stars and great reviews.  And it showed.  The food was soooooo good!! I HAVE to eat here one more time before I move.. They serve homemade fresh tostada chips with salsa that is delicious.  And their rice is made from scratch you can tell. Everything was super good.  You can taste the authenticity for sure.  It tastes as if you are at your abuelita's house eating some home cooked food.  Love it... 

Next door is a pastry shop with pan Dulce's.  Mmmmm we got some to go and let me tell you even a couple of days later the pan dulce still tastes fresh..
