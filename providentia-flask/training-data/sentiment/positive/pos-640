This place is a must try. The food and service are excellent every trip. We brought our dog with us today to sit outside and the staff immediately brought a water bowl and some treats for her. They are very pet friendly so that is a big plus! We always get the gyros and they never disappoint. I like these better than Showmars and that is saying something. As for sides, the lemon oregano fries are stellar as well as the loukamades. 

If you haven't been you must stop here to try it for yourself.
