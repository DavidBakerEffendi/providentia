If you want a traditional Steak House you found it! Old nostalgic western setting and delicious full portions you won't leave here disappointed! This place came highly recommend to me.  I ordered the Smoke prime rib french dip sandwich. The best I've ever tasted! Every bite juicier than the next. With creamy horseradish sauce and wide steak fries perfectly crisp. The restaurant's history can be seen and smelled throughout. Garnished with John Wayne photos and western props makes this place a hidden gem! Will be returning soon.
