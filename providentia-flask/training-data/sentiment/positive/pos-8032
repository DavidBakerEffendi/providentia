Absolutely excellent Ethiopian food in a cozy, home-like atmosphere. The waitstaff/owners are really charming and genuinely want you to have an amazing experience at their restaurant. 

Interior is spotlessly clean and the only thing Abugida is lacking at present is desserts and a liquor license. They're working on the liquor license so soon you'll be able to enjoy a cool glass of honey wine with your food.

Don't miss out on their sampler platter which is a good value and the best way to sample a variety of dishes. They serve a delicious collard greens + house made Ethiopian fresh cheese dish which is very unique; we have never encountered this dish before and we eat Ethiopian food frequently. 

All in all Abugida is a great place for people who are addicted to Ethiopian food or people who are trying it for the first time...and everyone in between. It's a gem and a great addition to Charlotte!
