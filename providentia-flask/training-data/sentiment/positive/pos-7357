Another outstanding meal at Island Style.  This remains one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas.  Russell and his wife are always so welcoming, and the food is always fast, hot, delicious and plentiful.  They never let our glasses get half empty or our stomachs to go without some gratifying morsel.  They are always going above and beyond, like bringing us extra mandu or topping off my kids' meal with an Otter Pop!  This place is a gem, and it deserves so much to be on map of great restaurants, but yet I want it to remain small and intimate and familial like it is.  My family and I want to yell it from the rooftops--- WE LOVE THIS PLACE!
