I am very late in writing my review which is a shame because this was one of the best meals I've ever had in Phoenix.

The seating is tight, it was very awkward waiting for our table in a walk way.  We were very much in the way of the wait staff and other patrons.  We had a large group and we were comfortably seated though.

What I ordered... what what I ordered is no longer on the menu... I'm actually really sad because the pasta I had was homemade flat noodles in a homemade apple sausage pieces in this sauce that was a dream.  I could not get enough of the sauce and I practically licked the plate dry (well as close to it since It is a nice place to eat and I tried to some some decency).

There was also this caramel rosemary cheese cake that was so fantastic that I was sad that no other cheesecakes could compare.

I've been writing this review while staring at the new menu that is published on their website.  I'm sure what is available now will be fantastic, I'm just also sad I can't go back and re-do this meal again.... it was that good.

I guess I will have to go back soon and try the new menu!
