Surprisingly great service. I'm not sure what was going on with the lady behind the magic counter but she was really happy. It made the kids smile and started our trip off right. Chrystee was over the top good... And its subway. We got a subway cheer and I even got upsold to 12 cookies ( don't ask).

I have never experienced this level of excitement at a fast food place, especially a sandwich shop. We all got not only greeted but complimented as soon as we walked in and that set the tone. Its a chain so its hard to rate them with anything too crazy, but considering the service I had to throw in the extra star to make it 5.
