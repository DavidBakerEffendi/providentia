This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  I was introduced to this place when I first moved to Arizona, and has been my go to place for Mexican food since.  Whenever I get company in town to visit I always make sure this is a trip we make out to eat.  Great food, decent prices, and love the atmosphere.
