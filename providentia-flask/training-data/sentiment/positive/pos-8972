This might be my favorite place altogether in Pittsburgh! It's definitely hands down favorite brunch place. 

Sunday deal: $10 for one entree, one drink, cold appetizers buffet, cake buffet

The food tastes SO GOOD! The cold appetizer buffet is the absolute best with all kinds of yummy salads, pastas, hummus, and fresh goodness. And the cakes are so so perfect as well... very obviously baked in the past day and not smothered in frosting just perfectly sweet. 

Something about all their food just leaves you with a clean feeling as you leave. Sure you might be bloated from stuffing your face but it's all good for you food and so fresh at that.
