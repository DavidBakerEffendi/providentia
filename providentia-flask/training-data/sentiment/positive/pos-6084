Stopped in for a sandwich and beer.  The waitress recommended the French dip made in a pizza crust.  It was so, so good!  Also requested tartar sauce to go with our fries and they offer there home made tartar sauce - best I've ever had too many places make it with sweet pickles I happen to love it with dill pickles - tailgaters makes it perfect!
