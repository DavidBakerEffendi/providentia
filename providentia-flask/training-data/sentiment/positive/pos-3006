I've been a fan since they had their old location. While not a regular Annie's is our go to spot for authentic Italian locally. 

Tonight we hung out in the bar enjoying locals and sweet natured visitors. Great service from 'Gio' Rice Balls, shrimp Scampi a cocktail and then a lovely Moscato! 
We were at Annie's this time on a Friday evening! By 7 we left with full tummies happy and feeling connected to friendly strangers. Annie's is authentic, fresh, and more than the food!!!
