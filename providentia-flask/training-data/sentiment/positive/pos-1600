This has been one of my favourites since I stumbled upon it while the le petit déjeuner line was too long (although also a bit fan of le petit déjeuner!). The brunch at poet is different on Saturdays and Sundays (note, pictures here are from the Sunday brunch). Sunday brunch includes 6 individual sides, your choice of omelette and tea or coffee for $18.99! Great price given how delicious everything is. The sides include: rose petal jam, nut and spice crusted feta, olives, cream and honey, cold cuts and their take on Greek salad, as well as delicious pita-style bread with sesame. Highly recommend if you want a different brunch experience :)
