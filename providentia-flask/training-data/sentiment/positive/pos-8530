Some of the best food around!  I had always just stopped to grab bagels for the office for breakfast, but one morning when I was waiting for my order I looked around and the food in the restaurant part looked really good!  We decided to stop by for breakfast and it took a couple of tries before we were able to finally get in as they are busy and you need to get there early.  Both my boyfriend and I had the corned beef hash and eggs and it was delicious!!!  I've been craving it ever since.

I went for dinner a couple of times in the past week and their dinner food is just as great as the breakfast.  I had the beef stroganoff once and the chicken marsala the next time.  The chicken marsala is the best I have had!  So flavorful!  The meal also comes with roasted vegetables that are always really good.  I cna't wait to go back and try other dishes.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in town!
