Wow! The pizza was amazing and hand made. Probably one of the few times I actually saw the dough being made and prepared fresh. The cheese was melts and Perfect.

Service was top notch too, the man behind the counter was friendly and I could tell he really enjoyed making pizzas. He was more excited about it than I was. Great place.
