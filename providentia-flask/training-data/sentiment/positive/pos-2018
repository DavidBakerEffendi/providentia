Hands down best Mexican restaraunt of all time. Not fancy, not healthy, but so so good. Their tortillas are big and homemade and full of flavor. Their green chili sauce is chunky liquid heaven and their new carne asada burritos are seasoned perfectly. I eat here at least weekly and have trouble eating Mexican food elsewhere.
