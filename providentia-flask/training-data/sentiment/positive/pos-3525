After visiting yet again, this place deserves a more in depth review. All that comes to mind when I eat at Buldogis is "DAYUM DAYUM DAYYYYYYYYUM!!!" Youtube Five Guys Burger Review if you don't get the reference. 

To give you an idea of how AWESOME this place is: I, a cheap Asian male, tipped this place roughly 23% for the experience I had. My last visit, I came with my girlfriend's family for lunch. We ordered Angry Dogs and the Bulgogi Dog (not sure if that's what it's called, but that's basically what it is) with Euro Fries and Angry Fries to share. Mere words can not describe the delicious taste of the dogs and Angry Fries. The Euro Fries came pretty salty, but that's just something I'll avoid next time. 

The magic here though, is the service. Every time I come in, I'm always served by the Head Chef. To anyone who doesn't actually know where the management lies, would easily be deceived into believing that Head Chef Cesar is the owner because of the amount of care he puts into the customers. During my visit, the chef messed up my order and served us an order of sweet potato fries that we did not order. We kindly told him that we did not order a side of sweet potato Angry fries, but he gave it to us anyways! Our party and another table were always checked on during our meal.

I just can not express my love for Buldogis.
