You know this place is going to be different and foodie-worthy when the first thing on the lunch menu is 'Seared Watermelon'!

I cannot wait to eat this food again. We had this food delivered to us, so I can't say that I've actually been to the restaurant, but I've definitely had their food. I got the beet salad. You are probably thinking, 'beet salad? That's what you ordered!?'. Yes, beet salad with two different types of beets, truffle mousse, candied pecans, greens and balsamic reduction. SO many of my favorite things in one dish? My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It was like eating a vegetable cake for dessert (see picture). Can't wait to get back here to try another expertly created dish.
