This place is in line with all the other Bianco joints: legit.

Besides having arguably the best pizza in a 600 mile radius, the best fresh mozzarella in the valley, ultra fresh ingredients, and hop knot on tap, you can essentially walk into this place and get seated immediately any night.  I have never waited.

The service is always good at this location in my experience.

One thing about the pizza here.  It's an exercise in control and attention to detail.  The crust is always prefect, with some nice blistering and char. The mozzarella is lush and fresh.  The tomato sauce is simple and perfect.  By dialing in all the finest details, this place pumps out world class pies... I literally feeling like hugging the dude running oven duty every time I take my first bite.

This is my go to Bianco location.
