Best Chicken n' Waffles I've ever had!  I get it with eggs sunny side up.  I let the yoke run wild to complement the protein waffle, fried chicken, ketchup, syrup, hot sauce and the dish turns into one conglomerate of deliciousness.  Probably not the healthiest thing in the world, but the mixture is incredible!  I don't know anything about the drinks because I get water so I don't get a heart-attack from this sugar and good cholesterol overload.

I don't eat anything after this for another 6 or 7 hours.
