Great little ramen joint!!! Modern decor, friendly service from the host and the chefs across the bar! Though there are many brilliant ramen places in town.  This one so far reminds me most like the last time I visited Japan! Will definitely come back and try their recommendation of the "chicken Tonkatsu"!
