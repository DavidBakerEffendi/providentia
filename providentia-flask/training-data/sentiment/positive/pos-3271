I LOVE THE WAFFLE HOUSE! 

Anyplace I can pick what I want to eat off of a "picture menu"... you got me hooked! :)

I love the loaded hash browns, and waffles. Nothing more, nothing else. They usually can't screw that up... so its generally consistent.... and cheap! A plus is the really good coffee. 

So... get yur briches on, put yur teeth in... and come on down to da Waffle Houze!
