I've been wanting to try Levetto for a really long time now.  I noticed the stellar reviews (consistent with all of their locations) so I was really curious.

It was fantastic!  

My husband and I fully enjoyed the rigatoni with slow-braised beef ragu.  All the pasta is fresh, made on the premises.  We also shared the mushroom pizza which was really flavourful.  To finish, we tried the tiramisu.  Light and not too sweet.  Perfect.  

For a casual meal or for take-out, this is an excellent option.  I'm already thinking about my next visit!  

Check out the artwork on the wall, it is one of a kind!  

P.S.  Henry, Ashley, and Zion (sp?): Thanks for our great meal!!!  See you again, sooner than later!!!
