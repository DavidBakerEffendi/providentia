Located conveniently off of the 215 and Flamingo Rd, this Jersey Mike's has the nicest, friendliest staff ever! I come in for lunch a couple times a month since my office is located close by. I usually see the same young men working behind the counter. They've always been so nice and professional. The sandwiches are always great but having a friendly staff makes the experience better.
