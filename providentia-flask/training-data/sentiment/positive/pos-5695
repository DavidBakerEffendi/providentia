Wow! I think I found my new favourite local shwarma place! 

Ever since Ghazele on Wellesley closed, I've been in search of good shwarma in and around the Village. Dropped into Lebanon Express this evening and picked up 2 Chicken Shwarma Wraps. They were absolutely delicious! We were amazed at how fresh everything tasted, and the wrap itself was huge! Great value for $8. 

I noticed there was also a variety of salads available, and they looked amazing and fresh as well. I can't wait to go back to try some of the salads and dinner plates!
