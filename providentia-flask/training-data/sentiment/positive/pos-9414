You enter and pay to the right. The cashier will give you a ticket to give the hostess. She will seat in one of five seating areas. The silverware is on the food bars. There are 10 food bars. There is also a hibachi and sushi area where food is cooked to order. Everything I tried was fresh and tasty.  It is self serve so there was the guy with a plate full of shrimp and kids playing in the ice cream. This is their first week open so soon they will have super service. Only complaints I have is I was not able to try everything before getting full. I. Will have to come back next week.
