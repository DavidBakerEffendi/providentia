Without a doubt this has to be one of my favorite places to get pizza in the city of Pittsburgh. My girlfriend introduced this spot to me a few months back and it has been difficult to spend money on pizza any where else. It started when we ordered one of their specialty pizzas, the veggie breakfast pizza! Toppings included spinach, green peppers, tomato, onion, mozt cheese and scrambled eggs. Hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten. 

The quality of ingredients is the biggest stand out. Starting with the crust which is hand tossed, just has the perfect taste. Soft on the inside, a little crunch on the outside. Then you make your way to the awesome cheese and hefty toppings. I've been to a few great pizza places in my life and Ephesus is atop of the pack.

Bottom is this, if you are in the Pittsburgh area and you don't want to waste money on basic pizza, go to Ephesus. You will not be disappointed in the quality or the taste. Always fresh, and the selections seem endless. My girlfriend does not eat red meat, so at most pizza shops we usually are limited in the protein toppings. At Ephesus we are able to choose from their large chicken specialty pizza options and a ton of veggie toppings too! Seriously a win-win for everybody! Ephesus is the way to go!
