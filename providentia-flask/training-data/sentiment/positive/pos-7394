Tired of the 3 million Vegas sushi bars? Looking for something unique for dinner? Don't want to pay hundreds for dinner at the latest and greatest "Strip" restaurant? Well 808Tapas is here for you! This is what a restaurant looks and tastes like when the owners actually care. The menu is deep. The concept is Spanish Tapas meets Eastern sushi. The menu has about 70 items on it all ranging from about $3-$10.

We went last night and had a great sampling of what's to come. Hamachi shooters, crab stack salad and spicy tuna cracker....all awesome! The sushi we tried was very fresh and great portions. 

Brian and the gang there have really went over the top. Located right next to Regal Village Square theater. Stop in for dinner and thank me later!
