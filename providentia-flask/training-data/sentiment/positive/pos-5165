Celebrated my daughter's 16th Birthday with 8 of her closest friends for teppanyaki! Joey was AWESOME! He helped me get a plan together so I wasn't spending hundreds of dollars! He told me about a Groupon that helped out too! 

I am a single mom that wanted to do something special for my daughter on a big birthday! Thank you to Joey and the staff that made my daughters birthday special and helped me stay with in budget! The food was delicious and our teppan chef had a great personality and was really great with all the teenage girls! Definitely recommend!
