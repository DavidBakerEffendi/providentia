Holy cow!

The server recommended her favorites and we ordered both and they offered to split them for us to try both.  Bothe were out of the park!  My wife even liked the cole slaw, and she hates cole slaw.

Come hungry, nothing is bad!

Oh, and she brought me a to go cup of their delicious iced tea.  Killer service
