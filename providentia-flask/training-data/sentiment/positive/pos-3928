YUM!

There's not much which hasn't already been said.  I had brunch/breakfast with my fiance, a friend, and an out of towner with his friend.  We had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cafe and it was delicious!  Three of us had mimosas (Thanks Kristin for the tip on those - they were delicious and too cute with the individual bottles) and the serve yourself beverage bar was convenient.  I had french toast with a side of potatoes and my fiance had the monte cristo with a side of bacon.  I would recommend both entrees.  We both ate all of our food (which was a lot) and didn't feel overly full, which was nice.  The potatoes were delicious and the bacon was so-so.  You would think for $2.50 you would get 3-4 thick, juicy slices of bacon.  Instead, you get 2 kinda puny, nothing-to-write-home-about strips.

The atmosphere is fun and earthy.  Too bad it was overcast and a little chilly.  Otherwise, it would have been perfect.  It's a nice setting in the midst of "the farm" complete with veggies growing and chickens in the coop (beware of the smell folks if you wander in that direction).  There are also other vendors selling art, jewelery, and other pieces.  My favorite was watching the man selling bread.  He seemed like the nicest man and was so happy to pair a person with the perfect loaf.  My fiance didn't get that from watching him, but I could tell.  We went over to buy some bread and he was in fact one of the most genuinely jolly people I've met - and I don't use the word "jolly" very often, but it fits him perfectly.  He had us smell the asiago loaf, introduced us to the jalapeno Cheddar, and finally sold us on the rosemary with sea salt.  It was $7, which I would normally think is ridiculous, but for as often as I'll probably make it out here, I bet I'll buy a loaf from him every time if he's around.  The happy bread guy is worth the last star for me.
