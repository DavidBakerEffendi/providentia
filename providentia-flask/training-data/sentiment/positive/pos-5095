The food was delicious. Our server was so sweet. We came in for a later dinner and was seated right away. Every person that worked there checked on us, glasses always full! We had to leave right after our appetizer arrived, due to sleepy children, but getting our entree's packaged to go was not an issue. Hands down, one of the best local businesses we've been to in a long time.
