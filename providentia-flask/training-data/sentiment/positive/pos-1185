I went to Madison to audition for the Ballet Company there, and was a little let down (given that the company is across town, on the old-deserted side).  When we came to the more hoppin' side, we came here to eat.

I thought the service was astounding: friendly and cute waitress, and was very welcoming.  The burger + fries were so delicious, I couldn't believe it.  I mean, if I had the money I would come here from Chicago.  I suggest this for everyone that passes by or lives in Madison.  You will not be disappointed one bit.  Plus, it's super cute inside!
