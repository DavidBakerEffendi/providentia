This was my first time at bowlology and I really enjoyed it! The employees were very nice. I got a smoothie and it was extremely thick. I ended up having to give it to my husband as it tasted like the smoothies we make at home, which is a good thing because we make them from scratch, but I was looking for more of a sweetened taste. This place is great though. Next time I'll order a acai bowl! Definitely recommend this place!
