I can't believe I haven't written about the greatness of this place yet!

I love sushi, I remember a time when I thought raw fish was the worst thing on earth but now I embrace it and can't get enough.  I have been here for a normal meal and the sushi is always fresh and very reasonable.  But you MUST go for the lunch buffet!

Here's the deal:  Everyday at lunch from 11am to 2pm I think there is an ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi buffet.  They are making it fresh all the time and keep bringing out plates and plates of it for you to devour.  Also included is a small buffet of hot asian foods like egg rolls, lo mein, fried rice, calamari and some other items.  There's also dessert.  All this for....$10!  

I know what you're thinking, the sushi has to be bad, the fish is old, I'm gonna get sick!  But no, it's fresh, and delicious and many times on Saturday afternoon after a rough Friday night I've found myself there with my husband eating WAY too much and heading home for a nap.

Try it out, I doubt you will be disappointed!
