WHY THEY DESERVE MORE THAN 5 STARS
I LOVE this place! It caters to no one, everyone is welcome at the Happy Dog and everyone loves it, because everyone loves a hotdog - even vegans love this joint because their vegan sausage dog is ah-maze-balls. They have plenty of topping options. You will never want to eat a plain dog with just ketchup ever again! Their food is cheap and good!

Descent Service, they do their best to be speedy but, this place can get crowded!
Friendly Staff, always willing to tell you their fave toppings.
Awesome Beer Selection!
Extremely Affordable!
Welcoming, Non-Pretensious, Divey, Hipstery, Welcoming, Music-Driven Atmosphere - Fun for everyone!
One of the BEST places in CLE to check out local music.

Here's a tip if you have sensitive ears bring ear plugs because this place gets loud! :)
