The pickled Peach reminds me of farm to table restaurant but without all the crazy pomp and circumstance of going to a sit down farm to table restaurant. The food is excellent always fresh and really well thought out as far as flavor profiles. I really like how you can see where all the ingredients are from. My wifes go to is the salad with Burrata and I am all about trying something different every time we go there. They have the best chocolate chunk cookies too. They have a good but small selection of beers so you can make it a nice dinner spot and sit out side in the back and just enjoy a nice quiet and well made dinner or lunch.
