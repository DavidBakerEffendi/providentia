This is one of my top favorite restaurants. Maybe it's the margaritas... Or perhaps it's the chips and salsa... Or the chipotle chicken fajitas... 
I always get the Pineapple margarita. Be careful, they aren't stingy in terms of alcohol! They are made with high quality ingredients, so you can expect to pay $10 to $12 for one of these babies. I can't drink more than 2 or I would be on the floor upon walking out. 
Service is always excellent. The bar is sometimes a bit held up, BUT remember what I said about those top shelf margs... 
I don't like the smokey salsa. They offer two, and I generally dislike smokey flavors so it's nothing against Cantina Laredo specifically. The other salsa is another story. My dad and I munch on it and usually get seconds. 
I always order the chipotle fajitas. They are absolutely delicious and served with warm tortillas, rice and beans. 
Overall, the ambiance is intimate, the food and drink is unrivaled, and the service is exceptional. 

Also, the desserts always smell really really good. My margaritas are considered my desserts, however, so I have not had the chance to try any sweets. I think you should though, yelper. Listen to your nose. Or just follow my lead and order another margarita.
