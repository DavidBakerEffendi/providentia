I've only been here weekdays so that might explain my slightly better experiences as though it was busy,  I've never had to wait for a table. 

This is probably my go-to brunch place and not just because it's close to home. Their menu is pretty extensive and actually interesting. Pancakes with lavender and salted chocolate chips? Never heard of that flavour combination but surprisingly incredible. Brioche french toast with captain crunch? Amazingly rich and unforgettable. They also have like 5 different types of Benedict, which I've found good but not incredible. Even the coffee here is delicious though. 

For what it is,  the prices are incredibly reasonable too. They could easily raise their prices and still be just as busy but don't. I ain't complaining.
