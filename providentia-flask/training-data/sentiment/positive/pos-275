Perfect NYC-style pizza, friendly man on phone for delivery, which was very fast!
The pizza bianca was fantastic, as was the standard one to which we added pepperoni and sausage. Having read on Yelp that Biaggio makes his own sausage, we just had to add that delicious, sumptuous topping. Biaggio's crust is just right: crispy and amber-brown on the bottom, but not hard--it is pliant enough for anyone, even the dentally-challenged, to eat. We requested "no garlic" on both pizzas, and our wish was graciously fulfilled. Biaggio's Pizzeria at Fort Apache is a reliable, classic place for pizza.
