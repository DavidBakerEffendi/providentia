Our entire family loves this place and have been going there for almost 5 years now - it's your typical selection of mexican food and it's really good!  The staff is always fun & friendly and the margaritas are AWESOME! Yes it's older & the bathrooms could use a make-over, but good food, great drinks, & fun people make it worthwhile stop!
