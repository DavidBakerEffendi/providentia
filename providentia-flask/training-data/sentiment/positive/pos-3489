Chada Thai highly impressive! Being a Thai girl myself, I was very pleased with the food and ambiance. The service was stellar as well. the decor in very chic, and not what you would expect door being in a strip mall in Chinatown. It's open until 3am, and since I am in the industry it was nice to have this option of going to a place and not feeling like we needed t rush to get there. My coworkers and I really enjoyed trying all the tapa style Thai dishes. Some were small plates, while others were normal portions and more than enough to share. I was excited trying different items that aren't usually seen on more traditional Thai menus. I would say some of the dishes were Thai Avante-Garde even! A must to try are the quail eggs! Yummy!
The oysters on the half shell( us girls even ordered a second order they were so food!), the soft shell crab with tamarind sauce was refreshing.
Don't forget to try the crispy pork belly and papaya salad with fresh grilled shrimp.
The only dish we didnt like was some pork patty thing.

They also have a very impressive wine selection. There are many more dishes we wanted to try to we will be going back for sure! Service was great as well!!
