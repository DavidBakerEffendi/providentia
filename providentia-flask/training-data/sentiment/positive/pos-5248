If you like Olive Garden, you'll like this place. 

The Italian cuisine is delicious. The bread is very fresh and the garlic butter dip is very tasty. The wedding soup is quite good and filling. The portion sizes are very large but I liked that the menu had a section specifying "for smaller meals" in case you're not that hungry. The appetizers were great. We got the platter to try a little bit of everything from the appetizer list. The atmosphere is very cute. A little fountain, some Christmas lights, a dim lit environment. It's a relaxing feeling.
