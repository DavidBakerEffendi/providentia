I have to say that I have only eaten here once, but the food was great. I love spicy food. It was definitely not too hot for me. The service was excellent and very prompt. We did get there about five o'clock and were among the first customers of the evening. By the time we were done the place was starting to fill up and I would expect to wait a bit longer if we had come in at that time.  They do serve whole beans which were very tasty.    The salsas are on the hot side, but that is what I would expect, too many Mexican restaurants serve bland tomato concoctions especially in recent years.
