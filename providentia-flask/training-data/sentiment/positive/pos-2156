Last time I came here I had a very unpleasant experience. I come here quite often as I live in the neighborhood down the street, I was not happy BUT my husband thought to come here once more to try again and Ruben was absolutely exceptional. He was professional and made the visit worth giving this place another shot. I'll be returning and hopeful to see him again. My husband and I are both very happy with the service from tonight. Thank you Ruben for helping meet our needs tonight.
