This is our usual go to spot after hiking Red Rock and I have also walked with my dogs to eat on the patio.  Until this past Sunday I had only had the basics, wraps, burgers, etc.  Basic bar food and drinks.  Nothing amazing but good and the staff is always friendly.   I am always a fan of a place that provides water to my fur babies.  
Now, this past Sunday is what made it 4 stars for me.  Their half off steak special!  I mean you can't beat bone in rib eye and a large salad for about $15.   Make sure and sign up for their text coupons as they seem to send them about once a week.
