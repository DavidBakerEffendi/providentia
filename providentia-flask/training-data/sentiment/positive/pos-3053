Taste of Thai is a great unassuming spot with tasty dishes that made me glad to stop while in the neighborhood. 

The interior is full of natural light from the big front windows, and the neutral tones makes the whole place feel simple and refreshing. Friendly service rounded out my positive first impression. 

Taste of Thai's menu is easy to navigate but hard to choose from. There are noodles and curries and marinated meats--oh my! At our table we picked the "garlic love" with beef and the "spicy cashew" with chicken, both flavorful options that left us full for the rest of the day. My one regret was not ordering a higher spice level!

For anyone in south Tempe or Chandler, give this place a try.
