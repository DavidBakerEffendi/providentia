A wonderful little restaurant! Their menu is small but you'll be happy with the choices. I had the Pupusas with cheese, beans and pork. If you've never had food from Salvador, they are like pancakes that are filled with delicious ingredients!! It comes with a tomato sauce that you can pour on top if you like. Very fresh! Great choice if you are sensitive to gluten! The chef cooks from the heart and only uses fresh ingredients and you can tell in every bite! The staff is kind, knowledgeable and helpful!  The decor is rustic-modern and relaxed. I'll be going back soon! I'm already missing their food!
