The meatball parmesan sub is the BEST!   We had read several reviews and had to try for ourselves and were not disappointed.  Fresh bread, good sauce, oozy cheese and delicious meatball - I can still taste it.  We split a sandwich for lunch, along with an order or wings and didn't eat the balance of the day.

Only change I would make is remove the TVs.   Why do all restaurants feel they have to entertain us with TV when we're dining?  We enjoy the experience of being together and enjoying a meal, but TV noise is quite annoying.
