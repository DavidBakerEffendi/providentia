This casino is very classy.  They have beautiful suites, great shows, and awesome restaurants.  A bit pricey but well worth it.  The Grand Lux Cafe is by far a must EAT when I go to Vegas.  Bouchon is also an excellent restaurant.  If you don't have a chance to eat at the restaurant then at least hit up the bakery!  Tao has delicious food and also the club is fun if that's your thing.  Phantom will be leaving in September 2012 but I'm sure it will be replaced with something just as spectacular.  Jersey Boys is one of my all time favorites!
