Great food! Not only seafood, they have burgers, pasta, along with their fresh catch fish of the day & sushi. Their sushi rolls here are to die for! They have friendly staff who are super informative about everything on the menu. Their lobster stuffed deviled eggs are so delicious, but then again everything seems delicious there. Sushi rolls are nice & big & very decently priced! Will definitely be back
