Thank you Yelp!  Without your reviews we would never have found this place.   

My wife and I were recently in Vegas and visiting the Pinball Hall of Fame.   After a little while of playing we realized we were hungry and needed to eat.   We knew that later in the evening we would be having a big meal, so we thought a sandwich would be good.   We remembered that Capriotti's had received good reviews so we figured, what the heck.   Fellow Yelpers, you didn't let us down.   

It took a few minutes to find this place since it is tucked in the corner of a shopping mall, but it's worth the time to find it.   When we got in, we were greeted by a super friendly staff.   We decided to split a large sandwich.   After placing our order, the staff started to prepare it right away.   In a few minutes we picked up our sandwich and started to eat.   WOW!   It was good.  They don't skimp on the meat or cheese   I believe we had an Italian Sub.   The bread was this awesome soft roll.   Man, it was good.   The sandwich and a couple of drinks was something like $10.   That was a heck of a bargain especially when you consider the taste, quality and quantity of food we received.   

Will we be back?  You bet we will.   It's only 5 minutes from the Pinball Hall of Fame and it's a great place to eat!   Thanks Yelp!
