This location is fantastic!  There is tons if great shopping that can be had prior to your cheesecake fulfilling experience.  Some things I would like to mention about the restaurant:
-The waitstaff are extremely nice and very helpful.  You will never worry about your cup going dry!  They also get the food to you in a hurry so that it doesn't every get cold, if it isn't supposed to be, waiting to arrive at your table.  
-The bathrooms are always clean and fully stocked.  
-The bar is an awesome area where the bartender is super nice and can help you pick the perfect cocktail to complement your choice of cheesecake (or food).
-The food ranges from pasta to salads to seafood to anything you can think of.  There is no shortage of options when it comes to this menu!!  
Lastly, the music they play is always best enjoyed on the outside patio on a nice afternoon with a glass of wine.  The patio is my choice of seating!!  

My only critical review would be that the waiter who brought our cheesecakes to our table reeked of cigarette smoke.  Not such a big fan of the stuff and kind of makes me nauseated.  (Not really a feeling I'm going for after stuffing my face with awesome food)

Love this place!!
