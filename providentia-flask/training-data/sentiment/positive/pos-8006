Love the Sow's Ear! It's my home away from home. The atmosphere there is so inviting & comfortable. 
Great yarn selection, classes are awesome, staff is friendly & helpful, & the coffee is always top notch. I highly recommend their frozen hot chocolate while knitting or crocheting. 
Their rewards program is not limited to yarn purchases, so even if you just go for the coffee, you can benefit.
