Cheap hole-in-the-wall Peruvian and Mexican food that is SOO yummy. Portions are HUGE, so plan on sharing. This is a great drunchies place - food is heavy and greasy and delicious. Of course, you can order lighter items and customize your dish. I got the chicken quesadilla, which was bigger than my face. And it was incredible. My boyfriend got the burrito, which was like 1.5x the size of a Chipotle burrito and probably cheaper. Definitely stop by if you're in the Strip!
