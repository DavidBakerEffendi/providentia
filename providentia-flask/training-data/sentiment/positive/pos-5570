Yoli's Cafe delights and delivers!  Awesome biscuits & gravy, really tasty french toast, and a delightful location.

This tiny little cafe is tucked into a neighborhood setting, attached to old downtown Chandler.  I have had breakfast and lunch at the cafe and am happy with all the food I had.  My first day, I ordered the hearty skillet and was pleasantly surprised by their delicious biscuits and gravy.  I actually ordered the gravy on the side as I am not always a fan of biscuits and gravy, but this stuff was AH-MAZE-ING!  I waddled out of the restaurant a happy camper, especially at the low prices they charged (even before the yelp check-in 10% discount!)

The next time I went I tried the french toast.  I am somewhat of a french toast snob, and yet... they did not disappoint.  It was golden and delicious with a touch of sweet.  The sausage they serve at Yoli's is also fantastic!  I was super delighted and again, left happy and full!

On my third trip, I arrived a bit too late for breakfast, but my girlfriends and I decided to try out their lunch menu.  My friend and I had the monte cristo, and my other friend had a beef sandwich.  We were all happy with our sandwiches, though I could have wished for a side of fries or cole slaw to come with the cristo.  My friend ordered onion rings rather than fries to go with her beef sandwich and this was a superlative move; the onion rings were crisp and tasty.  

The only downsides I've experienced is that if the place is busy you could be waiting for quite a while to get your food; if you prefer to sit outside, you may be in the sun; and the place is very small so it fills up fast.  However, the menu here has certainly delighted me, the staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere is beautiful.  You really couldn't ask for much else!
