The best buffet to go to when you're craving seafood! The buffet was a bit pricey (about $50 a person), but it could easily be paid off with the unlimited lobster tails, shrimp, oysters, raw salmon, etc. Every time family or friends come to visit, I always suggest this buffet. I'm excited to see the new buffet, as it is still under renovation. Hopefully, it will be bigger (and I bet a lot nicer!). Seafood....yum.
