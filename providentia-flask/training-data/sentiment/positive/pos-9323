All you can eat chips and queso.  You can come with a group of four and each chips and cheese for about $1/person.  You can get this and order food and drench it in queso.  I accidentally spilled queso coming from my chips and queso on my burrito bowl.  It was unavoidable but it improved the burrito bowl.

Eating here is a great idea - plenty of food and a simple tex-mex style.  You need to make sure whatever you are getting has queso on it.  This is the must have flavor ingredient in my opinion.  Without it the burrito bowl would have been a flop.  The flautas are a crowd favorite.  Easy to dip and plenty of comfort.

Everyone working here is nice.  Beyond just hello, but super helpful.  I am convinced they are brainwashed in some sort of service industry cult.  I wish everyone at every restaurant was abducted by this cult.  They aren't creepy helpful, they are just the right amount of helpful.  Excellent management in my opinion if the folks are so cheery.

All you can eat chips and queso, all you can eat chips and queso, and all you can eat chips and queso.

They have a bunch of hot sauces if you are a chili head go nuts.  I literally mean go crazy - lose your mind with all the choices.  It is a bit overwhelming but the onset of insanity will calm you.

All you can eat chips and queso for good measure.
