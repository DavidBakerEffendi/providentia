This place is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It has a really authentic new-Mexican ambiance (and yes, I've been to New Mexican restaurants in New Mexico).  There can be a long wait, but it's worth it.

I always get the carne adovada chimichange with red sauce. Oh, so freaking good. It is spicy as heck, but the flavor is just so deep and perfect. The salsa is also hot, so make sure you've got your drink before digging in.

The Central Ave location has the authentic ambiance, but both locations have the same great food.
