In the West valley Wong's is my go to, must have at least every month, Chinese restaurant.  The unsuspecting location just east of 107th Ave on Indian School Rd in the Villa De Paz Plaza is an unlikely but very welcome home to the best Chinese food to ever pass my lips.  I have yet to have a bite of food that I would be unwilling to order again and I've nearly eaten through the menu.  Tables are set with white linen table clothes and neatly folded linen napkins, in my opinion, as a statement of fine dining which is what Wong's is cooking up in this humble family restaurant.  If you have the opportunity, request Mei as your server, she has been a staple for nearly 20yrs and is the cornerstone of the staff.
