We have been coming here at least once a month for the last two years and it is always a consistent 5 stars!! Food consistency, food quality, service, price, everything 5 stars.  David and his staff know how to run a restaurant.  Favorites are the Garlic chicken, Mango Pan seared salmon, filet pho, mango and sticky rice and the donuts!!
