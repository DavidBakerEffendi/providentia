I don't know why it's taken me so long to write my review for Maizie's. I love this place. It was a late Central Phoenix discovery for my husband and I, but now it is one of our regular spots. For once, I actually have nothing bad to say... =)

Some of my personal favorites? I'm in love with their Mango Mojito...fruity, but not too sweet. So delicious! I love their caprese sandwich too. The mozzarella is fresh and the tomatoes are tangy. I love a good caprese and Maizie's is at the top of the list. The portobello sandwich is also a good choice for the vegetarians out there. The hummus that comes with it is so good and I will always go with a side of their classic french fries. Oh and I can't leave out the bruschetta. It's a little different than bruschetta you can find elsewhere around Central Phoenix, but super tasty and worth trying out. 

The atmosphere of Maizie's actually offers some decent variety for a small restaurant. It's dark and cozy inside with cramped, but charming seating and has a spacious patio that's both comfortable and trendy. They have very few parking spots right outside the restaurant, but you can easily park in the gravel lot a block down and walk over. Easy and free. The happy hour is pretty sweet too. 

Maizie's is an awesome spot that appeals to all kinds of people. Check it out...you won't be disappointed.
