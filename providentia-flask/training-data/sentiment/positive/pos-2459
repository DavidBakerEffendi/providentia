Can't wait to go back already.  We had dinner there last Saturday night and knew we had found a new haunt for us the moment we walked into that ambiance, then we found Charred Octopus on the menu and our evening was set into the right direction.

Our sever Monica made the night EXCEPTIONAL, she was professional and yet very personable and FUNNY.  I felt like someone had taken a questionnaire and gave us the server who suited our personalities the best.  She really put the night over the top.

The food here is really good.  We started with The New England Fry and Octopus.  The fry was good, but not exceptional, the octopus was excellent.  That dish alone will definitely bring us back very soon.

Our entrees were the NY Strip with fries, the Brick Chicken Breast over mac n cheese and the nights special, the Lamb Porterhouse.  ALL of it was fabulous.  None of us had any complaints.  We also ordered a side of Mac n Cheese which has kale and Anaheim pepper Incorporated in to it.  This part pains me to say, their Mac n Cheese is even better than my own Lobster Mac.  OMG I can not believe I am saying it.  IT WAS SO FREAKING good that I would have no problem making that and only that my dinner.  I don't care what you order when you go, make sure you add the Mac n Cheese to it.

We finished our meal with The Bread Pudding and Salted Caramel Chunk ice cream.  Very good, big portion, make sure you have someone to share it with.

The staff is on top of it here.  Our meal was served with panache and our water glasses were never empty, for that sake neither were our Martini glasses.
