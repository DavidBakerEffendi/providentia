I can see this little gem becoming a regular habit.  The service and food were both wonderful and I loved the comfy feel they have inside. 

I tried to finish their specialty a Havarti & Roasted Asparagus panini with ham and couldn't do it. It's enough for two. Next time I'll do the 1/2 & 1/2 option. 

The sandwich had a little spice to it; come to find out they roast the asparagus with some red pepper flakes and they roast their own meats!  Add to that the delicious  pesto mayo and the fab bread and I'm sold!!

I must come back for a overly indulgent slice of cheesecake!

Thanks Bertha & staff!
