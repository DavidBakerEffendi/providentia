Been to this Five Guys three times now and have not been disappointed. I've been to a few others around the valley with mostly positive results. 

Today I ordered a single bacon cheeseburger with various toppings and a lettuce burger with limited toppings, plus fries on the side.

The burgers are cooked fresh to order and are about 1/4 pound. The bread for the buns is always fresh, as are the crisp toppings. They offer a good assortment of condiments, such as A1, ketchup, hot sauce and such, along with the usual suspects like lettuce, onions and pickles. 

The fries are always plentiful here, as you get a double order each time. They fill the container and then give you that much more in the bag. You have to get a go-box to take it home or you get grease on your car seat. The seasonings are always on point tho. Plus they offer malt vinegar.
