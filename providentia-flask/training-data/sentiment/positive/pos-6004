This place is AWESOME! Everything was fantastic, from the cute waitress, to the friendly cooks. I ordered the Coconut Chicken with naan, dal, salad, biryani rice and yogurt sauce. My goodness, they really hooked it up. They will make your dish as spicy or mild as you like. The crispy and soft naan is something to experience. Even the condiments were delicious! We will only be in Scottsdale for two more days and we are definitely going back tomorrow. The price is very reasonable for the portion size.
