Dropped in to Parlor as Montecito was hosting an event. Couldn't be happier! The entrance is my favourite and really sets the tone well. 

It's cozy and Canadiana without being too kitschy. Finally a place proud of being Canadian. Torontos been definitely missing a place like this. 

I love their beer and wine selection which is proudly local and some tasty picks. The all local selections makes me so so happy, especially the wine!!!! 

I came for lunch but will have to come back for dinner and for sure for brunch. 

They are specials daily and I can't wait to bring some friends here. Fries were delish and had their daily egg special which hit the spot perfectly. 

I can't wait to go back for more.
