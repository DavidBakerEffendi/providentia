Been here twice now first time we had wonton soup, the soup was light and tasty wontons were very good but were made with chicken I'd say.  Had calamari and that is killer.  Then we started on the basil fried rice tons of flavor and a touch of spiciness.  

The second time we came in they recognized us even for pick up both times that means something to me in a restaurant.  This time we got sweet and sour pork, tomatoes were in this sauce and no deep fried nuggets here either.  The flavors were balanced very well my only complaint is I like a thicker sauce.  Also tried the pineapple fried rice, yeah I'm a fried rice junky.  This was one of the best I've had a little touch of curry a little sweet good stuff
