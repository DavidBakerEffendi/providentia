It was my pre birthday luncheon with my hubby.  I was excited because I never even heard of this place.  It's adjacent to the Clarendon Hotel.  

As we walked in a young gentlemen seated us quickly.  What a bright and spacious setting.  The menu was simple and elegant.  

Of course it was happy hour because I love, love, love happy hour.  We ordered fried avocado, fish tacos and shrimp tacos.  First, the fried avocado were amazing.  Lightly breaded in panko crumbs.... delicious!

 Now let's talk tacos.....WOWWWWW.... ONE OF THE BEST FISHING TACO SO FAR.... trust me I love tacos....the fish was flaky and light.  The shrimp was so tender and sweet. 

We ordered Margarita... not from a machine but freshly made, which made a huge difference. Delicious! 

I would definitely go back again and again!
