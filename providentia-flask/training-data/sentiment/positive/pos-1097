My aunt lives a few blocks away so when I meet up with her for dinner, we often go here. They know her name and reconize me there and we call it our "Moonstruck" restuarant (if you haven't seen this movie, rent it now!!) I love their gnocchi quattro fromagi (please pardon the spelling) and I've had their Spegetti carbonara a few times and loved it as well. Their patio is amazing, fairly lights statues, and despite being near two bars, its so quiet. The staff treats us amazingly and I adore their tiramisu. Definately a great place for a date (a bit pricy) but the atmosphere is quiet and enjoyable.
