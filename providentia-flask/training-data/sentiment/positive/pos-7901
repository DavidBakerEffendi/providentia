First off, I need to say that I wanted to take a star off for service after walking in on a Friday night and having to wait 40 minutes for my order. After eating my long anticipated meal though, I thought better of it, realized that they were insanely busy, and that good food is worth waiting for. And it was indeed worth the wait!
Next time I'll definitely take J's advice and phone my order in, then come and pick it up later. 
Even with the place as busy as it was; and even though I had gotten a little cranky after my wait, the staff remained friendly, accommodating, and kept working up a storm. I'm not sure who was cooking the fish and chips in the back, but they must have been going full tilt, and J and his helper were quickly and efficiently taking orders in person and by phone, packing stuff to go, serving in house customers, and even cooking burgers at the counter for those who ordered them. And in all of it, J still made sure to give every person a nice comment, a thank you for coming, etc. 
Now for the food:  To put it simply; it was AMAZING. Juicy, tender fish, light batter, freshly made thick cut fries, and all piping hot still by the time I got home with it. All for an amazing price. I'm not much of a fish snob, so I just went with the haddock, and for $6 for a nice piece of fish and more fries than I expected, who could complain? They also offered many other specials, including a $9 halibut and chips, a $6 burger combo, etc. 
This was some of the best fish and chips I've had. None of that greasy "it feels like someone painted the roof of my mouth with lard" feeling during or after eating.  I will DEFINITELY be going back, and soon
