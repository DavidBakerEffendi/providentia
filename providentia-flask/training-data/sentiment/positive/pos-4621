It was time for another pizza outing, and for this one I selected this Metro Pizza location.  Once again, it did not disappoint in any way.

A small Dinner Salad with lettuce, tomato slices, cucumbers, onions, Peperoncini, croutons, and zesty scratch-made red Italian Dressing got me off to a fine start paired with great chewy Pizza Dough Bread and butter.  And a "small" but really medium-sized bowl of homemade Minestrone Soup with cauliflower, carrots, zucchini, onions, and pasta rings in a hearty tomato-based broth rounded out the preliminaries before the main event.

When it arrived my large 16-inch Pepperoni, Roasted Mushrooms, Sausage, and Tomatoes Pizza looked fetching and smelled great.  Both saucy and cheesy, it was a great New York-style pizza.  My only slight disappointment is that the circular slices of cooked tomato were rather small in circumference.  I also sampled a slice of Diane's Large Ham Pizza with Extra Cheese which was really tasty, as was an excellent, large and chewy Garlic Knot ordered by friends, after it was dunked deep into a small tub of heart-warming Marinara Sauce. 

This was a memorable meal that was savored for lunch the next day, as well as during the initial dinner.  Service was praiseworthy, and booth seating comfortable.

Five stars all the way!
