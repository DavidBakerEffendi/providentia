I am very surprised this place hasn't gotten more reviews, honestly. I pass by it all the time and just haven't had the chance to try it. What do they specialize in? Soups. Specifically ramen soups. Specifically...Filipino ramen soups. Now you must be thinking, "They make such things?" Yes, yes, they indeed do. It's their take on ramen, really. 

We ordered lapaz batchoy (one of their best sellers), and bulalo mami. The lapaz batchoy came in those small Korean stew bowls you get at any Korean restaurant and I was a little hesitant on portion size. But mother of pearl, that ramen was intensely flavored, rich, and fatty. My goodness, there was 3 different types of protein in there: pork, chicken, and liver. It was topped with chicharron and that broth was so tasty. You get crunch, you get savory... all in one bowl. It was definitely filling, so don't be fooled by the size of that bowl. 

My boyfriend had the bulalo mami, which came in a bigger bowl. Bulalo is bone marrow, so bulalo mami is bone marrow noodle soup. So you best believe they cook that thing for hours. I was able to take a bite of the meat, and it was a fall of the bone, extremely soft and tender texture. The broth was equally the star of the show. Noodles for both dishes were I believe egg, since it's yellow. Similar to those chow mein noodles. 

These noodle soups don't look crazily colorful like pho or Japanese ramen, but I would say they were one of the most flavorful noodle soups I ever had, hands down.

It was affordable, tasty, and a good spot to try some ramen other than typical Filipino fare.
