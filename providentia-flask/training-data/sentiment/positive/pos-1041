I can't stop coming here. From the day that I discovered this place, I'm here pretty much any chance I get for lunch.

It's incredible to drive less than 10 minutes from my client's offices and find myself at a beautiful farm. I love eating at the wooden picnic tables under the trees that adorn the long grass field adjacent to the Farm's kitchen. 

You feel like you've left the world you were in, and gone off to simpler time and place, the kind you see in movies or read about in books. It's an incredible 30 minute vacation from work. Just be careful as the summer months approach, eating outside can take it's toll in 100 degree weather.

But the Farm doesn't get a 5-star rating on ambiance alone - the food here is fantastic. Everything is about as fresh as it can be - the vegetables are crisp and vibrant, the breads are all fresh baked and incredibly delicious, and the meats are always tender and juicy.

I love getting two half sandwiches (at no extra cost), and frequently will choose an old favorite and an interesting new item.

My absolute favorites:

Tuscan Sandwich $10.95
Grilled herb chicken, marinated artichokes, 
shredded Parmesan Reggiano and Asiago, 
balsamic dressing, tomatoes, herb mayo and 
organic field greens on focaccia

Grilled Chicken BLTDA Sandwich $10.95
Marinated chicken breast, crisp Meat Shop 
bacon, organic field greens, local Black Sphinx 
dates, Granny Smith apples and tomatoes with 
basil mayo on potato bread

And if you're eating vegetarian (make sure to add avocado):

Farm Fresh Seasonal Sandwich $10.95
Local seasonal roasted vegetables, shredded 
Parmesan Reggiano and Asiago, hummus and 
organic field greens on nine-grain

Every dessert I've had here is marvelous. The chocolate cake stands out as magical (incredibly rich, yet somehow feels light enough to float on air).

Go. Now.
