We had a great time at Gold Spike for my son's 21st birthday.  We headed over around 11am on Sunday to watch some football.  The place was empty...seriously we were the only peeps there!  Don't get me wrong, it worked out perfectly for us.  We had one on one attention from the bartender (who was super sweet and awesome), we got to watch the football game that we wanted to, and we had the back yard all to ourselves!  

I LOVED the back yard.  Lots of fun games to keep you entertained.  I hadn't played tether ball in years!  I also played beer pong for the first time.  Not sure I like it, but I didn't do so bad - LOL!  All of the games were spaced out well, so you didn't feel like you were right on top of each other and the decor was funky and cool.  The cost for drinks was awesome, especially since we are some heavy hitters lol!  We all had a great time and would definitely come back!  Cheers!
