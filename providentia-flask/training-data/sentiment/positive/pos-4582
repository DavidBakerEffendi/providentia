I wish there was 4.5 stars. I'd give them that. I liked the broth and everything. They also ask if you need refills on noodles (for charge) even in the middle of eating :) or even when you get done. The only thing I would say is that, the portions are a little on the small side. I got the Shio and my boyfriend got the Tonkatsu. I liked mine, but I liked his better. Their soup is mostly chicken based but he tonkatsu is pork base. They also have a homemade chili sauce, which is pretty bomb! Just too spicy for me lol
