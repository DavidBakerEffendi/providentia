Came here tonight and it absolutely surprised me how good this place was. As many of the other people said the soup base was amazing. Definitely some good spices and herbs and it wasn't too salty. I don't normally drink the soup too often when I go to pho places but this was a different experience for me. I cannot get enough of it! The portions of meat is good too. 

The vermicelli was quite standard and I felt the spring rolls didn't stand out to me too much. I'll just stick with the pho next time which is fine by me. 

This place is packed which is a great sign and all of the servers were very polite. One accidentally spilled water on my phone and she apologized and came back to ask if it was really ok. The phone is fine and I'm writing this great review for them. Will be back for more pho!
