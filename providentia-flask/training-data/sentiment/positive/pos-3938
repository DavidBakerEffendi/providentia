I have a hard time coming up with something that I don't like about this place. 

Sienna Mercato is a three concept restaurant with Emporio on the ground floor and has been opened the longest, Mezzo is fine dining and is not yet open, and Il Tetto is the rooftop beer garden. 

Emporio is a great meatball joint. The whole idea is great. Simple menu, low price point, and good drinks. You choose the type of meatball, the type of sauce, and how you want it served. Saucy Balls tends to be my go-to : Four balls covered in sauce. For $4 extra dollars, you can get the balls served over the side of your choice. The tomato risotto is delish. I recently had 2 balls on a panini and YUM! The texture of the crispy bread, cheese, and smashed meatballs was the perfect combo. The parm herb fries came in a MASSIVE portion, covered in parm cheese, and perfectly crispy. Be sure to start the meal off with a strong drink and some pickle chips. It is all so good! The exposed brick and rustic wood works well with the dark lighting and the huge front window that opens up for nice weather days. 

Be sure to use the NoWait app to get your table, because you could be waiting for quite awhile. If you do get stuck waiting, check out Il Tetto, the rooftop beer garden. Go to the back of emporio to use the elevator to take you up to the third floor. The retractable glass ceiling gives the perfect balance for the unpredictable Pittsburgh weather. At night, the lights strung overhead make for a great atmosphere. It would be a great place for a date, but it also gets pretty crowded. 

Get there fast and stuff balls in your face.
