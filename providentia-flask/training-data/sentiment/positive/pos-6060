I can't even count how many times my fianc√©e and I said the word, "Wow" throughout our experience at Renegade by MOD. I wish I could say we were more verbose, but I just can't think of a better word. From the decor, the music, the service, and of course the FOOD, everything was just spectacular. 

To the people writing the negative reviews: I'm positively thrilled you hated the place. Clearly, you're not the target clientele and I fervently hope you'll stay far, far away. As for myself, I plan on becoming a regular patron and spreading the word to everyone I know will appreciate something a little unexpected.

Cheers!
