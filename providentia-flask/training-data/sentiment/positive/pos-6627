This place is great! Stopped in on a rainy Sunday and ordered the Eggs Florentine, it came out perfectly cooked, with just enough hollandaise, and lots of spinach.  This came with wedged roasted potatoes, and really fresh fruits.  The service was fast and really warm and welcoming, and the hot chocolate I had was rich and creamy.  I can't find one thing wrong with this place, so it is an easy recommendation, they also had take away food, and judging from what we ate, it must be good.
