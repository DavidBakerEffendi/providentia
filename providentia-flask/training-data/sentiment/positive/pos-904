Five stars for the ambiance! If you want a nice place to sit down and enjoy a local meal as a tourist, this is well worth your time and money. There is a beautiful open air courtyard with live music and multiple levels of dining. We stopped by here on a weekday afternoon for lunch before leavin . The staff was extremely professional and helpful to us out-of-towners. You really should order a crepe if you are looking to get the most out of this restaurant. Although I saw others order other items, this place is notorious for crepes. I ordered the Filet de Porc and it was really tasty! Plenty of pork, so many fresh ingredients. These crepes are very very large by the way. My bf ordered the Rable de lapin (rabbit) which was also full of many ingredients and super flavorful. The slaw that came with the crepes was amazing too! I ordered a drink as well and it was very well made. Great quality, large quantities and I feel that the prices are fair for what you get. It gets crowded so be sure to go during quiet hours. Otherwise, be prepared to wait in line to be seated.
