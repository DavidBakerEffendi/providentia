***BEST DINNER IVE HAD IN AZ IN A LONG TIME
Seriously, its about damn time...not kidding when I say EVERY course was really good. Truffle pasta...awesome! Scallops....sooo good. Steak??! Better than Mastro's in my opinion. Olive oil cake is a MUST. Great job guys!! You did it again!! (Its the same owners as ZINC, THE MISSION)
