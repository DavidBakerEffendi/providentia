Really interesting to read some of the reviews... Kind of funny how everyone becomes a critic and judges a business (unfairly) based on one visit. 

I've been here a few times, the food is consistently good, the atmosphere is clean and it's definitely nice to have a fast food type of place in this area that doesn't consist of burgers and fries... 

I have to say, I was most impressed this evening. I went in just about 10/15 min before closing. I know it sucks when people show up right when you're ready to go home. I felt bad going in so late but hey, they're still open & I was starving! 

I was totally expecting the eye roll and sighing... Not at all the case. The guy who helped us (didn't get his name) was super friendly and gave me a couple of recommendations as I still haven't tried everything. I was really surprised by his positive attitude (sadly something you don't experience as often as you would expect) 

When you visit a business and your expectations are exceeded, that's more powerful than any advertising can buy. So as someone who's visited a hand full times- I can confidently say this is a well rounded, good place to eat!! Give it a try, the location is awesome too!!! 

Kudos to that employee who had a great attitude despite the fact they were about to close up! 

And so far the BBQ pork bowl with rice, corn and pico is my fav... But still have more combos to try out!! And their chips with cheese sauce -YUM!!!
