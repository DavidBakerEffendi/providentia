I have been here for lunch and dinner.  Dinner was great, we ordered a bunch of stuff and tried some of everything.  I loved the turkey meat pasta dish.  The calamari appetizer was also pretty great.  It is a bit pricey for dinner.  Lunch is a great way to enjoy this restaurant without such a hefty pricetag.  We had the buloxi fried chicken sandwhich and the grilled cheese sandwhich and both were amazing.
