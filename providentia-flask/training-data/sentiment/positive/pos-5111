Fibber Magees is the best place to spend a Sunday afternoon. Kenny is behind the bar today and he is awesome! He seems to remember every customer by name and takes the time to make everyone feel acknowledged. He also makes an amazing bloody Mary. This is my favorite place to grab a drink and relax. BJ and Kenny are the biggest part of that. You can get a drink anywhere, but the personality these two bring is priceless.
