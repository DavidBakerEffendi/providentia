If you love steak like I do, you have to come here! Especially on Sundays when the steaks are 1/2 price. I like the rib eye cut , medium rare, it's juicy and oh so flavorful. I've actually never eaten anything else on the menu. The service is good most of the time and I really like the dark, warm atmosphere.
