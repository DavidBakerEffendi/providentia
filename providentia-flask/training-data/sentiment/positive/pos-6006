Favorite downtown lunch spot.  I'm not sure it will stay that way when it gets too hot to eat on the patio, but the parking is easy (garage in the back), prices for lunch reasonable ($8-11 for salad and sandwich) and the food is awesome.  I had the maximus burger (burger stuffed with risotto) on the house bread with spinach salad.  Risotto inside the burger was a little out there, but I ordered because it was different.  Maybe one of the better burgers I've had.  Definitely coming back.
