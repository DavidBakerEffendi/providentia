One evening a few months ago i felt like taking a longer detour home to maybe explore the neighborhood a lil bit. Just as i passed by this place I was hit with an invisible force of fragrant spices coming out of this corner street establishment. I continued walking and was about a block away and the aroma was still lingering in the air and, I no longer had the ability to keep walking away so I turned back and walked in to the resto. 

Since then I've been here 4 times: the first time was a little bit too spicy and oily for me but that's just personal preference. The last time I went I asked for mild spice and less oil and it was bang on. I still get craving pangs for The vegetarian cauliflower which is my favorite so far.

Do check this place out. It is sort of a dive so don't expect designer decor.
