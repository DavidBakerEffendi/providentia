After eating lunch in an awkwardly quiet restaurant, we were looking for a pub to grab some beers where we could not get looks from angry french dudes for talking somewhat audibly in english *le gasp*.
Stumbled upon this place! Great beer and cocktail menu, lots of affordable food options (we didn't eat though), and awesome vibes in general! The staff were all super pleasant (and hot). We were glad to have discovered this place! 10/10 will return when I'm in mtl next time.
