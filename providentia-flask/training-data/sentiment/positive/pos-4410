Wow!  If you are looking for a complicated plate of food, this is not the spot for you.  If you are looking for simple great tasting Mexican food, this is the spot!  Descriptions on the menu are spot on, don't like something, just ask them not to put it on.  I had super burrito with refried beans(you have 3 options) and it wasn't too big and not too small, just the right size and outstanding flavor!  My wife he surf and turf, it tasted great!  Chipotle sauce in it is something I've been looking for.  If put it up there against most Southern California burrito spots, it's that delicious!  We will be back.
