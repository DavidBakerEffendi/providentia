This place has everything you need: good food, fast service, and it's clean with endless parking ! 

Location is hidden but easy to find. You walk in and order at the counter. The screens display all the options with clear prices. I went for lunch. For two platters it came to $13!! And when you check in, you get some extra stuff.  

The food can take a few minutes to come to your table but well worth the wait. It's fresh !!

I got the chicken platter: you get rice and salad. Pita is extra for 50 cents and I don't mean the rapper!  The owner came to
Our table and asked how everything was. He noticed we checked into yelp. He gave additional sampling of the kofta and some dessert. Koftas were amazing. Rice is flavourful. Pita was light and fluffy and warm.  But you need to ask for extra sauce and they are more then happy to serve it.  This place is brand new and squeaky clean!! 

Bathroom are super clean with automatic everything: toilet, dispenser and all. 

Make sure you go and get your food on !
