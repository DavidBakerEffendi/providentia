I was in love with Canteen Modern Tequila Bar on Mill Ave. When Julian decided to close her down I was sad at first. I heard that he was taking the concept to the next level and Modern Margarita was born. It has all the class and sass of the concept with cleaner lines, a less students and a whole lot more class. The Food is great, I'm in love with the Trio of Sala's, and warm fried chips. The Pipil Tacos were super tasty, with just the right flavor pineapple and chipotle slaw. So Good! If you looking for one of the best Tequila Selections in town, mixed with the some of the best Vibes around. Check out The Modern Margarita.
