In-N-Out is probably one of the best fast food chains out there!  This location has great service and great food!  My "go to burger" is the number 2 combo (cheeseburger) with whole grilled onion (whole onion as opposed to the little squares), mustard fried (pickles always okay I don't discriminate), and chopped chilis (banana peppers)!  Try it and you can thank me later!  Most of my friends order this now too!  Do it!
