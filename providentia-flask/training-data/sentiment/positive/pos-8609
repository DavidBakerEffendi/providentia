You can't expect crazy good service here, and it almost feels like you're in a supermarket because of the owner or manager lady that works there, she is just super loud. 

Food is descent and prices are cheap, I always visit her for their tomato broth ham and egg with vermicelli in soup.  Drinks are well made HK style.

Food is also served quickly to the table.
