Whether you choose breakfast or lunch, you cannot go wrong with this place. The food that I had here is outstanding. Breakfast is absolutely delicious. Your coffee is fantastic and they have many options and varieties depending on what you want. For lunch, despite many awesome options, their matzoh ball soup is amazing. Being someone who lived in New York City for many years, my favorite place from matzoh ball soup is second Avenue deli. It was the best that I ever had at a restaurant. This does not stray far from that soup and that's a huge compliment.
The location is in a very nice area. The prices are more than reasonable. The service is very friendly.
In writing this review, I feel very confident because I have many friends and acquaintances who recommended this restaurant to me and I cannot agree more with them. Outstanding!
