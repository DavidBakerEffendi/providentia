happy hour win
sliders are two bucks apiece
burger trifecta

So the Yelps are pretty polarized on the B-Spot.  I myself, am a fan.  
Terrific burgers and sides. LOVE the onion rings.  LOVE them. Fries are as good as you can get.  They cook them in lard (YES!!!) as well. Done right folks, done right.  The burgers are just the right size IMHO. Not ridiculously big, it's quality, not quantity. A great Happy Hour bar menu too, featuring sliders cooked to temperature, which is pretty uncommon. 

The temps seem to run a bit on the rarer side, so be aware of that.  "Rare" is one step away from a steak tartare. "Well Done" will still have a hint of pink.  No issue with the "Rules" here.  It's not Burger King. But it is also not a fine dining experience, where you order in courses. 

So now I'm craving a B-Spot cheeseburger. I'd even go to a casino to eat one.  That says a lot.

Carry on...
