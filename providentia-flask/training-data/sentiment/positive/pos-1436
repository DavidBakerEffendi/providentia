Literally just had the best Gorgonzola butter lettuce salad of my life. No joke! 
Is it weird that I am eating a salad at 2am on a weekend night in Vega$?!
Don't fret...I ordered a piping hot pizza too, which is apparently what they are famous for. A chef creates a personalized pizza as you watch. You can chose from many fresh premium ingredients that are lined up so you can see them behind the counter. And then...the magic happens. The pizza cooks to perfection in 60 seconds in their 800 degree oven, hence the name ;-)
Bonus points for them being open late night too. Located right outside the new megaclub 'LIFE'
