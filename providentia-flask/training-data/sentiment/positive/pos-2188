Sooo so good!  I've eaten Indian food all over and this is by far the best around.  Better than any white tablecloth places in the area by far.  It's like I've had blinders taken off of my taste buds.  Incredible food, right from actual tandoor ovens.

Check my reviews and you'll see I reserve 5 stars for truly exceptional places like Choolah.  

They do everything right.  Super fast and friendly service in a clean and unique dining room.  The food comes in less than 5 minutes, so it's actually fast food, but made to order and fresh at the same price as a burrito.

The meats are seared to perfection, with great seasonings.  The mint chutney is so fresh and vibrant, it goes great with their fresh samosas.  You can't go wrong, just pick anything and it will be fresh and delicious.

Try out their cool hand washer too.  Like everything else they do, it's fast, efficient, modern, clean and will leave you wondering why everyplace isn't as simple and effective as Choolah.
