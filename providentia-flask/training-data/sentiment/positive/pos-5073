The food was great, my boyfriend had the pizza and I had the steak... believe it or not, it was the best I have had in a long time! Not something I would expect for somewhere known for its pizza. Even though everything we had was delicious, the five stars are for the great customer service we received from the moment we walked in until the time that we left.
