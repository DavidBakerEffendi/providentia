Yao's is excellent.  I go there 2-3 times a month and have been for almost two years... and I live 30 miles away.  It is a pleasant atmosphere, not too loud or too crammed, and the owner is usually there talking to customers.  She or the waitress (if she's not there) always make time to chat with me.  Food is pretty good and there's a lot of it, especially on the combo meal.  Crab puffs are great, plus good soups and great shrimp dishes.
