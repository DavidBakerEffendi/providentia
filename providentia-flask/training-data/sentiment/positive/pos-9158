Perhaps my favorite watering hole in Charlotte! The food is a always solid, and a cut above your average bar food (lots of vegetarian options, too, if you swing that way They have a good selection of beers, once almost exclusively British beers, but they've started to get a lot of good local craft brews, too. The beer is always cold and perfectly poured, and a pretty good value, too (most beers are 20 oz. pints for $5, unlike the 14 oz. "pints" you get in a lot of other places). The staff are also top-notch. Jefferson, Mattie and Bradley will always make sure you never have to wait too long to get another beer! They have an Internet jukebox with a good selection of tunes (surprisingly, many Internet jukeboxes have a crappy selection). But my favorite aspect: it's a PUB. It looks like a pub inside, with seemingly ancient posters for London Underground and McEwan's inside. I love it!
