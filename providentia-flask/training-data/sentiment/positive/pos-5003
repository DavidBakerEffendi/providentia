My easy go to lunch spot! Tastes great and seems healthy... However, I always eat way too much. Service is wonderful bc Junco (sorry if I spelled it wrong) is very sweet and always checking on you. Even when it's slammed she is very attentive. 

The prices are on target with what you get. The sauces are yummy. I've been to others and this is the best in Vegas!  

I was tempted not to review bc it's so small and I would hate to see it get too busy, but they really deserve it!
