This place is fantastic. We threw a birthday party there last night. Mark Drinkwater (owner) and his staff made sure everyone was taken care of. Everyone had a fantastic time. I can't say enough about how delicious the appetizers were that the staff passed around for us. If you are looking for a great venue to throw a party for someone, you won't be sorry in choosing this place.
