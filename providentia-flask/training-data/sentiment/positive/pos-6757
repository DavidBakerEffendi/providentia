Ok, so I returned, a bit worried that maybe I got lucky the first time, and/or that my first ever visit caused me to be a little more enthusiastic than the place really deserved at 4 stars.

But NOPE! This time was even BETTER!

The first time I visited the chicken pakoras were very good, but didn't quite Blow Me Away, when compared to my favorite chicken pakoras, the huge portion of big fiery ones from Federick's, so this time I went for the shrimp pakora instead and Holy Crustacean, Batman, those suckers are delicious!

Great big bouncy shrimp inside, crispy on the outside, super silky and tender inside, and a killer cilantro nuoc cham type of dipping sauce, and these pakora just put them over the top.

Plus hard as it was to believe, I enjoyed the Bombay chicken even MORE this time than I did last time, with its super tender juicy hunks of chicken with a delicious and flavorful, bright red tandoori/tikka type of marinade, but dry style, sauceless and absolutely freaking delicious!

I'm hoping to try some other menu items, but I quite honestly can't imagine going there and not having the Bombay Chicken and the shrimp pakora, obviously I'm going to have to bring some friends so I get to try some other dishes, LOL

I don't give up 5 Stars very often, but Wong's Bombay Chicken and shrimp pakora don't leave a lot of room for improvement - really good food, and the woman working the bar / takeout counter was super friendly, quick, and very nice.

5 Stars! Keep up the good work!
