This spot tastes just as good as the LA grand central market location without the long wait!! There was a line, but it only lasted 5 minutes. Everything was just as I remembered from my first time trying eggslut in LA. Buttery warm buns, egg cooked to perfection and not too runny, and the bacon was so crispy delicious! This time I also got the gaucho. That wagyu tri tip was tender, had a bit of a spice, juicy, and was overall splendid. Though being a local, I'm rarely on the strip but i'll definitely be taking friends out here for breakfast/ brunch
