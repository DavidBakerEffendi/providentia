My friend and I came here for a quick bite after the gym and wasn't disappointed. I got a small chicken shawarma sandwich with all of the toppings and a coke. It wasn't very pricey. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the combination of the sauces was great. Service was also quick so this is a good place to grab and go for lunch time.
