We had our office Christmas party here. It was great. The staff are true professionals and they are so warm, friendly, and put up with all of our rowdy shenanigans. The decor was lovely and festive. 

The food was amazing. I don't think I've had a better steak than the one I had here in a long time. The meat was clearly of a very high quality. It was well-seasoned and evenly cooked to my requested medium rare. The baguettes they had to start the meal were probably some of the best baguettes I've ever had. Ever. I filled up on that bread and I usually avoid the bread basket. It was just too good to resist. 

Great experience. I would definitely come back here personally for a special dinner.
