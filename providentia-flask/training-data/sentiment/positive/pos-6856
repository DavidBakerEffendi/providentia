I like this place a lot.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was great.  I had a side of tater salad too.  The best thing about this place is the ribs.  I am not sure what they do, but to me the ribs are the best I have ever had.  I have traveled all over the USA eating all kinds of foods and BBQ.  I think Hap's ribs are the best.  
I like this place and will come back again and again.
