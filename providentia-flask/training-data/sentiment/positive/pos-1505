Great food! Nice setting and a really cool waitress !! The orange juice was so good, fresh! They also had (free) complimentary lemonade, coffee and tea for any one that would like to help them selves l. An I got huevos rancheros !! I asked for my eggs to be well done and they came on a crunchy tostada with a side of beans and seasoned potatoes with bell peppers! It was very delicious !!
