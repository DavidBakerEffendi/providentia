Second time for breakfast and the food is still
Great.
The prices are good too because you get a bagel with every dish. Plus bagel chips as you wait for your food. Sooooo much food.
Service is very friendly.
Food comes out hot but coffee is not good. 
Lots of cream! Lol 
Don't be in a rush when you come because they are always busy. Enjoy the company and good food. 
Thank you
