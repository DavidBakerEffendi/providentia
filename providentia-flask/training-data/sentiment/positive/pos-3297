This is the best Indian Food I have had in Arizona. 

There were 3 in our party and we had the Tandoori Shrimp, Tandoori Chicken. Butter Chicken, and Marigold Biryani with Lamb. The server recommended Kashmiri Naan which was excellent. We also had regular Naan. All the Naan was fresh out of the Tandoori.

The Butter chicken was REALLY good. 

I ordered the Marigold Biryani with Lamb medium heat but it came what I would call mild.

The Tandoori here is different from other restaurants it is not colored red and not as much sauce but still good, it comes on a bed of onions and bell peppers "Fajita" style.

This place is pricey though.

We will definitely be going back.
