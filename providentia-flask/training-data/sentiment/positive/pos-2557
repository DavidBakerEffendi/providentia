So my friend and I decided we were going to do the First Friday artwalk downtown in Phoenix this past weekend.  Living in north Scottsdale like we do, we don't get a lot of opportunity to get down south so it sounded good.  Apparently, tho.. we are not very arty as  our artwalk consisted of walking in one bank building and the room in it with old pictures of Phoenix on the walls and then we were done and ready for a cocktail..  Hey, go with what you are good at I always say!!! We started at Copper Blues and had a drink there first.. I had heard about the Arrogant Butcher and that was going to be ultimately our final destination.     BTW.. Copper Blues is pretty darn young.  I hear that the bands are good later but at 7 pm.. not so much my style.  So anyway, we were in the City Center but I swear we could not find the Arrogant Butcher. We walked in four bars along the way trying to find it... and the one on the roof was pretty cool.  When we finally got to the Butcher, we sat at the bar and were immediately attended to by a very nice bartender.  My friend had been asking for some kind of   liqueur that she got in Europe when she lived there and not one of the bars that we entered had it but the Butcher did!  Made her night...:) 

We decided to eat light and ordered the pretzels with provolone  fondue and the Kale salad.  OMG.  I could have eaten the entire bowl of pretzels with cheese myself. Screw the diet!!! LOL... super tasty. And I really liked the kale salad too.. I personally am not a fan of their salad at the Quarter but this one was delish... it had marconi almonds and an amazing dressing.. and it was $5??? And that was not a happy hour price? Score!

BTW, the bar can get pretty crowded because of its proximity to the arena ... a game let out and there was some nice eye candy walking around which was enjoyable... so the whole trip was worth it... even with seeing no art.
