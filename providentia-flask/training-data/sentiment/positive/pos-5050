For starters, who would've thought that the words 5-star and FREE would even be in the same sentence? Yeah well this definitely the case for the Fountains of Bellagio! I've lived in Las Vegas for years and can't believe I am just now doing a review on this attraction! Anyways I'm not sure if words can even describe the kind of experience you will have if you choose to stop and watch the show! It's located right in front of the Bellagio Hotel & Casino so if you are walking the strip you will have no choice but to see it! At night would be the most ideal time to stop and see the show because the fountains light up and the fact that they are synchronized with the music makes it all more that special! There is a show every half hour from 3 p.m. - 8 p.m. and every 15 minutes from 8 p.m. - midnight. I just recently had the pleasure of booking a penthouse suite here at the hotel with the fountain views and AMAZING isn't even the word! All I can say is come see this for yourself!
