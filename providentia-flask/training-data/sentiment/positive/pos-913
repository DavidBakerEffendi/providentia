I've been coming here for a long time. I always receive excellent service, happy workers, and they're all so very sweet and genuine. 

Food is BOMB :)

I usually get the croissant egg sandwich thingy (can't think of the name for some reason) and occasionally a coffee cake. 


Pros:
Great coffee (not so common)
The best customer service
Excellent food
Nice place 
Can eat inside or out 

Cons:
Can't think of any. :) the wait usually isn't more than 10 minutes.
