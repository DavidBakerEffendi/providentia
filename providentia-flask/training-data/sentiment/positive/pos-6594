Tried for the first time as I was in the plaza at the dentist. Man oh man this place is a AMAZING

First off... the rice to fish ratio is amazing. 5% rice 95% fish. Wow. Unreal

The service was great. Pricing is a bit more than some other places I have been BUT IT IS WORTH IT. 

Quality is not forgotten in this establishment. Wonton soup was the weakest item of the meal. It was good but not as outstanding as the rest of the meal. 

Sashimi was so fresh. Rolls are massive. Fish cuts are very thick and super fresh. 

Salad is great and not soggy like most other places. Fresh vinaigrette dressing is great and fresh. 

FRESH and GENEROUS.

All three of us really enjoyed the meal. Even the rookie sushi goer we broke into the Cuisine today enjoyed it (haha you know who you are ) 

BTW come hungry. You will not be disappointed

MMMMMMMM
