What a fun idea and place!! Happened to be working at my other job at Biltmore Fashion Square, walking by this darling establishment I saw a sign stating they were giving out FREE Crepes the whole day!!! I had always wanted to try the little spot out- this was the day apparently!!! The staff was super excited to offer free goodies and were charming while preparing the crepes as you will see in the video!! The crepe itself was Amazing!! I had the Nutella crepe that was piping hot with warm chocolate Nutella oozing out of it delicious folds!! A little piece of heaven!! Join the Club- The Crepe Club that is!!! Your Welcome!
