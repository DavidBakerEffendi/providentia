More than a year later and this is till my favorite sushi bar in the valley. Since my last review, they've changed the happy hour menu to a "Customer Appreciation" menu that is available Sunday through Thursday, with smaller portions of the normal sushi (no more lettuce in the rolls).

My only complaint about Sakana is it's popularity. It seems that if I come too late in the day, I'll have to wait for a table and it seems like they often run out of Tamago.
