A must see for anyone coming to Las Vegas!!! Get your Ocean's Eleven Status on and go to the very middle to get the best view. The fountains are choreographed with music and it's a beautiful FREE show that occurs several times a day. Check their website for times (evening is the best!), especially if you're coming on a holiday.
