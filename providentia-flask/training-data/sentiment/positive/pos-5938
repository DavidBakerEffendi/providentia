As far as Vietnamese food is concerned, this is by far the best that we've found in the Phoenix area.  We've tried a few different dishes, all of which were great, but judging by the quality of what we've gotten, it seems to be the kind of place where one could safely order just about anything on the menu and not be disappointed.  

Our favorite items are the veggie spring rolls and the vegetarian Pho with tofu.  The spring rolls are made of tofu, cucumber, bean sprouts, and mint wrapped in rice paper.  The ingredients are so fresh and delicious and there's just the right amount of mint to add the necessary flavor to set these veggie spring rolls apart from so many others.  They're served with a peanut hoisin sauce and we like to add a bit of the red chili sauce to it to give it a bit of spice. The Pho (item P7 on the menu) is so flavorful and in addition to the rice noodles, has baby bok choy and broccoli in it.  It's served with a plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, cilantro, jalepenos, and lime and is some of the best Pho that we've ever had.  

It's certainly telling that the restaurant is busy even when we go for a late lunch at 2pm.  If you're looking for excellent Vietnamese food, this is definitely a place that you shouldn't miss!
