Best tacos in GTA so far, and possibly the best tortillas in Toronto.

Tacos at Ay Caramba, Eh are simple and good.  Simple as in not having too much toppings, or attempting to use garnishments and secret sauces to differentiate their tacos from the competitors'.  Good as in using the freshest ingredients that are properly marinated, not too salty or spicy or bland.  Shredded beef, shredded chicken, shredded pork.  Corn tortillas taste good.  They are pedestals on which the flavours of the meat dance and shine.  The flavours are well balanced.

To abbreviate: think simple - a single soft tortilla wraps around your choice of meat or mushroom, garnished with a few slices of onion and cilantro.  

So delicious.  So courageously naked.  So much pride and faith in the authenticity and quality of the food.  

Just go and enjoy and feel.
