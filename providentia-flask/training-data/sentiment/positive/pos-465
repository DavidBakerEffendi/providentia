THEY GIVE YOU THE BEST SNICKERDOODLE COOKIES WITH EVERY ORDER!!! 

SOLD! 

But seriously, their jade red chicken is awesome. It's the only thing I ever get because I'm just hooked! It's a little crunchy, a little spicy, a little sweet, kinda salty, always tender and has such unique flavor. Whether in a quesadilla (try it seriously, it's great) or just over rice, this stuff never disappoints. 

The snicker doodles they make IN-HOUSE could rival that of a bakery and they come with every entree!! Can't beat it! The price is nice for a reasonable amount of food so you never leave hungry or poor. 

They also carry a great fountain drink that is green tea and peach. Never see it around any where else. It's an awesome compliment to the jade red (just saying').

Love chino! If you want to take someone to a truly unique dining experience that is very causal and affordable, this is the place. If you like tasty food adventures, go to Chino!
