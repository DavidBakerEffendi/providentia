I had never been to other locations of Whiskey Row but this one was convenient to the Livewire concert venue. Staff was welcoming, friendly, efficient. Happy Hour offerings were priced perfectly. In fact the entire menu looked great. I started with a bleu cheese bacon slider ... Omg melt in your mouth. As an entree I chose the Fingers and Strings which was the best wings and onion rings I have had in forever. My friend ordered the ribs. Cooked perfectly with a side of bacon mashed potatoes they were amazing. A few drinks... And off to the concert. Will definitely get back to this place !
