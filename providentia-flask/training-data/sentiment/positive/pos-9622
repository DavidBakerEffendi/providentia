Holy guacamole this place is good!  Why have I not been here before?  Why do I continue to frequent mediocre establishments that are more convenient?  Deciding to try something new and actually use one of my usually worthless Groupons before it expired, we made the long and difficult 6-mile trek to SMG.

I was soon greeted with chips, two full of flavor, but not too hot salsas, and a bowl of that delightful guacamole.  Granted the chips were not my favored thin, crispy, and lightly greasy chip, but they sufficed for scooping salsa and scraping the last bit of guac from the sides of the bowl...restaurants tend to frown when you lick a bowl, which is why places like SMG offer take-out thankfully.

Soon to arrive at my table would be the carne asada taco plate.  Two of the most delicious tacos I have ever had.  It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about those wonderfully seasoned morsels of beef surrounded by the best corn tortillas this side of wherever has the best corn tortillas.  Beans and rice are not just empty fillers here either.  The charro beans are worthy of a meal on their own.  I should also note I was somewhat envious of my husband's carne asada burrito which was toasted.  Living my childhood 30 miles from the Mexican border, I foolishly assumed everyone toasted their burritos (only we called them burros).  I grew up quickly when I realized the harsh reality was that this wasn't true in most parts of the world.  It's a sad reality, indeed.  Luckily, SMG knows how things should be.

We had wonderful service from the owner who reminded us that everything is made fresh.  As if you wouldn't know after one bite.
