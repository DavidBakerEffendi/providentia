Seriously great food! It's changed hands recently and it only got better!!

They only serve white meat chicken in every dish! Never any grizzle / chewy pieces, you can taste the love they put in to make sure their food stands out from the normal Chinese/Asian restaurants. By far my favorite spot in the valley and it's just been bumped up to 6 stars with the change in ownership. 

The staff is awesome, super friendly and will make you feel like you're truly a guest.  

Do yourself a favor and make the trip short or long to this place, you won't be disappointed.
