Do you like crepes? If so look no further...these are sumptuous! We tried the Suzette which is orange segments, cointreau, brown sugar, butter and lemon juice...mmmm.......and the Napoleon which is lemon custard with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries....wow! Accompany that with the Irish Coffee and it is an almost spiritual experience. They make the crepes right in front of you and you are given them to go. You can take them back to your room or you can enjoy them right there. Highly recommend!
