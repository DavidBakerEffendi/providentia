800 degree pizza is true Neapolitan style pizza that was invented in Naples 125 years ago. The pizza is excellent and prices are reasonable. I like being able to pick toppings to create your own personal pie. A big plus is they stay open late and the ambience is nice with outside seating right on the strip. There is no other pizza place that compares to 800 degree pizza!
