My boyfriend and I eat here ALL the time. We've ordered several items off the breakfast menu and probably over half of the sandwiches. Everything is always really tasty. The service is always super fast and they're really friendly. Good place for a quick breakfast (before 11am) and AMAZING place for sandwiches.
