Spent this past weekend in town and hit the normal spots Silverton being one of them. We had dinner planned somewhere else later in the evening and opted to grab some Brunch at Silverton to tide us over. 
Wow! What a Surprise. I must say you have stepped up your game. I wasn't expecting much but boy did you guys make an impression. 
Everything was Fresh, Flavorful, Lots of Choices, The Brisket was Probably the Best I have ever had and those that know me know I very picky when it comes to Brisket. I so made a Pig of myself. Oink Oink! For $20 bucks we had a Killer Lunch and rolled out completely satisfied. Again Silverton you are the off the Strip Gem you've always been. Solid as always. Keep up the Good work and we'll keep coming. I wish you had a mailing list. we'd probably stay there if you sent us packages or deals. We are registered players.  Hint Hint .....
