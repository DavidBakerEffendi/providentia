Awesome!  For a cafe, the quality and portion size is great.  There were 3 of us that came to eat for the first time and we all agreed to come back again, soon!

They use fresh deli meat for their sandwiches.  I had the Roast beef, my fianc√©e had the pastrami, and my friend ordered the corn beef.  All was delicious.  

The service was decent, pretty much what you would expect from a cafe.   

Their bakery is also pretty great.  It's only our first time, so we didn't buy a lot from the bakery.  But we did buy a few desserts (tiramisu, carrot cake, cheesecake cupcake & cannoli).  We will be back for more!
