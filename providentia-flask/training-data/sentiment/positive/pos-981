I had multiple people recommended this place to me and rightfully so! It's kinda in the middle of nowhere in Medina. My fianc√© and I loved it! My fella got a pulled chicken bbq sandwich with the smokie robbins lager. He loved both. I ordered the flip flop chicken with sweet potato tots, so good. The Abbeyville Trippel was a delicious ale choice as well! Our waiter was Nicholas, super nice and efficient. Great service and food. We'll definitely be going back!
