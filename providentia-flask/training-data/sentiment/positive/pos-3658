Wow. Best Mexican food I've had in ages. So surprised to find this up in Bradford! The waiter was friendly and attentive (but not too attentive). As it was our first time here he suggested a sampler platter for two, which contained 2 tacos, 2 burritos, two quesadillas and two other things that most closely resembled a small taco pizza (using a crispy tortilla for the "crust"). My wife had them as mild, and I went for the spicy. We were both thrilled with our choices. I had a bit more hot sauce on the side, as it was so flavorful. 
Afterwards we were so full, but wanted to explore their menu more, so we split an order of churros, and had their specialty coffee (black coffee with cinnamon and sugarcane). Sooooo good. Especially the coffee. 

It's not a question of will we be back, but when!
