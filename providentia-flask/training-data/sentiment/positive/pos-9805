just felt like eating some hawaiian food today and decided to try this based on yelp reviews...it's a hole in the wall but the service was AMAZING! the super nice owner came to our table a few times to make recommendations...went with the meat jun and i freaking LOVE it! it's obvious that the owner loves what he does, very happy guy and proud of his restaurant. food was superb, generous, and not overpriced. i will definitely go back again.
