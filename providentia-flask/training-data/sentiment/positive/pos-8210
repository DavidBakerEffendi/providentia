Gold Spike is such a fun and diverse place to go.

I seriously have such a wonderful time everytime I come here.
There is so much to do at Gold Spike. Its not just a bar but an adult playground!
They have great life sized games such as janga, connect 4, and beer pong.
They have the classics like darts, and ski ball.

At Gold Spike I feel like I can be a kid again and let loose! There is always a great atmosphere and live music on the weekends in the backyard. 

For those who have not yet gone, it is an absolute treasure. I assure you it will be your new favorite destination. See you on the four square course!
