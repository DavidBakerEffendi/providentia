They haven't had their grand opening yet, but once word gets out, this place will be very popular!!
Menu isn't huge, but has a great selection of appetizers and main course meals. 
Start you off with customary colorful chips & salsa - we ordered the guacamole which came out on a bed of lettuce and was enough to satisfy 6 people...Nice helping! :)
I had the Tortilla soup which was to die for and I highly recommend it! 
Main course was the carne asada enchilada. It was comparable to the carne asada you'd find in a California mexi stand. The red sauce was not too spicy and had a great flavor to it. 
For desert I had the strawberry cake - YUM...but didn't compare to the banana burrito...Holy cow that was good! 
Prices were average and the staff were very friendly and on top of things - Glasses were never empty. They have tvs all around playing awesome 80's Motley Crue videos the whole time! When dinner was over the whole family was treated with a complimentary airbrush tattoo.
We will be going again when we are on this side of town.
TIP: Park behind the sports book as it is located right inside the entrance.
