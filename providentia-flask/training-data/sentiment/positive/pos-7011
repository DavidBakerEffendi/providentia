My husband reserved this restaurant for my birthday. We had a lot of people and they did a great job accommodating us. Natalie was amazing ensuring all our guests were happy. Our waitress, whose name I can't remember (it was the awesome drinks) was great too. Keeping a group 22 isn't an easy task. She did a great job. Now on to the food. Amazing. The drinks were great too. Overall such an amazing experience I'd recommend them to anyone wanting to have a celebration with good food. Thanks fin and fino!
