Been going here since I was a kid...like 4 years old, I'm 21 now. Love the place, if you don't care about the way a restaurant looks/atmosphere, then this place is great if you just like Chinese food.  All dishes are served with styrofoam containers and plastic  utensils, simple but gets the job done. My favourite is this vermicelli noodle with salty veggies and pork strips. Super simple but very good. Daily lunch and dinner specials are posted on the wall by the register. Order food, sit down, wait for your number to be called. Busy times are normally morning, noon, and dinner. Mid afternoon is more quiet.
