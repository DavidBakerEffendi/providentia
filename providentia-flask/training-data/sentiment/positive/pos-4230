I pronounce it CHOO-LAAH and I am on board the choolaah train! I had heard amazing reviews and I've been trying this new thing where I explore foreign cuisines and become more cultured so why not try this for starters right? It was SUPER clean inside, like immaculate, I probably could have eaten off the floor. There was a line but it was well orchestrated and went fast, ordering was a breeze and the staff was very informative on allergens and nutritional values. I was actually really impressed by that. I got the bbq chicken with tiki masala and let me tell you...this was my first experience with any type of Indian cuisine and I fell in love at first sniff! And to think this place is considered "faster" food blew mine. The food is prepped in an open area where you can see them actually making it, the naan is fresh made in shop. The ingredients were beyond fresh and the spices and such made for a mouthwatering experience. I really cannot wait to come back! The prices were great and you really do get a bang for your buck!
