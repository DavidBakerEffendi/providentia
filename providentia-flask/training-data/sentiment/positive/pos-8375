Outstandingly tasty and friendly service too. We had the Abugida Feast and the Vegetarian Feast at our table which gives you some of about everything. These two dishes were more than enough to make 4 people really full and satisfied. I hope this new restaurant makes it because it is excellent and provides something different than the usual Charlotte fare.
