The B Spot is one of my favorite spots in Cleveland. I have never had a burger there I didn't like. During today's visit, I had the French Onion burger which was cooked perfectly and had a delicate balance of the gruyere cheese, horseradish, and grilled onions. The Lola fries were, as always, delicious. My dining partner had the Thin Lizzy burger which has pickle, cheddar cheese, and grilled onions. The chocolate milkshake was out of this world!! Definitely worth the calories! Don't forget to check out the pickle bar. The spicy pickles are a must try.
