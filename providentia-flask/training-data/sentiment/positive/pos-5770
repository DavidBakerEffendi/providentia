This place is beyond amazing. 
 
I have had this place on my radar since it opened and after all the great word of mouth I was dying to try it. I came here with a big group of friends and luckily there was one table that was able to accommodate us. The owner, David, was a fantastic guy. He was so personable and welcoming. He was joking around with us and very patient with us even though we were taking quite a bit of time deciding what to order in between conversations.

Our table started with some appetizers and a salad to share. We got the Crying Tiger, which burned so good, the Malaysian Roti and some spring rolls. They were all delicious. I ordered the Massaman Curry with fried tofu. It was absolutely fantastic with all the unexpected combinations of flavors. Some other dishes we tried were the Red Curry, Pad Se Ew, Black Bean Chicken, Pad Thai with Chicken and another Massaman with Beef instead of tofu. Everything was perfectly flavored and the portions were generous for the price. 

Chef Lisa came out to chat with us as well and she was incredibly friendly. We were joking back and forth about the one guy in our party who ordered a spicy level 10 and what that would be rated on the Thai spicy scale. She said a 7, but I think she was trying to be kind as David said it was more like a 5 to them, haha.

It was a fantastic evening with even more fantastic food and to top it all off she delighted us with a complimentary order of tempura banana which were excellent with bits of coconut inside.

I can't wait to go back to try the rest of their menu. I just might become regular very soon!
