Delicious!! A group of 8 went here last night, and we were immediately greeted by two smiling, friendly employees.  Immediately I noticed how clean the restaurant is, and how delicious the food cooking at other tables smelled. Once we ordered the all you can eat, two ladies brought out a huge plate of beef briscut and thinly sliced beef tongue, as well as so many side dishes, salads, and appetizers! Our tables were full! The salad with the ginger and apples dressing is yummy, with a little spicy kick.  The seasoned cucumbers were one of my favorites, along with the miso soup.  The miso paste/sauce is my fav, and the meat tasted great! So tender, and juicy, and the meat plates kept coming! Im thankful I had my Korean friend with us to explain dishes and order, but the waitresses were nice and spoke english.  The best meat was the thin marinated beef!! A must try!!!!!!! I will be back here once a month!
