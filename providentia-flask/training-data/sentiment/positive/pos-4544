I had Rani's bookmarked FOREVER, and I finally made it down here to actually do some grocery shopping. Well, my mom did some grocery shopping. I kinda fail at the learning to cook my ethnic food. But enough of that! I went and met Rani and she's awesome!! She reminds me basically of every single Indian grandma. They stuff you full of food to show their affection. My only qualm is that the food isn't next level spicy. When I want to eat chaat, I wanna feel like my intestinal lining is being seared off. But hey, I know she's catering to both Indian and non-Indian palates, so I'll let it slide. But this is a great place to come when I'm missing some homemade food.
