I thought I left a review the first time we came but I guess I am behind. Well, we came here again tonight and left very satisfied. 

We got a coupon for BOGO meal with purchase of 2 drinks so we stopped in for dinner. Both of us got the 2 meat plate. For my plate, I went with chicken breast and pork. My fianc√© got chicken and gyro. I wish one of us didn't get chicken and got steak so that we could try it but he didn't listen to me when we were ordering. Oh well! We plan on coming back so there's always next time. 

The plates also included some pita bread and we both added a side salad to our plates. We tend to snack a lot through the day so we really could have just split the plate and a normal salad instead of 2 plates and 2 side salads. Oh well, leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I actually got to witness them fry falafels while we were putting in our order. It was interesting how they scoop it. 

Back to the food - The pork was better than I had expected. I would get it again and while chicken is my go-to protein, I think this may be my go-to protein at this establishment. I'm not saying I didn't like the chicken (because it was perfectly seasoned!) but the pork just stood out more. Gyro tastes the same to me anywhere so I'm not sure how to review it. 

I was on a cider kick after our London trip so I grabbed the Ace pineapple cider as my beverage. My S/O did the same. It was interesting - not sure if I'll get it again. 

We really like this place in regards to food, service, cleanliness, and variety. Even better that it is down the street!
