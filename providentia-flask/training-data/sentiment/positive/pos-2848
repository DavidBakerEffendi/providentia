OH M GEE!!! when our family decided to have dinner here I wasn't very sure I wanted to because I've never eaten sushi. Looking at the menu I was somewhat still unsure. Once the waiter came he went over the menu with us and provided suggestions on what to order.  The orders were placed and afterwards we received some complimentary sushi rolls and others entrees. The manager even introduced himself and was very pleasant.  

Once I tried the sushi for the first time ever I was very impressed...it was delicious.  All of the food was great. The staff was great and attentive as well. All of the staff were dressed nice and clean cut. Very intimate environment and I would suggest this restaurant if you've never been here.
