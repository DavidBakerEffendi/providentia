Delicious. New favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto! Thai spicy is THAI spicy--be forewarned. Lovely crowd, friendly servers, and lively atmosphere make the wait for a table bearable. 

Here's what we ordered:

Spring rolls - average joe deep fried goodness (3.5/5)

Pad Thai soft shell crab - definite game changer; the crab adds an extra dimension of flavour that makes every other Pad Thai taste like instant noodles GET THIS (5/5)

Pad Kee Mao Chicken - You need to be a fan of bamboo shoots to like this because it's super prominent in this dish--if you have no idea what bamboo shoots taste like... maybe stay away haha (4/5)

Khao Soi Beef - A beef creamy curry noodle soup with crispy wonton chips! It's also as tasty as it sounds (4/5)

Pork Krapow - their basil stir fried pork is crispy and aromatic and spicy and delicious. This is tied with the pad Thai for my fave dish of the night (5/5)

We waited maybe 40/50 minutes for our food. I know that seems ridiculous but it really amped our appetite and the sangrias kept us happy! So I can vouch that you'll have a fantastic night, just don't expect a quick dinner ;)
