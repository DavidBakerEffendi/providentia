Came in here because the service and wait at salt and lime next door were complete shit. So glad we did it was way better than we expected. Everything was so fresh, way generous portions and service was unstoppable. I couldn't believe the kids meal. I liked it almost more than my own meal. They also have sushi burritos here!!!!! Lots of options for the non fish or Asian food lover. Steak, chicken, pork, bowls, salads, ETc. pay to upgrade to fried rice!!!! You won't regret it
