I have spent several months in Thailand. I love Thai food and eat it often. While I wouldn't say the food here tastes just like it does over there, this has definitely become my favorite new Thai restaurant. I've been here at least 5 or 6 times now and every time has been really good. 

They do a really nice som tam (papaya salad) and their tom yum kai soup is good as well. I also recommend the jungle curry and their spicy basil is top notch! The only thing I've tried that I didn't think much of was their chicken satay. It was just kind of dry and flavorless, but everything else has been great! Good desserts as well and I'm not usually a dessert person. Also, if you order Thai iced tea, they will bring you a little cup of simple syrup so that you can sweeten it to your liking, which I really appreciate since I don't like it too sweet. 

Service has always been great, but unfortunately they're always slow when I've gone in. Please come support this great restaurant!
