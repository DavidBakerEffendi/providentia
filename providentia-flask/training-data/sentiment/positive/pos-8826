Effing awesome! Worth the wait in line if you have friends to eff around with.

Go hungry so you can eat all of the seafood. Many different kinds of fish to choose from.

Been to a couple different buffets in Vegas and this one has been the best so far.

Been here twice for the champagne brunch and they are really good about refilling your glass.
