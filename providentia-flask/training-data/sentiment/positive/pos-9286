A friend told me about Jewel's knowing I'm always looking for a great gluten free spot to eat. This place is going to be a new favorite. Everything is gluten free! They have a great breakfast and lunch menu, and so many baked treats. I had an amazing gluten free & vegan vanilla almond cupcake. Very excited to have found this bakery/cafe!
