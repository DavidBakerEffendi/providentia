I've been meaning to go since it opened, but only now found the time. It's located inside the Restoration Hardware store and immediately upon entering I felt transported to cafes/restaurants in Europe. Like if I was blind-folded going in, I wouldn't have known I came through the mall.

The selection of food enough to cater to most everyone. My friend chose the truffle grilled cheese and the RH scramble (eggs and toast) and I decided on the lobster roll. 

Truffle grilled cheese - simple, but elevated
RH scramble - fluffy
Lobster roll - small portion, but each chunk of lobster was juicy 

Overall the service was good. Food was delicious!
