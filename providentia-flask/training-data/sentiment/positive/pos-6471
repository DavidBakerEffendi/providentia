They are the ONLY reason why we drive from the north end. Their gyros...just...just...stuff your mouth delicious! Never once have we been here where the food has ever not tasted fresh. The vegetables are always so crisp and fresh, the tomatoes are so vibrantly red and juicy, meat is never dry. 

It's situated in the food court of the Galleria mall, and literally is that mall's best thing! Well, next to cinnabon of course. Lol. 

Their baklava is amazing, and I'm allergic to nuts. So if you have a nut allergy, caution. It is worth a shot of benadryl! 

Just be prepared to pay a bit considering you are eating in a mall's food court, but it is definitely well-worthed! My only gripe if I had to create one is they charge a refill fee. Big whoopie. Lol.
