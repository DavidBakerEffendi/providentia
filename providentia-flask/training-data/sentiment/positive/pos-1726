This is hands down the best outlet in the square one food court. They have a hot table with a wide  variety of meat and vegetarian items . There is also a dimsum section.  A must try is their 'make to order'  menu where they cook a signature dish in front of you in the wok. I have tried them all and their Hakka Chowmein is  very good .  A good way to sample  what they have to offer is to go with some friends and purchase the 3 item combos , each one order different items and try what each one has ordered . This way you get a lovely offering of Szechuan cuisine. 
The soups are really good as well with their chicken corn  soup being a hot seller. 
There are also their deals  on close such as a two item combo for the price of a 1 item thats available from 8 40 to 9 pm. Try the same sampling strategy with friends on the discounted deals if you are on a budget. 
Service is always excellent and quick.  Perhaps them keeping two cashiers at all times will help as the line does get slow  if there is a rush with just  1 cashier
