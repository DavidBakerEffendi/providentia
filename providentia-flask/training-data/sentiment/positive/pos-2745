We drive from Scottsdale just to have Juan's food!  If you are looking for 5 star atmosphere, not here, but if you are looking for 5 star food.  You are in the right place!!!  This Phoenix restaurant is family owned - Mom runs the kitchen, daughters run front of house with mom and dad and the brother run back of house (except for the cooking) and the register.  Once they know you, it feels like you are part of the family!
