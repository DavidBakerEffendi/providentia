The only thing I got here was the heavy almond croissant & I'm not a morning person so at times I was quite unlucky at obtaining one. My sister previously lived in this neighbourhood and I probably made excuses to visit her solely for sneaking into Jules for that goddamn croissant. SWEET TAPDANCING CHRIST I could really use one right now. It's just so perfect. Almonds and custard are two of my biggest vices/sh!t I'd probably die without. Even if I witnessed with my own damned eyes-- someone lacing that pastry with cyanide (apparently cyanide smells like almonds), I'd still eat it by the boatload. It might actually be worth dying for.
