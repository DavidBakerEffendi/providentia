This place is a vegan's paradise.  It's located in a hip little spot in Atherton Mill.  Upon walking in, I noticed the place was clean, airy, and very inviting.  I would love to sit and eat here, even by myself, if I wasn't just picking up an order I had placed over the phone.  Note, they also take online orders through Postmates for delivery, or through their website for pickup only.

Not once did I feel guilty eating this food, not matter how indulgent or creamy it might have tasted.  They did end up forgetting to put the cake I ordered in the bag and I didn't notice til I got back to my hotel... but they refunded me after I called and I took it as a sign that I wasn't supposed to be eating sweets anyways, ha!

For a light appetizer, I had the "Vietnamese Pho" which really isn't anything near Vietnamese or authentic at all.  If you ignore that part, this is a nice, light, decently flavorful, spicy clear broth soup with loads of vegetables and a little bit of kelp noodles.  Great kick and good if you're craving some hot soup.

As my entree, I had the Living Burrito.  YUM.  I love that it's wrapped in collard greens which were incredibly fresh and had no sign of dirt or holes or anything.  It's got quite the mushy filling with the "refried beans", cauliflower rice, cashew sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole, but it's some of the best mush inside a collard green wrap I've ever had - not that there's anything to compare it to, haha.  It had plenty of flavor and I loooooved the house hot sauce it came with as well as the little green salad.

Luna's also serves a massive list of juices and smoothies.

I will definitely be eating here again, versus the same old boring salad joints.  It's not the cheapest thing in the world, but at least you feel clean eating it.
