Stoped in for a quick bite. Last time I was at chipotle I learned the hard way that their soft shell tortillas are no longer gluten free. Unfortunately they just ran out of their hard shells right when I got there. One of the employees went out of his way to make sure that even though I couldn't get what I can for I left satisfied. Amazing customer service at this location this Sunday night. So much in fact, I am writing this as we are still sitting here. I'll definitely be back thanks to this great team.
