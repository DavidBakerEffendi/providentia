This afternoon was my first time trying The Coronado and I was so impressed. It's a small place with order at the counter style service- yet cute atmosphere. 

We all got drinks, mine was their take on a Kentucky Mule (Whiskey, Ginger & Lime) which was just ok in my opinion. My fianc√© got the Evergreen (Tequila, Serrano Peppers, Cucumber) and it was amazing- truly a delicious and different drink.

We started off with the street corn which was flavorful, crispy roasted outside and perfectly cooked. Then we shared the Potato Tacos which were excellent and bursting with flavor! Literally one of the best vegetarian dishes I've had in awhile. I want to try the cauliflower tacos next. My friends ordered the Jackfruit Sliders and Potato/Chickpea Burger and loved theirs as well. 

Their prices are a little higher but the quality of the food was well worth it in my opinion. We love Green and Nami and this isn't a replacement for them, it's just another option with different flavors. 

Well done Coronado! 
I can't wait to try it again and hope it's just as good.
