One of the Top 5 restaurants in Charlotte, hands down! Maybe even our favorite but it's just so hard to pick. The pork belly small plate is a must. All of their meats are locally sourced and always perfectly seasoned and cooked. Sides are well thought out and complement the main without fail. I love their wild game specials. Things like venison and boar shine. Great beer and wine selection. Excellent desert. Even their coffee (French press) is to die for!
