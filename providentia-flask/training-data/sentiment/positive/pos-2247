A few years ago, I went to the M&M's factory and thought, "how could someone be so into candy?"  Later that year, I developed a sweet tooth that now leads me to places with names like "Sugar Factory."

As soon as I walked in, I was in heaven.  It looked like something out of a Christmas movie or Willy Wonka.  Plus there was lots of pink, glitter and Hello Kitty- so totally my thing.

The shirts, clothes and non-food items were oh-so-cute. Believe it or not, I'm not a HUGE candy person.  I love sweets, but I'm more of the dessert type. This place had the BIGGEST cupcakes, brownies and meringue I have ever seen.  The problem is, I was kind of overwhelmed the first day.  We said we would come back the next day, but I got too sick.  I had my friend pick up the cutest shot glass for me there. It was a more reasonable $7 as opposed to those ridiculous $25 lollipops.  My friends got a few different types of candy.

I had so much fun just walking around here picking up the 50ish pound teddy bear and looking at all the desserts.

I feel like I shouldn't give this place 5 stars because I didn't get to eat the stuff.  But then, its not their fault I got too sick to walk there right...? :/ As far as selection for a edible museum of candy, sweets and just cute things in general goes, Sugar Factory wins if you are the sweets, pink, fluffy, puppies, Hello Kitty and rainbow kinda girl. :)
