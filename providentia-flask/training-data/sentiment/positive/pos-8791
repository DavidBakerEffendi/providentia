Located inside a gas station, Jefe's has two tiny tables in the back and a counter where you can order some seriously excellent food.  Manny told us it was all cooked San Diego style, which I'll have to take his word on because I haven't been to San Diego to eat yet.

Whatever the explanation is, I'm glad Jefe's is close to home so we can eat here often.  And this is from me, who isn't a big fan of Mexican food. Hubby IS a big fan, and he loves the place also.  In fact, I've never seen him devour refried beans like he did there and going into poetic rhapsody whenever he had to come up for air.

He had a couple of fried tacos and loved them. I had the 3 pork mini tacos and they were so overloaded with meat that I separated the two taco shells and halved the filling into each part so it became six tacos (which was good because Hubby also ate half of my tacos).

We've already been back twice and that's pretty rare for us, we like to always explore and try new stuff. However, sometimes a place is just too good not to return to, and Jefe's is one of those.
