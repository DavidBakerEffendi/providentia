Just had the sashimi sampler and a mango roll. Both were top notch. The quality of the fish was superb. Perfect sized pieces with wonderful flavor and texture. The sashimi plate came with a nice crusted tataki style  albacore, very unique, very tasty. The roll we had was beautiful with more fish than rice (rare these days) and the rice was a very delicious and purple in color. It had a subtle nutty flavor that I have never experienced. I am going back tonight with friends. Its so good and priced right. Love it.
