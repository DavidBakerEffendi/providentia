A solid 4.5 stars so I'm gonna round up to a 5. I ran into this spot for a quick lunch to go. Roger greeted me and took my order. He was super friendly and the food was brought out within five minutes. It was fresh and hot. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai lunch special and it came with five huge shrimp, pad thai, edamame, and a spring roll. It was a perfect lunch and it was a fair price ($11). I would definitely recommend it.
