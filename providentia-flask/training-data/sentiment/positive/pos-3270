Yes and oh YES! The patties here are sooo good. Be aware after 5pm they might not have spicy or vegetarian patties left those are best sellers. I usually opt for the 2 patty special or the patty with cocobun. They take visa,debit so that's perfect. The service is very fast unless you have a too many questions customer in front of you then you are waiting!! Patties here is very delicious the meat filling is good and oily. The pastry is good and soft crispy. Would come back. They do have a competitor called Crumbs near them but Patties Express all the way !!
