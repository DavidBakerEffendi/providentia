I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now noticing it every time I drive by, I just finally worked up the nerve to do it today and all I am asking myself is WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG?! 

Holy Amazing!! I didn't go inside I had a pick-up order and someone else picked it up. 

I got the yellow curry lunch special, bang for my buck. It came with white rice, obviously the curry, chicken and a spring roll. I don't even like spring rolls and decided to give this one a chance, delicious!!!
