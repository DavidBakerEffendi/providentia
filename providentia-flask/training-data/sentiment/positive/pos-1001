Really good food and service!  Even if you're ordering take-out, they still serve you water and today, they also gave us a complimentary bowl of boiled peanuts to eat while we waited for our food. YUM!  These people are definitely in the "know" about customer service and how to treat their customers so that we are "repeat customers."   Kinda rare to find this kind of business-savvy sense nowadays!
