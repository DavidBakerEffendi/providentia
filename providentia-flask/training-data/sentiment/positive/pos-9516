Love the lava cake! Smooth, strong chocolate flavour not overly sweet, it was perfect with a cup of warm coconut latte. Yummy in my tummy. Also, There's no private parkings lots, we parked on the street that night. so it requires parallel parking. Embarrassed to say but I have to get off and ask my friend to park the car for me
