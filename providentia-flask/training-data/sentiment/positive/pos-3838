I love the salt cellar . It is my favorite place for sea food. The happy hour in the bar is fantastic with 3.50 well drinks and they just added the four peaks pumpkin porter to theory beer on tab which is delicious :). The tacos, shrimp toast, mussels, shrimp san remo ( shrimp sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms sauteed in a butter sauce...my favorite), and crab cakes make this place amazing. The service is always attentive and I always feel well taken care of. Dont forget to try the snickers cheesecake for dessert :)
