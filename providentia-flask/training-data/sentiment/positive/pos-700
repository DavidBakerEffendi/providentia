Have you ever been sad that a meal was going to end? Have you ever taken smaller bites when your plate was just about empty so it could last longer? Have you ever wanted to lick your plate clean? Well, this is exactly how I felt while eating at RM Seafood. The crab cake, fish tacos, grilled shrimp risotto, fat Elvis, and tangerine creamsicle were wonderful. 
This restaurant participates in Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program which supports sustainable seafood. This is the main reason why I ate here. It was nice being able to order anything off the menu and not have to worry about how it was caught or farmed. 
This is a MUST for anyone visiting the Las Vegas area. Simply wonderful from beginning to end. 

If I am ever in Las Vegas again I will definitely be eating here.
