I love Italian and this is great Italian.

Everything from the water to the desserts was fantastic.  The water comes with a plate of lemon wedges and mint leaves.  How great is that?  I know its just water, but it really made it taste great.  Surprisingly, it didn't even taste like desert tap water to begin with.  The bread is tasty and comes with a garlicky, spicy olive oil.  Yum!

I had a creamy pasta with regular and spinach noodles, prosciutto, peas, and lots of parmesan.  My sig other had meatballs with marinara and a caesar salad.  Those meatballs were somethin' else.  Crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside.  A great meal.

The best part of all was the desserts.  They brought out a tower on wheels that puts the term dessert cart to sham.  An unbelievable good looking chocolate cake, Italian wedding cake, four flavors of gelato, tiramisu,  spectacular strawberry cheesecake, and a few others.  I went with the pistachio gelato and I'm glad I did.  It was so delicious and a perfect pick for this gelato lover.  They even make it right there in the restaurant.

There is a row of tables on the outside with a view of the fish tank/exhibit.  Make sure to get a reservation if you want one of those tables.   I would have if I had known.  I also saw them hand making the pizzas.  Nice touch.  The service was very good.  Ciao!
