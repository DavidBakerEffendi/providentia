Overheard at Barriques: "Its really amazing. They do a fantastic chai latte." I can't speak to this, but I can say that the coffee is my idea of right and the avocado egg wrap makes me feel some type of way. 

A great place to work with delicious food and a calm atmosphere. Good vibes even for those who aren't here with work to do. Perfect for a weekday glass of wine and catchup with a friend.
