Of all the restaurants I have been to in Las Vegas, I have never been to one that so perfectly captures the essence of the Vegas Strip. The exterior of the building looks rather unassuming aside from the neon "Peppermill" sign at the front, but once you walk through those doors you are officially in Vegas. The amount of neon lights is just unreal! The 50's diner/tropical oasis combo is something I am sad to have gone my 25 year life without experiencing. There are flamingos everywhere, and their tableside sugar is rainbow colored! If all of this doesn't scream Vegas to you, then all of the hungover/still partying people dining alongside you will!
This was our stop for breakfast before leaving Vegas on Sunday morning. Standard breakfast fare, but giant portions! I had the eggs bennie which was delicious! My husband had the biscuits and gravy that even a human vacuum like himself could not finish. My dad had the ham and eggs with a slice of ham bigger than his face.
The wait staff was really wonderful. Very quick and helpful. Overall, I truly enjoyed dining here and cannot wait to go again!
