Endless Shrimp cannot be beat. The real key to this promotion is good service and that is just what we got from.Kelle and she took good care of us, she had our refills timed just right, I never waited for anything once we started.  The only bad thing about endless shrimp is that it is only once an year.  A Big THANK YOU to Red Lobster at Superstition Spring in Mesa, AZ and to Kelle for the best meal, that I have had in a long time.    Good Job.
