My fianc√© took me to Buca Yorkville for my birthday dinner, and I can honestly say it was the best meal of my life! It is now over 3 months later and I still constantly think about this meal. 

We started off with the Nodini (olive oil, garlic and rosemary bread knots), which were as delicious as all the previous reviews had mentioned. Then we shared the Salumi di Mare - here, we chose the lobster and scallop sausage, the dry-cured and smoked albacore tuna, and the hot-smoked herring. These were very interesting choices, which I was immensely satisfied with. After that, we had the whole raw branzino; this is a showstopper and not to be missed! They carve the fish table side, and it is finished with prosecco, olive oil and lemon. It was SO fresh-tasting and practically melted in our mouths. For our mains, we shared the Gnocchi with shaved truffles (which happens to be the best gnocchi you will EVER have!) and the Polipo E Vongole, which was braised octopus, B.C. clams, bone marrow, cavolo nero, crisp artichoke and fregola sarda - this was truly an amazing dish and not to be missed! 

We were both stuffed after all this amazing food, but the Deconstructed Tiramisu sounded interesting, so we tried it. There is nothing about Buca Yorkville that is an afterthought, down to the dessert. Typically, I don't care much for desserts, because compared to the rest of the meal, they tend to disappoint. Not here!

The entire meal was so good, it's hard to pinpoint what i liked most about it. Service here is impeccable, and the space is absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to come back!
