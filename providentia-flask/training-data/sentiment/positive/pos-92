Yep, I know it's crazy to think there could be world class sushi in our dusty desert town.  But fear not...and you certainly MUST bring your MOST discerning sushi expert friends along for the experience.  Be prepared to wow those skeptics and drop some coin for hauntingly delicious morsels, top shelf sake, and craft brews from Japan.  

Mmmmm...bari oishii!
