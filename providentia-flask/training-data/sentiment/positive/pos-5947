Located in an area that is not the most "upscale" and the exterior is nothing that would be considered "eye catching". Yet, once you try the food, you're hooked.
I especially loved the gorditas and only $3 each, I could have had 10 they were so good.
Everything is excellent but I think the shredded beef in green chile stands out, melts in your mouth literally.
Met the owner, very appreciative and knows what he's doing.
Best in town!
