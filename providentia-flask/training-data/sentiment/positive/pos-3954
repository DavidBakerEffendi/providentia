Me and my girls tried this place out for breakfast and dang was it good. I was most pleased with the staff. The sever who also worked the register was very nice and that means a lot to me when I go out to eat. There coffee was hot and didn't have that bitter taste you get some times. I ended up getting the blazing chicken and waffle which is like a waffle chicken finger sandwich. Which as I am writing my mouth is watering for one. Also it came with waffle fries. Get it? Lol. Anyways, my daughter got the pumpkin delight and loved it. This is a local small business joint and we will be back. Need more places like this in North Las Vegas.
