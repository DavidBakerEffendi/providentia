Tom's Urban is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. We came here for Saturday brunch around 11AM. We wanted to sit outside on the strip so we waited for about 10 minutes which wasn't had. The atmosphere is very cool and party-like. They have loud music playing and the seating is very close together like a party. They have a nice sized brunch menu and bottomless mimosas. This is what made me come here. I did the create your own omelette and it was AMAZING and big! The mimosas were very strong. I don't know what champagne they use but...usually I do not get drunk off mimosas. All it took was three from here and I had to catch my balance a little to stand. AWESOME! Lol 

The service was a little on the bad side. Our server didn't check on us much and she messed up my order. I order sausage on my omelette and she put in bacon so I had to wait for mine to be remade. No apology or anything. We also had to chase her down for our bill. But I will definitely be returning! I want to try their dinner!
