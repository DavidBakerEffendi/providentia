I order from here once every few weeks, and I've never been disappointed!

Tonight, I called in a delivery order. General's chicken, crab rangoons, and cashew chicken. 
I asked about their Yelp check-in deal, and they said that it was based off the delivery total.
I ended up being applicable for spring rolls, and an upgraded order of my crab rangoons.

The person taking my order said is would be 40-45 minutes, and it ended up only being 20! They had my name, address, and my gate code already saved in their system.
The delivery driver was very nice, respectful, and everything was boxed up nearly.

I will continue to order delivery from them :)
