Little things. McDonald's is not great food but I was very pleased this morning by the service. I tend to like my coffee with milk, not creamer. I asked for a coffee with milk. They gave me a bottle of milk to put in my coffee at no charge. Most places would just they don't have milk. Good on ya McD's.
