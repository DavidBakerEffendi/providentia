Having been born and raised in Los Angeles, I've had some pretty dern good sushi. Big coastal cities will do that to ya - give you the upper hand when it comes to great seafood. So when I moved to PHX, I pretty much settled on not experiencing mind blowing sushi the way I had back home. And then I found Harumi. I venture this place at least once a month. It's a favorite for all special occasions and sushi cravings (They usually come in cycles and correspond with the full moon). The fish is always super fresh and the flavor combinations of their signature rolls will definitely familiarize your palate with umami. Hands down best sushi in PHX.
