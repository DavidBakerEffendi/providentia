I was a bit apprehensive about coming here because of the remodel and new management, but since my wife wanted to give it a try I finally agreed. It took a little time to figure out what was new on the menu and what was just a new name for an old item. Once that got straighten out and all members of our party ordered, things went smoothly. The staff was friendly, though we worked through a bit of the language barrier. The food was delicious, such as the pan fried noodles. We ordered it with extra sauce which is three dollars extra. The price on most of the dishes increased by two dollars from when this place used to be Diamond China Restaurant. Before the renovation and new management, we had gone to this particular Chinese restaurant since 1988, so we were are very familiar with the old restaurant and used it as a measure for this review. So my opinion is that some things have changed for the better and some for the worst, but overall it's still a good restaurant. I'm looking forward to trying out their dim sum or as we like to call it back home, manapua, which they say will be made fresh to order starting this Friday.
