Whenever I land in Vegas I always have a couple of "must eat" places.  I've written about several of them in Yelp over the years.  This year, I must add Chada to that listing.  From my vantage, they are one of the top 5 Thai restaurants in Vegas.  Chada is located in a small shopping center but they have paid attention to many details others overlook.  For instance, the front door is shielded from the outside by a hanging which makes you walk around it to discover the door.  Once inside, we were promptly seated and yes we had reservations - highly recommended.   For openers we had the NUA DAD DIEW (homemade beef jerky) and MIANG POU (lettuce wraps).  Both were exceptional but I must say the MIANG POU I have NEVER had  before and I've eaten at many Thai restaurants.  In fact, it was so good, I think I could make a meal off 2 orders of this one dish.    We shared a wonderful dish with salmon and rounded out the meal with another delicious serving of mango sticky rice!  Also, the whole while they had this track of songs playing which resonated with me.  It's like he had co-opted my playlist.  The service was exceptional and I will return.  Recommended.
