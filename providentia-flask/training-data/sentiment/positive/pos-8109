Pizza is always better your way!!

Ever have a problem trying to choose what pizza to order? Uncle Frank wants pepperoni. You want vegetarian and someone wants pineapple on the pizza?! Well this place makes everyone happy.

Fired Pie is celebrating this Mesa location as their 20th location in Arizona. They are located on the Southeast corner of Alma School and Baseline with it's own parking lot. What makes Fired Pie awesome is you get an 11" pizza where you can choose from a preselected pizza or customize it entirely. It's cheaper than buying a giant pizza that no one can agree on for sure.

Since it was their free pizza day I was worried it would be to crazy. Luckily the wait wasn't long, they provided shade while you waited and free iced tea samples outside. They remained transparent and let us know how long the wait would be so we could decide if it was worth the wait. I only waited 20 minutes and it was worth it!

I ordered the Meditterranean pizza without olives. The staff was super courteous as I ordered and piled on the toppings. My pizza was cooked to perfection and the blend of Meditterranean spices was perfect. Fired Pie never dissapointe and this location is perfect. Nice and roomy and relaxing even when it's busy. Now go get your own pizza before it causes you and your boyfriend to break up over whether pineapple should be on pizza!
