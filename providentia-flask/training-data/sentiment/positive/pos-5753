First time here. 
I had the "The John Wayne Omelet". Ham, sausage, bacon, and Cheese. served with potatoes and toast. I also had coffee with non dairy flavored creamer.
My Alex had the "Cheese" Omelet. Cheese blend, provolone, Havarti, feta, Swiss or mozzarella. Served with potatoes and toast. He had Ice Tea.
Really good food here, service as great and the restaurant was immaculate.
We were here on a Sunday, only open till 3:00 pm. 
We'd like to come back and try lunch some time :)
