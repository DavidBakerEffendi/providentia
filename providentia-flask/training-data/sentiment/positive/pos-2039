At first I was a bit wary of this place because it has a drive through and claims to make things fresh.  However after going there I'm now a believer, I always order the Dave's BLT because it's delicious.  There is quite a range of breads to choose from so the same sandwich can be different every time!  The Parmesan chips they make there are super delicious!  I definitely recommend giving them a try if you're in the area!!
