Food is reliably great. Service is also strong. Hostess nice and quick to seat us. Asst server (?) Named Jade got our drinks and refilled our water 3 times before our order was taken. And it wasn't a long wait to order. Nick (goatee) was helpful and complimentary. Really great service, all around 

Farmer toast is a fun alternative to regular bread. Wife lives the grilled octopus. Salmon is bomb. Get the squash. And any way they make ahi tuna...get it now!
