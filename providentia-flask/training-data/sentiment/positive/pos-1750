First time trying out Thai food and this place does not disappoint.  I was very weary of eating something too different, especially any curry dish, but I was wrong!  Recommend the beef green curry, beef stir fry, chicken ravioli and chicken pad Thai!  SOO GOOD.  Also, I love how the young lady at the counter remembers me from the first visit.  Definitely a regular spot!!
