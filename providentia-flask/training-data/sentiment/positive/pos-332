A game of Stratego anyone!?!

I love the concept for this place! For 5 bucks you get a table and access to hundreds of board games (literally). It's also a cafe with a newly acquired license so you can order up a latte (apparently not very good) or my fav, a bottle of Steamwhistle beer and play to your heart's content.

Once we were seated, I walked over to the daunting wall of games. They are all categorized for easy browsing and they have everything you could possibly think of (although only one version of each, which meant no scrabble for me... ). Since there ARE so many games, this can make choosing one pretty difficult. This is why the smart people at S & L have game specialists that will not only pick out games for you, they will make suggestions and even teach you how to play! So throw those useless instructions back in the box and get ready to learn a new game.

This is an extremely popular place so be ready to wait for a table. If nothing's available, they will take your name and number and call you when something comes up. In the mean time, there are a lot of other places to kill some time along this stretch of Bloor St.
