We had recently dined here for a celebration for my mother in law.   The interior was clean and modern.  We were sat promptly and greeted.   We decided to order Panang Chicken, Pad Se Ewe Beef, Pad Thai. and Pad Prik King.  Our food was fantastic and all the dishes where on Point.   
The only reason i could think of why this place wasn't busier was that people must not know that it is here.  We all really enjoyed our food and service.  We will return.  The menu was quite affordable which was a plus.  We got the check and had to make sure they didn't forget to charge us for something.   TRY THIS PLACE OUT!! IT'S WORTH IT!!
