We just stumbled on this place after seeing it on Yelp, and we're very happy we did!  Casual, open, clean surrounding; fun, helpful service; and excellent, plentiful food at extremely affordable prices.  It's a good thing you can order half servings, because there was so much that neither of of could finish even those.  What a find! We will definitely be back!
