I was surprised. I had modest expectations that were summarily surpassed.

I had the 22 oz bone-in ribeye and it was outstanding. From the ranch of the M Resort owners. It was tender, juicy and flavorful.

Just a little less expensive than the high-end meat joints on the strip....steak in the 40s instead of 50s. But worth it.

Wine list is good, not great; but workable. Service was very good. 

This goes on my list of first-rate Vegas steakhouses.

Just opened so they're eager to please.
