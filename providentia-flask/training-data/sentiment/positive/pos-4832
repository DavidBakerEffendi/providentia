Service is superb! Entire wait staff is very attentive and efficient. Food presentation is nice. You have to specify brown rice if you want it because they seem to push the white rice, especially on take-out. 

Green chicken curry was very tasty... Sauce a bit thin, but still good. Namprigpaow was excellent. I will definitely return.
