It's probably the time of the month again.. ( you know what I mean)... When I arrive from school last night instead of eating dinner.I craved for dark, moist sweet thing... so..I changed my uniform and I thought I'd go to demetre's. and of course it didn't disappoint me.. I ordered Cocoa Ono.. and I was in heaven!.:)  I had to share it because the serving is too much for me 

When I came here the first time  the attendant recommended Chewbaklava.. that one is great too.. ! 

If you have a sweet tooth this place will never disappoint you. It may seem a little pricey but you get what you paid for.. 

This is one of the great places to vist when you feel like bonding with your friends or family..eating sweets makes you feel good.. it's makes you happy The ambiance here is nice. The staff are friendly..but take note,  you must eat everything slowly.. take your time.. enjoy.... or else you'll get sick of it easy. :)
