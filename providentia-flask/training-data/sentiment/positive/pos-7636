By far one of my favorite places to go when visiting home.  They always have one of the best beer lists in Cleveland, interesting bands, and most importantly: the BEST hot dogs ever.  I recently moved to Chicago, and I would die to find a place like this near me.

I highly recommend going earlier in the evening, especially if it's your first time.  When bands play, it can be tricky to get a table.  You don't stand a chance eating a super messy dog if you're stuck standing! Their topping list is constantly changing. Recently I got hooked on the mac and cheese topping (for obvious reasons) and any coleslaw they have is phenomenal.  The coca cola bok choy was my old favorite but they took it off the menu :(

The one bad side: I tend to overdo it on my tot sauces so sometimes i have no idea which sauces I really like. The Top Secret fry sauce was everyone's favorite last time we went....but it's hard to tell if that's what we were actually eating...
