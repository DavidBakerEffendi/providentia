Before coming here, I only had the ramen that came in packets that you add water to and microwave. That ramen wasn't very good, and I only ate it during my poor college days. When my husband suggested coming here, I couldn't imagine the ramen tasting that different. Boy was I wrong! First of all, they make their own ramen, so it's none of that prepackaged stuff. Second of all, the variety of toppings and delicious broths makes the ramen taste amazing! I am a big fan of the chizu ramen, which has cheese, egg, pesto and garlic. I add the spicy ground pork for an extra $2, which I think makes the dish even more flavorful! This is one of those places I like to bring out-of-town guests, because it's unique and everyone likes it.
