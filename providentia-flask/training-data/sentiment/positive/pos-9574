I went in last Monday to try out this new restaurant just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Yogurtology. 

The menu is quite extensive. Whew! 

I ordered the chicken Picado combo, which came with a side of rice and beans and some tortillas. The chicken was well marinated and the veggies sauteed well. I loved the flavors. Yay! Good job!

There was a man eating next to me who had ordered a burrito the size of a mack truck. No joke, you could get four good meals out of it. Seriously. It. Was. Huge. I am not kidding! I am shaking my head just writing this right now. 

The staff was fast and friendly, the decor fun and different from your hole-in-the-wall Mexican food joints. 

Good prices, more than fair for the amount of food you get. In fact, nothing on the menu is more than $8.95. 

Good luck to the newly born business!
