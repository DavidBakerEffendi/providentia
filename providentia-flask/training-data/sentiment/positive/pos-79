Lunch was good but didn't like my drink the second visit. 

Space is large and spacious; a lot of staff compared to the low traffic. Very extensive drink menu, as well as lunch/dinner, snacks, and dessert (shaved ice, toast..)

Ordered from the $9.99 lunch/dinner menu which comes with a large drink and dessert (some jello/pudding). 

Popcorn Chicken + Noodle; Grapefruit Green Tea 
- large portions!! Couldn't finish at all 
- popcorn chicken was crispy, light batter, and juicy 
- noodle is plain white, soft, thin noodle, to balance out the saltiness of the deep fried meat, with some green veg. and egg

Basil Three-Cups Chicken - really big pieces, quite flavorful and moist

Pork Cutlet - same coating as the popcorn chicken, moist meat, light batter, salty 

The complimentary garlic black pepper edamame is quite tasty as well. 

Second visit, ordered a Japanese Green Tea Latte. Didn't like it.. not as good as Green Grotto's Matcha Milk Tea. Tasted a bit powdery/artificial. Comes with red bean. 

Tawainese Sausage - not a huge fan of sausage, but this was good, slight honey/sweet, meaty

Overall - Great quiet spot for lunch/dinner and meeting with friends. Love the meal combo.
