My review is only going to discuss ONE THING, the most important thing in the whole place and maybe the whole city: the chocolate chip cookie.

This is, hands down the best, the ultimate, the most amazing chocolate chip cookie in Toronto. It's oooey, gooey, often still warm, often slightly undercooked on the inside, oozing with chocolate chip cookies. It's buttery, and it's perfect. I will always get a cookie when I am anywhere close to here. I just have to.
