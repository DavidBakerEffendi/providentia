I really enjoyed myself here, and what I will say next may shock a lot..

But I felt it was better than both the Wynn and Bellagio buffet!

Yes I just said that. 

Don't get me wrong the Wynn and Bellagio buffet are top notch as well. They have a much nicer/luxrious atmosphere compared to the Village Seafood buffet. 

But I came for the food. Perhaps it was because prior to eating at the Wynn and Bellagio, there was A LOT of hype behind them. My expectations were super high from all the reviews that after my experience it was, "yea it was good but that was it?---  that was supposedly the best buffets"

I went into Village Seafood not expecting much at all, just heard it was good as well, but no hype or high expections.

The decor and atmosphere are well below that of the Wynn and Bellagio. The buffet sections were not as spread out as the aforementioned places, it did make it look more like a dense amount of choices. So it depends how you perceive it.

They don't call it the "Seafood" buffet for no reason. They definitely had more choices in seafood compared to the others. Of course its a trade-off wit other items. But I'm not that much of a pig to argue that they were missing other items, because it made up for it with more seafood.

All the food tasted great, I went straight to the lobster and crab of course. There is sushi, and they were not bad, but not good either, but no buffet (even the wynn and bellagio) produce a "good" sushi. 

What really shines is the desserts. The gelato wheel is awesome! The flavors all taste great and refreshing. The other dessert items are absolutely superb as well.

The staff that cleans up after your plates are attentive and we had no problems.

A line does form as well, but not as much and not as long as the more popular Wynn and Bellagio. 

I would definitely go here, and after you experience the hype that is of Wynn and Bellagio buffets, give this a shot.
