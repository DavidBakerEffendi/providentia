My first visit to Block and Grinder was this past weekend and it was fantastic!  Our waiter was very attentive but not overly so, very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in offering suggestions (my boyfriend was torn between 3 different choices) and the food was just amazing.
We started with the deviled eggs which were awesome.  My boyfriend decided on the venison flank steak (which was a special that night) and I had the duck.  Having never tried venison before (and being slightly hesistant to try it), Block and Grinder set the bar very high.  It was amazing.  And the duck with the warm peaches on the side was fantastic.  The portions were generous though neither of us had any trouble finishing our meals! :)  We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was definitely a good choice! Yum! 
We sat outside so I cannot comment on the indoor seating but it seemed totally fine.  It's trendy and not an "intimate" restaurant but we aren't typically looking for that type of setting.  It's a little louder and more casual while still being upscale.
Their prices are VERY reasonable considering other restaurants in the area and the freshness and high quality of your meal.  I actually was suprised it wasn't more expensive given the level of service and ingredients. You definitely get what you pay for when it comes to food and the meals here are totally worth the price.
Really looking forward to our next visit.  We saw so many amazing meals being delivered to neighboring tables so we cannot wait to go back and try more from the menu!
