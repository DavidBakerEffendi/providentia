We were hosting a fitness week at our high rise condo tower and enlisted The Green Regime to come out and blend to order their smoothies for our residents. From start to finish Wendy was a ton of help and had everything setup and ready to go for after the fitness class. 

I personally ordered the Vanilla smoothie and thought it was fabulous. I also tried the Tropical and the Clean Green, both were really great healthy options. What I like most about these drinks is that the sugar content is low compared to other chain smoothie shops. These drinks were FRESH and good for you. 

All of the residents gave very positive feedback about the drinks they received and were very excited to have them onsite. Will definitely use them again in the future.
