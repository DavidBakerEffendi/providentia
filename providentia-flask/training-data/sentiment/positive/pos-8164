Sorry Luv-its, good luck competing against Art of Flavors, they have seats, take credit and debit cards, and the owners are vested, friendly, and obviously care about their business. I met Desyree and she was soooooo nice and you could tell a bit anxious and cute about her brand new business right next to Viva Las Arepas. It's places like this that are helping clean up the area. 

   They don't offer toppings (not at this point) which is keeping the flavors au' natural.. In my opinion that's a good call! If you need syrups and toppings to hide or enhance a flavor then maybe it wasn't that good to begin with. They make some everyday flavors and others exotic flavors as well, I had the white coffee bean today and I loved it!!

Hey folks, it's hot, it's summer and its Las Vegas so I recommend trying it. I've never had gelato before and I liked it.
