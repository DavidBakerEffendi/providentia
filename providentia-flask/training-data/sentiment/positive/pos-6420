We usually come here often and every time the customer service and food is superb! Here, they have the server call button where you can request the server when needed. Their sides are tasty too especially the pasta and the carrot salad. We usually get the Popcorn chicken with the Supreme sauce and the Spicy Rice Cake. The bibimbap here is good! 

This restaurant ambience has good vibes with little light bulbs and hipster items. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing.
