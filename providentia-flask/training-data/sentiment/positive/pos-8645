I had a wonderful first visit to this Little Burgundy spot with delicious wine and small plates! I enjoyed a lovely "orange" wine (first time having one of these!) and a sparking rose. 

For food, my friend and I shared the falafel and beet hummus, which was nice and light; scallops served with an interesting crunchy topping (not sure what it was); a half order of the very rich and delicious ham and cheese dish with brown sugar butter; and the very large and filling rotisserie cauliflower. Every dish was unique, and the mix provided a full complete meal. 

We finished with the diplomate choco-cafe which was a flavourful mousse served with cookie wafers.

For the amount of time we spent enjoying our drinks and bites and the quality of everything, the price is totally worth it!
