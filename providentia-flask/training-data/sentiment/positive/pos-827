They have  lots  of things for  under six bucks.  I love their shredded cheese on  the Carne Asada quesadilla.  Nice  customer service when  we dined in to  eat.  Don't  share  drinks there  is  a big  sign by the  fountain machine..  I was  shocked they had  a charge on  credit/debit cards.

BRING CASH.
