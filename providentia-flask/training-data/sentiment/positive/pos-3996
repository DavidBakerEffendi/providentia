Have been meaning to check out this restaurant out for awhile!  I've heard good things from friends and I drive by it all the time!  Finally made it over for Restaurant week and we really enjoyed ourselves!

The space isn't very big, but it's comfortable and has a lively vibe.  It seemed like a lot of small groups of friends catching up and kicking off the weekend.  It's also BYOB, so there were plenty of wine bottles on every table.

Service was great.  Very knowledgeable and friendly, but not pushy or overly obtrusive.

Some of the menu items are their staples (Chalkboard Menu) and some of the items change depending on the season and what they receive locally.  I think most of the items we had were seasonal, but we loved the eggplant appetizer and the roasted chicken breast the most!  The heirloom tomatato salad we had was also good, light and refreshing.  And the veal dish I had was also good, but just not as good as the chicken, which was juicy, flavorful and with a nice crispy skin!  

Overall, I would definitely recommend checking out Avenue B if you're looking for a slightly nicer restaurant with reasonable prices and yummy food!
