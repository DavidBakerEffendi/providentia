This was such an enjoyable meal. 

We went to the new Danforth location at lunchtime, and the restaurant was not too busy. This was great, because I've attempted to eat at the Ossington restaurant before and have been faced by an hour+ wait (albeit at dinnertime). The service was fantastic- friendly and attentive. 

We ordered the braised oxtail special on polenta with roasted brussle sprouts. This dish was out-of-this-world perfection. The different textures worked very well (creamy polenta, tender oxtail and quite crunchy sprouts) and oh-so flavourful. It was visually beautiful also. They should put this on the menu permanently!  

Calamari was good- what you might expect, golden and crispy with a chipolte and a black garlic mayo. 

We split the funghi pizza- it was hot, fresh and very light. The crust was almost naan like. I definitely prefer this pizza to Terroni- and the pizza comes pre cut in four slices! (Way better then wrestling with it at the table and having it slide around haphazardly!)

Espresso to finish. Did not try the desserts but there is always next time. Usually when I eat Italian I have ``eaters remorse`` about all the bread and cheese. But here not so. The food was not greasy, very fresh somehow amazingly light. 

Check it out!

P.s. The server recommended the duck confit pizza with pear for next time- which is  a) a pretty brilliant move to encourage repeat visits, and b) effective because I have not stopped thinking about it since. 5 Stars.
