I've been always wanting to try Carluccio's -- I'm an often Vegas tourist who likes to explore nook-and-cranny museums, eateries et al (I know life is more than the Strip) -- I have the opportunity to finally get there over July 4th weekend.  All you need to know is that I did so in 111 degrees and via bus -- and it was oh so well worth it!

First, the service and staff were wonderful -- I'd been seated maybe 5 minutes and looking at the menu when another server (or manager) insisted on making sure I got some water because I looked like I'd "been out in the sun."  For an older restaurant, the service was anything but attitudewise -- very enthusiastic, friendly, knowledgeable...very homey.

Foodwise, wow, for the choices and taste and also for the reasonable prices.  I had the stuffed shrimp, which came witha side of pasta (I wanted to try the sauce, plus I ordered a side of meatballs) along with a  casesars salad.  For dessert I had to try -- or shall I say, ingest -- a homemade cannoli.   All food items were exceptionally tasteful, authentic, unique, flavorful...and the homemade bread was yummy as well.  Plus I did check out the lounge area for all the celb pics and piano bar and all the historical things (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting).

Just an all-around great dinning experience after a scorching hot day of playing tourist.  Totally hit the spot.

PS  As i understand it, the Trop location is closing (Liberace closing wasnt good with the restaurant tucked back in the shopping center) and a smaller version will be opening in Henderson.  If I get to Henderson ona future trip you can be sure I will be there for dinner!
