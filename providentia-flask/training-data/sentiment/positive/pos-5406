Outstanding food and great value! Definitely the best pizza in town! So far we've had the Carbonara Specialty Pie YUM! the eggs on that thing were to-die-for. We've also tried the fish tacos, I usually don't like spicy but these were really well prepared, and carnitas, also delicious. All ingredients taste fresh and I love that they're local. We really needed a place with high quality food at a reasonable price on the East Side and this is it, we will be back often!!
