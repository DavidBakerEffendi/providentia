Here is something cool to check out in Vegas...and it is free.

We were sightseeing in Vegas.  Most of the hotels have their own theme so they are all neat to check out.  We went by the Bellagio.  Outside the Bellagio the fountains light up and dance.  We kept missing it and finally were able to catch it.  It is an absolutely beautiful sight to see.
