Well I have been here a few times now and really like it.
It is very clean inside, the restrooms are clean as well. The staff is always pleasant ,even when they are very busy.
Now the chick-fil-A"s all serve Breakfast as well. I have not got to try the Breakfast yet. But, I will one day soon. I have been checking out several different stores through out the Valley.
The food is always fresh here. I love their lemonade and they have an Ice tea that is not sweetened, which I love as well. I am not a fan of sweet drinks and I do not drink Soda. So I like that they have other Options. You can also buy Bottled water.
You might find it a little hard to find at first, even though it is on Ray Rd.
It is in the same parking lot as the AMC. That is the largest thing you can see from the road,so you can use that as a marker. Also there is a Petco in the same Parking Lot as well. From the street, the best marker perhaps is" On The Boarder" restaurant.
They do have a drive thru as well, but so far I have always just parked and gone in.
Give this place a try. It is fresh, hot, and very good.
