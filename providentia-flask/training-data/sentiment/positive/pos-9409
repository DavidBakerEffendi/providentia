Why 5 stars? Because why don't I think of this stuff?

My Mom always told me I was smart, so why is it that my brain didn't invent a Build Your Own Taco Menu? Who would hear about something like that and react with anything other than euphoria? Not someone I want to hang out with, that's for sure.

I couldn't even tell you what exactly I ordered. There were so many choices, I gave up on logic and just filled out the card with my heart. I know that one had a shrimp base, one had a Coca-Cola marinated steak base. I believe the other one was pulled pork. It doesn't really matter, because they were all wonderful. 

You know what else was wonderful? The chips and guac. Also, our server.

Oh, and you know what else was wonderful? After Barrio, we went and watched the Cavs decimate the Warriors in Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals at the Q. And then you know what happened a couple days later.

I credit tacos.
