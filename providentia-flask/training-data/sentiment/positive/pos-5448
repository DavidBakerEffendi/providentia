This is the place to go for good breakfast food. We always have to wait a bit but it is definitely worth it. Like everyone else has said, TRY THE COFFEE CAKE! Everyone that has tried it with me raves and we fight over who gets the last bite. Service is great and everyone is very friendly. I'm glad this is near my house. It rivals Egg Works for sure.
