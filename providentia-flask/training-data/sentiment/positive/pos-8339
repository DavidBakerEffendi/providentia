They always greet you once you walk through the door! It's a small place so there's very few workers & it's pretty much the same people every time. 

I've had a couple of rolls and they've been awesome! My favorite items on the menu are the salmon poke salad & the salmon poke tacos! THEYRE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! 

The service is always good, I mean there are only a couple of tables to wait on. I would say it's a tad pricey but what sushi type place isn't?
