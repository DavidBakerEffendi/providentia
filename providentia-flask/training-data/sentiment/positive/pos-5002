The entire aura of White Brick Kitchen screams "comfort food here, come and eat your heart out." Seating is comfy enough, the menu is as straightforward it gets, and the staff are super chilled out. I waited almost an hour after having my burger for some buttermilk fried chicken to be made so I could take it home (they ran out before I first arrived). It lived up to expectations and then some, let's just say.

Must-try items:
Fried Chicken
Chicken & Waffles

I like the idea of offering burger specials and other surprise menu items. The passion, creativity, and customer service along with the food quality warrants the rave review, in my books. Not too far off the beaten path, it's a short walk here from either Bathurst or Christie subway stations. Definitely a spot to check out for chicken and beer, brunch, burgers, and all that other good stuff. Quite impressed and would make another appearance here in a heartbeat.
