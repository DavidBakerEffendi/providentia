One of the BEST Asian restaurants in Charlotte hands down. I was shocked it was not already on Yelp.
They specialize in Malasian Food, but offer a fusion of Japanese (sushi & hibachi), Chinese, and Thai inspired dishes. Honestly I have not tried the Hibachi, but the sushi is among the best, even over sushi specific restaurants!
Don't be scared of the term "Malasian", if you are not familiar with it. There is not a single person I have ever taken there that has not loved it, and become a regular patron. Even the "standard" Chinese Restaurant dishes are really good- Kung Pao Chicken or Shrimp, Chow Fun, and fried rice. Try the Roti Telur for an appetizer. It's a savory Curry Broth with potatoes (don't think of Indian Curry), it's mild and I think it tastes similar to Thai Massaman curry. Comes with homemade bread pancakes for dipping. Also the Beef Satay is very good.
The wait staff is usually very helpful to new customers that are not familiar with the dishes.
They do a great Lunch Menu and are very fast with service.
Located next to CPCC campus downtown, this place is a must try!
