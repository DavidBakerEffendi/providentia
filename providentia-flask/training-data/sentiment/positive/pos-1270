I am not vegetarian and I LOVED this restaurant! Their faux meat dishes were out of this world! I had gone with my equally carnivorous boyfriend and we couldnt believe how good this restaurant was! 

Service was amazing, food was delicious, atmosphere was great.

They take your coats at the entrance too. Parking is a bit tricky however.
