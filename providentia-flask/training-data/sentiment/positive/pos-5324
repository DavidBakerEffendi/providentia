What a great find in Mississauga. Came here a few days ago for lunch and already know I'll be back. Quaint spot in Mississauga with an old-fashion yet luxurious vibe. 

We loved every dish that we ordered. I had the lamb lollipop and the sea bass with lobster risotto. I would highly recommend both dishes. They were to die for. Service was also great. We came on a weekday for lunch and it was quiet. Although I'm sure this place gets packed for dinners and on the weekends.
