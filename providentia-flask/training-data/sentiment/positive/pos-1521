One of the busiest sushi places in Charlotte for sure. I'm there on weekly basis, as I'm a sushi lover. They have excellent sushi and always fresh with a very friendly staff. A lot of options to choose from and try every time. It's a busy place if you want a calm place for a romantic dinner that's definitely not your destination.
