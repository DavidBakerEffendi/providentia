We had a green curry at 5 of 10, and the pumpkin curry at 1.  Both were flavorful, and all fresh vegetables.
The servings were enough for leftovers.  
We also sat on the patio which was lovely this time of year.  There was a bit of traffic in spurts, though.
The owners are super sweet and friendly.
It's in a neighborhood, too, a nice drive and setting.
The to-go bins are recycle-able plastic,too, not styrofoam.
