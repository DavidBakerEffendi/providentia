Large portions, great food and alcohol beverages! Glad the Uber driver recommended this place for breakfast over Denny's. After experiencing the food, we ate here every morning we were in Vegas and this is now our go-to spot after a night out in Vegas. Although, I think the service is hit or miss because the couple next to us was ignored after being seated and finally left after a few minutes of not being noticed. So far, nothing negative for us here.
