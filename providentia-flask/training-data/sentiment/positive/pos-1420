Such a great crawfish restaurant. Try the oysters too, they're phenomenal! We ordered the combo with the lobster mixed with the Cajun sauces, no regrets! Except for the food coma shortly after... 
Billy was one of the best servers we had, great guy to joke and chat with. Looking forward to coming back!
