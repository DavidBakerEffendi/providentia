We had a wonderful time at Cork & Cleaver last night. Having never been there before, I was impressed by our entire experience. We sat at the bar, and the bar tender was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We started with the Rueben Ribs, which are phenomenal. For entrees I had the short ribs, which literally melted in my mouth. My dining partner had the gnocchi, which what they are known for. And holy cow, I see why. They were incredible! On a whim I ordered the country fried brownie.... it was a heavenly experience. The caramel sauce they used it an other worldly experience. All drinks and wines that we had were great. This is a must go place. Such a big fan, we will be back!
