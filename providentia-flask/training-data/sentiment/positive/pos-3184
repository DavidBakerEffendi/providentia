Not a fan of chicken!  Figured I should start with that.   But, Wing King pleasantly surprised me.  They have an excellent waffle with different syrups.  FRIED PICKLES!!!  And if you want a non-chicken alternative but want to try one of the 80 flavors; you can get pig snackers (individual ribs).  Don't worry pizza people, they also have 6 different pizzas on the menu and can add any of the 80 flavors.
