I should probably preface this by saying I am related to the owner, but that only adds to the appeal!  So what if I get a free beer once in awhile? I come here anyways!

Having lived in Belgium, I come here to relive some of my favourite Belgian foods and beer (although, I am admittedly not much of a beer drinker). The cheese fondue and frites are authentic standouts, as well as the pulled pork sandwich even if it's not really Belgian. You have to ask for the pulled pork as it's not on the menu, but it should be since it's so popular. Maybe I should see to this since I have the connection and all!
