Axis has quite a large menu with variety of foods. Now I have not tried it all but from what I've ordered I have not been disappointed. Chicken chow mein, spicy salmon rolls, chicken pad thai, bento boxes, miso soup, chicken fried rice. All these dishes are packed with flavour and the portion size is great for what you pay for! They have great daily lunch special options and the whole establishment is just decorated so nicely ! Adds a great feel!
