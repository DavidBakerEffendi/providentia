Looking at the pictures on yelp had me drooling and I couldn't wait to try this place!  I thought I was going to order something crazy, but by the time I got there, I was really craving a Chicago Dog.  It was the best Chicago Dog I've ever had!

I also ordered the Euro fries.  They were okay.  I liked the pork belly but would have preferred a different sauce.  I got some ketchup and enjoyed them that way.

I can't wait to go back and try something different.

Very good service.  We didn't know what Asian Slaw was, so they let us try it before we ordered.
