So delicious!  This feels like a real country gas station with great brisket.  I got the brisket sandwich with baked Mac & Cheese.  Sandwich was really flavorful.  If you like some spice, mix the hickory sauce with the habanero.  Next time I am getting the corn; saw another table with it and looked fantastic.
