great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant.

you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable. local breeze made it tolerable and i don't think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience. they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture.

we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for. the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees. their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing. ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich. my girlfirned (Rachel O.) went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish. it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it. the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it. leftovers are always good.

service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before. get over it, it's no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze.
