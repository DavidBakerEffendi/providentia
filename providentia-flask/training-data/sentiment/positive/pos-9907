It's one of those places where you wondered why you never visited before.

Tonight was out first visit here and we left feeling completely satisfied.

Service was impeccable.  Food fantastic. Price very fair.
Greeted at the door by the owner.  How often does that happen? Had a cocktail or two at the bar while waiting for the other half of our party. When they arrived we took our table.

Had an assortment  of appetizers that we all shared.  We moved on to the main courses which were nothing less than stellar. Finished with dessert.

 You can tell that it is a family affair and they all care.

We can't wait to go back.
