What a great sandwich, ordered the Streetcar without the catfish and it was amazing!! Our waiter was great and the food came out quickly! Will be coming back again and again! We were told that because of the I-15 freeway expansion that they will be relocating and we were sure to leave them our emails so we know where to find them when they do move. Definitely recommend this place for their sandwiches!!
