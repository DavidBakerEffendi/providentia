4.5 but rounded up. 

Maybe it's just me... and I don't go out to farms and gardens much, but the whole idea of having a restaurant with a garden and farm makes pretty good sense. You can tell your greens are picked from the garden and where the eggs come from. 

The Farm has salads, sandwiches, soups, baked goods, and desserts but their main emphasis is sandwich. We picked the special of the day - Sicilian Chicken but asked it on French bread and not focaccia.  =0)

I loved the sandwich! A little sweet and tangy but tamed by the light mayo. Delicious chicken and ... lovely toasted bread. It came together wonderfully...and in a basket too! 

I love how The Farm has picnic tables and little cafe tables out ... so that you can eat out in the fields (bring a blanket)! Some tables have umbrellas to shade you and some don't.

Oh... and free refills! We got their homemade lemonade... light and sweet. Perfect for the sunny Arizona day!  

Parking: You can park across the street at their lot or you can park on the unpaved road next to the picnic tables.

I wanted to take my hubby somewhere special because he had driven out from LA just to see me....I gave him the option of going to a Man vs. Food place or here. I'm really glad he decided on this place! I took a look at their Valentine's menu...and wished  I could be here for it!

It's definitely special and unique!
