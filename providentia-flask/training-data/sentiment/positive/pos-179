Great service and great food. They don't advertise this but you can order chocolate chip and/or blueberry pancakes. The Volcano is awesome and the cinnamon roll French toast is great too. My favorite dessert is Olga's bread pudding ala mode with whipped cream. The lava cake is awesome too and is gluten free for those who are sensitive to gluten. The servers are attentive and the food comes out pretty quick.
