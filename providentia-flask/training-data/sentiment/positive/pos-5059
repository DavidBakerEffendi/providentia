5 stars for consistently providing: great food, fast, friendly service, & uniquely beautiful atmosphere/ambiance. without a doubt, this peppermill is one of my favorite corners of not only vegas, but the world. in my opinion, peppermill/fireside is a must-see in vegas for locals & tourists alike. it's pretty, it's soooo, sooooo pretty!!!
