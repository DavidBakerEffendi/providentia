Trust the reviews! This place has by far the best sushi I've had in the valley. We had the H3 Roll, the Crazy Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll and some salmon and yellowtail nigiri. Everything was so fresh and delicious I couldn't help but dance every time I took a bite. 

The servers were awesome and the black rice adds a fantastic flavor to the sushi. Highly recommend! Only downside, no parking and if there's an event at the Orpheum you really have to search for a spot.
