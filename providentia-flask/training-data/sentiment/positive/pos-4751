I live in town and cherish old school Vegas as it is slowly disappearing. This place is holding on with both Fists. Walk into here and it's like no other place you've ever been. When they were filming Casino next door at the Riviera Sharon Stone Pesci and De Niro  use to hang out here. As a matter of fact a couple of the scenes were filmed here. Where the Sharon Stone character asks for money and goes to the restroom then when she comes back to DeNiro asks, " any change?". The place is great.  When they implode it, I'm moving.
