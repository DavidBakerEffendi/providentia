Even though it has been about 3 weeks since I left Las Vegas, I still think about the buffet at the Bellagio and my mouth starts to water.

I went to Las Vegas as a 20-year old with my family, so I was not expecting any, you know, fun. We stopped at the Bellagio during their Father's day weekend special, so everybody had to pay the same price ($40). While that was a bit of a damper, we luckily breezed past the cashier-there seems to be no lines at around 5:30pm...

The spread was fabulous. I usually eat buffets "strategically"-that is, I avoid the cheap fried rice, pizza, bread, salad, etc. Even with my odd buffet eating styles, I still filled my plate 5 times! What else can I say about this fabulous place?!

Buffet Bellagio, thank you for making my Las Vegas experience somewhat bearable. You have opened my eyes to the wonders of the buffets and Las Vegas, and no other buffets will ever seem to match to the sheer quantity and quality of your food. If I ever get married in Las Vegas on a whim, my reception will most definitely be at this place.
