I'm just repeating what others have already said, but one more glowing review never hurt anyone. This place is awesome. They serve soups and wraps. All the soups are delicious. All the wraps are delicious. That's their trick. The place is perpetually packed, so grabbing a seat for lunch can be tricky. Take out is probably your best bet. The place has a big back patio. It's surprisingly big. I usually get the $11 soup and wrap combo. It's a good amount of food, and it's probably easier to justify spending that much on the combo rather than $9-10 for big bowls of fancy soup. I'd like to talk about all the different soups you can get, but I keep getting the Butternut Squash. it's too good.

The restaurant is run by a bunch of Tamil dudes, so that's basically a reason to go right there. What!
