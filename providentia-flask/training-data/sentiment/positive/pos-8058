My husband and I decided to have our Christmas dinner here and it was by far the best place we have ever dined at.  The food was incredible but the service was outstanding.  The Manager on duty (Jade) made us feel like family. She constantly checked on us to make sure that everything was to our liking and that our waitress (Paula) was taking good care of us.  They both explained each dish as it was served. It was amazing. Every dish that came out was absolutely  delicious. I highly recommend this place to anyone who visits or even lives in Vegas. My husband has been in the military for 20 yrs and traveled the world and we both agree that Sushi Samba is the best place we have ever been to.  We will definitely be back again when we are in town!
