If you are going to Las Vegas for the first time (or even a millionth) checking out the fountains of Bellagio is a must.  It is such a fun experience.  We make sure we go at least once during the day and also at night.  The fountains are beautiful and fun to watch... at night time it is also very romantic... a must stop for love birds!
