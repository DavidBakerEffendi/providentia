There's a reason this place has a consistent line up out the door. 

Amazing food at such a reasonable price. The decor and atmosphere is lovely and the staff are always pleasant. The complimentary breads and dip are unbelievable. I struggle trying not to fill up on those. The filet mignon salad is to die for -- perfectly cooked steak every time. The schnitzel is the size of your head; anybody who can finish it in one go deserves a freaking medal.

No wonder Green Eggplant has grown into such a renowned Beaches institution!
