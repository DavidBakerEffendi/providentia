Oh lordy lord lord. where shall we begin? Let's start with Breakfast, shall we? 1st thing is 1st; the Disclaimer ya'll. Ive only been for breakfast. however comma the lunch menu looks epic and anyone who can make a person who hates breakfast fall in love with breakfast all over again deserves props for the whole menu. i will update my review for lunch someday...problem is, I'm not allowed to go to the same place more than once a day and i come here for breakfast. so, hence the problem. Also, since my Delorian is broken (Popsicle gas sucks), i can not currently go backwards ( IE: delete button broken, ramble shall continue on). Well, any great breakfast joint will have 2 things IMO; fresh, home made Mimosa's and NFL on the TV. check and check. parking? a cinch. easier than a valet. Greeting? always warm and inviting. Cool bar seating/normal seating? you guessed it folks, the price is right. Food? O....M.....G...... my goal is simple: try the entire menu. the problem? I'm stuck on item #3, on my 19th visit. do that math. Luckily for me, my girlfriend has amazing will power and is on item 14 and is a small eater. guess who gets her dish? This Guy!!! i haven't had one bad thing. My favorite is BY FAR the Chili Pork Tostada. The braised short rib egg Benedict is so good, you'll literally O Face at the table. no joke. for you followers of me, you know how i feel about places that make your wet dream a reality. seriously. incredible food. also, 2 other awesome things; the patio is legally allowed to have dog's on it and they have a dog menu! how cool is that? answer: freaking cool man! also the bathrooms are so weird and unexpected...its like the Blue Man Group, i could try to explain it to you but it just wont make sense. you have to witness it for yourself. PLUS - if you want healthy, they have egg whites, turkey, spinach omelet. AND a drive thru for phone ahead orders AND AND protein shakes also. whats that now, like 8 PS's? told ya, backspace button has been deleted.
