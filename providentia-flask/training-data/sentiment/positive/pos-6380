Omg, go here immediately and order the brisket.  Just get the whole order because it's the best thing you will ever eat.  Not kidding.  And there is something about the water because it's the best water in LV!  And the cheesecake?!?  Life changing!  After you eat head to the deli and get some bagels and cream cheese to go!

Or get their omelet (any and all of them!) and ask for a side of hollandaise sauce!  It's, oddly, one of my favorite keto friendly restaurants!
