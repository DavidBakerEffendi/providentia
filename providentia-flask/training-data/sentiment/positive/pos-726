I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this place was awesome!! I searched yelp and was skeptical when I saw the rating, but decided to give it a try anyway. When we pulled up we were nervous. The building and location made me think it was a joke. This is a case of never judging a book by its cover! Thank goodness for yelp!!!! The food is great and the wait staff were awesome. The food had a unique approach and tasted great. The burger was to die for and the eggplant was great. The staff was very accommodating as we'll. the prices were also reasonable at 13.99 for an entree. Very small, cozy restaurant and a MUST try!
