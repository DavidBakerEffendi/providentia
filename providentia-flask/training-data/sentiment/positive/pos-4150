This is one of my favorite places to chill out with a friend because their tableside guacamole and endless chips and salsa are to die for. The chips are paper thin and served warm with 2 types of salsa. Everything I have ordered here has been top notch from typical fajitas (love the baco wrapped shrimp), flautas, tacos, skirt steak wrapped around a poblano chile and of course the exceptional mole enchiladas which you should not skip out on. 

Prices here vary depending on what you order. But everything is very well excecuted.
