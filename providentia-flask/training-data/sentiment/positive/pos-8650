SOOOOOO PRETTY! 
   Really a gr8 find in Henderson just off the freeway @ the Stephanie exit. 
   All different type of treats, cookies, HUGH macaroons in many assorted flavors, savory scones, sweet scones, tropical flavored delicacies, chocolate desserts! REALLY!!! even sugar free & gluten free options.
    The black & white walls with nicely showcased cakes samples, comfortable chairs, spectacular lighting....as u can tell I 'd the space. 
    Open till midnight PLUS they offer champagne, wine & beer along with coffee, lattes, cappuccinos .
    All the servers which we had were sooo polite, helpful couldn't have been any more pleasant especially the gal who took our order & made our coffees. The ONLY I might recommend would be to serve coffee drinks in actual cups opposed to TO GO cups~ however that is a minor, very minor issue for me.
