Topgolf allows people to make reservations. I suggest you make one online otherwise you will be waiting for an hour. I had a party of 5 with a 4pm reservation and we only waiting 5 mins at the bar. Every single staff member that we encountered was extremely friendly and took very good care of us. We were escorted up to our bay. We were served by our waitress Lauren. We played for a full hour while enjoying food and drinks. The prices are fairly reasonable. Top golf is perfect for a family outing or even a fun date. The environment is very lively and has music playing in the background. You can dress comfortable as the attire is casual.  I highly recommend top golf to anyone that wants to have a good time and try something new. By the way, you do not have to be a pro golfer to have fun.
