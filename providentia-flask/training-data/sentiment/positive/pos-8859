I knew this place because my office was moved to be in the same building complex. With 2-3 years working at that busy office, I became a regular at Sacks with the aim to redeem for free meal from the punched/stamped card.

My favorites are Sacks Mona, Sacks Van Gough, salad with beef steak, pasta with meatballs, and the LARGE fifty-seven cookie.

Although my office was moved to the new location, I continue to stop by Sacks for lunch once in a while. The sandwich and salad taste the same with the same good quality.
