I knew this place would be good.

My mojito was one of the best I've had. I loved the tacos al pastor. In fact I love anything al pastor.

When I heard it was a tequila bar, I assumed there would be tons of latin women in short skirts and loud mariachi musica. No miniskirts tonight. Music was quiet and more classical than I expected. The place is dimly lit, but it looks great.

Not sure whether to consider it a bar with food or a restaurant with excellent drinks.
