Really nice location across from the Hard Rock Hotel and next to CVS. Stopped in for lunch buffet, but I got there too late. I will try it another time.
The restaurant is elegant and has a really good energy about it. Like..the air is so clear inside.
My waitress was super sweet and very attentive.
I had the lamb vindaloo and a side of rice. I ordered it on the spicy side, and it was perfect. Very rich and flavorful. I believe my entree was around 16.99 and the rice is separate.

Stop in sometime if you are a lover of Indian Cuisine, its worth it!
