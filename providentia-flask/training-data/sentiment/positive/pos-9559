I attended a conference at the Marriott for two days and ate lunch here both days a few months ago. As a creature of habit I sat and the bar and ordered the same thing. Tacos and chopped salad. Both were flavorful and fresh. The customer service is great, just enough attentiveness although they are busy. I would return 100x if I lived closer!
