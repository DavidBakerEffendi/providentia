Bluebird Kitchen is tucked away in Market Square and easy to miss. It's a hidden gem, though and a great place for a healthy breakfast or lunch option in downtown. I love stopping by in the mornings for their granola and yogurt. In the afternoon, they have a great selection of fresh veggies, salads, and other lunch options - I love their fresh beets! If you're able to find a bar stool near the window, it's a prime spot for people watching, too! Tasty food to go, in downtown for a great price... that's a win for me!
