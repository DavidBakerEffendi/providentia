I Have visited this location about 3xs since open and out of all the locations (which I have tried) this one has the best customer service. I love the Happy Hour prices. The food is amazing. I tried the shredded pork for the first time every and it was amazing. Of course everyone need to get the onion blossom. It's one of the best I have tried. Great job on adding this location. I don't have to travel 30mins anymore to others locations. I might add I will probably become a regular here.
