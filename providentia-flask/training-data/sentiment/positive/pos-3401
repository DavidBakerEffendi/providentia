I remember walking in here and being really sad it was no longer udon.  The restaurant looks exactly the same feels the same, just with a different menu.  We ordered the gyoza, two tonkatsu ramen, the pork bowl and the takoyaki.  So everything was pretty good for the most part.  The gyoza was nothing special I would not order it again.  The ramen was great we also got the black garlic on the side which was really good.  I liked the rice as well!  It is a solid place with good food and awesome service.  It is just like it's brother over on durango and sister counterparts like monta.  Great place good ramen.  Nothing super special though.  I liked the udon place better.
