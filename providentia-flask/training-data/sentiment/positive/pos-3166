I've been here three times in the past few months and I can honestly say I've never left disappointed! 
I'm normally not the biggest fan of shaved ice but the bingsu here is very milky- it's in a whole other category of "shaved ice". I'd say the texture and taste is very similar to ice cream except it's lighter without compromising the flavour. I've gotten the green tea and the nut one and they're both amazing! 
The atmosphere is great. It's very cozy with comfortable seating. They've really done their best to make it "insta worthy" with a cherry blossom tree on one side of the restaurant and an aesthetic shrubbery wall on the other.
