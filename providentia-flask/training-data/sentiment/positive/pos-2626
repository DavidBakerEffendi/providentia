One of the best breakfasts in the Toronto core area!

Their food is absolutely fantastic and flavored to perfection. I've never had a bad meal from them, and their home fries are the BEST (it's a must have)! The servers are very nice and efficient, which is great for those faster mornings.

The area is in a great location, right across from the ROM and U of T, and 2 stations subway ride away from eaton center, making this an ideal breakfast place as part of a weekend outing to Downtown Toronto. 

The decor is very homey and classic, yet clean, and you can always smell the eggs and bacon coming from the back!
