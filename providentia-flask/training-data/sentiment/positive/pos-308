The Yalla Special was a sort of Lebanese poutine where there are fries topped with chicken sharwarma, garlic sauce, and tahini sauce.  It was a large portion and definitely something you want to share with a friend or two!  I loved the garlic and tahini sauce and how thick and creamy it was.  The chunks of chicken sharwarma within the fries made this dish very filling too.

The BBQ Chicken Wings were three pieces of whole marinated BBQ wings.  Now these might seem like normal BBQ wings to you, but these chicken wings were so tender and juicy.  I really liked how the meat was so tender and the marination was just right.  It also came with a small serving of sauce that I really liked.
