I'm a little biased since I was part of the opening team, but Ncounter has continued to provide awesome service and dangerously delicious food for years now. It's a tough spot being right by the light rail and on Mill Ave., yet the service is always consistent. They've continued to expand as much as possible to accommodate more guests, too. And did I mention the food was to die for??
