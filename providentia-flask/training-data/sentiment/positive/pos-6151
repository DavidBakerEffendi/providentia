We tried this for the first time today and now I am hooked! OMG it was so gosh darn yummy!

Pu Pu Plater
Egg roll crispy with a hint of cinnamon 
Beef strip okay no flavor kinda dry
Rib was meaty with a light flavorful BBQ sauce
Wonton was fluffy and light pork was not hard and condensed best I have had
Crab puff was no puff very sad

Soup was fantastic very light savory flavor. Veggies perfectly cooked not soggy or slimy. Cabbage, shrimp, wonton

Sweet sour chicken. Sauce came on the side. Was crunchy and had Real chicken in it.  Was not a ball of batter. More chicken then batter.  

Shrimp and veggies. Veggies were amazing. The snow peas and celery had some crunch and the broccoli was not crunchy and not soggy just the way unlike it. Shrimp good. Sauce was packed with flavor and not over powering I could have licked the bowl... If I could have finished the HUGE portion! 

Orange chicken. Wow! This was not a ball of battered chicken in a mushy mess of sauce like many places.  It was thinly sliced chicken with a slight crunch. Sauce was not spicy but had wonderful flavor. 

We ordered a side of soft noodles for my toddler and he loved them. 

Take out only took 15 minutes and we ordered ahead on the phone

Nicely packaged nothing leaked from the take out container.
