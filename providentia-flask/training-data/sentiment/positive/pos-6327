My wife and I stopped by on a Wed night before the Hornets game for pizza and garlic knots.  Both did not disappoint. After reading other Yelp reviews, we decided to try the Mushroom pizza. It was delivered promptly after about 10 minutes.  Great crust and great flavor.  The garlic knots and marinara for dipping were some of the best we've had. Realized I forgot to ask for the honey to dip my crust in, and went back to the counter to retrieve the cinnamon honey. We spread the honey on our crust and it was like eating cinnamon toast for desert. A nice, sweet ending to a great meal. The evening would have been perfect if the Hornets won, but that's another story.  My only objection was no fountain drinks, just a limited selection of 12 oz cans.  No Coke Zero?
