Sals has amazing pizza, service, and atmosphere. They had a speciality pie this weekend that included smoked white fish, Gouda, and apples. While it sounds strange, it came together beautifully! Our waiter was amazing, timely, and attentive. I hands down think this is the best pizza place in Madison. This is a must have!!
