I didn't think I'd like this place by reading all the mixed reviews.   But I am very happy that I went in.  My son who has become a very picky eater was already upset  when we walked into the establishment.   He wanted American food and  wore a frown on his face.  We got a very mild tofu soup for him.  Ordered the Meat Jun,  bbq chicken and Panjeon  too.  We were amazed to see how much banchan was served.  Most places serve 4, but we had 8, and they were all delicious.  My son's face lit up when he saw the potato banchan.  I gave him some chicken and Meat Jun.  He didn't care to eat his tofu soup.  He was all over that Meat Jun.  My son doesn't really care for Korean food but that Meat Jun won his heart.  My husband is now a big fan too.  We found out the server is from Hawaii, and that was a big plus too.  He served us with that big Aloha spirit.  We will certainly dine here again.
