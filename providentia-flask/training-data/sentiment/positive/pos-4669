Went to Morning Glory Cafe for brunch and then grabbed sandwiches to go. It's a bit pricey but considering it's organic and local it's a good value. Get the BLTDA, you will NOT be disappointed. I never would have put dates on a sandwich (much less a BLT) but OH. MY. GOD. They add this amazing creaminess with just a hint of sweetness. 
The picnic tables are lovely! This is a great date spot but is also perfect for families and friends! Oh, and if you go on a Saturday, stop by the crepe truck and get the bread pudding. To die for.
