I love this place for brunch 

Great patio and service  

Fun presentation 

Fresh squeezed juice for mimosas

They have great bloody Mary's 

Chocolate bacon is a fun treat. 

We went there one time and our son asked for no onions. The waitress noticed his omelette had onions and brought us a gift certificate for next time 

The portions are huge but the food is he great. They have fruit on a skewer and the pineapple is always sweet 

If you come on a Sunday head over early you will have a wait. It's worth it but a wait :)
