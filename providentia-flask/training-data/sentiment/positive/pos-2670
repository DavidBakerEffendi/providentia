Gosh how I wish Yelp would add one more button next to Useful.. Funny.. Cool... how about SLAPPP?? 

If you gave this place 3 stars or under... I really question you... what exactly do you expect in a buffet or restaurant? Sex under the table? Massages as you eat? Keno while you eat? I mean REALLY?? 

Whatever the line is, it is worth it... be social you are in Vegas, hang out talk to others from around the globe, watch the dealer tables nearby with people playing War... I thought that was only on Vegas Vacation until I saw it live and up close... 

Dress? No not to impress... but rather to come wobbling out... rolling like a ball, wobbling like a penguin, etc. Leave the belt at home guys... And girls if you pick one day to eat while you are on vacation make this be the day! 

Waiters and bartenders, you spoiled me completely... 

The selection of food is something I would have never envisioned... I walked around for a while looking for something they didn't have that I would want and NEGATIVE... 

King crab legs on steroids, PIZZA (all different types drool worthy), pastas of all sorts and sauces, sushi, meats, cheeses, salmon, shrimp, clams... EVERYTHING and ANYTHING. And there is no room for disappointment... 

Price is perfect... And if you are contemplating this buffet or the Wynn go for this one hands down...
