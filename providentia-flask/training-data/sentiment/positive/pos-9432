This changes everything! They have an unbelievable menu here. My wife and I had  crepe items and both were excellent. The variety of crepe dishes and pancakes is the broadest I have seen. Atmosphere is typical Scottsdaleish. The service is better than it needs to be (don't need quite that much attention).

Portions are significant and prices are fair. The big question for us is whether it is worth the drive from Gilbert. Yes, it is!
