I've been here several times and have had the opportunity to chat with Lydiah at various social and political events around the city. She's such an amazing person and chef! It saddens me that she will be closing her doors on March 16th. Through no fault of her; the owner of her building is selling so that Bank of America can set up ATMs. Also saddens me I didn't take the time to write a review sooner. 
The food is so beyond fantastic. The flavors pop with every bit and make my mouth salivate!
Thursday is typically my favorite, goto day because I love her curry spaghetti and green beans so very much. Obviously that is the Thursday special.
Going to visit as many times as possible before the 16th and here's to hoping she continues at a new location!
