What a place; from the spinning records, to the amazing location, Analog is a cafe I see myself frequenting. The selection is your essential coffee drink varieties, but their baked goodies and sammies looked pretty scrumptious. There were some lone hottie patrons on their laptops, old friends catching up, and trendy couples, mostly, who occupied the space.The whole vibe was very relaxed, although well-kept. Analog is proof that simplicity and quality is key :)
