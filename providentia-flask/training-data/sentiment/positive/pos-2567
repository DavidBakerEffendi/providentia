The food was incredible! The opening bread basket was warm and well made. We were treated with an amazing Caesar salad compliments of the chef. I ordered the New York sirloin and my friend had the Bone in Rib Eye. Not only were they cooked perfectly but also well seasoned and complimented well with Au Jus gravy. The lobster mac and cheese was very rich and not too thick. The loaded baked potato was tasty as well. I was extremely impressed with the service we received. Marco was our waiter and he was very knowledgeable on quality liquor and fine dining. If you're looking for a quality steak restaurant hands down this is the place to go!
