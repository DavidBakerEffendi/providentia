I LOVED this place so much! I was worried, because several reviews mentioned the food being not wonderful, so I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was. (nota bene: I had the chicken - great, my partner had the filet - great, but my daughter did have the pasta and it wasn't as great). Our server was Dave, who was just as fabulous as other reviews mentioned. I am hard-of-hearing, and also wasn't sure how it would go as I typically lip-read, but Dave was great about speaking very close to my hear so I could understand. I feel like this is a must-do for everyone once. I found eating in the dark not as difficult as I expected, but it was surreal how I kept expecting my eyes to adjust (spoiler: they didn't). I think if I went back, I would get the main and appetizer, instead of main and dessert. I was worried about the "surprise" aspect of the appetizer, but I think I'm ready for that now! It was a little expensive, but with the exchange rate for USD, tax and tip had me about $100 for three people. If you're hesitant, I encourage you to try and open your mind for this unique experience.
