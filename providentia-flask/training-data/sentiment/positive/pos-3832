I'm so glad that I hadn't read the reviews prior to my lunch here. I understand that we probably went at an odd hour, 2pm, but there was no wait at all. We sat outside and it was beautiful. The server was nice, attentive, and we felt like we were her guests at home. 

The menu has a great variety but not enough to be overwhelming. I got the egg salad sandwich with fries, my bf got the steak sandwich with fries. The food was delivered fast. Seriously it was about 15 min at most and the food was fresh as can be.  The fries were enough reason to return...crispy perfection seasoned and thick. Our sandwiches were perfect. I thought to myself now this is something I can feel myself craving again. 

Great prices, about $22 total for both and we left stuffed. 

It was tricky to find but it's right by the perch but off to the back side. Enter from Oregon street and walk in thru the gate...it will be on your right. 

Going back again soon!
