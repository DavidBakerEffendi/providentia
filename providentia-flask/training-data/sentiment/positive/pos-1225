The best tip I can give you: pay an extra $20 and skip the entire line. We would have waited well over an hour but were seated in less than 5 minutes.

Another great tip: bottomless mimosas (which is mimosas, bloody Mary's, sangria, and margaritas) is only $15. The waitstaff was very good about keeping your drinks full.

Now on to the food. Brunch includes a large variety of breakfast items, fruit, pasta, pastries, crab legs, seafood, meat, and dessert. I was very happy and full.
