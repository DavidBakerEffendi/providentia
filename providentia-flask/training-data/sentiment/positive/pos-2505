Great new sandwich joint on the Coxwell and O'Connor strip! 

Came here for dinner with my partner on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant is casual, has a fair number of tables and seats for individuals or small groups, with a few bar stools by the window.  A large wall menu is on the right as soon as you walk in and you order/pay first and then sit down for your food to arrive.

I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which was delicious, crunchy from the slaw and crispy chicken, and very flavourful. My partner ordered the beef brisket sandwich which was also flavourful. Both were $9.50 each, which is comparable to other burger/sandwich places. We also ordered fries and onion rings on the side which were crispy and delicious with their Sriracha ketchup! Salads are also available on their menu.

I'd definitely come back whenever I'm in the area again to try their poutine and other sandwiches!
