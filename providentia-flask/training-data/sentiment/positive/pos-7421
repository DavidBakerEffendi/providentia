If you love seafood and want to eat it to your hearts content... THIS is the place to go!! Dinner only here, from 330-930pm and it's $40 with your players card and $45 without one. TOTALLY worth it!! Other buffets will usually ONLY have crab legs, and cold ones in fact. Here, you can get cold, warm, and seasoned crab legs! Also, what other buffet will have lobster tails at an all you can eat?!? I seriously had a whole plateful!! They also have the biggest shrimp I have ever seen at a buffet!! 

They have all different types of seafood... hot, cold, and in different flavors: american, asian, etc. I tried them all, except the cold. I'll admit, the crab legs were a bit dry... but I loaded up on lobster tail, which I'm sure was more then $40 worth. 

I did this place as a last stop on my buffet of buffets gluttony quest... for a $10 add-on, I think this place is way MORE worth it as an add-on compared to the Caesar's buffet add-on cost! 

This place totally hit the seafood craving that I was having! I can't believe I have not eaten here in such a long time!! I will definitely be back here!! Service was awesome!! Our waiter was friendly, quick, and cleared our plates/refilled our drinks BEFORE even ever asking!! He was very attentive and our table was always clean... even if we only had one plate!

I will be back to conquer this seafood feast again next time!!
