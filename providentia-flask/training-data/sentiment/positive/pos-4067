I've reviewed Gandhi Roti before and they really are the same quality. The butter chicken is just incredible (note I don't usually order butter chicken at a regular Indian restuarant but in a roti and when they deliver some spice it is perfection).

We usually call ahead and it's ready when we get there (approx 20min). The samosas are probably the best I've had in the city (on par with Trimurti) and I love the tamarind sauce they serve alongside. 

Last time my husband ordered his usual chicken vindaloo (delicious) but also tacked on a chicken biryani for us to try and have for leftovers. He is a biryani aficionado and thought this was the best he's ever had. It came with a strange yogurt sauce (perhaps their version of raita?) but we didn't like it at all. Luckily the biryani was fantastic on it's own.

*Note: I don't think Gandhi offers biryani

Final verdict: with Gandhi or Mother India you can't go wrong
