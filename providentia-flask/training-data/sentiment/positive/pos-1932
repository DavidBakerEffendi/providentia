Ordered food to pick up and what a cute little restaurant, definitely not busy during the time I came but it was a super clean facility. Not many places have it, it's not even a hole in the wall, there was more tables and I love how the kitchen doesn't even look like a kitchen! The gentleman that helped me was nice as well as the other ones that were serving food. I think I will come back and dine in! But the food is superb! Wonton soup isn't too salty and definitely not bland, just right! And the fried rice is amazing with tofu with a medium kick to it! I gotta say this might be my new favorite Thai place!
