Really fun atmosphere sitting on the "Brooklyn Bridge."
The drink prices are a little high, but not unusual on the strip.

The food was outstanding. I had the frog legs, which was a huge serving. Our server suggested trying a half and half order, where half were regular and half spicy.  Both were really good, but honestly I preferred the spicy.

I also highly recommend on the drink menu that you try the cactus ass kick.
