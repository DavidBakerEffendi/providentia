I've only been here once, and we showed up in the middle of a snowstorm right before they closed (about 45 mins). But the staff was great. They answered our questions, gave us an informational background on the wall art; and most importantly, the food was killer! It's a bit pricey, but for the quality of food we got, it was worth it.
