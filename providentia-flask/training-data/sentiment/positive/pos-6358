I decided to try 800 degrees because I spotted the huge Nutella dessert poster posted on the wall. As delicious as it appeared is as delicious as it was! I ordered the Nutella calzone which comes with strawberries berries and of course NUTELLA. So delicious definetly not for one person or two or maybe even 3 unless u want to be border line diabetic but so worth it!
