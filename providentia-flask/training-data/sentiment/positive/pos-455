I'll get this out of the way first. I did not love the carbonara sauce. It just wasn't the creamy carbonara I was expecting. But after evaluating the quality of the meal overall, I'm happy to give up the five stars.

Pasta Fresh is aptly named. Their open kitchen design allows you to watch everything that goes on and you can see the owner and chef rolling your pasta, well, fresh. The basis of their menu appears to be the build-your-own pasta deal. Pick your pasta, a sauce, a cheese, and your toppings. For my first time, I decided to go that route.

You don't see pappardelle on menus too often, so I went with that along with the carbonara (sauce), bocconcini (cheese), and spinach and roasted garlic (toppings). The pappardelle was incredible. It definitely made a difference that it was made fresh. In a way, having a lighter sauce helped me fully appreciate the delicate nature of the pasta.

I also tried my friends' dishes. One had spinach ravioli in marinara sauce with zucchini and mushrooms. The other had rigatoni in pesto sauce. Both were tasty, but I especially enjoyed the marinara sauce. I ended up getting some pappardelle with marinara sauce to go for the girlfriend.

With fresh pasta and fresh ingredients, you get a gourmet meal at reasonable prices. A good deal is the meal for two. For $19.99, you get two build-your-own pasta bowls and a choice of macarons or garlic knots. We got to try both and they get the thumbs up from me. As someone who doesn't even like macarons, it says a lot that I loved their salted caramel.

EDIT: Now that I've gobbled up my leftovers from last night (the word pappardelle comes from pappare which means to gobble up), Pasta Fresh most definitely deserves five stars. I'm still reeling from the absolute deliciousness.
