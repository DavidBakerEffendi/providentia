Loooooved it loved it loved it. Is it the best pizza in the United States? I don't know but it's pretty damn good. We went on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 7 guys and ordered all of the pizzas and two pastas as well as house white wine - brilliant. The bread is also amazing. My favorite was the Rosa with pistachios followed by the Wiseguy. The pastas - all homemade were excellent too.
