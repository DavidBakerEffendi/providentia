Either I am just easy to please or have been getting damn lucky on the places I have been spending my money at. Anyhoo, I went to Maizie's last night for $3 burger night, best 3 bucks I have ever spent on a burger! First off though when we got there it seemed like we would have a bit of a wait, not so! Waited less than 10 minutes which was awesome because I was starving. For an appetizer ordered the buffalo wing dip, so freaking delish I could have eaten another! I had bacon and pepper jack cheese added to my burger but it was so filling I could only eat half. My breakfast this morning, the other half! Tastes great heated up too. For my taste beverage I had lemonade which was perfect, not to sweet, not to sour. The staff was attentive and the people watching was great. This wasn't my first time at Maizie's and it won't be my last either.
