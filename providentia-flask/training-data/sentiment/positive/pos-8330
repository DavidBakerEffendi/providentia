12/31/17 Update- Virginia is still the best. So happy we live in the neighborhood and have a bar like this. 

We *love* this divey bar! It's actually not that divey at all. They have plenty of table space and a really delicious menu! We always sit in Virginia's section. She's been here forever and knows how to serve in a bar. They have tons of TVs and always play the games you want to see. And Off Track Horse Racing? They've got that too! Go Horsey Go! Their happy hour is awesome and I'm Sunday too! Regardless of if its a game day. Just go check them out.
