the place is small. Sometimes full of smoke and definitely not fancy at all... Its actually not very appealing being on the corner of sahara and boulder near all the dealerships....but if your looking for great comfort food like meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Pot roast. Chicken fried steak etc... This is the place !!! They have great specials everyday for about $6 u get a huge meal that includes salad or soup. I suggest the soup...love their clam chowder!!!!    The staff is nice... 
Quick tip... During lunch it gets packed!!! So be prepared to stand and wait or go at an off time.  

Only cash is accepted but they do have an atm there.
