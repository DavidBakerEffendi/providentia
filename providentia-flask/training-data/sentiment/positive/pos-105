I went here completely skeptical. I know what put put is.. and I do not accept golf. The onyl reason I went was because out friend hosted his birthday here.
Needless to say.. IM HOOKED. 

This placce was a lot of fun, it made golf entertaining for everyone and it has a nice lively feel. Modern music, lights, good food and drinks. Great atmosphere. Love it!
