So EXCITED this opened up here. When we were going to South Scottsdale more often we went to Tottie's all the time. Absolutely love it! But life changed and we haven't found ourselves in the area very often as we live in North Scottsdale.  I also love that this new location is designed to be able to stop in quickly to pickup. Love the food, everyone should try it!
