I might only go a 3-4 if I were in NY but considering were in North Scottsdale this is as good as were going to get and I don't mean that in a bad way.  The owner is very nice and friendly, the decor is nice and modern but not overdone.  It has a good vibe to it and the food is great, especially for the price.  If you are regular of FLO's or Tealight Cafe (the only two decent Asian food up north) then this place should be #3 on your list.  Fast, clean, friendly, and good food.  I have tried other area Thai food and generally the cleanliness of the store and service overshadowed decent food.  This hits all the major marks.  Try them out.
