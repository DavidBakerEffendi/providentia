This is far and away my favorite place for breakfast/lunch in the city. I haven't met a crepe I didn't like. The atmosphere is cozy, which also means it can fill up fast. For two people, I've never had a wait longer than 15-20 minutes. They have an awesome coffee and tea selection as well. Def a must visit for anyone!
