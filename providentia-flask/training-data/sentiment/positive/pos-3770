I'm so obsessed! Such a simple concept, but so wonderful! I fully realize I could make these sandwiches at home, but seriously, who wants to fuss when you can get a warm toasted PB&J. 

But this isn't just PB&J. The menu is massive with every combo imaginable. You can get chocolate, nutella, fluff, banana's, cookie butter (YAS) and more. Plus, they have a cute "sushi roll" section where they roll the bread and cut it like sushi. Cute for kids (and adults of course).

I've had a couple of the sandwiches and of course I like all the dessert type ones. Just add fluff and I'm all set. The cookie butter sandwich with raison toast is beyond incredible. They also give you animal cookies or chips with your meal. You can't beat a $5 or below lunch either. 

I highly recommend a stop in here soon, you'll be smacking your lips with PB&J goodness, I promise!
