This burger place was really good. I had the number #1 combo(no drink included) for $5.99 which is a pretty reasonable price. Burger was pretty good size,  i dont think theres a need for double or bigger than the Big One. I added bacon and I appreciate its in round shape so it covers more bites than strip bacon. Fries were good as well. Onion rings could be skipped nothing special. We also ordered a side of chili i would skip it too. 

If you know Anthony Bourdains top 3 burger joint in the word named Sams in San Fran then you could compare the flavors and feel. This reminded me of that place. I highly recommend it.
