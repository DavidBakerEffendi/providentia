Absolutely thrilled about this place. I waited until I had eaten here a couple times to review since they are very new and I honestly didn't have to. All of my visits here have been five star worthy. This place has everything I wanted and needed close to home. 

Let's start with the atmosphere. Beautifully decorated, every object in this restaurant seems curated. You'll wish your home was decorated identically to Bottiglia. And don't even get me started on the patio. My goodness. It's like being in an extremely elegant backyard. There are potted plants galore (as an avid plant lover, I'm a bit biased here), misters, a fire pit, lounge seating... I can keep going. I could LIVE on that patio. 

I see some yelpers may have had bad service... I have been multiple times and service has never lacked. My first visit was in the first week of opening and things were a little slower, however, I wasn't in a rush. Dinner is meant to be enjoyed, and why would you want to rush out of a place as pleasant as this? Servers are happy to offer suggestions, rush to get your happy hour orders in, and are overall very friendly. The restaurant is managed very well, and everyone seems to deeply care for the restaurant and the experience each customer has. 

The food... THE FOOD. Now, this is NOT traditional Italian. If that is what you are expecting, do not get your hopes up. The food is based in Italian food, for sure, but it more modern, fancier, and has interesting non-traditional combinations than you would see in homemade classic Italian food. Very surprising, delicious, adventurous combinations, that if you get your head in the right place, you will enjoy immensely! 

My favorite things on the menu: 

Zucchini Flowers (IN LOVE)
Short Rib with dumplings
Carbonara Mac & Cheese
Arancini 

Give this place a shot, especially if you are a local. You never know, it could become a new favorite spot! It is for us!
