Don't think that this little cafe just has Tammie Coe's fabulous cupcakes and beautiful fondant cakes...because you'd be missing out on other great stuff!  I needed coffee this morning and decided that a soy latte with honey was what I wanted.  Tammie Coe's has honey sweetener in a pump to add myself, thank you.  My kiddo had 1/2 a s'mores scone which is a ridiculous breakfast item, I know.  So we also ordered a pb&j on multi-grain.  Delicious multi-grain bread with seeded crust!  I should have requested light on the jelly but otherwise this was a really tasty and kid friendly choice.  I also brought home a caprese salad for later since it looked like fresh mozz and really fresh looking tomatoes.  The staff is friendly and I truly prefer this Illy coffee over that other big chain with the green logo ;-)
