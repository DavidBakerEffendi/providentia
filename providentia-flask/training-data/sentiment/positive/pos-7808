Great atmosphere and good food. The staff us great, friendly and attentive. Pricing is very reasonable too. The GM Ryan is fantastic and takes great care of the customers. It's good to see when he walks around and interacts with the customers and they all know him. Definitely one of the best wine & food bars in the valley.
