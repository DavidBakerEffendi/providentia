Ahhhh, brings back memories of cozy coffee houses in Cali (California) where you can kick back and relax. The reno is finally done! Caffeine has the place all to themselves; they no longer have to share the space with a convenience store. 

They have many seating options depending on your mood: window seating to people watch, cozy couches beside a faux fireplace to relax with a book, study tables to do work and cushy chairs to just hang out. 

Delicious and affordable food and drink options with flexibility for substitutions and additions. Stellar customer service by the personable co-owners, Justin and Sophia. Encounter a problem? Let them know and they'll do their best to rectify it. If you love coffee houses that also serve up delicious affordable food, you owe it to yourself to come by.
