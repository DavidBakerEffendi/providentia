I haven't been since I was a child so today I ventured over here and what a great decision it was. I sat down and Richie came over to serve me. Very friendly. I ordered an appetizer, the Redneck Egg Rolls. They were fantastic! Richie said he eats them every other day, I believe it because they are great! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. Everything was perfect. I will return for sure
