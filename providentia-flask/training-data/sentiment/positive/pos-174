Deep within a pecan grove, is a small organic farm that has a small cafe. which prepares its food with using the organic vegetables and herbs.  

It is an anomaly and is always popular for those who want to get away from suburban sprawl.  

It is a little pricey for breakfast, but it is worth the splurge.
