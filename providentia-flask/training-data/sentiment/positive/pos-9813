I would rate this as close as Bellagio and Caesars. It might be a half more point for a popular club called Tao and the outdoor gondola and shops. I like the David and Goliath store they have. I made my friend Jim stand next to Mark. I pulled out the shirt that says "He's GAY" with an arrow pointing to the right and put in on him and the girls at the place laugh. It was just or almost as funny as  Eric W putting on the pajamas in Target. 

Overall, lots of nice things to see here. I played some slot machines and won a few bucks. The weekend goal was to gamble at every casino on the strip and have at least one drink.
