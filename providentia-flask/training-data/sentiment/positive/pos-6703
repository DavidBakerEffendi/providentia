Okay we already know In-N-Out is amazing. Their burgers are the best. If you haven't tried them and live out west, I don't know what rock you've been under!
Anyway, so far every In-N-Out I've eaten at, the food has been consistently great. I'm writing this review for the efficiency and friendliness of this recently opened location. 
My kids wanted In-N-Out for lunch and once I saw the length of the drive through line I almost told them no but how could I let those adorable faces down? The line moved so quickly I couldn't believe it. And the 2 workers I encountered in the drive through were so friendly and just went out of there way to make it a great experience. Our order was perfectly accurate as well. 
So glad we have a location in Summerlin now!
