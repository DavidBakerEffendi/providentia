Caf√© Tranquilo is my go-to neighborhood brunch spot. Great service and trendy ambiance.

The Green Chili Chiliquiles paired with a Bloody Mary is my recommendation. I have also had the yogurt bowl, delicious on a hot Phoenix morning. Either way, can't go wrong with anything they have to offer on the menu!
