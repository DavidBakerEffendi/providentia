I go to two locations for It's A Grind, I like it the same. I do like this franchise better than Starbucks. It's A Grind's blended drinks have catchy names, tasty as well, such as the campfire chill, or the famous mocha mint. I feel like this is a chill coffee place, the people who work here are always down to earth. I like going to a place with good vibes, service, and good food/ drinks.
