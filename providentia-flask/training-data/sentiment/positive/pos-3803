I must say, myself and my girlfriend were lucky. We got in to this place before the lunch rush hour started. Our seats were great and the service was prompt. The decor was nice and the ambience made the area for a nice conversation.

The price was average, but the food was cooked to perfection. The calamari was amazing to start. It had the perfect crunch and the sauce was a great complimentary flavor. My girlfriend got her favorite BLT bacon sandwich and it was juicy, flavorful and presented really well. Myself, I got the PB blue burger with fries. It was delicious cooked perfectly and was very filling. 

Our server always made sure we had everything we required ie; water and napkins.

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone. I've had a great experience and would like to try their chicken and waffles next time I go.
