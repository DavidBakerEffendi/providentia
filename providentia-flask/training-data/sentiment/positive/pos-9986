I can't stop thinking about the great experience I had here yesterday! I forgot to eat breakfast and had some extra time so I stopped in. I had never been to this location before but when I walked in a whole group of employees greeted me with Hi and Welcome like they knew me! It was so sweet. And the ordering was a very pleasant experience! Then when they brought me my food they gave me a free cookie! They were all so kind and friendly and smiley! I loved my experience here!!
