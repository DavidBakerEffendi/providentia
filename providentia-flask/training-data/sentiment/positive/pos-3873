Oh the lovely Keg, so many options and locations. 

Venue is dark, just the way I like it. I don't appreciate really lite up restaurants. 

Dinner Order: 

They started us off with the Baked Bread and Butter, warm and toasty!

Bottle of Pinot Noir - Village Reserve ($69) It's a very light body, tasty wine and I normally hate red wine, this one might be my new fave red to drink if I ever drink red again) 

Filet Mignon 10oz ($39) 
Tenderloin wrapped in applewood smoked bacon and served with Bernaise. 

Pistachio Crusted Salmon ($30)
Served on garlic mashed potato, bacon saut√©ed Brussels sprouts, and maple butter.

Very filling, there was no room for dessert!
