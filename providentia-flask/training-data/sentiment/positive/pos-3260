Who doesn't love fountain shows? I see this every time i drive along Las Vegas Blvd. It's breathtaking and romantic, especially the last time we have seen it at night. My husband booked a dinner date at the Eiffel restaurant at Paris hotel. We are sitting by the window and it was Valentine's Day. I thought he is going to propose once again.  
This fountain reminds me that simple things can bring so much joy, it's like bringing back the inner child in me!
