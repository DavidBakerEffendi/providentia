Co-worker of mine told me about this hidden treasure and I decided to give it a try. It is located not in the best place in town but location doesn't matter for me because I went there for authentic Mexican food. The place was packed during lunch with families and blue collar workers. That should give you a clue that its the spot. 

We ordered Green Chilli, Tacos and Quesedila to split three ways. Green Chili was amazing, tacos and  quesedila were good. Overall I had great experience and I can't wait to go back there.
