I have come in here several times. Every time i like it. The portions are huge and this last time i was here my girlfriend taught me how to use chopstcks. Now i am really good. I am a fast learner!! Hehe                   Anyway, many good meals ,all freshly prepared. Nice and clean, and the bathrooms. Very relaxed in here, but really good quaility food. Tons of parking in the lot..Always very quick service as well.
