Probably the best lunch in Uptown. This place is the real deal. Reminds me of the halal carts in NYC, and their food is just as good, if not better. The lamb and chicken over rice is delicious. The gyro and chicken pitas are amazing as well.  Make sure you try the yogurt sauce and the hot sauce they offer. They're usually pretty busy during lunch hours, but it's worth the wait. Only negative is they only accept cash.
