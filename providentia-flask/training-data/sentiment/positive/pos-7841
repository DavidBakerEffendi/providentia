So many choices here, such delicious Hawaiian style food! And, some Asian/Indian dishes (curry, teriyaki, etc.).  

We had gone here a few times many, many years ago when it was owned by another group.  

This staff said they have been there about 3 years.  I am sad I hadn't gone there in that time because it is so delicious, fast preparation, and very good fountain prices $1.39 small, $1.59 large with free refills).  

I had the Bento box with their recommended 3 meats (got katsu, teriyaki chicken, and smoked pork).  It was all so good. the katsu batter so light and tasty, perfect. The smoked pork, so tender and juicy.  The teriyaki chicken, sauce just perfect. 

The macaroni salad that comes with it was great, not overly mayonnaise'd.  The rice, cooked perfectly, not hard, not mushy.

They also have boba!

Went with 3 other people and we all prefer different things as our favorites, but each of us loved this place! We will return, many many times in the future!

So great.
