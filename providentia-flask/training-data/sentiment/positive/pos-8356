this'll be a lackluster review, but what can I say about one of the most popular sandwich chains?  Their breakfast deals are one of the best, and I wish they had a drive-thru here to make it more accessible. A flat bread sandwich and a coffee or drink for $3 is something that can't be beat.  Get it!
