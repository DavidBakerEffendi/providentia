So happy that there is a great Indian restaurant  that recently opened up in the neighborhood.  I love Indian food and this place more than satisfies the craving.  This is my third time there and the vegetable pakora, shrimp biryani, lamb curry, chicken tandoori, and pistachio desert was delicious.  The atmosphere is clean and classy.  Excellent service.  I hope more people find this place because it's awesome
