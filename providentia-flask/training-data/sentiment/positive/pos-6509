I love this place, it's definitely my favorite restaurant! The staff is always friendly, the food is always fantastic, and they have AMAZING pastries that even my non gluten free friends love. I haven't disliked anything I've tried (but the chicken and waffles are a strong favorite). It can get VERY busy at times, but think about it - how many restaurants are completely gluten free? Not many, at least not that I've found. In any case, give this place a try!
