I will certainly NOT be the one to break the local 5 star love for this place. Part of a small group of similarly named bakeries across the GTA, Molisana has all the key points of a traditional Italian Bakery nailed down, and they do it great!

Baked Goods - I was having a tough time finding Zeppole before the end of season, many places were either sold out OR not making it anymore. I called Molisana and they whipped up a half dozen special. I was thrilled with this extra effort AND with how delicious they were!

In addition, and as Stephanie S mentioned, they also have a full selection of Italian buns and various cakes and desserts

Grocery - Looking for Italian specific items? They've got them in spades, whether it be a certain brand of canned tomatoes from the 'old country' or a pack of Briscola playing cards, simply ask and ye shall receive.

Hot Table (Aka Tavola Calda) - Madonna Mia!!! So many delicious items on their lunch time hot table, including all the staples (meatballs, veal, soup, pasta, etc) but what really put them over the top IMO was the array of freshly made pizzas they had on hand. Each slice is thick with toppings and even when warmed up the dough has an almost sweet characteristic which takes me back to my childhood when the Nonni (Italian grandparents/uncles and aunts) would make the pizza - old school.

Best of all you don't need to eat and run, they've got ample seating here so you can enjoy you lunch, pastry, espresso, etc before you leave.

Eatcrest Out!
