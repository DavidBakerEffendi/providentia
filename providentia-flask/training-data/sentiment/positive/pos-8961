Saritas is my new favorite spot in Lakewood. They have great appetizers (the jerk chicken wings are my favorite). They also have amazing cocktails. They change out their menu periodically - was disappointed they took the blueberry mule off the drink menu, but I found another great cocktail the purple haze :-) The servers are tentative and friendly. Great atmosphere and all around a great dinner spot.
