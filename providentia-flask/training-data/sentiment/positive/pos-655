201 Central is my new go to for buying wine and craft beer! Friday afforded us free samples of wine and seasonal craft beer at Oktoberfest. $3 beers in the store made for a much more enjoyable shopping experience. There were about 8 craft beers to try in addition to an Alamos wine selection tasting.

This is an excellent place for beer and wine lovers alike. The wine selection gives you more than your traditional grocery store wine varieties. With most wine being purchased at grocery stores, the benefit of a place like 201 central is in its variety. This place is reasonably priced, and definitely has more than just wine and beer, but is by no means flooded with food.

I was surprised at the amount of people in 201 just enjoying the evening; and again, this was my first experience so I was unfamiliar with what is typical here. I really enjoyed the craft beer tasting and ended up taking one of the cases home. The seasonal Doghead Punkin was delicious as well as the Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest. I love seasonal beer, and 'Tis the Season!
