Been to Gold Spike several times last night was the first time we ate there.I've found it had to find Vegan food options in Vegas and was surprised to see several on their menu.  The portabella sandwich was so yummy!  All of my friends that ate as well were super happy with there food.  They also have a huge collection of hot sauces which my man was stoked to try.  Looking forward to eating there again soon!  Thanks Gold Spike Grill
