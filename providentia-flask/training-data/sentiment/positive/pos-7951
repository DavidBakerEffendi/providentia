Absolutely wonderful!  I had been eyeing this one for a long time, finally made it over this past weekend.  Well worth the wait!

Very nice ambiance inside, very comfortable but cozy.  Kind of a shabby chic vibe, kind of modern/hipster, but nicely balanced.  Our server was Scott and I can't say enough good things about him.  He was attentive, kind, knowledgeable, funny, you-name-it.  We got there early and so we were the first ones seated in the large dining room (we're old, we eat early); he came over and greeted us, got our drinks going, explained a bunch about the place since I mentioned it was our first time.  We felt very welcomed and it was great!  

I ordered the Mary's Brick Chicken which comes with a small portion of mac'n'cheese and kale.  The whole thing was perfection.  I've never had a more tender chicken and it's my favorite meat so I eat it a lot.  I'm usually very blah on mac'n'cheese but this one is so flavorful, we're definitely going to have to go back for more.  It has a slight kick to it but I'm a total spice-wimp, it's really very slight.  Loved, loved, love it!  Husband ordered the charred filet mignon which came with a couple of sides as well.  He also loved everything.  Filet was as tender as it should be and cooked exactly as it should be.  The veggies were delicious.  

The sides that come with the "Plates" are very small so if you are very hungry or tend to have a big appetite, you'll want to order an additional side.  I hate large meals so it was great for me!  

We ended up having room for the "brookie" which is a brownie with a cookie on top of it, topped with salted caramel ice cream.  It was fantastic - except for the one issue I run into with every a la mode dessert I order: not enough ice cream!!! I want to have enough ice cream for some in every bite of the brownie/cookie and that didn't happen.  The ice cream was the best part too!  

Overall, highly recommend and we will be going back soon!
