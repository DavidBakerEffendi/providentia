Great experience for my first time at a ramen place. Went with a friend and tried the crispy rice square appetizer, miso ramen, salmon rice bowl, and strawberry basil ice cream. Everything was great. The ramen is definitely the better bang for your buck, however the crispy rice appetizer was our favorite!
