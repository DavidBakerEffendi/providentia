OMG! My husband just picked up two of the Philly Cheese steaks (mine had the sweet bell peppers on it) and this sandwich was amazing. 

Like, OMG! I don't know if it's because I'm 8months preggo and was craving cheese steaks really bad or what, but y'all this sandwich was so good! Even my 3 year old liked it after trying a bite, and she is one picky eater!

But let me back up- we ordered two "Philly" cheese steaks with fries, and a kid's nuggets meal.
The cheese steaks were cooked perfectly. They were hot, flavorful, and the sauce and cheese made the sandwich taste wonderful. The bread was nicely toasted. The fries were really good as well- not too hard and not too soft, and seasoned very well.

My daughter liked her chicken nuggets. We tried one, and I could see why she liked them! They too were well seasoned and had a nice crispness to them. My 3 year old definitely approved of her kids meal!

Overall, very pleased and extremely satisfied with my meal, and entire order. We will most definitely be re-ordering from here again!
