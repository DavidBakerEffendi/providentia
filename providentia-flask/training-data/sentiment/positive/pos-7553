Loved the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich. Can't go wrong with a classic, and an $8 breakfast. It's a large sandwich too- they don't skimp on the portion. The line was wrapped around the corner around 9am and full wait time was 30 minutes. Once my order was placed, I had my food in about 2 minutes. Would wait again!
