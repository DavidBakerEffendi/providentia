I just had to give this local place that supports organic local farmers a 2nd try.  
This time I tried the Kale & Saut√©ed Beets Salad and Vegan Tamales.....YUM!
Loved every bite of both.  The Kale Salad was loaded with big bites of perfectly cooked beets and a delicious citrus vinaigrette. 
The Tamales were filled with beans and topped with diced tomatoes.  I didn't miss the meat or cheese at all and I'm not a vegetarian! It was served with a scrumptious artichoke dip that was a creamy and cool topping to this pipping hot dish.

Way to go Saber....you nailed every part of this meal!
