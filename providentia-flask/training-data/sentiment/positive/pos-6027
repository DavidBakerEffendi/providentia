I have never in my life experienced such amazing customer service! The food is out of this world. We ate in the first night and the night before we checked out it was that good we ordered to go and ate it in our room. I will be back here and have recommended this restaurant to everyone I know. They have it down from the host through out your time in the restaurant! If visiting Las Vegas this is a MUST GO!!
