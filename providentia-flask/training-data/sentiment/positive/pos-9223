I'm really just here to evangelize about the Short Rib Cavatelli. SO good. I don't think there's a way or reason to complain about too much sauce, so I won't; just know that there is no shortage of short rib at Bottiglia, especially not in this pasta dish. Seems like the noodles were freshly made in-house as well, but if not, they surely had me fooled. 5/5

Sampled an edge of my neighbor's Butternut Squash Ravioli, and that was divine too. Just get all the pasta. lol

Dranks! I tried two and loved 'em both. The Apricot Sour and fall pear specialty cocktail were healthy on the alcohol pour and tasty x2. The servers are super knowledgeable about the extensive menu and offered some great suggestions and comparisons to make deciding easier.

Lastly, there's really no bad vantage point in this restaurant. Very open, pretty all over, and perfect for any occasion. A dose of the unexpected from Green Valley Ranch to be much applauded. Can't wait to go back for brunch!
