Consistently great coffee. That is what you need to know.
Depending on location, quality food: breakfast, lunch and dinner: sandwiches, salads, paninis, scones, cookies, etc.  
Wifi to stay all day, hang out, and atmosphere at all locations is always interesting.
My favorite might still be on Hwy. PD.
Staff is always polite.
I will never turn down a chance to go to Barriques.
