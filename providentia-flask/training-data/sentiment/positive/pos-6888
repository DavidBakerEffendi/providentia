Loved it! First of all our waitress Jen was a very nice woman...served us well. I had the Pulled Chicken Philly, incredible...with garlic mayo, sauteed mushrooms and a perfect amount of cheese. I met one of the Doogan boys...great guy. Go there, what a place! Only problem was, my wife vomited all her food up shortly after we got home.
