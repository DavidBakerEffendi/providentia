Nowadays, when I want steaks, I will just go to the Keg because the price is reasonable and I will get what I expected. However, in the rush hour, it is hard to find parking in some locations and huge line up for tables. When you tell them medium rare, they never fail. Also, service is always excellent from receptions to the dining table.
