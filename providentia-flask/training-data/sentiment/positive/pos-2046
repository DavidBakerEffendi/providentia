Absolutely FANTASTIC!!  Great apps, pizza, pasta, dessert, service and ambiance.  The calamari and stuffed shrimp were fantastic and good portions.  The margherita pizza was amazing - great sauce, perfect cheese portion and the crust was perfectly charred - it was absolutely fantastic.  Fruitti di Mare was super fresh, and the sauce had a great zest to it as well. Best part of that dish is the fact that they put so much seafood in it, my husband absolutely loved it.  The zeppolis are amazing - piping hot with the perfect amount of powdered sugar - We'll definitely be back!!!!
