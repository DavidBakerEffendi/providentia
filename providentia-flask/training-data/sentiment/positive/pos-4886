I was very happy to see Mama Mia's reopen as Pizza on 40th. It is the same great pizza at the same great prices. I have been going to this location for years, and if you want slices of pizza, it is the best deal in town. The location is small and no frills, but the pizza and prices more than make up for it. The employees are very friendly too, especially Denise, who usually works the counter.
