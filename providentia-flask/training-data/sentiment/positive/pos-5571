Yeah!  Kickass Asian fast food!

No "bobo plates", no little sterno grill to burn your own food, no 70s "Oriental" restaurant ambiance.  This is the REAL THING.  Just knock your socks off, FRESH Asian cuisine to please many palates.  Want veggie?  There's LOTS of vegetarian options for you made to order and brought to your table fast.  Chinese?  Sure.  Japanese?  That too.  They even have pho and curry plates.  You'll get a satisfying mound of food for $10 including bottomless drink.  My only caveat: don't bother having a big conversation with the person you may be eating with--this place is LOUD.  That's okay--you'll have too much fun eating to want to talk that much.

Look, I'm from the SF Bay Area, where Asian joints abound.  This place would totally outdo a lot of the spots back home if it were in the Bay.  Best Asian spot so far that I've been to in the Valley.  If there's a better one, I have yet to find it.

Go.  Eat.  Stuff thyself.
