I wasn't really aware of this place until we walked by and saw their little thing on the street advertising happy hour, meatballs, and all that. I'm no meatball connoisseur, but that alone was attractive enough and so we went inside. For a first timer, it was a bit confusing that there were three levels, but we were quickly seated in Emporio for the small eats menu. 

We got four "Saucy Balls," which consisted of beef with spinach and almond pesto, along with a crab balls appetizer. The latter came with 5 and was fairly good, nicely fried on the outside and lots of delicious crab meat on the inside. The meatballs were amazing though. They were not overly firm, and they also contained a lot of flavor. The green pesto also paired pretty well with them and the accompanying penne side. Probably some of the best meatballs I've had anywhere.
