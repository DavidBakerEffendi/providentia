-DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS PLACE-

Cork & Cleaver is a small location in between an automotive shop and a few small businesses, but don't let that deter you from going here. The atmosphere is nice, the staff is pleasant and attentive, and the food is outstanding.

We had "The Board" as an appetizer, which included Pork Belly, Bone Marrow, and Foie Gras. Things that my girlfriend and I are not really overly accustomed to eating. We thought we'd try it and everything was delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the Foie Gras, but it was cooked and prepared well, it just wasn't for me.

I decided on the Veal Schnitzel for dinner, and my girlfriend chose the Duck. I loved my dish, it was perfectly cooked and did not drop from the standard of the appetizer. She enjoyed her Duck as well. This is quality food.

We finished off the night with some coffee and Carrot Cake. It was good too.

We left full and enjoyed our visit. Dishes weren't seam-splitting so we felt great afterwards (unlike when you've eaten too much and feel overly lethargic or sick), it was just enough food to give you that healthy 'full' feeling.

There really wasn't one thing that was bad to eat here. My mouth waters at the thought of going back. It is a bit pricey, but well worth what it costs. They also have specials (such as rainbow trout when we went) and seem to always be coming up with something new or different.

If you decide to stop by, I suggest getting there at the opening hour, or placing a reservation. This place fills up quick.
