OMG it upsets me that there's not a chain of these restaurants. And unfortunately, I live in the opposite side of the country.

An hour wait on a Wednesday night at 8pm. That shows you how hoppin it is. I had Chicken Parmesan with spaghetti - $28.00 (That came with a side of spinach). The chicken was HUGE!  And for me to carry food home, it must have been big. Before your meal, they serve you you get a choice of soup or salad (I got the salad, yes it was amazing), including the most delicious garlic bread ever (puts olive garden to SHAME), and for dessert included a cappuccino. I'm not a fan of cappuccino's but it tasted just like chocolate milk, I couldn't even taste the coffee-ness.

Like I said, it's unfortunate I live a 5-hour plane ride away. But when I'm back.. I'll be sure to spend money there, again! Next time I'll be smart enough to call in for a reservation.

I guess I should tell you about my service as well, GREAT.
