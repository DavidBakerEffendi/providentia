This place is one of my "must haves" when I'm in Vegas. The crowd is always intimidating, and you'll worry when you'll get a table. If you're a party of 2, you'll get right in. From the tasty and fast margaritas, to Christian the super star who got us right in, to the super amazing service from Lupe. The place was PACKED to the doors and the service and timeliness of our food were incredible. We ALWAYS order the flaming fajitas, and we always leave with a goodie bag because the portions are more than sufficient. 

OMG! I forgot this! They serve beans, two salsas, and a plate of grilled onions and poblano peppers with your tortilla chips. And tasty soup when you order the fajitas.
