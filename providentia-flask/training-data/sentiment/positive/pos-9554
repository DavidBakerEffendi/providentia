For us, this is the best breakfast in Phoenix, and maybe lunch too. Packed with old time regulars who know what they like, this is a throwback cafe with a great menu and even greater food. Don't miss the green chile on anything, I like the pork chop and eggs. M'lady orders hash everywhere it is fresh, and declares theirs a winner
