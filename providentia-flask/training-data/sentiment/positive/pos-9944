Excellent meal. Derrick was our waiter. Nice guy...great service. My sea bass was perfectly cooked. The texture was like butter. My only complaint was I wish the cut was a little bigger. My husband ordered the surf and turf. And I was given a complimentary birthday dessert. Everything we ate was delicious. We'll definitely be back soon :)
