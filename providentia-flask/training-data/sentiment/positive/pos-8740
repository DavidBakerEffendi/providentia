Probably the best hotel we've stayed at on the strip.  Biggest 'suite' we've stayed at as well.  Really nothing bad i could say about the suites...just that the price is probably pretty expensive on peak times.  we stayed during monday to wednesday to get the best deal.  things we loved:  three hd tv's in the room.  one for the bed, one for the living room, and one for the bathroom area.  what more could you ask for.  bed was very comfortable also.  not to firm or soft, slept very comfortable.  i think most people know this is a awesome hotel...you really get what you pay for ;)
