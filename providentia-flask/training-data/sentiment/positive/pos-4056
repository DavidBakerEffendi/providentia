My boyfriend and I frequent this place at least twice a month for Sunday brunch. The service is great. One recommendation is I clarify with the waiter if the whole menu is considered brunch, or just the too menu items. I say this because our first few times we were told the whole menu is considered brunch and this comes with a complimentary alcoholic beverage. 
I tell all my friends about this place and we have brought many to dine there as well. Without a doubt, one of my favorite restaurants!
