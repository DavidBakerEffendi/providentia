The pizza pies here are amazing and so delicious! Love the farm to table freshness and quality. If you haven't tried Sal's yet, it is well worth it. This place is very family friendly and I have been bringing my family here for years. My family's personal favorite is bacon and goat cheese on a pizza and although it sounds a little strange it tastes delicious!! They even have mini customizable pizzas for kids that are good for older kids too. We recently moved to Minnesota and Sals pizza is still the best we've ever had. You can even see the chefs spinning the pizza into the air and at one of their other locations they have some of the most wonderful calamari. I definitely recommend this place to any body who loves pizza!
