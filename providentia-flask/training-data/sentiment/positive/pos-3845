Went for lunch on a Friday. Walked in at 11:45, wondered why we got a table for two since it was empty. Then it was packed at 12:05. Ok, got it. Had the pork ramen and gyoza. Everything was delicious. Just filling enough. Lunch menu is affordable. Service was done at a good speed. I really liked the decor: original and interesting. Not for kids: mostly high tables with high stools, but they have footrest and a back so it is comfortable enough.
