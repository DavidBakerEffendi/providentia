The food menu is not huge, but there is a good variety and everything is made from scratch. Our party ordered the burger, the beef appetizer, crab cake sandwich and the kid's mac and cheese. I tasted everything, and it was so fresh and flavorful. I forgot to  taste my mom's tiramisu, but she loved it. I was preoccupied with the lemon buttermilk cake I split with my daughter.  I honestly can't remember a better dessert. It was a perfect balance of tangy and sweet, and the perfect size. They also have an extensive wine list (I was the DD so I didn't partake.) The service was excellent;  attentive but not hovering. Will definitely be back.
