Not surprising that they have all five stars reviews, terrific food, service, everything you would want from an Ethiopian meal. Had the vegetarian feast and added on the only veggie option that wasn't included and it was much more than enough for two people. Make sure to get an Ethiopian coffee if you like super strong java, which I definitely do. Oh, and super cheap, not surprisingly. Our whole meal was $22! We'll be back!
