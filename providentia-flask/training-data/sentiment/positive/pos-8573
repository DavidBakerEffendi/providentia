Great service from super friendly teens working the front counter. Been coming to this location for over 23 years, and it's just as good, if not better, as the first time I put a slice of Barros pizza in my face. The crust,  the sauce, the toppings...everything is fresh fresh fresh, and quailty. Even my bf from CHICAGO says this is his favorite pizza joint, and out baby loves gnawing on the flavorful pizza crust. Thank you for 23+ years of awesome
