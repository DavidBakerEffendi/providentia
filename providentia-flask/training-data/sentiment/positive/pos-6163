I came in today parched! My server Tannie immediately welcomed me at the door and took me to my seat. She was the friendliest, happiest and prettiest server I've ever had! I ordered the Gilroy pizza it was delicious!! After eating I decided to gamble and the bartender Dawn was extremely cheerful and sweet! I love the vibe of this place and their awesome staff, best local spot in Vegas... 

Thanks Sierra Gold!!!! I will be back!!!
