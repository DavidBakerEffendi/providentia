Repeating my review from before... this place originally was run by the Arcadia Farms folks, and the Heard Museum has now taken over the operations directly.    Fortunately they have not screwed it up! 

Everything is really YUM - all fresh ingredients.   And the setting couldn't be more beautiful.   I often grab lunch here even when I'm not going to the Museum, it's just such a beautiful, quiet setting, particularly if it is nice enough to sit outside.  I've often brought out-of-town guests to this spot and they are ALWAYS impressed.  It's one of my top-5 lunch spots when the weather is nice and you want to sit outside.  (Hmm, I gotta create a list about this!)    There are far too few outdoor dining experiences in Phoenix like this - because the sitting is in the middle of a courtyard, you don't have the annoyance of car noise or smells nearby.   It's an oasis!   You'll love it and your guests will too.
