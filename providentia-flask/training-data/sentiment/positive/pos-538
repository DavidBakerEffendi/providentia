I had visited La Madeleine many years ago when I lived in Dallas, Texas and always enjoyed the food so I was intrigued when I saw that this one was now open. My friend and I both received emails for a complimentary cup of soup or small salad just for joining their email list. I had the onion soup which I thoroughly enjoyed (the best onion soup I've had in recent memory) and my friend had the lentil soup with kale which she thoroughly enjoyed. We both purchased salty mini-baguettes which were so warm and yummy with lovely crusts and REAL butter.
Each of us tried a dessert, mine was a mini seasonal fruit tart which was wonderful. Also, both of us made additional purchases to take with us before leaving, mine included a mini lemon tart and a mini chocolate tart. The staff was very helpful and attentive. We are looking forward to our next visit.
