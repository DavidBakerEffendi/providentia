I've been reading about Futo Buta on Yelp and had it on my short list of places to visit. Am I glad I did! The place is sort of small, but we had no trouble getting in. Our waitress was super nice and helped us decide what to order, since we had never been there before. We ordered Brussel Sprouts as a starter. They were excellent. Then we had some bowl of Ramen noodles, which was also incredibly tasty. My wife and I shared it, since we didn't want to overeat. It was plenty for us to share, though we are light eaters. Then we had one of their homemade ice cream's for desert. Our waitress recommended a Sake flight. Since I'm a Sake novice, that we're out perfectly. I was pretty impressed with it. Definitely a place that is worth a visit and has a decently cool vibe to it.
