I came here with some co-workers for a good-bye lunch. 

We were immediately greeted when we arrived and asked if we would like our coats taken. We were brought to our table and seated at a cozy booth which was perfect for our intimate occasion. Our waiter described the specials to us, and then was kind enough to say that he didn't want to rush us, but that he also had two large parties that had just arrived, so that we could get our orders in before these groups. I really appreciated that he took the time to tell us this!

All table members enjoyed their dishes. I ordered the grilled calamari (lunch size, not appetizer). It came with lots of calamari that was cooked well, although some pieces were slightly overcooked (not uncommon when grilling calamari) and drizzled with olive oil and garlic. It also came with polenta, asparagus, green beans, carrots, and roasted beets. The beets were delicious! My only complaint was that there was a bit too much olive oil on the calamari and the vegetables for my liking, but otherwise it was a great dish!

Throughout our meal we had superb service that had an air of quiet elegance, not the pompous over-the-top flair that you sometimes experience at higher end restaurants. The waitstaff were attentive without being in your face.
