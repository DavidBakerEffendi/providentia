I've been to the Keg twice in one week so you might say that I am a steak lover. When we walked in, we were seated at the bar right away. We ordered drinks and 15 minutes later, our table was ready. I've ordered my usual which is a salad and New York style steak (medium well) and a baked potato with sour cream. For dessert, cheese cake of course!. Everything from service, to food, to atmosphere was superb.

I will be back soon :)
