This is def my new favorite cafe in toronto. From the ambiance (which was spectacular) to the food and all the fine details, it doesn't get classier than this. The feeling is as if you're in Paris or somewhere in Europe just enjoying a quick bite. 

We ended up having chai lattes (actually really delicious) with the grilled cheese and fries - one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had. 

The decor was top notch with marble tables, gold accents and amazing lighting.

I'd recommend going here whenever you want to dress up and have a little date or even to celebrate something special.

The only downfall is that the menu isn't big, so if you're expecting a huge dish for a cheap price - u won't get that here. 

Can't wait to go back!
