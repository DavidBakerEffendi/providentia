I first came here on my birthday one year with my girlfriend. I'm pretty sure this place caught her interest because the name is really, really cool.

Arrogant Butcher is a 5 star restaurant because they are so well rounded. The service is impeccable. I've only had the pleasure of having 3 or 4 different entrees here, but they were truly mouth watering. You can tell that the menu was carefully crafted with influence from all around the world, however it is still a very 'Merican experience. The location is great, too. I would say that the crowd here is late 20's to early 50's, but it really depends on time of day. During game days, you'll get all types.

If you're in the Downtown Phoenix area, I strongly recommend coming here. On the nicer days of the year, it's is pretty cool to see both stadiums and several museums when you look out the windows or sit on the patio.

Two things: parking can get difficult, you will mostly likely have to pay for parking (lot or meter). Also, this place is pretty expensive--upwards of $20 a plate--be prepared for this when you're also ordering a bunch of drinks.
