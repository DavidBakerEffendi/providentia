I have not made it to the dining room yet. I've filled my belly with shrimp cocktail, clam chowder,  & their delicious bread at the bar for their happy hour. They also have Reverse happy hour till close. Everything looks delicious.  Shrimp is super fresh & huge.  Chowder is watery but still full of flavor. I'm use to the clam chowder from the Bay Area. Be prepared for stairs when you come.  Remember the name is the Salt Cellar.
