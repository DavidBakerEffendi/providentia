I've been here quite a few times since my last review and I've sampled a variety of their dishes and they're honestly amazing. You can see that the staff really puts love into what they do, and it shows with the quality of food they put out. It doesn't hurt that their friendliness and open-mindedness makes for some great conversation with them as well. 

The renovations that they did in early January certainly helped brighten the vibe even more than before! I love that they opened up the kitchen so that customers who sit at the bar on that side of the room can see what's going on, and its beautiful blue/aqua walls lighten the mood perfectly. Food-wise, I would recommend the tostadas and enchiladas if you're in the mood for something that will easily fill your stomach, and mochaccinos during the winter and horchatas during the summer will certainly sweeten your day. (Insert fact that they give you so much more coffee for a cheaper price than other places nearby!)
