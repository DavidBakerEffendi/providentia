Hands down my favorite ice cream/ gelato place to go. I love bringing family and friends here to try. They all have fallen in love with this place too. Flavors are always on point. The owner is open to let you try anything which lets you try some of the creative flavors they make daily like almond joy to potato chip to pickle. My favorite hands down is the pistachio, red velvet, and almond joy. I always manage to bring home at least a couple of pints home. Which doesn't last more than two days at home. The owner is amazing and entertains my very hyper nephew which i am always grateful for. Its very clean. They also make a pretty tasty cup of expresso.
