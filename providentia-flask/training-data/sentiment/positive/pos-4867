Service was amazing and the food was so delicious. My boyfriend and I went on a date there and we got California rolls, vegas rolls, 2 servings of shrimp tempaura, California rolls, we each got a sacki bomb and I got a glass of wine and a Dr Pepper and it was all only $40 which is absolutely  amazing and our server was so sweet and made sure we were completely taken care of. My new favorite spot!!!
