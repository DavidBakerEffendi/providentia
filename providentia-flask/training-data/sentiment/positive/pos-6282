steak... nomnomnom

pretty sure i gain weight after coming to dinner here. I had a voucher and decided to take some friends for food, we love food. Made a reservation and came in the dine here at the Palms, N9NE hiding in the corner by the ivory tower. We started with some drinks at the park. my best friend order some wine and said it was the best one she had, ended up ordering another, that drunky. :) i ordered a beer and then we were taken to our table by the host. 

the server we had was amazing, really helpful guy. he gave us the chef specials for the day as well as walked us through the menu. we ordered the chef special app to start. the also brought over bread which was delicious, some were pretzel like other had a little cheese on them, great start to the meal. they also brought out some small apps and sticks that included tomatoes, peppers, and olives. they weren't anything crazy special but was still cool to fill in space between apps and meal. then came the STEAKS!! Ally ordered the filet 10oz i believe, me and Niy Niy order the same meal and i could barely finish it. 12 Oz was too much for me, also with our side. We also order the gnocchi (which i heard was amazing and i heard right!) mac and cheese which had the twisty pasta which i thought was cool and delicious, and also lobster mashed potatoes.. not a huge fan but Niy likes. then i made the big mistake... i order the smores. they came with their own little fire, different marshmallow and chocolate... but it was way too much, i stuffed myself the top!

Overall the experience was excellent. i hope to go back and maybe order a little less.
