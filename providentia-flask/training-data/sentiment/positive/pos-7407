I'm surprised anyone would give the Venetian anything less than 4 stars, but we are all entitled to our own opinions.  I found the hotel and the rooms to be superior and probably among the most comfortable I have ever stayed in.  Even the sofa was luxe and comfy.

Some thoughts: 
* Yes, it's expensive and over-the-top, and I normally wouldn't stay here while in Vegas, but hey, it's Vegas.  
* Tao Beach and the pools are a blast.
* I love how staff here addresses me as "Mister" and kisses my ass like nowhere else.
* If you have a chance to take the hotel's limo out for a whirl and charge it to your room, I highly recommend it.
* I wasn't impressed with the generic toiletries (what? no name brand stuff?).

 I don't think I can add much to what's already been said other than to say I almost slipped and fell on the waxed and polished floors (which would have been biff number #2 of the weekend), so be careful.
