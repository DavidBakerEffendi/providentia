The food was fantastic. There are not many European restaurants in that area, and this is the best you could get if you don't want to go to Etobicoke or Toronto. 

You need to make reservation as it is a small restaurant. We went twice recently on a friday and sunday evening and they had someone played piano there and it was very relax and enjoyable.

We had chicken and veal paprika, chicken schnizel. The schnizel would never disappoint you!! Very thin, cryspy and tender. yummy.   The paprika were so tender and went very well with rice.
