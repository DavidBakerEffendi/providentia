There was enough seating available for us. Very clean and a nice atmosphere. We got an order of Rose topoki with cheese, and kimchi bulgogi. The food tasted great. The prices seemed to be reasonable. I forgot to ask for a higher spice amount, so it would have been nice if the waiter  confirmed what spicy level I wanted.
