Came in here this last weekend for a work party and I had never heard of this place before but let me tell you this is definitely up to par with the likeness of some of my favorite higher end Scottsdale places like Capital Grille and City Hall. Everything was very very good and left me wanting more of everything I tried. The Greek boards were to die for as well as the calamari and the Caesar salad is big enough to share between three adults. I got a short rib cooked incredibly so tender you could cut with your fork and the potatoes were very tasty. Also discovered my new favorite wine while here so that's a plus! Will definitely be requesting this location for my next birthday dinner!
