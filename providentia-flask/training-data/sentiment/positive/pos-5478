Dear store owners: I realize I formerly reviewed the wrong place with 1 star. It's actually fantastic.
This place has a variety of fusion Taiwanese snacks and entreÂ´s. If I recall correctly the ube sprinkled yam fries were not the highlight. They were alright. Kind of like generic sweet potato fries. But everything else like the rice plates, deep fried tofu and five spice marinate was on point. Also, the shaved ices are HUGE. Come with three other friends.
