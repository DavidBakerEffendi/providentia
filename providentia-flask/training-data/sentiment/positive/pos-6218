I built my own burrito and it was delicious! 

My favourite fillings would be the teri mayo sauce, salmon, tamago (sweet egg), purple potato, and any of the crunchy veggies to round it out. Satisfies the taste buds and the belly, and it makes you feel like you made a healthy choice. ;) 

The crew working here is cool, too. I'm looking forward to trying their other proteins!
