Ok... let me preface this review by stating that this is not a place you plan an evening for... no dates, no groups, no hangin' out with your buddies. It's a very tiny take out joint. You walk in the door and you have about as much space as a broom closet to stand in. It's cramped, looks a bit disorganized, but folks... let's face it - we're here for the food.

Owned and operated by an authentic Filipino Lola (grandma), she and her place serves the quintessential Filipino comfort food. I say comfort because when I sit down, wherever I may be, to enjoy a meal from Mely's... I am taken "home". Memories flash of all the tastiest Filipino dishes made by the greatest Filipino cooks I've ever had the pleasure of being fed by. I've tried just about everything Aling Mely offers at this joint. Everything, and I mean everything is authentically good. But I have my two staples that I get just about every time I come here: 1) the oh-so-crispy lechon kawali - wok fried pork belly with the skin ever so crispy, chopped up in generous bite-sized pieces, served with Pinoy gravy. 2) The dinuguan. Oh, man! The dinuguan. I won't describe the details of this pork dish here, but if you're a fan of dinuguan, it's as good as any of the best I've had. It really is. And if you don't know what dinuguan is... just try it over rice. I promise you'll love it!
