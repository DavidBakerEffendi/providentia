This place has made me a certified breakfast believer. SO and I were looking for some breakfast after a long morning of Pokehunting and stumbled upon this gem. The outside is underwhelming but once you go in, you're transported into this chic and very tastefully decorated breakfast bar with a great selection. I felt like I just left soul cycle in New York and came here for some coffee with my rich friends lol anyways, the selection was great and the simple breakfast (I think that's what it was called) really hit the spot. A new favorite!
