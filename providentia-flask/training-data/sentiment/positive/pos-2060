Chocolate chip cookies (both regular and walnut) is all you need to worry about here.

For those that do want the chocolate chip cookies ... they tend to sell out by 11:30am. The next batch comes in around 1:30-2pm.

Definitely worth getting when they are fresh - absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

I am curious what the calorie count is on one of these.
