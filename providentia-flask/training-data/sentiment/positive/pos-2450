Had to update my review after now years of coming here. In those few years I will say this, I've been told so many other things aside from Pizza are delicious,  and I have no doubt in my mind... BUT when I make the special trip down here, it is for the BEST PIZZA I have EVER HAD in ARIZONA. Not over priced, the staff is awesome, desserts are great and each pizza has a recommended wine from their extensive yet quaint wine list. I'm from Pittsburgh, I've been to New York, family in Chicago and seen 80% of this country and still stand by saying this is the closest to genuine, authentic east coast Italian flavor - located in glendale, arizona. Bravo! 5/5 Mi Amore
