I've been craving a good bowl of ramen ever since I moved here from L.A./S.D. So obviously I resort to Yelp for all my answers in food goodness. 
I tried the miso ramen, sashimi, and vegi tempura. It was a pretty damn good bowl of ramen. It was a little expensive, but when I saw the HUGE bowl, I understood. Sashimi was well cut and fresh. 

Overall, this place is good, but expensive...which makes sense considering there aren't that many authentic japanese ramen places around. It helps to have a place around when the craving strikes!
