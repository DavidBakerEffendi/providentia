Pretty good lobster!! I had my first ever lobster roll here and it'll be back for more. 
The service was quick and friendly, the food was delicious and the prices are fair. At first I thought the menu was sort of limited, but based on what I saw and heard, other guests loved their dishes as much as I loved mine. 

The lobster roll comes with kettle chips and a dill pickle; for $14 I wish the sides were a bit more plentiful, but nonetheless, really good. No complaints. 

The atmosphere is a great fit for this trendy neighbourhood -- a little dark and romantic, and also a great place to hang with friends and family. It's a very laid back and comfortable spot. 

The other items on the menu sounded amazing, and on Sunday nights, their Lobster supper is $25+tax, usually $39! How can you go wrong?
