** Best ramen place I have had in Pittsburgh. Affordable and decent portions along with a wide variety of options. 

Zen is a ten. Hold up... looks like I may have found myself a new ramen spot in Pittsburgh. I know I just posted in my last review that I do not believe there is good ramen in Pittsburgh... but Zen proved me wrong. Very reasonable prices (around $10 or low teens), a ton of different options on the menu, and decent sized portions. On top of all that, it's on the edge of Oakland so accessible to college students.

When I first walked in, the savory aroma of the broth filled the restaurant, which gave this place a promising start. I ordered the spicy seafood ramen, which left me satisfied (apparently I am quite hard to please). It came with a variety of shrimp, fish, and fish cakes, and of course vegetables and noodles. Only thing that was missing was an egg, but that can be an add on for an extra fee. 

Broth was very flavorful as is necessary in ramen. The spiciness level was perfect - enough to stimulate your taste buds but not too much to the point where its painful. The noodle texture was on point and chewy but not too hard. The variety of seafood just topped off the bowl. I particularly thought the fish pieces was a hit, as it added a nice szechuan spicy fish remix. 

The only downside is that there is limited seating (around three or four tables for four, and a bar table for maybe 8-10), so don't come with a group bigger than four. Likely to have a wait if all the tables of four are filled.
