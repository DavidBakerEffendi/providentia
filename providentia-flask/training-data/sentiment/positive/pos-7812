When my daughter, a local, said we needed to have breakfast here, I thought it was holiday hyperbole. I was so off in my assessment. This place has one of the best breakfasts in the LV area, and absolutely THE BEST coffee drinks I have had in America.
Between the three of us we had a lovely mix of offerings and everything was perfection.
Our server, Bianca, was welcoming and delightfully attentive. The kitchen is open concept so patrons can see every moment of culinary creation.
A true joy and well worth repeat visits.
