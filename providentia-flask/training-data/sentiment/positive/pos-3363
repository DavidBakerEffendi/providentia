Consistantly excellent, great staff and friendly.  I can not understand why this place is not jammed all the time.  I was there on sat and it was not busy, what a shame.  I love their Italian beer on tap.  The cesar salad and the caprese is outstanding, the balsamic on the caprese is wonderful.  The pizza's are quite diverse, cooked in a wood oven, different types of toppings.  

Comon Yelpers go to Il Bosco and support them its a great restaurant with good food at very fair prices.
