We had a great lunch at Pure Pizza. The guys behind the counter was super cool and very accommodating. I can't eat cow cheese so they left off the Parmesan of my garlic knots and subbed goat cheese on my pizza. Everything was amazing. Bonus the knots were free because I checked into yelp. They even gave me a few more knots because I was nice about them opening a few minutes late. The pizza crust and knots were light and crisp. I also had a salad which was a little pricey but a fresh accompaniment to the pizza. I had a meat pizza called the T Rex which was very delicious. All of the meats complimented the airy crust without overwhelming it. The public market has many choises for lunch but I am very glad I picked Pure Pizza.
