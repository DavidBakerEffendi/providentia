This place is a hidden gem. Definitely the kind of family-owned restaurant that makes you want to root for their success. 

I had the Dickeys Grubba breakfast which included a half order of biscuits and gravy, two eggs over medium, homemade sausage and a delicious slice of thick cut bacon. I also opted for a side of fruit - it was perfectly ripe and delicious. The drip coffee was pretty standard but no complaints! 

Their menu contains a nice selection to choose from but not too big. I had a hard time deciding what to get because several options caught my
Eye. I'll definitely be back. 

What do I think makes this place extra special though? The staff. They clearly know each other really well - in a good way - and communicate like a family. That connection and their love translates into their service. I got the sense that I was at my grandma or aunties house for Sunday breakfast and that's arare vibe to catch these days. 

Every neighborhood needs a great diner with great comfort food. And this place fits the bill. Do yourself a favor and give 'em a go.
