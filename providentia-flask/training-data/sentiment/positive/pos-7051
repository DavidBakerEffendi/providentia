Too soon to give this place a 5/5? Nope

Having majority of my friends living on the lower half of the 215 is really a pain in meeting up with them. But the drive was worth this time. 

The following items are ordered between 2 visits. NOT A ONE TIME VISIT. I'm not THAT fat. Lawlz.

Pork Belly - Yum! Meat - fat ratio: 1:1

Chicken Kaarage - Not too much breading and still could taste the chicken not the breading.

Tuna Roll - Fresh fish

Porkcutlet Rice Bowl - It's like any katsu but the breading is good, not too much.

Salmon Rice Bowl - Grilled salmon on rice, with furikake and hot tea. It looked like a soup or taste like one. But the idea is cool. 

Sashimi Rice Bowl - an orgy of dead raw fish....that's fresh to the taste!

Service is great. They remembered me because of my tattoo on my arm. Kinda awkward but that's okay. If you check in you can get a free drink. Sodas, tea or lemonade. Big plus for their English Bulldog stuff animal by the door. I would come back here if I happen to be in the area.
