I love coming here for breakfast and for the kosher dill pickles! Love the turkey pastrami sandwiches for lunch too. This place is always jumping with people but they have always managed to get me in and out. Great quality food and delicious bakery. I've never had a lemon bar so huge and delicious! They have a great selection on bagels? And other deli meats and items too. Hands down one of my favorites places to stop for something good to eat!
