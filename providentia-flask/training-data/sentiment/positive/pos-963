There is no better place to get an egg sandwich that tastes so wonderful that Eggslut in Vegas. The line proves that it is worth the wait. I did have to stand in line this morning for a sandwich, but that's ok; I have the time. Plus, for eggs done perfect then the wait is so worth it!

Now jus let getting to the front of the line; anticipation growing too. The cashier was very friendly and took my order with ease. After paying and getting the receipt I waited for the cooks to do their magic. The smells that tickle my nose are so amazing. The cook was busy and making the guests food. It was the cashier that runs the register and the front counter that placed my food in the bag and handed it to me. With this establishment so busy you would think that they could run two cashiers. Just a suggestion.

With the bag now in my hands I took it to eat in the car since I'm running behind. I had this time around the Eggslut with bacon, egg, and cheese. Yes it is fantastic and messy. It gets all over the place, but that is more of it to enjoy! If I could I would eat all my egg meals here.
