This is not your traditional street taco  but these are AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. The kiss tacos are my favorite. I could eat them every day for the rest of my life. The taco consists of chicken, pork, and a white cheese. It sounds weird. I know but it works I promise! The taco can stand alone but what makes it over the top is the Salsa's.. they offer 3 different options again they are not your typical salsas but they match perfectly with the taco. Choose which ever tickles your fancy.Then you add cilantro and or cabbage sprinkle a little lime. Take a bite ..at this time I recommend you close your eyes just to fully enjoy the fiesta that is happening in your mouth.
