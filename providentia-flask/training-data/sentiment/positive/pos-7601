My hubby made reservations for my birthday and thank goodness - because this place is busy! There was a 45 minute wait list, but we got seated right away (love it when they honor reservations).

There was a live piano player who played all of the classics, yes even "As Time Goes By." We felt pretty classy. I was wearing a tiara for my birthday, and I felt like I was treated accordingly. Frederick is a class act, and he took very good care of us. I can see he has a lot of fans on here, and he deserves it. He alone is enough to come back for - but then there's the food...

I don't know if it was a special thing for that Saturday, but a lady offered us a wine tasting. Not only did we fall in love with one of the wines, but the prices were actually reasonable! We each got two glasses.

I got the scallops and...well...the only nice way to put this is that they were so incredible I almost needed a towel and a cigarette afterwards. My husband laughed as he watched my eyes roll into the back of my head. From the break basket to the green beans, the entire meal was extraordinary.

Birthday girl got a free crème brûlée for dessert - HEAVEN!

I sneaked a peak at the bill - not scary at all! We got so much for such a reasonable price. I am sincerely impressed.

After seeing a movie in the luxury theater, this dinner was absolute perfection. Then, on to a concert right on the other side of the casino. It was a wonderful night, and all under one roof. We are already planning on our next excursion.
