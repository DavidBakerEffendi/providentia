My only complaint is that they aren't open every day. I get it - it's hard to make a lot of money on $3 tacos when people aren't ordering drinks, but this place is amazing. I love everything, but especially the veggie tacos options. I also got mango guacamole and it was divine. Service is a bit slow and good sometimes takes too long, but they are great about giving out chips and dip, which are both great.
