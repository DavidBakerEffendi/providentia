Algebra Tea House is a truly unique experience in Cleveland. Everything in the place is hand made, right down to the espresso cups. The hospitality is always extraordinary - but maybe in a European way. There's usually only one person working there, so if you order food, it will be a while. But the food is excellent, and clearly a labor of love. The brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday is my favorite, and the whole place smells of the best bacon. 

The teas are all excellent. The coffee is unique, and bears no relation to anything you would find at Starbucks. It's a very light roast with some interesting spice (maybe cadamom?). Keep an open mind, and you might find yourself wanting more by the time you get to the bottom of the mug.

So grab a book, or sit down and play one of their many board games, or just come to think about stuff. Algebra Tea House is the kind of place you will not forget.
