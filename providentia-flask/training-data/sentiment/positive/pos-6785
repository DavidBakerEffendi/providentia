Wow! I just had to give an updated review for multiple reasons:
1. After my first review, Pete had replied to my message so soon after. I like the care he shows towards the business and customers.

2. My boyfriend had ordered from the Basil Box and couldn't finish his food. So he offered it to me. From what I saw, he got jasmine rice with peppers, corn, steak, tamarind sauce and loads of fun toppings. I was amazed by how well seasoned the steak was, how flavourful the entire bowl was. And hurray, the portions size definitely did a big upgrade.

3. To make sure it wasn't a fluke, I got myself a meal. Today I decided to try jasmine rice with peppers, corn, coconut curry tofu, penang curry (just a warning if you can't eat spicy, it's got a nice medium spicy kick so might wanna avoid that), and the fun top your box stuff. Again, full of flavour and great portions.

4. The people here are very very friendly and enthusiastic to serve you. It's really rare to see all staff come up to approach with such positive manner and be really genuine about it.

5. Got the Thai iced tea again. It's bomb. I should really try the other drinks because they sound really great and unique :)

Voila! Basil Box you get 5/5 :D
