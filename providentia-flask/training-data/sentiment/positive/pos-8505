I sure wish my living room looked like this place! Great interior design with a classy, sophisticated atmosphere. I recently planned my boss's 50th birthday here and we had a great evening! Thanks for great service, we had one dedicated server and he was on it! We also planned to have appetizers and pizzas delivered throughout the evening and it worked out perfectly! We had some flatbread pizzas, bruschetta planks, spinach artichoke dip, sliders and cheese fondue. Plenty for all of our guests and everything kept disappearing so we clearly enjoyed it! 

The restaurant was packed on this particular evening and the staff handled it like champs. I would hold other parties or events here, making sure to plan the menu and discuss our wants with a manager ahead of time. 

I totally forgot to mention the layout of this restaurant. It's pretty cool. There are a few really neat wrap around patios. And inside the dining room has an open layout with smaller little nooks for larger groups. Check it out, you'll definitely be comfortable in this living room!
