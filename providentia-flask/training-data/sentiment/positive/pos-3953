Yum!! I love the Italian sandwich,it is the best Italian Sammy I have had out west, since leaving the east coast. The Philly cheese steak is awesome as well. I usually get my Sammie's to go,but they have plenty of seating. It's clean and staff is very friendly. This should be everybody's go to sandwich shop in Chandler. Don't forget your Tastey Cake.
