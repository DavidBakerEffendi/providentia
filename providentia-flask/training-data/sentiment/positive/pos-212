If you have not stopped by this little gem for some yummy tacos, you are missing out.  Tacos are great, but the hot salsa is the BEST that I have tasted ever.  Very nice people that work there.  Never busy when I go, but I usually just pick up to take home anyway.  If you haven't tried it, try it!!!  You will not be disappointed.
