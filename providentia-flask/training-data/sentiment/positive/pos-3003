Came here for brunch on a Saturday. Definitely recommend showing up earlier if you're with a group to grab a table. The brunch can also take a few minutes to be finished as well, so arrive ready to wait (but I promise it's worth it!) 

The whole place is close to a cafeteria style where you order at the counter and go get your food when it's ready to take to your table. 

They had an amazing array of baked goods and tons of fresh squeezed orange juice. (I didn't grab any but I'm going back because the cookies looked mouth watering.)

Their brunch menu had things like lemon ricotta pancakes and Norwegian eggs benny on it (I will come back to try the pancakes for sure.) 

I had the breakfast burrito, which was vegetarian to my surprise! It had scrambled eggs, refried beans, guacamole and sour cream. It was super delicious and I would go back to eat 20 if I could. 

My friends each got dishes involving eggs and all loved them too. 

Great brunch spot all-in-all
