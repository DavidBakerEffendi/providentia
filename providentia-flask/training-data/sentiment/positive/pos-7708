I love this place! Came here with my family at lunch, and the service was great once we told them it was out first time.

The fajita's were on par with the best I've ever had. Chips and Salsa are better than Cantina 1511.

The serving size was generous, and one could share the fajita's easily. Good vareity as well for vegatarians.
