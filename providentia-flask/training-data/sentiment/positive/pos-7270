The bf and I headed here for the Champagne Brunch, it is a little pricy, but in my opinion very much worth it. The quality of the food here is definitely not buffet quality, but what you'd expect at an upscale restaurant. I enjoyed the BEST French toast I've ever had along with a variety of other tasty items. My bf was excited to try the sushi bar that opened at noon, and he said it was pretty good. All the while the mimosas kept coming. 
Great food and good service! A definite must if you've never tried it before!
