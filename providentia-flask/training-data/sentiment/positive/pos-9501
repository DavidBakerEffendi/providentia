Such a fun date night or could be super fun group event! Food was good, but the experience was what it is all about! Customer Service was amazing. We did the 6 course dinner really good. Drinks also are delicious and the really fun part when wine gets spilled your senses are very strong so just makes you want more. Ha! So much fun I'd definitely do again.
