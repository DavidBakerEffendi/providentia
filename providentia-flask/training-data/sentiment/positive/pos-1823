omg if you go to Las Vegas, you have to go check this place out. I think it's the Paris Hotel property, because they have an entrance from inside Paris Hotel and one from the street. I can not tell enough about their crepes. It just melts in your mouth. Please try them if you're visiting Las Vegas. I promise you won't regret it.
