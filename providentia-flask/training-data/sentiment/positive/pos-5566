Why the high fiver? The pizza itself is addictive but the main reason is because of the service.  I ordered a personal pizza which they made fresh with ingredients from Italy...yum! While sitting I was offered an espresso, that's class right there. From that I had a great convo with them about the history of their pizza, where they got their ingredients and their future plans.

They are going change the place to a sit down restaurant soon.  I can't wait!!
