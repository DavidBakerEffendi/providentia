We came here on a Saturday night and chowed down on a bucket (literally a large bucket) of chips and salsa. I couldn't believe we were the only ones at the bar eating the free chips! I had two seltzer waters and my boyfriend had a beer. Our tab came to $6 on a Saturday night! How great is that?

We've been here many times and had all of the tacos with the fish being my favorite. They have quite a few vegetarian options that are easily modifiable to be vegan. Their happy hour is fantastic, you've got to try the nachos or the dip duo. 

This was always our favorite place for Sunday Funday because of all-day happy hour, but I can't recall how many TVs they have or if we just popped in here for a drink. Taco Tuesday is a killer deal. 

TIP: Their skinny margarita and yogi marg are insanely delicious for low-calorie drinks. I love the pop of soda water on top to give it a little carbonation. 

They're open late and serve food all night long, which makes getting a late bite to eat very easy!
