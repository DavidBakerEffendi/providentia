Wow South Asian cusine served at its best. I am really not a great judge when it comes to this type of south asian cusine when it comes to food but Thanjai was just really good. All these dosas were a great combination of taste and flavours. I tried their cheese dosa, and just wow soft and tender cheesiness just blew me away. As a bengali myself who doesnt have much real exposure to south asian food this was a nice intro to this side of indian cuisine. Its impossible for me to go to an "indian" restaurant north south east west or whatever and not order lamb biryani so when I had their version I was happy with the mild spicy(requested) take and curry flavored rice. I will however never understand the point of why they put a boiled egg on top of the biryani as I am used to having boiled egg curry or korma as a side. Nevertheless its a different cuisine and I am a boiled egg lover so Im not gonna cuss over eggs on side or on the meal or wherever as the meal itself was really yummy. You can really see the passion coming through the staff and the people who are running it over their service, food, and ambiance. Loved how they kept a replica of the famous temple on the entrance and the orange walls and nice traditional vibe. Will return again...and again :)
