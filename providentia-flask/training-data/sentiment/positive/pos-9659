My new spot for sushi. Worth the wait for sure on there busy days! Wow, the variety and the fresh taste! While waiting in line we spoke to a few people and one guy said he comes all the way from chandler to this place for sushi. I only understood why after we ate. Good service too! Very caring and friendly staff.
