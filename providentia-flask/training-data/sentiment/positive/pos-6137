Went here for the breakfast buffet on my last day in Vegas and I was completely blown away!!! Overall I had great service and the food was excellent, but what stood apart from any other buffet I've been to, and I've been to many, was the ham that they served! It literally looked like one giant slab of unsliced bacon that was cooked with a whole lot of lovin! The carver dude served me up 2 slices of it and I was literally in Heaven! It was so fatty yet juicy and soft... OMFG... thinking about it makes my mouth want to have an orgasm! Hard to honestly say how great the other items were because the ham trumped everything by far!
