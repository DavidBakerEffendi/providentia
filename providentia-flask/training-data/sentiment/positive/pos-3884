If you're looking for great pizza I recommend this place! Everything we had was great, we ordered:

Ontario Prosciutto and Arugula pizza
Cacciatore Salami pizza
Glass of Gragnano
 
Both of us preferred the Prosciutto pizza because it was very very good, but the Salami pizza was great as well. The bread they served was fresh and delicious, the wine was great and the waiter helped us choose a bottle and even suggested we taste 4 different ones before choosing. He was really friendly and helpful.

Overall a wonderful experience and I would go back!
