Please note that this review is mainly about the sandwiches and with that in mind, 5 stars.  Can the staff be ornery sometimes, yup.  They can also be friendly and chatty.  Does it take a while to get said sandwich when the line is long (that means still inside, to the door)?  Yeppers.

All that said, the sandwiches are very, very good.  Quality Boar's Head meats and served on the Bin's bagels and as much as anything it's the latter that's what really makes the sandwich.  Those bagels are as good as I've found in Charlotte and certainly beat the heck out of options from Panera, Einstein's, etc. Throw in that the meats are piled high and the veggies are fresh and, voila a 5 star sandwich.

My fave... Roast beef, turkey, provolone with lettuce, mayo, S&P on a toasted onion bagel.  Go and get one.
