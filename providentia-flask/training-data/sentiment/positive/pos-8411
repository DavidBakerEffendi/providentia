Needless to say, the Peppermill is a landmark. The lights, the booths, the lounge and the ever friendly uniformed waitresses. Sure, it's a moderate pricing but the portions are well worth it. From appetizers to foo-foo drinks, everything is big. A personal fave is the Scorpion Bowl, a big drink for two I usually handle alone. Breakfast, lunch or dinner you had best bring your appetite.  A club sandwich that resembles something from Carnegie Deli? Pancakes wider in circumference than the plate their on? Great for a date night niche meal or just a late night hankering. And don't forget the lounge. Not an abundance of seating but what there is is plush and comfortable in the classic Vegas shadows. The fire pit is a nice touch with that special squeeze to get good drinks and appetizers and spend some time. Local or visiting, it's worth your time and appetite.
