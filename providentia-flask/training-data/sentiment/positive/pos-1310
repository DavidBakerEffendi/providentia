This restaurant is known for their Banh Cuon dish (BC2 on the menu is my go-to) which is a rice roll dish that is stuffed with ground meat and served with fresh herbs, pork sausage, picked veggies, squid party and fish sauce. In my opinion it's the best in Toronto! 
In true Vietnamese restaurant style, they serve complimentary tea (hot or cold) to their patrons. They also have an amazing Vietnamese iced-coffee , although it comes from a machine and isn't made with the traditional French drip filters.
The restaurant is family-run and seldom packed. Perhaps because the parking lot is an accident waiting to happen! Side street parking is available next to the plaza if there aren't any spots available in the parking lot.
