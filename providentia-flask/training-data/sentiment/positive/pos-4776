So we've had some very good food at Nee House but I just don't care. 

It's the fried rice..... I'm a fried rice junkie. Ever since I was a kid. I'm 1/2 Chinese and grew up in AZ. I remember fried rice at China Doll from my very early days.

Nee House's fried rice is probably the best fried rice I've ever had. 

My dad is from Canton, China, and he favors the salted fish and chicken fried rice. While I love that, I have to disagree and go with the crab and dried scallop fried rice.  It is nice though to always get both & have a bit of each.

If you're eating in, they also have live seafood tanks so definitely don't ignore those.

Most of the time though, whenever I'm within stopping distance, I'm calling in fried rice orders and grabbing an order (or two) of each to bring back home to php and my family.
