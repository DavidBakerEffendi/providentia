Been eye balling this place for so long but finally made my way here for brunch and have no regrets! 

Fatima was great! She was attentive and made sure our mimosas were never empty. They have three varieties (or more since they can mix them!) and each were amazing. Though I suggest the blood orange mixed with Bellini. 

Food wise, we had the much talked about monkey bread to start. While I'm not a sweets guy, this was amazing and did not have me wanting to run to the dentist. The brioche was soft and warm with just enough caramel drizzle to make you want more without killing you with sugar. Entree wise, I got the biscuits and gravy and damn! Simplicity elevated and done right. Everything from the warm cheddar biscuit to the bacon gravy with seasonal veggies added in came together to form a complete bite.

I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu and will be bringing visitors here for brunch. Although I love to try new places - this one will have to be on the return list.
