If you miss Europe, you should visit Lumiere. In short, the flavors, service, wine suggestions, presentation, and value was all right on point.  We went for the tasting menu, but started with the oysters.  I can't say no to an oniony flavor and some melted butter on a chargrilled oyster! They were great, and served beautifully with very course salt and whole spices for presentation. They gave us an espresso-sized cup of pallet cleansing soup - my dad asked for another! The pear salad missed the mark, but the filet mignon topped with fois de gras was faaantastic.  The final course was a creme brulee with hints of passion fruit.  Thinking of going back soon to see what's new.
