My first encounter with Chef Ogden was his namesake butterscotch pudding at the Larkspur Yankee Pier.  Wonderful, creamy and slightly sweet.  

Vegas was no different.  Excellent food plus simple decor: sleek taupe accents against stark modern white.  

Warning: Portions are fairly small, so eat up on the little round rolls they pass around with generosity.  

Our party ordered:
Bradley's Caesar- full leaves and ample anchovies
Bison- not gamey at all, tender, juicy and cooked rare
Duck- slow roasted, the rhubarb and foie gras were perfect accents

Service was attentive, but did not disturb the ebb and flow of the table talk.  

Due to the minimal decor, and well lit dining room, I would recommend this restaurant as one for schmoozing.
