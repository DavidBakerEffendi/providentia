Soooo...Im trying to find the words to explain exactly how dope this little gem of a restaurant is.  Futo Buto brings authentic, flavorful bowls of deliciousness unlike any ever seen before in the city of Charlotte.  Let's start at the beggining.

Izakaya are, for lack of a better term, appetizers or small bites.  I always start out with Kurobuta Pork & Scallop Gyoza.  They are the best dumplings I have ever had.  Kurobuta pork is basically the Wagyu of the pork world.  Phenomenal quality meat and they are sticking it in traditional gyozas with scallops.  Insanely delicious.  I am also a huge fan of the fried brussel sprouts...never thought I'd say that in my life.  The pork belly buns are incredible as well and always round out my meal.

Ramen- First of all, the broths are truly remarkable.  A lot of love and time has to be put into building the layers of flavor that penetrate deep into my soul with every slurp.  They use alkaline noodles so the noodles never get mushy.  My favorite is the Buta Bowl.  It comes with smoked pork belly and duck confit, double noodles, corn scallions, chilli sauce and egg.  It is spicy and deep.  May be the best meal in Charlotte.  I love love love this place.
