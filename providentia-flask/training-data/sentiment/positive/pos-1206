While this place is a little more expensive than others it is terrific.

The basic room is humongous and elegant. Normally I just stay at an average hotel because we aren't in the room much anyways. We decided to stay here so that I felt comfortable with leaving my gf back in the hotel to relax if she didn't want to come out gambling with me. It was perfect. There was both a tub and living room for us to relax in.

The hotel is in a perfect location on the strip. I really enjoy it for gambling because it has a high class gambling area but also places like the casino royale are right next door if you want a different more up beat crowd or lower stakes.

The check-in/out was quick and easy. The hotel has everything you need without even leaving the casino if you don't want to. 

When we went they also gave us tons of coupons that had lots of great deals for activities and restaurants on the strip.

Overall very impressed with this hotel.
