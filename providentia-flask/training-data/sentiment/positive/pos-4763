Wow, best tacos in town! As a native born Mexican, I can say that these are as authentic as they get. The barbacoa tacos are deliciously marinated and seasoned perfectly. I tried their bean soup which had pieces of salchicha and chicharrones, I was blown away by the flavor. Will definitely be coming back to visit.
