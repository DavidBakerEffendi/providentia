I came here for brunch this morning. The atmosphere was great, I loved the old school hip hop vibes. I had a couple mimosas - they tasted great and were reasonably priced. For my meal I got the french toast - omg it was amazing! They used some sort of coffee cake in place of regular bread which was so good. My boyfriend ordered biscuits with gravy which he enjoyed. The service was great. Overall a nice brunch spot, we'll be back!
