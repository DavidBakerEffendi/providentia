I've been to a diff location but I'd go back to this Spring Valley location bc of our kickazz waitress "Marianne from Detroit!" She was great, professional yet also had a personality-which so many servers lack these days! Had a little mushroom mishap and she offered to buy my b'fast which I absolutely would not allow but the kind gesture was appreciated. My Denver omelet was delish & when I didn't love the "chili dusted powder on my potatoes" she got me some fresh hot plain ones-yes. Yum! Good food + great service. I'll be back
