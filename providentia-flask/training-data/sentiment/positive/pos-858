Ahhh. the Crier! A solid pub that my co-workers and I are actually regulars at. I've been to the sister bars to this ( The Village Idiot and Sin & Redemption) and over all the owners really know what they are doing. In my opinion one of the best international selection of beers in the city. If you love German beers like me this is the place to go for sure. 

They have two floors and a great patio so there is usually always seats here. This is a great place for a date or even to go for supper as the food is pretty decent too! 

Just be careful on a Jays game night as the crowds get bigger and louder those nights ( But yay Go Jays) 

Cheers!
