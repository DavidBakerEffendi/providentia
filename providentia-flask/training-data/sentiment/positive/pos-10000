Cravings has an awesome bar staff (as I mentioned in my previous review about Daniel Freeman).  I also wanted to give a big stamp of approval to bartender June (I wrote his last name on a football sheet but lost it).  He seems like he's always having a great time - smiling and joking with the customers -- even idiots like me!
