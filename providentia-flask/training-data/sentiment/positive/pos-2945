I kind of forget about Ferrucci's since it's tucked away back off I-77 exit 28 in the Shops on the Green complex.  But when I remember them, I'm always glad I did.  

That goes for pretty much everything they offer.  Their selections of meats, cheeses, prepared Italian dishes, salads, etc. is first rate.  What's also good is their sandwich menu.  A nice selection made with fresh ingredients and served on at least serviceable bread.  Making my stomach growl just thinking about it but alas, they are closed on Sunday.  They also offer a good selection of Italian specialty canned, jarred items.

I like that you can get prime beef here.  All their meats are pretty pricey by the pound but I've never not been satisfied once I got it home and cooked it up.  A friendly staff though not as outgoing and boisterous as the crew at Derado's.
