Came here yesterday to try the Prix Fixe menu, and it way surpassed me expectations. Portions were huge (we had to pack a lot of go, salmon steaks could have fed two), and food was excellent quality, with everything being perfectly cooked.

Service was great, our server was attentive and helpful with great recommendations, and my water was always filled (which matters a lot to me because it's awkward to keep asking). He spoke with a charming accent and even offered us more bread when ours ran out (as I am a bread monster when the bread is good). There were olives (YUM) on the table as well, and olive oil for the bread. 

I had the squid (perfectly cooked and two big pieces, with beautifully seasoning, over a pineapple and ?cabbage? salad for brightness), the salmon (beautifully crusted and perfectly cooked to be meaty and not mealy, with a tangy complimentary pineapple compote, and perfectly season veggies below). The sorbet was very good, but a lot of sweet for one person to handle. We also got personal teas as part of the menu. 

Also at the table, was the ceasar salad, which had lots of prosciutto, the chicken and the seafood stew were all delicious as well! What really took the cake was the DARK CHOCOLATE MOUSE CAKE! ORDER THIS!!! It is not on the prix fixe menu, but it was delicious! 

I will definitely be coming back!
