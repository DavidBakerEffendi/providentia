Early birthday breakfast was spent at this place. Rossy was our server and she was outstanding! She was very kid friendly (made life easier) and very attentive. She had a great personality and she took care of my family and I. 

My Husband and I ordered chicken fried steak. My all time favorite! The chicken was lightly battered and crispy! So yummy!

Their banana nut muffin is soooo delicious! Btw, check in on Yelp and receive it for free which is even better! Yay! It's so moist and flavorful. It's definitely a must have when going here!

I also love their diablo potatoes! So good! Well seasoned and crispy outside yet soft inside.
