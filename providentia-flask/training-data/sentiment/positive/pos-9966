One of my go to places downtown. They have free entry and some times a line at the door. I love that I can go here and relax, or I can go and get drunk, or even just go and play games. They have so many options for activities and so much room. I actually didn't realize then had the outdoor area until my second time going there. As for some of there games.. they have connect four,  jenga, twister, giant beer bong, corn hole, and even some pool. Inside they also have a bunch of chairs, bean bags, and even a bed with pillows. my friend almost fell asleep on the bean bags, however security was quick to wake her up. To keep her up we played huge tic tac toe for like ever! Not sure how she could even sleep with a DJ playing!!! It's more a place to hang out and grab a drink then a place to dance but it still happens in little blasts. White girls trying to twerk!! YAY!! They also have a band that plays outside that gives out FREE BEER. It's free and it's beer, what more can you ask for. They have a couple bars, the one outside takes the longest it seems but they have $3 PBR and tiny cups. Super fun place that I recommend to start or even end your night at.
