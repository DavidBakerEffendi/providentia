This is officially my new favorite place!  
We went on a Friday evening about 6:30 hoping there would not b an issue getting in.  
Well the inside was booked up w/reservations, but the outside patio is 1st come 1st serve.  We got lucky!  The weather was great and there were a few tables open. 

I want to start w/our server.  He was fantastic!  He knew the menu up and down and backwards! When asked what he liked, he told us honestly.  We went with his suggestions and loved everything!

Apps- we had the fries w/sausage gravy.  Cooked in real lard!  I'm not a super freaky health nut.  I know dozens if old people who grew up on farms eating lard and lived into their 90's!   So bring it!  Oh, and damn they were deeeeeeeeelicious!

Entrees-  I got the gnocchi with lamb. Outstanding!!! Its been a couple days since I was there and I'm already craving more! 

I tried the fried chix w/Mac and cheese.  Very good!

Also tried the flat iron steak and it's accompaniments,  all outstanding!

Dessert- must get the bread pudding w/the candy pieces....oh-my-gawd!

The server also mentioned how there is some rare onions in one dish and how they own a garden too, fresh stuff!
