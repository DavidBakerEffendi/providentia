Came here because I was craving for wings and was not disappointed! Great customer service and wings. I like the honey bbq(I can't remember the exact name). There's also a hot version of it for those who are daring. The wings are big and meaty which was great! The only thing I didn't like was you can't do half and half on an order because the server said the owner doesn't like doing that. However, since it was my first time, I didn't mind paying an extra $1 to get 2 separate orders so I can try the different flavors. I also got fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was deliciously fresh. Be careful to not burn your tongue because everything will be hot and freshly made. I will definitely come back to try the pizzas when I am in the area.
