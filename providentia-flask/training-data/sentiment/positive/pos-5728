I have to be honest and say that I have never stayed here before. but this review is about all the cool things that they have to see in the hotel. the grand canal shops are very impressive even if Ya don't really like to shop all around in malls. it is a lot like venezia. it is ooooh cool. I love the way they put the canal into it and you can go around in gondolas. looks like a lot of fun. it is like as soon as you walk into the place you are in Italy. beautiful. when you go to the front of the hotel it is still themed like Venezia and there are even more canals. I really will be back here in the near future. ciao
