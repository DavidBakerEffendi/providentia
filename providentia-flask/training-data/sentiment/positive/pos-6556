Incase all the other 5-star reviews weren't enough, let me add my own:

This chicken is the bomb. The end. That's all she wrote.

Seriously though, when my mate was visiting from Calgary we ate here every week for 3 weeks, and in between visits we thought about coming to eat here. It was good all the times we went.

The chicken is crispy, but the key is the sauce. Make sure you get extra sauce, 'cause that's where it's at. The fries are herbed, and cooked to

If you order a meal (chicken, chips) before 12 or 1pm you also get a free bread roll and a Portugese tart (!). Needless to say, this place is Legit Portugese, so they know how to make a tart.

If you're in Montreal, want some good chicken, want to try a local institution, or any of the previous, just go here already.
