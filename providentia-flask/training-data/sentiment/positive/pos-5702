Stopped in with my dad for a quick (and early) snack before a 5 PM movie. 

I have to admit - the location (a strip mall) had me feeling a little judgy about what to expect.

We ordered pulled pork sliders and fried shrimp. Both were from the appetizer section of the menu.

The service was fast and friendly. The food was fresh. The BBQ sauce options (there were several) were tasty.

I would definitely return.
