Yep.... this right here is a real gem.  

Walked in to this place with high hopes.  It exceeded.  

The people were super nice. Really helpful and friendly.  

I got the curried goat and the oxtail.  Both amazing. Rice outstanding. Just a really plate across the board. 

I'll come back here for sure.
