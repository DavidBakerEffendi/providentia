Beautiful presentation, delicately simple flavors, and a superb chef.  We ordered one each of the seasonal omakase (which you have to reserve in advance since the ingredients are hand selected by Chef Nubuo and prepared by him only on the nights he is in house) and the regular omakase with wine pairing.  

First of all, I thought I was going to be out by the end of the meal after drinking so much wine and I'm not a huge fan of wine, but the pairings really were spectacular.  There's also a list of a few thousand wines available if you are so daring to read through the whole thing.  I was pleasantly full after the meal which included such dishes as seared octopus over tomato and fresh mozzarella, oyster uni shooter (my personal fav), mushroom melange, lamb chop, etc. etc. etc. Also, the last dish of the regular omakase... the foie gras was so melty, smooth, and rich that I almost cried... I literally had to hold back the tears from pure culinary ecstasy...  

The dessert assortment at the end was a nice finish-- banana creme brulee, assortment of ice creams, green tea custard.

Chef Nubuo is not only creative, but incredibly kind and attentive to his customers.  Not the typical stuck-up sushi chef....  The hostess was a bit snotty since we were sharing omakase meals, but we ordered a bunch of a la carte items and drinks as well.  The total for four of us still came out to be over $400... so why she was giving us the glare from time to time I have no idea.  If the chef is fine with it, the hostess should care less.  

So aside from the annoying hostess, all was well in Sea Saw land.  It was a truly fantastic experience and one I would recommend you to try, but be willing to open your wallet for the pleasure.
