Great patio birthday dinner. We had a get together, and asked for a "sidecar" drink. Normally, it's made with cognac, but we had it with whiskey, and it worked. Bartender worked with us, even though our server had never heard of the drink. Oh, delish! (lemon, orange syrup, cognac)...

The Skirt Steak Entranda (Sp?) is so good with the Chimmichurri. I would have liked some fresh cotija cheese on top, but it was cooked so well, it just melted in my mouth. 
The chicken skewers-same-delish and cooked just right.

The dessert tart and the Smore were huge desserts. Enough for 4 but we managed! The music was just right, and we had a great meal and get together. Such a great place, Joe's...
