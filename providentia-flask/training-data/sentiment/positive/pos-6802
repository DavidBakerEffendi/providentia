I love this place!!  I started going to Chris' about a month after I moved to Charlotte in 1994.  I was working at Lebo's down the street and a coworker took me there for lunch.  Right away I fell in love with the place and the people.  Very friendly service.  I ordered the steak hoagie with chips and a sweet tea.  Ever since I have been hooked!!  I loved meeting the owner and his sons!  They make it really fun to go there, grab lunch, and just hang for a while.  The chicken and rice soup is something I get EVERY time I go!!  This place is a must try if you haven't yet!!
