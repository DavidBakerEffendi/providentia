Can't go wrong with oyster night! Just came back on a Thursday night with some friends, I believe Monday's they have the special as well. $1.50 per oyster and great beer selection!

I smelled the delicious food that was coming out to other tables, next time I'm coming on an empty stomach and going to try out the burgers! Will have to give an updated review once that happens. ; )
