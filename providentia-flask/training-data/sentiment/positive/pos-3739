This restaurant is impressive on many levels, not the least of which is the owner's willingness to improvise and update the menu.  Raja recognized my name on the reservation and came over to say hello.  He also sent over an order of BBQ chicken, the evening's special appetizer, which was beautiful to both the eye and tongue.    We were also served house made papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  Our shared entrees this evening were lamb raawali (boneless lamb with Indian spices, tomatoes, yogurt and a touch of cashew) and chicken Labrador (chicken delicately cooked in tomato gravy with a hint of coconut).  The entrees were accompanied by a large bowl of black lentils, rice and Naan.  Service throughout, as usual, was outstanding
