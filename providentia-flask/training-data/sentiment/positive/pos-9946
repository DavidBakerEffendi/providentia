Gotta update yet again.  Had lunch here, and the table got the pork mac n cheese with jalapeno.  This was an excellent dish to share, but it's listed as an entree. I think it would be a bit much as an entree, but split between 3 people it was perfect.  The pork and cheese gives a nice smoky flavor.  The jalapeno provides heat and was welcome.  But, jalapenos are always welcome with me.  The top had a fantastic, textbook crust.  I'm beginning to think Rick Moonen could cook a box of rocks and I would like it.
