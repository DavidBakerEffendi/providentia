Went to Morris Ramen today for lunch after many months of wanting to go. We were greeted and seated promptly; the restaurant was a little on the warm side considering the temp outside was mid-80s, but that was minor. I ordered the Morris Ramen and was blown away! Exceeded my expectations by far. The broth itself I could drink from a jug--it was that good. No, not good--delectable! The noodles, egg, everything else were a perfect compliment to this beautiful broth. I loved the Morris Ramen at Morris Ramen. We did try the satsuma fries with gochujang aioli and weren't impressed. No matter, we'll try something different next time! And yes there will be a next time--soon! Also: our server was a total sweetheart. The place is trendy, but service was warm.
