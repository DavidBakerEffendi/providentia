Cute place to grab brunch with friends uptown! Love that they have healthy menu options. We tried the coconut spelt waffle (its only one waffle) and the weekender breakfast with salmon. Everything tasted great!

Portions are pretty small for the price and it's self service though. If you're hungry you definitely need to order a side or grab a muffin!
