I was a little disappointed to find that there is no stand alone Chanel store in AZ so I had no choice but to go to Neiman to find my next Chanel bag.  I must say, they have an excellent staff here.  The bag I wanted to see was not in stock so they had it brought over from a store in TX so that I could check it out.  The sales associate texted me to let me know the status (when it was shipped, ETA, and when it arrived).  When I went back down to see the bag I wasn't impressed - they didn't skip a beat or act like it was the end of the world that I didn't want the bag after they had gone through the trouble of bringing it over.  I found another bag that I loved but they didn't have the color I wanted in stock so they ordered it for me and shipped it to the house (Fed Ex - no charge).

This boutique is bigger than others I've been in which was a nice surprise.  I won't hesitate to come back for my next bag, I guess I didn't need the stand alone Chanel store after all!
