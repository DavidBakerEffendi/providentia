4 months!!! That's how long they've been open here in Henderson and I've been missing out! Finally, as my cheat meal my son and I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try since it was Cinco de Mayo.

Our order consisted of:
-Nachos with cheese sauce and jalape√±os: nothing special but exactly what we like!
-Asada Quesadilla
-Carne Asada Taco (grilled extra)
-El Pastor Taco (w/out pineapple and grilled extra)

The carne Asada and El Pastor were one the best I've ever had especially grilled a little more on the crispy side. It was bursting with flavor. If you're craving for authentic tacos definitely give this place a try!
