As a sushi lover, I am always on the hunt for good sushi. For the amount that my husband and I eat, we have found ourselves going to all you can eat places when we need a sushi fix, and saving the a la carte places for meeting up with friends or date nights.! I have tried many places in York region, and this is my current favourite for all you can eat. 

For the selection, the price is about right, but I am not sure I would pay more. They have a great mix of raw and cooked options. Their fire grilled sushi is a must order! 

Service was quite quick and the waiters were pretty helpful. 

My main problem with this place is that they did not serve unagi (eel) in sushi form, and that it is only available in maki or hand rolls. That was a huge disappointment, but I did find other things to eat! 

*edit* they do offer squid and unagi sashimi and sushi in their a la carte menu, but they go for ~$3 per serving... no thanks!
