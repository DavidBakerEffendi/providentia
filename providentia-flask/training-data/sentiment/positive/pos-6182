PDQ is a great staple out in North Las Vegas. Great chicken, perfectly crispy fries and a plethora of sauces. It's nice having a place out here that does chicken really well AND has multiple sauce options. Did I mention they have a lot of sauces from which to choose???

My boyfriend and I both got the crispy strip combos and 7 difference sauces to try and it was fun trying the different ones with the fries and chicken, get as many as you can to try! I really like mixing the ranch with the buffalo blue, my bf likes the honey mustard and we also like the blueberry ginger one but think it would be better with the grilled chicken (may have been a seasonal sauce as i don't see it on the website.)

How many times can I mention the word sauce in a single review? Sauce.
