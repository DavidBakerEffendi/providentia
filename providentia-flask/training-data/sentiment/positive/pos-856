When I think "Chicken & Waffles", this is exactly what I'm talking about. So freaking good! 

I ordered a pound of chicken tenders, waffles and fries... The portions were way bigger than expected but my goodness is that chicken good. It's tender, juicy, perfectly breaded and mouth watering *Drool Emoji*. The fries were also excellent (fresh cut).

Service was great. We came in 15 mins before closing on a Sunday and no one rushed us at all. I will definitely go back soon!
