My first time at Indian Paradise and wow! was I pleased!
The lunch buffet ($10) is huge with dozens of options from soup to juice smoothies to vegetarian and non vegetarian main dishes to desserts. So so yummy! The server was polite, the atmosphere pleasant, the choices tantalizing.
Can't wait to go back for more!
