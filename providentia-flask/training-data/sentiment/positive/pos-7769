This restaurant has only been open for 2 weeks so I was surprised by my amazing experience. Everything was perfect; they had friendly service, great atmosphere, and delicious food. I appreciated their bibs that kept my clothes clean and the long chopsticks that made getting food across the table easy. 
The menu had a huge variety of food to choose from. I recommend getting the platters from each category because you get to try a bit of everything. 
We got the signature spicy olive oil soup and the sweet tomato ox bone soup. You could choose the spice level of the signature soup: spicy, medium, or mild. We got spicy and it was really good. I liked the tomato soup too, it was very flavourful and unique in its own way. It even came with slices of tomato and an ox bone! Good if you're down to try something new but I did like the signature spicy soup better. 
Things you gotta try from the menu: 
- Konjac Silk Knot: absorbs the flavour of the soup and is perfect to dip in sesame and soy sauce mixture!
- Golden Stuffed Fish Balls:  one of my favourite things from the menu. Chose it randomly but was pleasantly surprised by the crab eggs inside! 
- Thailand Tiger Shrimp: they are so big and pair well with the signature spicy soup! They leave the heads on which is the best part in my opinion
- Deep Fried Taro Slices: thinly sliced and already cooked so it was nice and tender.  
- Deep Fried Buns: served with condensed milk which was the perfect combination to end the meal. It came with 4 buns and was also only $1.99, so cheap! 
I like this hot pot place better than all you can eat places because the portions are bigger, the overall price of the meal is cheaper, and the quality of the food is better. They even have a better selection of food like wagyu beef and jumbo oysters! They also don't charge extra for holidays. 
They're currently having a 20% off promotion so come quick before it's over!
