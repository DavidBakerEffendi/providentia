I love and crave their food so much that I wish they were open 24 hours so I could indulge any time I want! I've been eating and bringing my out of town guests here for breakfast, brunch & lunch since 2004. I've come to love some things that may not still be on the menu but can still be requested such as the Banana Brown Sugar pancake, the California Turkey Pita sandwich with grilled chicken instead of sliced turkey. I also often order my omlettes as a "mini" since they are usually too big for me to finish. I can't get enough of their Gooey Buns and bottomless carafes of coffee! Thank you for being you, Le Peep!
