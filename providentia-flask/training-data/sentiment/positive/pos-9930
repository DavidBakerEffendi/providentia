The Venetian Hotel and Casino by other reviewers are lacking.
The rooms are big and have recently been updated. And it doesn't feel stuffy like others. 
The location is good. It's next to the Wynn, across from T.I it's good. 
THERE IS NO BUFFET! Which! doesn't cheapen the place. But there are cheapper options for food. There are two food courts but the one on the bottom is often mislooked but! if you find it! You'll like San Generro the italin place. Oh sooooo good. 

If you want romance. Try Pinot, Enoteca San Marco and Brassire. The Canal ride inside is better and longer than the one outside. Also when you get a canal ride you buy your ticket but you don't ride until an hour in advance. A couple ideas to try the wait time is the incredible chocolate shop next to the ticket place. (Im bias cuz i love chocolate.) But there is also Gelato in St. Marks Square that is good.

The stores weren't my thing, but there is a magic shoppe, the typical vegas shoppe and TENO (which is cheaper but luxurious jewerly) Also the Dumb boys store is funny. 
Tao is hella trendy to find celebrities. I saw Vin disel there. And V bar. Wayne Brady was there. Actually his show his at the Venetian and worth it. Also there is Blueman, which is different... and Phantom of The Opera. (Which is good but not my thing) also there's Madame Tussauds which seems freaky, but have some drinks and imagination because that place was fun. 
Oh and the gambling! I lost. But i don't do vegas for the gambling. 
One last thing~ the Canyon Ranch Spa is the coolest place to go. The massages are pricey but, i didn't feel like i got ripped off either. THe place is huge, and it even has a rock climbing wall (which i'll do next time!)
