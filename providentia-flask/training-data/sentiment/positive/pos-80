I love this place! The renovation is amazing and everyone should check it out!!! I liked it before but am so excited it re opened bigger and definitely better! The wasabi was hotter than you typically get, which was fine by me! The service was great, very helpful and accommodating. Sashimi was a bit smaller than I expect but it was good and fresh. Didn't try any of the rolls because I'm starting to get some with all this yelping! So excited to have another sushi choice in Gilbert!
