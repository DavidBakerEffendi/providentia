Between the amazing food and phenomenal service you can't go wrong. My friends each ordered an entree but I had dinner earlier in the night so just had chips and salsa. The portions were large and everything was priced reasonably. There was a musician present who played the guitar and sang and be really added to the evening. The restaurant is decorated very cute, as well, and you almost feel like you're in another country, which is a nice feeling! Definitely will be back!!
