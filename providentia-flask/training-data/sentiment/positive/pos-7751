I come all the way from mississauga to chitos to get their shawarma pizza when im craving it... Who else would have thought to put shawarma chicken, on TOP of your pizza slice then again top it like a shawarma with garlic sauce, hot sauce, and any other toppings u want... and then their prices are amazinggg u can get 2 slices for like $4-5? and trust me youll be stuffed, and will not be able to eat for a few hours...
