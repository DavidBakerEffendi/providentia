This is my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. The coffee cake is the best I've ever had! Beware: it has apples at the bottom, like an apple pie filling, which my husband prefers not to have. He will eat all of the fluffy cake parts though while I try to stab his hand with my fork. It's MINE!

Service is fast and friendly. My favorite breakfast meal is chicken fried steak and eggs, which is perfect here. My husband likes plain season potatoes without onions chopped into it...and that's what they serve here!

I've never had to wait for a seat here. I usually go before 11 am on weekdays, though!
