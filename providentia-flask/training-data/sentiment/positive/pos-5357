Outside the Bellagio on the Strip in the little " pond" is where you will find this little beauty of what I would describe as a symphony of water.  Remember the movie Oceans 11 ? Or was it 12? Anyway in one of them they walked out in the closing scene to this " water symphony " playing in the background in the dark. Which is actually when it is best viewed.....in the dark. Sure you can see it in the afternoon but it is better at night. It is a fountain which plays up and down along most of the length and breadth of the water in time to the music of a classical nature . Up and down it goes along the pond and at times spraying outwards  , not just straight up. It plays then rests then plays again..with the time between playing not all that long , so the wait if you come at the end or in the break is short. So beautiful to watch even with many people around, that we would even for the days we were there stop to watch it play several times in a row. Well worth stopping for if you are meandering down , or up the Strip.
