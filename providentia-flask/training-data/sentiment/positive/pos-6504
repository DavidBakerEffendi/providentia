My husband and I went to N9NE last night and it was fabulous! The restaurant is romantic and very sexy in decor. The music was a great mix of 80's and the wait staff was dressed in white suit jackets. The wait staff went above and beyond to make sure we were catered to. I asked for a drink that wasn't on the menu and they went out of their way to make it for me. My husband and I had salads, lobster bisque, onion soup, rib-eyes, creamed spinach and flour-less chocolate cake. They bread basket that they provided us was a delicious mix of pretzel bread, garlic bread and these fabulous small muffins. We are really picky about food and every entree hit the mark. The steak was FANTASTIC. N9NE is now one of my top favorite nice restaurants. I can't wait to go back.
