Wong's is hubby and my new go to Hakka place!

Went to Spicy Dragon for lunch but they were packed, so turned to trusty Yelp for some help. Looking for some affordable lunch specials and Wong's came up with a $. Yes it's in a small divey strip mall but the minute you walk in the door you'll be glad you braved the panhandlers (there was only one actually but it didn't sound as good without the "s"). 

Nice clean restaurant with lots of available tables, a strong aircon and free WiFi. I was enamored by their delicate cork art (see pics); the detail was so beautiful. The bubbly hostess was also our server. She was the sweetest thing: always smiling and helpful. With her detailed descriptions we decided on.... 

- Hot & sour soup with shrimp - should have gotten chicken because the shrimp were tiny and I didn't like the taste of them; however, the soup was spicy and flavourful and left a strong afterburn.
- Lung Fung soup - if you like egg drop soup, you'll like this. Chock-full of veggies, tofu and chicken.
- Chicken Pakora - crispy and flavorful on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.
- Chili Fish (dry) lunch special which comes with a tiny egg roll (bleh), rice and soup/pop. It was flavorful and the fish was moist.

Didn't see any dessert on the menu so I asked the waitress about it; she must have notice my sad face and went to talk to the chef (who happens to be her hubby). She came back and said that the chef could make us a deep fried pineapple dessert with vanilla ice cream drizzled with maple syrup OH YEAH! Tried the ice cream and I didn't like the taste of it;  but when we paired it with the warm deep fried pineapple and the maple drizzle, it was delish!

With lunch menu prices at $5.95, nice ambiance (inside), and exemplary service; Wong's blew Spicy Dragon out of the water! It was nice knowing you SD.
