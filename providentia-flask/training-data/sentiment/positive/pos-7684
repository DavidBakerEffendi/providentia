My family and I love Juans. The fajitas are amazing and I love that they have the romaine wrap alternatives for those of us on strict diets. I usually always get something different every time I come and it's always been amazing. The chicken fajitas have been my most common choice lately, but I do really like the chicken tacos and the mole. The service is very friendly and fast. I appreciate that the owners work in the restaurant and ensure that everyone is happy with their experience. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a delicious Mexican meal in the southwest.
