I just love this place. The location is perfect because it's just a few steps off the Strip but you don't have to pay the kind of prices Strip hotels charge. 

I thought the food was great from start to finish and I really appreciated the simplicity of the menu and the "all-inclusive" pricing. The cappuccino they include, I'm almost positive, is actually one of those General Foods International Coffees. Who cares, it's tasty!
