Wonderful place we happened upon for lunch.  

All meatballs, all different kinds.  We didn't want anything especially heavy so we opted for salads each with one meatball.  I got a chicken while my husband got beef.  They were both extremely flavorful and the salads were so fresh and good.  

Our waiter was really great and explained everything to us.  

Their meatball of the day was a bacon cheeseburger, which sounded awesome but I was in a chicken mood.  

We will definitely go back next time we are in town.
