For me, this is the best Lan Zhou ramen in Toronto.  It reminds me of magic noodle when they first open.  Soup is tasty and portion is big.  Price is under $9 for a big bowl of hearty noodle that neighbouring stores cannot beat.  Staffs are extremely friendly and the store owner is super nice.  I heard the table beside me got the wrong noodle and the owner just gave them an extra bowl free of charge.  Free wifi and they accept credit card.  If you love spicy, make sure you add the chilli sauce!
