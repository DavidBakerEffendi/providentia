After living in Madison for 5 years now, Estrellon is just simply one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. It never disappoints, and I would say that Estrellon serves up some of the best Spanish cuisine I've ever had. The seafood paella is excellent if you're a seafood lover - lots of fresh fish and incredible flavors. You can tell that the chefs pay attention to little details, with every ingredient meshing together seamlessly for an exquisite dish. They also have many creative appetizers (fried guacamole...yum!!!) and sliced jam√≥n....everything is always delicious. Don't shy away from the seasonal paellas, as well as their dessert - their basque cake is up there with my favorite desserts of all time.

Overall, Estrellon is an excellent choice for fine dining Spanish fare. It's a perfect place to go for a fancy night out or a romantic dinner! Absolutely recommend.
