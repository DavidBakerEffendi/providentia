This place is pretty awesome and very unique. Like they have so many activities and games to play to really keep your night fun. And it's way bigger once you go inside. There's a dance floor, a bar, and even a creepy bed next to the dance floor (why is that even there)
Then you walk outside and see a live size game of beer pong, cornhole, four square, and other games that remind you of the good days during recess. The music is cool, it varies per night. But there's always a good crowd and a good vibe.
