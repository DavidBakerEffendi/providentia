I love Greenland market! It is an excellent Korean-owned asian grocery store and carries a lot of varied products. 

Their fresh meat selection is awesome. Everytime my Mom is in town I always make a trip to Greenland to stock up on Korean-style short ribs so that she can marinate them (and so that I can have a freezer full of Mom's delicious bulgogi short ribs nom nom nommm).

The prepared foods section is very good too. I have had jobchae, kimchee, kimbop and seaweed salad from there.

The food court is perfect for when you need a quick bite before grocery shopping, knowing that if you walk in to Greenland hungry you will end up buying everything in the store. My favorite food court item is the mussel champong (spicy seafood and noodle soup) from the stand in the corner, the name escapes me. So yummy.

Be sure to get your Greenland Market rewards from the cashier. For every $500 you spend, you get a $10 coupon/voucher to use towards future purchases.
