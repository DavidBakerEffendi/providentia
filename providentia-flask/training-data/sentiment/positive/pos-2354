YAAAAAAAYYYYYY!!! This was my first event for Yelp that I attended. Lil Man and I were so happy to check it  that they had little things for the kids like the bounce houses for them to get into and jump around. And let's see. When we first got there, we were greeted by the cashier and she directed us towards the back so that Lil Man could get his fingerprints taken and his picture taken. Then we went to get our yogurts. I had a cup full of orange sorbet mixed with their newest addition of hawaiian delight sorbet. Then I had mine topped off with mangos, pineapples, cherries, and blackberries. Lil Man wasn't sure about getting one because he left Yogurtland the last time with a not such a great taste and a bad impression of yogurts, but as soon as I convinced him to try the hawaiian delight sorbet, he was hooked. So, he went and got a cup and filled it up as well with, of course, hawaiian delight sorbet, vanilla, and some others... he went on his own to make his own recipe. I was able to see what his recipe was because I had to hold the cup while he added cherries, cherries, and more cherries with strawberries and more strawberries. He is a fruit addict like his mama. LOL.. Afterwards, we were satisfied with our choices and walked out with full bellies of yogurt and fruits.
