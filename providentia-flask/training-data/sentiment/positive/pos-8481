I cannot find fault in this place.  They serve consistent superb food.  I can honestly say that they have the best meat lovers pizza, which you can elect to be spicy, to which they add a slice of green pepper and chilli flakes.  The pizza crust is light, crunchy and delectable.  All their pizzas have copious amounts of premium toppings and you can get your pizza crust either on white bread or whole wheat.  They also serve a mouthwatering veal sandwich and yummy meatballs.  Basically if you want a hearty gourmet meal, this is the place to be.

They also serve hors d'oeurves such as cod fish balls with plenty of tasty cod fish and empanadas with light flaky crusts with juicy tasty fillings.  Unfortunately, they only serve the hors d'oeurves on Fridays apparently.  However, I came in this Friday and they did not have any!!! NO! please make this part of the regular menu.

Now this place is not only a restaurant/takeout place, it is also a deli market, a coffee shop, a fresh bakery, has a small amount of European groceries and an LLBO.   They have a clean dine in area with a tv, so you can catch up on news, as well as a patio.

Now, they offer all the above along with affordable prices!  Winner!  You can make your own full pizza box consisting of six slices for $13.99.  If you order a custom pizza, it is about $18.00 with tax.  Friendly service, great food, clean place, like I said, Molisana Is a winner!
