So there's been this craze and talk about a place called Jimmy Johns, and I really had no flippin idea who they were or what it was..All I knew is that I "MUST HAVE IT" according to their biggest fans and sub connoisseurs lol. 
I've now tried two of the menu items...#5 and the #10 both are sooo good. It's a nice place and alternative to go to instead of the played out pizza joint when the bars let out. And for a 8inch sub it cost you anywhere from $4.35 to $5.35. That's a great deal!
