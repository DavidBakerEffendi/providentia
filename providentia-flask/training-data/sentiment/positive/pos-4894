I've been here twice since they opened and I can definitely say that this is the best TexMex food around the Charlotte area.  The fish tacos are quite good, but any of the combinations are excellent, too.  Try the Jalapeno dip and fresh salsa, but don't fill up too much!
Parking is a chore, but know that going in and you'll be fine.
