Food was fantastic. We went here for restaurant week and unlike other restaurants that changed their menus to include something cheaply made with a upscale twist, Sonoma used items that were on their regular menu.

The wine selection was extensive but pricey. 

We had a good experience and would definitely go back. If you are staying in the hotel next door definitely check this place out.
