First off. It's a BBQ joint, not a fancy sit-down chain restaurant with hot girls in short-shorts and tight t-shirts. Most BBQ places are order-at-the-counter, eat off of paper plates and baskets. (The great ones anyway.) Not ever gonna' throw down cuz a BBQ or Chicken place doesn't behave like a sit-down restaurant. Don't even care if they don't have tables. These places concentrate on one thing: Food. And my friends, Moe's has got that food part down-pat! It's dayamn good!!! You can tell all the sides were cooked with "love" (butter & pork fat) and you won't care. So so so SO super yummy! I had Mac & Chz that was perfection and my friend had some squash casserole that was so good she couldn't stop making yummy noises. And this is the 1st establishment that I've found that actually rivals my collards. That is no small feat. (I make some mean collards.) And the BBQ?? AMAZING. Tender and sweet and tangy! YummO! Well done!! Will definitely be back. Again and again. Wanna' try EVERYTHING!!!
