Rush is truly an experience for the senses. The menu is as beautiful as the decor (so is the wine list).

If you're feeling adventurous, put yourself in the hands of their Chef, Sommelier and wait staff by choosing the tasting menu with wine pairings. The portions are perfect, ensuring you can make it to the end of the meal without needing "buffet pants". 

Beware the faint-of-heart or spendthrift...this experience will run you $95 for the tasting menu and an additional $65 for the wine pairings before taxes and gratuity. If you want a taste of their superb cuisine without the investment, dining a la carte is also available. My recommendation is to save up and do the full experience - it is worth every penny.
