We went last night for dinner and we previously went when it was Joeys seafood. I was happy to see all you could eat fish fry for a reasonable price 14.00. We went at 5:30pm, which was perfect because it picked up soon after. We had no wait and our server was pleasant and helpful. We had a longer than average wait for food (i think because i ordered a ny strip) and he came over twice to apologize. We were not in a rush or starving so it was fine. Got our food and it was great! Steak cooked perfectly and fish was crisp and hot. I told my husband i want to go back, most likely for Valentine's. Also we got some envelopes with percentage off coupons. Only kicker is you dont know what you will get until you come back to eat or else they are void if opened. Loved it!! :)
