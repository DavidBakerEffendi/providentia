I took my parents here when my folks were visiting me from out of town and let me tell ya, I was not disappointed.  First off we showed up a little late with hubby and my parents in tow on a Friday night without reservations. We were told by the hostess that the wait would be 30 min, which was totally reasonable. Fortnutanely we were able to be seated within 15, not only that during our wait we were provided with glasses for some of the wine that we brought along for our dinner.  Anyway our server poured us some wine and shortly thereafter we were seated. 

Our waitress was incredibly attentive and had some really good recommendations. Amongst them was their meatloaf (which my husband loved and said it was the "best I've ever had"), and the caramelized brussel sprouts. 

I initially was rather hesitant to order duck which my husband was urging me to do. I had a previous experience where the duck was dry and stringy as well as real greasy.... not what I would want. But I went for it and was so glad I ordered it!!! The duck was probably the best I have ever had. It was juicy, tender, and incredibly seasoned. It was a total delight to devour. 

This place was one of the many places that I have been meaning to visit and I was so glad that we took a chance and took my parents here. Love the ambiance, the services, and most of all the food. I honestly think that anything from this menu may just turn out to be amazeballs. I can't wait to come back!!

PS bring a bottle of wine as they are BYOB! 

Cheers!!
