Service is good and friendly also.  Each of us got a personal greeting when we walked in the door.

We went with a 4-person lunch crew, and we ALL liked EVERYTHING we ordered.

The fried fish was crispy and flaky-tender.  Onion rings, we could smell the beer batter.  Potato salad made in house.  Pastrami and cheese sammich was a winner.  Green chili burro was good, but the "red chile" bowl that came with it was even better.

Portion sizes are a good value and taste is even better.

If you are in the area, you should stop by and give these nice ladies some business - we need more places like this to stick around !!

P.S.  Corrected info.
