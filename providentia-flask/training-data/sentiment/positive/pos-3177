I'm really suprised that this place hasn't received more reviews...since these cookies are AWESOME!  I would expect all future reviews to be just as glowing, b/c seriously these chocolate chip cookies are so yummy.  They are what chocolate chip cookies (ccc) were meant to be - the person who invented ccc probably envisioned them to be just as tasty as the way Nancy B's makes them.  

This place is challenging to find if you've never been there before and couple that with the construction and it's a freaking treasure hunt - but the treasure is well worth the hunt.  The hours are inconvenient for those of us who work 9-5 during the week, but if you can manage taking a half day this trip will be worth your time.  

Also they only take cash so don't forget the greens!  I also recommend (so does the owner) to call ahead for the more popular items such as ccc and snickerdoodles, these sell out fast so if you call in the morning to put in the order they'll have your box waiting for you when you arrive.
