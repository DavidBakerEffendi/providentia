For my sons 11th birthday ( he wanted to ride the saddle)! Our waitress, Ashley, was polite and on it! The staff really went out to make the experience fun.  The food is always great.  8oz sirloin, medium with mushrooms and shrimp on the side YUM!  This location never disappoints and of course we will be back again.
