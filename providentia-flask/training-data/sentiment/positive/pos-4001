Listen, seafood lovers! 

SPICY SQUID!! 

Now run to this place and order it. Nothing else, because it comes with 4 banchan, and a bowl of rice. You'll be full, I guarantee. 

Let me elaborate about this particular dish.
Pretty simple, first of all. 
It's squid, cooked in Korean spicy sauce, which I'm sure mixture of gochujang and something else. That's it.
The highlight of the dish is, the texture. 
I know a lot of people may stay away from squid because of its texture. But that's because when cooked wrong, it's just rubbery and chewy but you can never really bite it off or into small pieces so you don't know when to swallow?
Not at Island Style. Their squid was cooked perfectly, so while it's still bouncy, it has bite to it, and you can bite it off. It's a really fun, pleasant mouth feel, and you can't stop eating!!

4 banchan includes macaroni salad, napa kimchi, radish kimchi, and silver noodle tossed in creamy dressing. All of them offered different taste, flavor and texture, and well balanced.

The man at the counter was so kind. Not only he offered a bottle of water for my child sleeping in my stroller, he offered to bring  my plate to my table (it's a food court and I was ready to walk with this plate on my one hand and push stroller with the other. Things I do for food when I'm hungry.....lol).

I'm definitely going back, and would recommend this place to anyone!!
