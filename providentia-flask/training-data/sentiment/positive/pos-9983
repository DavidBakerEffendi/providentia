Always loved this place and its never let me down.

Delicious onion rings, large portions of a burger, have veggie burger options, many toppings, they have ice creams (that are great), a wonderful environment (space), and nice service. One of the best burger places to go in Whitby, and even Durham region.

Worth a try, and you'll probably be back.
