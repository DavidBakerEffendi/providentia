This place is long overdue.  Working downtown and living nearby, we have long complained about our lack of options between here and home.  By the time we leave, most Strip grocers are closed, and that other market that is open in the Strip just doesn't seem fairly priced or offer much in terms of a selection.

Lots of unique cheeses, fresh produce, meats and seafood here.  A great coffee bar, Gaby et Jules bakery, and more.  I'm looking forward to becoming a regular here!  If you live near or in downtown and work here, I am sure you will enjoy this spot too!
