This place is the real deal for sushi. Having had some of the freshest, best sushi living in San Francisco I can honestly say this place is equal if not better in quality and service. The staff,  particularly the owner work to make your experience wonderful and your glass is never empty. Very decently priced rolls and appetizers.  We got the stuffed jalepe√±os and super crunch crab to start.  Omg... amazing.  For rolls we got the crab mania, spider roll and  OMG roll that they set aflame at your table to barbecue the eel. My boyfriend's fave was the crab mania roll (loaded and topped with delicious crab meat). From start to finish our food and overall experience here was top notch.  Definitely our new go-to sushi spot.
