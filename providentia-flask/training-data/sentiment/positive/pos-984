Wait!  You haven't checked out the happy hour here?  Stop reading and do so and afterwards continue reading.  From 5-7, small plates and wine are only $6 which given the quality of the food and wine is a damn good value.  Throw in the patio on a nice summer night and this maybe my new go to spot for after work refreshments.
