My mother and I spontaneously decided to stop here for some wine and cheese and we were very pleasantly surprised.

Although it's located in the middle of Crocker Park, 87 West has managed to create a peaceful ambience. Upon walking in there are signs indicating for you to "make yourself comfortable". I personally love choosing my own seat so this was very nice! There are several styles of seating - from couches by the windows, to restaurant style tables, to patio furniture outside. 

Once we seated ourselves, our server promptly came over with cucumber water (LOVE) and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. It also happened to be happy hour and she told us all about the specials. She was so friendly, attentive, and sweet. My mother ordered the white sangria and I got their Chardonnay of the day - both were phenomenal. We also chose to get a cheese plate to share and it was AMAZING. I couldn't have handpicked the selections of cheeses better if I tried. We got 4 cheeses, fig jam, fresh strawberries,  dried apricots, toasted hazelnuts, and baguettes. It was one of the best cheese boards I've ever had! 

But the absolute star of the night were the post-wine and cheese martinis that we both ordered. My mother got a chocolate truffle martinis and I did the double espresso martini. She loved hers and mine was AMAZING. I wasn't expecting a wine bar to have such tasty dessert martinis but I would honestly come back just for those. SO good, I highly recommend trying it! 


All in all I will definitely be back. I love the casual and relaxing ambience. The service was impeccable and our drinks and cheese plate were amazing!
