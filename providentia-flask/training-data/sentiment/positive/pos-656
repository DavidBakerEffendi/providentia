Number One Pho is number one in my heart! I love Asian food, and this place definitelyâ€‹ has a ton of tasty options to choose from!

To drink, I got the mango bubble tea. I'm obsessed with bubble tea, so my standards are pretty high when it comes to this tasty drink. Number One Pho surpassed my expectations, and the tea to tapioca bubbles ratio was perfect! It was perfectly sweetened.

I got the fried tofu for dinner, and it was cooked to perfection. It came with a soy sauce, which was a perfect complement to the tofu. 

Next time I'm looking for some authentic Asian food in Cleveland, this place will be my first choice!
