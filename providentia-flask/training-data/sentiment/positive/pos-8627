First of all, I'm not going to compare this place with any Korean restaurant in California.  It's just not fair.  In Vegas standards, I suppose it's just okay.  I wouldn't say that this place is really delicious, but this place will definitely get you full off of banchan, rice, and the main dish.  Pricing is a tiny bit steep, but it's understandable. 

Quite frankly, the food isn't really all that, but then again... not only are we in Vegas, but we got there around closing time (1:20am and they close at 2am). Definitely made us happy because we were starving and it hit the spot. LOL

Just to be fair, we'll come back again and try other dishes..maybe this time, during their lunch or early dinner hours. Don't come at 1 hour before closing like us. 

For now, this place is a winner for those looking for a clean and spacious restaurant especially for large groups!  Oh and if service is more important than food, this place is for you!

Banchan was just okay, but I wouldn't recommend eating their kimchi. Soondae was definitely not restaurant-made, but it tasted decent. Their ddukbokki had great flavor, but the dduk was overcooked.
