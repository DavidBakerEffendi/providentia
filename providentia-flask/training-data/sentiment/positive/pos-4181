Initially was super excited to try something new, except as we walked in the dining room conga dance style, I started to question myself.  It was completely dark, NO LIGHTS whatsoever.  As I sat there with my eyes closed wondering why in the hell were my eyes closed, I opened my eyes and relied on my other senses.  

Not a vegetarian/vegan; food was amazing!! Flavorful and smelled amazing.  Everything was seasoned to perfection.  I was able to not only enjoy my delicious food but also my lunch date.  No cell phone interruptions!!! Amazing concept for a restaurant.  Thank you for bringing something amazing and affordable to LV.
