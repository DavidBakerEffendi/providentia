I guess this could be called a post humous review, as they have closed down, and have been taken over by a specialty pizza place 

I probably at here a couple dozen times, the number one thing that brought me back was the incredibly nice and friendly owner, Jim. Finding someone like this running a business, getting his hands dirty and chatting up his clientele is a rarity, but something I fully understand, being self employed myself. 

I can go on about the food, but it's a pretty moot point at this point as you can no longer enjoy the meals, but I mostly grabbed sandwiches (veal, meatball, chicken, sausage) but even indulged in the pastas as well as the  pizza many times. Great prices and great flavour. Coupled in with Pop Shop soda in the fridge rekindling childhood memories. 

I was sad to see what looked like a midnight move took place, but I know they were not the busiest, and sometimes life happens. Bummed me out though as there were not a lot of well priced great eats in the area, and it is an area I would frequent.

So why bother writing, well if Jim ever sees this, it will serve as a reminder that he was appreciated, and he did have a decent restaurant.
