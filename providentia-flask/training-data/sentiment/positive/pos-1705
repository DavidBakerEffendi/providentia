(*not E.L.)I am a native of Cleveland, but live in Las Vegas now.  I make Pickle Bills a must each time I am home.  We go each August to celebrate my niece's and dad's birthdays.  There are usually about 15 of us and EVERYONE gets the all-you-can-eat crab legs.  While you are spending about $30 + for your dinner, it is totally worth it.  With AYCE you don't have to waste time digging out every last bit of crab; you can just ask for another bucket.  The service is always great.  We let them know ahead of time to just keep the crab, butter, and lemon coming and they do.  We never have to wait to find our server.  
The decor is unlike any I have ever seen and it makes for a very enjoyable experience.  The drinks are good and the clam chowder is great too.  The bread and cinnamon butter is incredible, just watch out if you are getting the AYCE anything because it is very tempting to fill up on the free bread.
In addition to crab legs they also have add-ons for only $2 and these used to be $5 so they are recession conscious.  It is my recommendation that all seafood lovers in Cleveland make this your destination.
