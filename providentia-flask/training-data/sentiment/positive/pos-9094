You know this hotel is fancy when the curtains open and close by a remote control. AWESOME!!!!

This was my first time staying at the Venetian and I feel completely spoiled.  It also didn't help that we had VIP service for everything (my friend is a VIP). Our room was free, we had a free restaurant voucher, and we got free gambling credit for the slot machines!!! This hotel really takes care of their guests, and that's probably why their guests are so loyal.

The entire hotel is beautiful.  Except for the weird smell in the casino and lobby of the Venetian, I really enjoyed all the shops, restaurants, and performers (people posing as statues, gondola singers) here.  Everything is open late, if not 24 hours, so you never have to leave the hotel!!! Besides a male revue show, we stayed inside the hotel for almost the entire time. I don't think I can stay at any other hotel that's of lesser quality than the Venetian now that I've experience how wonderful everything is here!
