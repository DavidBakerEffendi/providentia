This is my new favorite hotel in the Phoenix area. 
There is no additional charge for parking, of which there is plenty. 
When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the pleasant smell. I was greeted immediately. My room was ready with no issues whatsoever.
When staying for more than overnight, you are given an option to decline maid service and for every night that you do that they will give you a voucher that can be redeemed for either $5 at the restaurant or at the pantry OR you can redeem it for 250 Starwood/Marriott points. I use the points because they add up and upgrade your guest status. 
My room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I know that it is a dog friendly hotel, however If I didn't know I would never know. 
It was an all around very very good experience. I will stay here on my next visit. 
I highly recommend this hotel!
