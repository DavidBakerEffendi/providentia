This place rules!  I came here for my anniversary and they went above and beyond all of my expectations.  They personalized our menus, served us a free dessert and took our picture which they gave to us complete with a paper frame at the end of our meal.  I tossed the frame but the picture is still up on my fridge.  The food was delicious as well the steak was juicy and flavorful and my lobster tail was soft buttery perfection.  They also have killer happy hour deals, Roys would be hard to beat
