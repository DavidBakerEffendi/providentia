Finally a fresh hand pulled noodle shop opens up in Toronto. After watching countless videos on YouTube of people posting their overseas adventure, this place really replicates just that. Love the glass window display that allows you to watch your bowl of masterpiece be pulled. 

Went with both the soup and dry noodles. Thin noodles with the soup and thick for the dry. After eating both, I think I definitely made a mistake getting the thinnest noodles with the soup. Soup is rich in beef flavour. Meat is tender. The sauce that went with the dry noodles was nice. Will be coming back for more! Definitely feels authentic.
