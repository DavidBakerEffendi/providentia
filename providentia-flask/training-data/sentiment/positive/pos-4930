Came here for a 'late brunch' and gahh, it was too good.  Plenty of selections, all were fresh & delish and great staff.  Who puts out vanilla sauce, butterscotch and fudge drizzle for gelato?  Cravings does.  And a giant vat of fresh whipped cream.  I can hear my buttons starting to pop, lol.

But seriously, really great.  BF & I are definitely ranking this as our top 3, with the other 2 being Flamingo & Cosmopolitan (BF likes Aria's chinese selection, but we don't favor it as a whole).

Plenty of seafood selection, and the ceviche was a delightful treat, seeing that I haven't seen that in the other buffets, with a great amount of kick.  Large prawns too for the cocktail, so also a plus.

Service was very good.  No need to ask for refills, he would always come by & check on us.  Didn't wait in line either, luckily enough, since the lunch rush came right after we sat down.

They were constantly putting out new/hot trays, so definitely glad that they're not making giant portions and leaving them out there to sit.  Will definitely be back here!
