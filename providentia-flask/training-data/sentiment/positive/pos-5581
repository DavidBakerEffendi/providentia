I went here with my friends on a Friday night and the food was killer! I haven't had sushi this spectacular in quite some time. My pals even stated that it was the best sushi they had ever had (and he's been to numerous countries). The only flaw of the place was the waitress who was inattentive and rarely came to check up on us (it was busy granted, but she seemed to visit other tables more often than our own). I still rate it a 5 star in light of her poor service.
