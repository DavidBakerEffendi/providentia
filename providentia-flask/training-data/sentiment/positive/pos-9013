May very well be the best sandwich shop in Toronto. Yep, I said it.

Went with my female friend on a late Sunday and ordered the porchetta with an Ace Hill pilsener and the large arugula salad. She split the salad with me and had the piri piri chicken sandwich and some LC ale but can't recall the name. sandwiches are more or less $10 a pop and the tallboys were 6.5 each.

Girl taking the order was a sweetheart, very engaging and informative. The design is nice and chill, the music was very a solid and eclectic mix of chill lounge, hip hop, and rock. 

The food was off the chain good. My friend agreed fully. You wait 10 mins for the order because it's made properly. The ingredients are uber fresh (aioli and porchetta is insane good) and the portions are solid for a guy who works out but doesn't want unnecessary filler in his system. I had a bite of her piri piri chicken, which featured a thick chicken breast, and having stayed in Africa for a long time I know proper piri piri and this is a milder version of the traditional Mozambican or South African version, in a good way.

When a meal is so good you order the buttermilk chicken (huge sandwich btw) to go and then eat it at 1am you know the place is spot on. East York needed a joint like this and don't be shocked to see a few of these pop up across T.O. over the next year or two.
