This was the first time I had Mediterranean Food and I was not disappointed, the service was SUPER FRIENDLY, felt very welcome when we came in! They have vegan options as well, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich, amazing it was, and some homemade fries. Definitely will be coming back here again for sure, Thank you so much! :3
