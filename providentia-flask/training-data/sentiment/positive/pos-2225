The menu looks awesome!  I love the vibe, and I will definitely go back.  I want to try their breakfasts. I had a bahn mahi.  The bread was perfection!  I thought the fish was a little salty, but I enjoyed the sandwich.  I also tried the mac and cheese.  Even though it had bacon in it (I do not usually eat pork), I had to try it!  Very rich!  

Michael the manager/owner was very friendly.  Staff was excellent.  I love that they serve Peixoto coffee.  I can't wait to go back!
