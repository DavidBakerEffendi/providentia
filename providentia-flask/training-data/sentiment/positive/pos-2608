This is a great family low key restaurant. The food was delicious! We opted to dine in, but we saw lots of people coming in to pick up their orders. We ordered calzones which were fabulous, not too much dough and stacked with filling. I also had their salad with their homemade dressing (which they sell!!). They do have bar seating too and offer wine and beer. Definitely a place to make a "go to".
