Not knowing that they essentially shut down from 3-5, I walked in alone at 3:30 to grab a bite/drink and kill time waiting for a friend in the area. As no one was around, I found myself asking the owner (Moe) if they were in fact open. So easily could he have shooed me away, but instead he welcomed me in. 

I had the burger, fries and a beer. Simple but classic. The burger was juicy and the non-ordinary bun/sauce really paired well with the onions and portobello mushrooms. Filling without being too heavy. This is the first restaurant I have seen that really nailed the shoe-string fries. Recent changes to the menu have added a lot of mouth watering plates, and had I had a significant appetite there would have been too much to chose from. Excited to return for happy hour martinis and live music.

Food is must try, and the great ownership / service are what keep people coming back.
