Went there for my birthday and with cousins who visited from the states. The place is a little hard to find. But we can locate it easily following their instructions on our reservation. Love the ambience and  decor of the place.  The  staff was warm and friendly, very willing to accommodate our request in moving to a brighter table. 
I didn't specify that it's my birthday when I booked the table. Our waiter was very attentive and took it very seriously once he learned about it. 
We ordered a few dishes to share. The Salumi plated of 5 choices of cured fish, the raw Branzino,  which is unforgettable. Love the way they prepared  the fish in front of you. The Burrata pizza, so light, it's to die for, Stardette and Bigoli, Polipo E vongole, are all very delicious. 
At the end, to my surprise, they prepared a pack of freshly made pasta complete with special olive oil, cheese and cooking instructions for me to take home  as a birthday gift. How nice of them!
Price is on the steep side, but worth it, consider the service and quality of food. Their menu is very unique, at least in Toronto. Be prepared for lots of seafood. It's best to share your dishes so as to taste everything.
