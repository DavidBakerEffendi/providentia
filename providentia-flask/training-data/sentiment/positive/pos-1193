Great service here, I am new in town and don't have my car with me yet, needed food and found JC cuisine , they got me a quick delivery and even put me ahead of a big far casino order because my apt is very close by, big thanks to them for helping me out, orange chicken was good , provide drinks and delivery service !!! Highly recommend especially for the price
