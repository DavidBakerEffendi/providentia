Swan, I love you.

Just went there for lunch. Easy to get a booth (although did pick up quite a bit by the time we left). Great casual atmosphere. Great friendly service. 

I had a chicken club. BEST club sandwich I've ever had, with bits of bacon everywhere tossed in with the chicken, some type of yummy dressing, and green. Ugh..so darn tasty. The sandwich was huge, only ate half and was stuffed.

Cost? $10. I am so coming back here. I was looking at what other people ordered, the salads look awesome! So excited to find another favourite place in Toronto!
