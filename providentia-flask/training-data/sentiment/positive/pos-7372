If I could,  I would give this wonder 10 stars. The show is at the fountains in front of the hotel. The water literally dances to the music that is played, anything from the Beatles to Andrea Bochelli. The lighting, and the water cannons that shoot the water into the air are spectacular. At night, the show is every 15 minutes and each time the music and the show changes. You have never seen anything like this. Do not miss this when you go and enjoy!!
