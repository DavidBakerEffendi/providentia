So I've stumbled upon this place because I miss my friends mothers cooking and I was in dire need of some Thai food. Its located in the Kmart parking lot next to this lash salon and Idk what else. As I walked in i was hesitant on the food since there was only one other couple. 

I ordered my usually skeptical meal for a Thai place of Pah thai with tofu, yellow curry, jasmine rice and papaya salad. Everything and I mean everything was amazing!!! How can this place be empty?!?!! 

Service was great, ambiance was chill, music was nice, restaurant was super clean, etc etc etc!!! 

The most recent visit we ordered papaya salad, sea bass, and pad Thai. The fish was steamed to  perfection! We wanted the fried fish but they were sold out!!!! Next time...but she said the steamed was better anyways and I was sold. It came with fresh ginger ans bak choy with a thick kinda soy sauce...amazing! 

I hope this place gets its recognition but please don't get too busy when I come
