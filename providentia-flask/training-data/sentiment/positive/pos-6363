We had to drop our roommate off at the airport so we just yelped places around.  So glad I came across this gem.  You order first then seat yourselves, didn't seem overcrowded which was awesome because seats popped open.  We got the omelette and chipotle bacon burrito.  

Omelette- I'm super pickey with eggs.. this was SO good! Everything from the eggs to cheese to veggies were perfect.  I got wheat bread which sometimes can be grainy and dry, it was super moist and tasted great with the omelette, couldnt be happier.  

Chipotle bacon burrito- Awesome burrito the chipotle sauce complimented the dish so well and the tortilla was so soft.  

A bit on the oily side but its ok, its breakfast! 

Definately want to come back to try the eggs benedict.
