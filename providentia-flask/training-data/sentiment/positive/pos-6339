Today was our third trip to Ranch House Grille - we keep coming back because it's been amazing every time. The food and the service are both top notch. They have a small outdoor patio (about 5 tables), which is dog friendly. The menu is large, but not intimidating.

My personal favorites are the biscuits and gravy & the strawberry Belgium waffle.
