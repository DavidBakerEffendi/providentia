So they have catered to my school before and I tried the pasta. But the other day we were passing by and I was like hey let's try it. So we did. 

I got the big slice (actually 2 slices) of cheese pizza and my man got 2 of the big slices of pepperoni. I also got the sweet potato fries. He got a cherry Pepsi and I got water. Holy monkeys everything about this place is huge! The booths, the cups, the pizza, the sweet potato fries.... and the Cookie Pizza... OMG. We got the peanut butter chocolate chip and omg was it amazing! It came out with ice cream on top. It was so good. 

All in all all our food plus tip was $30. A little on the more expensive side, but the quality, size, and service was all 5 star.
