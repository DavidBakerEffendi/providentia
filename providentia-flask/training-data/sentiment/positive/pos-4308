New favorite Sushi place.  Fresh fish, good portions and great prices.  I love the Tusy roll.  It is fairly new, so there was a few hiccups with the service but that did not detract from the quality of the food.  Very friendly staff,  makes this place well worth the minor issues they are still trying to work out.  Try the dynamite, spider, asu, vegas and Maui rolls.  Vegas and Maui were on Happy Hour with an unbeatable price.  You will not see a Vegas roll like this one with 3 different kinds of fresh fish (salmon, tuna and yellowtail) and no cream cheese.  It was awsome.

Keeping my fingers crossed for good Happy Hour Sake Bombers once they get their Liquor license!
