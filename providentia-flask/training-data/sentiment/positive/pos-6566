"broke da mouth" - otherwise known as "superb".   I have a unique food allergy, and telling Russell about having a white and yellow onion allergy in a local/korean place was a laugh.  But, we came through with Spam dolsot ba-bim-bop!  I ate three servings of dang-chae (appetizers: kim chee, seaweed, pickled radish, pickled bean sprouts, marinated potato, kim chee cucumber, and boiled peanute) - saving half the main dish for home!  
Welcoming, fun, accommodating....delicious.  next time I'll go I'll post a photo of spam ba-bim-bop!    
this place is now a favorite...
