Old Vegas, you have to love it just for that! But the food is good (large portions).  Service is always good.  Bloody Mary's are the BOMB!!! We take our friends & family there when they visit.  I appreciate the history of the place and it's definitely a Vegas landmark that they haven't torn down yet.
