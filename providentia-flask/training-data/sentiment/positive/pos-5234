Not all Rosati's have the same owner.

59th Ave. location serves some of the best pan and Chicago stuffed pizza in the Valley.  Cheese, sauce, and crust all come together beautifully and remind me of Giordano's and other pizzarias in Chicago when I lived there.

Service is great.  Order is ready when indicated.  This location is take-out only.
