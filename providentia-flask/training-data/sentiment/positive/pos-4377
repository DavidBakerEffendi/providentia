this is a very interesting place to go if for no other reason than the setting....but don't do like we did and park in their lot across the street....parking available right by the restaurant........the food is great for breakfast, and the buttermilk biscuits are phenomenal...the young waitress was from White Center, a suburb of Seattle, where I grew up....she did a great job.....recommend this place to anyone....and buy an extra biscuit!!!
