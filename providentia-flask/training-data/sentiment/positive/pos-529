I was hired to work here before they officially opened, but unfortunately had to turn it down due to family issues and time constraints. I was very sad that I was unable to join their team, because it is ADORABLE! 

Good atmosphere, nice people, owner really seemed like a genuine guy to me. Also it is nice to get out of the starbucks/coffee bean rut.
