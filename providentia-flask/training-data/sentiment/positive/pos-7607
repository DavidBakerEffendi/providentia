What a concept!  A chipotle style restaurant but with Indian food!  I will be back for sure.  Food was out quick and the beer was cold.   Had a lamb meatball bbq meal with naan and a kingfisher.   Food was very flavorful.   However if I could give a 4.5 I would only because the rice was just rice, nothing special.  Needless to say, if this is a franchise, I'd be interested in getting in!
