They recently remolded the entire restaurant it looks great now. All the servers there, especially Stanley, Alan, Min, and Austin are always attentive and professional. The managers there are great too. They have a new dessert bar and the creme brulee was delicious. I had the loco moco and my boyfriend had the ginger salmon. Both great choices.
