Great find! Just happen to see this place while driving by. Been wanting to try Shabu Shabu and i definently know where i'll be going next time i want some good hot pot. We had 4 kinds of meat and unlimited veggies, tofu & tofu noodles to cook, the package also came with desert. 3 sapporo's and all for only $50. Very tasty, but light meal. Next time we'll try the sukiyaki. The wait staff was VERY friendly and we even stayed past closing time and they were still bringing us food. GREAT PLACE!
