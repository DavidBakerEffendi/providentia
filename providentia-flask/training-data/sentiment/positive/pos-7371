I enjoy Fired Pie. I like how the pizza is freshly made right in front of you and baked in minutes. 
I have never selected their suggested pizza options and prefer to go rogue. I start with a combo of the white sauce and presto as my base. Then, I pick toppings as a look at the choices and depends on my mood...and cheese... always extra cheese.
My topping technique leads to a unique pizza every time, but always delicious....
