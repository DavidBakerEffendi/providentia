First time here flew in early, my server was Hellena who exemplified excellent customer service and was very attentive.
My food was bought out nice and warm, fresh and well presented. It was quick service as well. When your ready to order you flip s little egg to yellow and they come to help you.
Would definately come back.
Place is clean, has booths and tables or you can sit up at the bar..
