Ok so I have never been disappointed whenever I've come here. Breakfast and brunch is awesome! This location is close to where I live and it is always busy! 

There are inside and outside seating for you to choose. TV to catch the game if you decide to grub on a Sunday and the environment is country casual.

Every item on the menu is pretty much home style comfort food but the warm banana nut muffins that most of the time you need to ask for is so freakin GOOD!

Anyhow if you haven't been here come. Foods great, people are friendly, sometime service can be a tiny bit slow but for the most part they are on it and super nice, so that makes up for it. I like it and my friends and family like it, and you will too!
