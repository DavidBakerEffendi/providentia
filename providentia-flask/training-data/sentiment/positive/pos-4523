Review #100 & it's for one of my favorite places, The venetian. I said it in my last review and I'll say it again "you get what you pay for" this place is worth the money.... Not the bait Fiji water, stay way from that s**t. Today I decided to pay the $45 a night for a room with a view, and Ohhh man! I'm glad I did a view of all the pools & strip (pictures below) but really how much time will you spend in your room to enjoy your view? So if you don't get a room with a view or you do, you made the right choice anyway you go. Have fun you're in VEGAS!!!
