The dine-in-the-dark experience at Blackout is very memorable! My team and I went for their lunch service and were pleasantly surprised at just how much we enjoyed the experience. Our waiter, Anthony, was patient and kind as we got acclimated to total darkness. He did a fantastic job at describing our surroundings before each course. The food was AMAZING, and the staff paid close attention to our dietary restrictions. They change their menu every three months, and I can't wait to go back for more :-)
