Can't go wrong at all ordering from The Golden Thai Kitchen..... My favorite is the #18 Pad se ew spicy..... The yellow curry is great as well as the Pad Thai, pineapple sticky rice, and spring rolls..... I'm sure everything on the menu is good.... The Golden Thai Kitchen is definitely a hidden gem.......Give it a try.....:)
