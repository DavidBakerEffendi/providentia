This place is like heaven to me.
It's so Vegas that I cannot even handle it. I walked into the bar and just pictured Sam and Ginger hanging out in a booth. 
The bar part of the Peppermill is exceptional, even with it packed the bartenders are cool af and personable they serve you quick. They're were also video poker which is a super plus.
We did come at lunchtime on a Saturday and we waited like an hour but waiting in the bar was awesome.
In fact once we were seated in the finding room I wanted to be back in the bar.
Service was great but i was served a very u see cooked egg. (Whites were raw) and I was turned off, but it won't deter me from returning to the peppermill. If I could live inside this place i would.
