What a fun, but expensive way to spend an afternoon!  Our group of four reserved a bay for 3 hours and played multiple games as well as enjoyed some tasty food and drinks.  I had the Angry Orchard rose cider (yum) and we shared the grilled chicken sandwich with tots, the bao bun tacos with brisket and the pretzel bites with mustard and cheese.  Each bay is also outfitted with a TV, so you can watch whatever sports are on at that time - NBA playoffs for us!  We'll definitely be back for some more fun with friends!
