before The Palazzo opened, this was my favorite place to stay...big luxurious rooms, it can accomodate 6 people, or more if you dont mind sleeping on the floor w/ sleeping bags

always had a great experience at the venetian, whether it'd be gambling, staying in the room, or clubbing at Tao. 

be part of their Club Grazie and you'll get some pretty good discounts

service was great; of course i will stay there again.
