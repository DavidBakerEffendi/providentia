Never did I expect to find such a vegan and vegetarian friendly restaurant in Cleveland!! The Root Cafe has the best tempeh reuben (or any vegetarian reuben) I've ever had and the selection of tea was fantastic! Plus the team working here was super friendly, and there was live music on a week night! I'll definitely be back every time I'm in town.
