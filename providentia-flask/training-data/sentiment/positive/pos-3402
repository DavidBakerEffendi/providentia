Went for the final night of restaurant week. Food was good. I had a filet cooked medium rare +, my son had the salmon which was the catch of the day, my husband had the pork chop. Peach cobbler and chocolate cake were on the dessert menu for the special. We were so full after our salad and entree we asked for our dessert to be boxed up. It was delicious! Enjoyed being able to try a new nice restaurant during restaurant week.
