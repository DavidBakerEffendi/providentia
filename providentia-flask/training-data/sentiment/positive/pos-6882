Went here for New Year's eve, Gary was our fabulous server -very attentive and shared lots of great information about the food. Our main course of fillet mignon and truffle mash potatoes were on point, perfect! Also had their signature chocolate lava cake, a little fancy for my blood but my husband ate every last bite. they also have a great happy hour, worth the money to splurge on a great meal. Also, their bread and multiple butters to dip in were delicious!
