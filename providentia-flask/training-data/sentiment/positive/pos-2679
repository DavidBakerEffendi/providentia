It's crazy I forgot to review this, so here goes ...  I could sum up my review of Los Dos Molinos by a statement the slightly intoxicated gentleman sitting next to me blurted out on my 1st visit here. And here goes:

I just saw Jesus in my beans.

Done.  Well, the beans he almost saw Jesus in were those on the plate of the Adovada Ribs. Hot. Hot. Hot. Way too delicious.  Not the ribs dish you're envisioning, you create mini burritos with this dish of spicy deliciousness. 

A local favorite. An out-of-towner never forget! I always go back whenever I'm in town...

Tell Jesus HI ... ;)
