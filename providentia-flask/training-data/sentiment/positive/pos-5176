This to me is a serious west side institution.  I lived here when I was a WESTIE I mean seriously every Friday night after work we would stop for happy hour beers a five dollar dog if we're gonna be out all night to five dollar dogs and we would hit the strip of bars and restaurants all divey but HIPSTER DIVEY.  Like where you think it's a local dive but you are spending $6-$8 on a beer - so not divey. 

This place has the hipster culture in full force - pinball machine, random Elvis lamp, and bartenders with hoodies, slouchy hats and that poet-esque skinny jean. 

The suggestion menu is there for folks that I think are afraid of getting a nasty combo when they've not thought about 108 toppings they could mix n match for a dog of perfection.  For me I am sure I've never made the same dog twice - in fact before my trip to the east side location in February the only yes I must have was a fried egg - even I've now branched out and I'm a self admitted foodie  banshee - and I won't eat the calories after having kids unless every bite is worth it (as it's sticking with me). 

But I digress so - delicious toppings that are must tries in no particular order...obviously the aforementioned fried egg, the spectacular southern bacon spiked greens, the pimento Mac n Cheese, that ridiculously good white cheese fondue, spaghettiOs and don't judge yes I said SpaghettiOs, Momocho mole sauce, homemade in-house sloppy Joe, Bourbon baked beans, just pick some numbers and try it out you can't go wrong! 

Prop shout out to the employees who didn't freak out when her 15 month old twins really made a mess no matter how much we cleaned up! Xo
