Holy smokes, Rocky, this place is legitimately epic!  Yes, I said it and I really mean it.  I've been deprived of sugar for the last three months, but I still mean it.  Ever since this place opened a couple of months ago, I've seen my friends check in here, raving about its deliciousness, especially the Duchess, Amanda M.  FINALLY, it was my turn to sample the goods and BAM!  It was worth the wait.  I won't rehash what all the other 5 star reviews have said, except to say that you should come to this place and try the gelato yourselves.  You can sample all you want and then good luck with making a decision.  I kind of knew what I wanted before I got here, so I went with the sweet corn, sampled the coconut, and had the duo together:  heaven!  I wanted to lick the bowl, I didn't, and now I wish I had.  I would like all future cheat meals to be scheduled here for the time being, especially since Amanda told me they usually have a flavor made with stevia.  Try it, you'll like it.
