I was planning to meet a friend for Sushi at another restaurant - Charm Thai (delicious, by the way). But their sushi chef was not in attendance today. So, i did a quick search on Yelp for sushi nearby. Blue Ginger came up. Neither of us had heard of it. But it just happened to be located in the plaza across the street, so we headed over. 

The inside is beautiful and we were sat and served beverages immediately. To our delight, we were given a 50% off sushi menu. This menu is active every Monday and Tuesday at lunch. The descriptions were clear and the special rolls looked delicious!

So we ordered, and what came was some super tasty sushi plated beautifully. The dynamite roll was....well....dynamite. Fresh, flavorful, and wonderful. Looking forward to exploring the menu more next week.

They also have other dishes inspired from different countries throughout southeast Asia. You can just tell right from the beginning that everything on the menu is going to be stunning. 

Delicious sushi in Parma? Serious? YES!! GO THERE!!!!
