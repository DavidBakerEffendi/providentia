Amazing! 

This place always hits the spot when I am craving something light and fresh. The owners are the cutest couple and have begun to recognize my order every time I call in. Which is rare for a restaurant, and why it is so awesome! 
Their food is always on point. I typically order the Crispy Rice with Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Pork Belly, and a Kalbi Bowl. Yes I finish it all and Yes it's the same order everytime! When I do dine in I always love trying their newer menu items, but when it comes down to placing a to go order, it's always the same because they never go wrong. 

The inside of the restaurant is absolutely adorable. It is a small space but they make the best of it. My favorite is the cash-out section. All the toys and lego's make it so unique. There is even a mini sushi restaurant doll house on the counter that SHE made! Such talent. Def. a must see while you are in there. 

Well this review made me want to eat there again!
