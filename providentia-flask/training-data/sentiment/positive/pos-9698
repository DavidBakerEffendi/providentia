I don't know why this place has a poor rating cause it is super good and authentic tasting. The simplicity of their recipes and the options to add toppings is simple and desirable. Plus you can't beat the local discount! Half off til December 23rd with local ID and players card! 

My boyfriend order the margarita pizza and loved it! I ordered the Porchetta with additional mushrooms  and it was delicious. The setup and order process was very easy, chipotle style ordering. 

The environment is pretty chill and casual. Your usual pizza spot vibe. They even have gelato for dessert to order if u like! I can't tell you enough the dough they used is freaking amazing. That's if u like the soft crust pizza. They aren't greedy with their toppings either. 

The service is pretty fast too. I would say one pizza is good for one person. It's nice to share too when your boyfriend orders a different one too! Haha definitely reasonably priced.
