What took me so long to discover this place? It's only been open for about 30 years! All around fabulous dining experience that doesn't quite exist anymore in Montreal. French cuisine at its finest, with service and ambience to match. 

First visit was for lunch. Started with the home made pâté de foie. Wow! Beautifully presented and even better tasting. Smooth like butter. Melted in my mouth. Nice veggies on the side, too. Main course was their Coq au Vin, a dish that's rarely seen in restaurants today. Again, it was over-the-top delicious. Beautifully braised chicken with not a bone in sight, with a sauce that was exquisite, sides of veggies and a generous scoop of perfectly mashed potatoes. 

I returned alone on a Friday night and sat at the bar (tended by Kazim the owner!). Cocktails were great, the steak was super tender and perfectly cooked, and the bonus was Alexander playing the baby grand throughout my meal. 

This place is a gem that needs to be discovered by anyone who enjoys the charm, service and craftsmanship of the fine French dining establishments of the glory years. And the biggest surprise was how reasonably priced it was. I will definitely be returning soon... and often. I want to try everything on the menu.
