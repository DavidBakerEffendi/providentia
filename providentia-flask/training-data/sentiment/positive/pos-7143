Now officially my favorite bar. Their happy hour (half priced apps and drafts 5 - 7, I think) is great because their fries are a must have, even if it doesn't go with your old fashioned cocktail. Cocktails are what they do best - I've fallen in love with their Montmartres. Take your parents or take a date, Kelly's is good for all occasions.

Double update: my fiance proposed to me here (over some fantastic cocktails and shrimp po'boys and under the dark pinkish lights), so I'd say it's pretty low-key and romantic too :)
