I love this place! I only discovered it recently through a friend, but it's already on my list of favorite restaurants. The food is fantastic! The drinks are fantastic! The staff is fantastic! Are you getting where I'm going here? After a very dismal and disappointing experience at another nearby Indian restaurant, I rolled the dice on this place and am very glad that I did. The ambiance really isn't 5-star worthy, but the overall experience takes it there. They also have this customer rewards program that gives you credit towards your next visit that is pretty cool. The food? Well let me tell you! The chicken stuffed with mushrooms and dates in the cashew stuff is awesome! All of the usual suspects are here and they are all wonderful! If you want spicy though, you need to ask here! Enjoy!
