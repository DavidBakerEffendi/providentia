Yes, these are as good as it gets.  I don't even like hot dogs but these, I like a lot, ok, I admit it, I LOVE these dogs.  The hot dog itself, ignoring the toppings, are HUGE.  Then you add toppings like cheese steak, or pastrami, and you get this over the top, humongous hot dog meal in a paper boat.  It's TDF.  It really is.

For sides, I have two words for you:  Euro...Fries.  So much garlicky,  pork belly, cheesy fried goodness.  YUM!

Run, don't walk, go there and bring an appetite.  And, btw, if you have this for lunch, you will still be full at dinner time.  The dogs are that big.
