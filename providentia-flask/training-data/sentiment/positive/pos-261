I stopped here for lunch on Friday, February 9. I was pretty surprised at how full the parking lot was! I was seated immediately and received excellent service from my server. I chose the spaghetti lunch special that included unlimited salad and breadsticks. Of course, the small pasta entr√©e took a backseat to the always wonderful salad and breadsticks. Thankfully, Olive Garden has kept the salad and breadstick recipes it has had for many years. These items always make me want to come back.
