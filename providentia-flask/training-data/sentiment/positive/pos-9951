I've been here over 10 times. Just like any restaurant it can be a hit or miss but for the most part  N Counter is definitely a hit! I started going here in college. My boyfriend and I would go hiking A mountain and after spending hours burning off fat we would go straight to N Counter for breakfast ( located at but not exactly at the base of A mountain)

Enviorment/Location:  To be exact N Counter is located in the heart of Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from ASU  (Go Sundevils!). The actual resturaunt is super cozy and inviting. In the spring/summer we like to sit outside and soak in the enviorment. 

Food: I can never go back to I-hop after this place. Food is always fresh, always hot and 9/10 times always  freaking delicious. Everyone I take here, loves it. The portions are also pretty decent.

Service: you pay at the counter so you don't exactly have a waitress but the staff is always friendly and happy. Food is served pretty quickly, so no unnecessarily long waits

Price: I was there two day ago and  got: a loaded egg white omelet,  potatoes, a side of bacon, and a peach Bellini (alcoholic) =$19.50

I would recommend you try!
