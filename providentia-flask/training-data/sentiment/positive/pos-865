First time checking out this new restaurant.  Great new look with a cool atmosphere.  The music was good at a nice level for having conversations.  Went with a big group and they accommodated our party and seated us very quickly. The food came out fast and in good fashion with sushi being first and hot food coming after. The food was great, the fennel roll was amazing, had to order another. Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu.
