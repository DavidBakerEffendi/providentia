Just an awesome meal.  Fusion to the max.  Burgers, sandwiches, brunch/breakfast dishes - all with the American/Korean flare you had hoped for.  I recommend anything pork belly but you can't go wrong with a sandwich or burger.  I came on a weekday and breakfast options were still offered, so I'm not positive what changes for weekend/brunch offerings, but I'm intrigued and would definitely come back to test it out.

I had the I had the Asian BLTA with pork belly and an egg.  Huge sandwich on Texas toast.  Honestly, impossible to eat, but forking and knifing it didn't take away from any of the flavor.  Sriracha it up and you're good to go.  I asked for spicy and it had no heat whatsoever, but it was still perfectly cooked and crispy.  Sweet potato fries were a little salty/underwhelming, but I do like a sandwich that comes with a side complimentary so I can't complain on that.

At Served you receive a full meal so expect to pay about $15 per person at least.  You will be full and content and surprised by the uniqueness and the beautiful presentation of the food.  You will feel taken care of by the staff.  As a restaurant, I also really like the cheap alcohol Happy Hour menu beginning at 2:00pm and the free Wi-Fi.  Give Served a chance for sure if you ever venture to this part of Henderson.
