I was in the neighborhood for lunch and I was so pleased the other day when I first experienced this place, so I came back for more!

The owner remembered me and had that same pleasing and chill attitude! Brought over the boiled peanuts quickly and took my order promptly as well:

Fish Jun: Alaska Pollock Fish Fillet dipped/wrapped in egg! I loved the Meat Jun so I wanted to try the fish version this time. Well, it was the same difference!! So Mother Freakin' Good!! Soo "ONO" as the islanders would say! Once its dipped in their sauce, its a done deal. I had to ask what was the origin of the "----- Jun".... The Owner told me that it was Koreans in Hawaii that started making this back in the day.. Gamsahabnida! (Thank you!) Koreans from Hawaii! 

I was also brought the napa cabbage, radish and sprouts (korean sides). On top of that, a small bowl of hot Saimin soup to cleanse the palate. Nice! 

Again, A Completely Positive Experience!!
