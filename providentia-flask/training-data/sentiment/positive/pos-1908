I got turned on to Jersey Mike's subs on a business trip, so I was pleasantly surprised to see one close to me in Phoenix. I love the sandwiches they make and love that I can see them slice the meat and cheese in front of me. But what makes this store great is the staff.  They are always friendly, they remember how I like my sub made and they seem to truly like their jobs.  I was in the store once when they were training new employees and I was impressed on how much they stressed cleanliness, personal appearance and customer service.
