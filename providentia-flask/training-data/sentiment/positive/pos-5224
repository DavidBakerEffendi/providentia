First of all I'm a regular here, coming in at least once a week for lunch. In other words, I LOVE this place!  Great food, wide variety, weekly specials, and a frequent diner card. 

The servers are super friendly and know their shi....stuff :) Virginia and Amy are awesome. 

Tomato soup - hands down the BEST I have ever had. Slightly sweet and very creamy. WOW. Serious mouthgasm. 

Smothered chicken - excellent gravy. I have had this one more times than I can count. Corn can be a little dry but you can always substitute a different side. 

Fried pickles - these are spears, not slices, but the breading has great flavor and is very crisp. 

Quesadillas and burgers are good, fairly standard but still tasty. 

All of their pastas are excellent. Can't go wrong here. 


Was not a fan of the meatloaf sandwich but the actual meatloaf dinner is well done. This sandwich is the only thing I ever ordered here that left me at all disappointed and I've probably stuffed my face with 3/4 of the stuff on the menu by now. 

Overall, their food has a home cooked, fresh flavor. Nothing tastes likes a tv dinner and for a sports bar, it goes above and beyond what I would expect for food. 

Love you Dillo, see you soon!
