Dropped by the College St location for a late lunch.  My partner & I ordered the Affumicato and Salsiccia along with 2 glasses of house red and the warm coconut cake to go.  The pizza was excellent perfectly baked with a generous amount of toppings.  The sauce had a nice tang to it and the bacon used on the Affumicato was crisp and smokey but not greasy at all. Ditto for the Salsiccia--the sausage used was not greasy but full of flavor.  What we additionally liked was the crust.  It was airy with a crisp finish and didn't leave us with a heavy bloated feeling afterwards. 

The show stopper for me was the warm brown butter cake.  It was the nicest dessert I have experienced in ages. The cake was moist and not too sweet and could easily be eaten on its own.  The icing, coconut and pistachio bits compliment it well.  The cake is stellar.  Staff are good folks, very friendly and approachable. Prices for the quality of the food is more than reasonable. Service was excellent.
