EXTREMELY UNDERRATED! First off I was shocked that no one was in here and it was just me and my boyfriend. This is a relatively new ramen-based restaurant. The previous ownership was Japanese BBQ and I promise you will not be disappointed with the change! 

Upon walking in I was intrigued with the buy one get one free Thai tea signs! They are my weakness and ultimately I do believe that they do match up to their prices and are worth every penny. Would come here just for the bobas! Tea station who?! 

Food: HUGE proportions. Working at a restaurant myself, I know when restaurants cheat off their food. While I didn't order there ramen, I was extremely pleased with there curry! The food actually had real chicken breasts. Best part of all? At max 10 minutes for such an amazingly large proportion! Big enough to satisfy bodybuilders too! :) 

Atmosphere: Authentic Japanese vibe and such a clean interior! Bathrooms are obviously monitored almost after every use! I was very shocked with the conditions of the entire restaurant. Plus the music isn't so loud and it helps a lot because the servers are always in sight! 

Service: outstanding service! Not only are they extremely friendly but they always remain extremely professional. They knew when to have humor and when it's time to order, they get down to business. Overall, i have recommended this location to all my friends and family. Thank you so much Yagyu! You never fail to please!

P.s ask about the coupons! On Tuesdays they give a great deal for a free appetizer with a number of visits than any other days!
