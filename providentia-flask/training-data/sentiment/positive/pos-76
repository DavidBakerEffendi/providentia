We came here for a quick, casual dinner after the Michael Jackson Cirque show. Service was fantastic and the food was delicious. Here is what we ordered:

Appetizers:
-crab cakes
-1 dozen oysters

Entrees:
-ciopinno
-bronzino

Dessert:
-peanut butter chocolate bar
-maple cheesecake ball

Everything was so good! I especially enjoyed the ciopinno, the broth was amazing. If you feel like (waist-line) splurging definitely order dessert. I will absolutely be back to RM Seafood.
