Came here again and everything was still great. Service was fantastic, we were being checked on frequently and making sure everything was ok! The salsas that come with the chips tasted better this time, however still ask for what other salsa they have in the back. This time we got a habanero and a tomatillo. Both were delicious!

Got the shrimp poblano and fatijas again, and the meat was just so tender!! The shrimp was cooked perfectly this time. The shrimp pieces are huge. For the price, you get a lot of food so it's well worth it since you'll have left overs the next day!
