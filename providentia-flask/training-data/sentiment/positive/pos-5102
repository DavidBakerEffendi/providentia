If you're willing to spend a little more on sushi, Sushisamba will be the only place you go to eat sushi from now on. Who would have ever thought that Japanese/Brazilian fusion would taste so delicious. 

Hands down, the Samba strip is the best sushi roll I have ever had in my life. Literally, after I went on my birthday I had dreams about the roll for the next week. Lobster, mangos, chives, rice, and peanut curry are my new found addiction. Realize that you only live once and because of that you deserve to try the better things in life. You have not lived until you have had two samba strips! Contrast the sushi with the five meats churrasco for a truly excellent meal.
