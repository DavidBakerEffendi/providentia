This place is off the chain! They have some of the most "weirdest" flavors. I tried Cheetoh flavored which was one of their new ones. It tasted like Cheetoh's but at the same time was a little sweet. It was really good. I also tried the rice pudding flavor. They said they make the rice pudding from scratch before using it for the gelato. It was also bomb. I ended up getting the soursop which was super nice. I even got a little lesson on the fruit. It's a Brazilian fruit that is a cancer fighter along with having other health benefits. Wonder where i can buy some of this stuff.
