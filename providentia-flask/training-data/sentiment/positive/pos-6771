The name alone gets 5 stars. It's a NYC thang.... We had  dinner with friends here and I was surprised by this beautiful treasure tucked in the Pinnacle Peak area right next door to Mastro's.  

We walked into a private room with a huge television on the wall.  The owner Larry explained to us the reason he gave the restaurant it's name. Larry and his wife traveled all over the world and decided to bring these taste back to Scottsdale.  

After that story, I'm ready to eat. I ordered the salmon with fresh vegetable. My hubby ordered the same. I'm ready to eat.... 

The salmon looked amazing, and when I placed my fork into it.....wow, it felt like melted butter. The taste was even better.  

As I finished my salmon, the chef walked in and asked us "How was the food, and if we needed anything"?  This place is magical. I mean the chef came from his kitchen cave to talk with us....  

This place is a diamond in the rough. 

Larry has an exceptional warmth about him.  He takes pride in his establishment and it shows.  Try this place, you wouldn't be disappointed.
