I visited the venue last Saturday for a drink after not having been to TC for awhile; it was a pretty nice day so the patio as always was packed but this time I/we managed to get one end of a long table looking out to the patio which was nice for a change.  The service was quite prompt and friendly and I enjoyed my beer, Skinny Dipping Stout; they have a pretty impressive beer list with a fair bit of variety and the prices are pretty fair, too.  Several of the selections are also available as half pints.

I've only eaten there once and it was a daily special: smoked Ontario mushrooms; it was on New Year's Day, 2016 when TC was one of the only venues open in Kensington Market.  TC is quite spacious so good for larger groups with long tables and they have a 'stage' area in the back where live bands perform.  I may be back soon with a social Group for brunch, which I haven't had there yet.  Looking forward to my next visit.
