Pricing is good, service is good, the coffee I got was good, and the atmosphere was great. Has a nice smaller relaxed coffee shop vibe to it with some real character. They have comfortable indoor and outdoor seating with some misters and a well decorated patio outside. They also have a drive through and are pet friendly! It is a great spot for a first date (my reason for going there).
