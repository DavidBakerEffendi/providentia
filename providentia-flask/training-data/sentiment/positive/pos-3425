Ahhh I absolutely love the Arrogant Butcher. I go around Phoenix and Scottsdale and try other restaurants (e.g.: Citizen Public House, St Francis, The Mission etc) but I keep coming back to my first love (The Arrogant Butcher) ;) This is definitely in my top three favorite restaurants of all time, and my favorite American restaurant,no doubt. 

Appetizers: I LOVE their cheese and meat plate. The cherry marmalade that comes with it pairs up perfectly with the cheeses and the meat. My favorite cheese are the cypress grove and the prairie breeze (I found both of these at AJs and can't be happier). The Black mussels are my favorite as well. The butterly/garlic sauce it comes with is so so so so good. I could eat it with absolutely anything.

Entrees: I used to order the NY strip but unfortunately, they have gotten rid of it so the next best thing is the grilled ribeye. The succotash and creamy horseradish is what makes this dish AMAZING. My boyfriend always gets the burger which he said is the best burger he has ever had. I've had the jambalaya for lunch before which I thought was just okay, but maybe that's because I was never really a fan of jambalaya.

Dessert: Their award winning salted caramel pudding. Out of this world. 

They have a great selection of drinks. I always get the pink drink as I like girly/sweet tasting drinks.

I am getting hungry as I am writing this review. Can't wait to be back here again!
