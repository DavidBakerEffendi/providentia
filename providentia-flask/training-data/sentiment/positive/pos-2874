"O" for Oscar!

My favorite @unfiltereddames and I met at this casual Latin American inspired restaurant yesterday afternoon for a birthday celebration! The ambiance is colorful and the upbeat music will have you shaking your shoulders spontaneously with content (trust me I got my shimmy on a few times)! 

Helpful Tip:  DINNER DAILY AT 4PM. We opted for appetizers and cocktails until the dinner menu became available.
