So delicious! Called in a breakfast order and was told it would be ready in ten minutes. :) and it was! AND the food was seriously so tasty. Ordered the breakfast wrap and all the flavors were perfect together. Also picked up a brownie and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Soooo good! Glad this place is by my job and I will be back!
