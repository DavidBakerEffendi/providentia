When I'm in the mood for bomb nachos this is the place to satisfy my craving! 

I love the super nachos. It comes with pico, guac, sour cream, cheese & carne asada. There's so much 2 people could eat it depends how hungry you are. They also have half nachos too. 

The breakfast burritos are good. 

My brother likes their carne asada fries. 

Also they have by the forks some side items like pickle carrots, onions & salsa. The salsa is good. It's a bit spicy. It kicks in alittle after you eat it. If you want other side items like pico, sour cream, cheese, & guac they do cost extra $1.19 without tax. 

They have deals for high schoolers from 10am-4pm. 

They have a tv inside as well. 

They are open 24/7. 

Also you can order UberEats for your food to be delivered to you.
