I don't generally leave reviews but I felt I really needed to in this instance. My family has done takeout twice now (in one week) and they were extremely quick and the food is amazing. Seriously the best Chinese I have found in the area and I've lived in this area for almost a decade! I love the fact that they don't drench the sweet and sour chicken and keep the sauce separate, the chicken was super crunchy and not soggy. Egg rolls are huge and super delicious.  I don't know why anyone would leave a bad review, the staff are friendly and the food is flavorful and so yummy!
