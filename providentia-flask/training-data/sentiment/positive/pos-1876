Just returned from a first visit; my dad and I just happened onto this pub while searching for Dandelion's across the street. Once inside Molly's, we forgot about our original destination until we were walking back to our car and stopped in for a to-go menu (Dandelions does looks inviting, and we do plan to try it soon).

But back to Molly's. I won't recap previous reviewers' comments except to emphasize the friendliness of our waitress (despite our not ordering much beyond a couple beers), the bartender (an engaging and knowledgeable sort who took time to come out from behind the bar to respond to our various curiosities regarding Scottish drink), and the manager (who impressed us with her previous experience at the Molly's in Savannah). Also, we found the prices quite fair throughout the menu. 

We both ordered two Guinness pints apiece (despite Richard the bartender's suggested Scottish Dragonhead beer - hey, Guinness is always a priority on the first visit, basically a quick and dirty measure of bartender care and knowledge due to its relatively high maintenance requirements). They were excellent, earning an A on our subjective but highly refined (we wish) rating scale (A+ ratings are reserved for pints actually consumed in Ireland). I also ordered the Scotch Broth soup at the waitress' recommendation, and was most pleased. There's very little actual broth to be found in this hearty selection, as it has been absorbed by toothsome barley and perfectly tender chunks of beef.

Except for the ubiquitous Uptown parking inconvenience ($12 for two hours in a nearby garage), it would be easy to add Molly's as a favorite local. But we'll be back to explore and enjoy more soon, nonetheless ... probably on a Wednesday or Thursday for discounted Guinness ($4/Imperial pint)!
