This is my pho spot. The consistency is on point. My chicken pho with potstickers is the combination I go. 

In addition to the great food, I really dig the decor - wide space, clean tables, huge windows to the outside and inside the kitchen! 

Oh yeah, and if you use it, the wifi id is Netgear40 and password is Niftytable543 ...until they change it.
