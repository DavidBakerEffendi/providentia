Another great meal and service.  Tried new dishes as I'm usually a creature of habit.  Had the veggie burger. Very good.  Second time this week  i was here. I usually try to get here once a week. Ahi sliders are so good. Nick, who has waited on us before came over to make sure everything was ok, even though we were not his table. A very happy person right now!
