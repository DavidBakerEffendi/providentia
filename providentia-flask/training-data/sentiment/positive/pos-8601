This is the first time I went to Mama Maria's but it won't be my last.  I enjoy Mexican food and this place is legit.  The only complaint I really have is the chips are not really chips, but tostadas.  The salsa was good, not heavy on the tomatoes and they don't give you a bean dip.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the food.  Really, it prevents you from going heavy on the tostadas and spoiling your appetite.

I had the chicken enchiladas and they serve three nicely sized enchiladas for a reasonable price; they were "money!"  In other words, they tasted really good and I'm picky when it comes to Mexican food.  I dined with some of my co-workers and they all enjoyed their food.  For the people that order the Burrito, it is huge!!!

The only draw-back is the side of town it is on, but the strip mall where it's located didn't seem shady.  The restaurant is next door to a Mexican bakery. 

I really don't think you can go wrong with this place.
