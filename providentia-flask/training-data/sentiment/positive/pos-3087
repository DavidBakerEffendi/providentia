Three of us described what kind of wine we like, and the sommelier suggested a few wines to try. We had two glasses each and loved all of them. We also ordered a cheese place, olives, mini burgers and chocolate with churros. Everything was very very good and came to 112 US Dollars. That is an excellent value for money.
