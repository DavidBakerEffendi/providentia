Writing this review WHILE eating my soup :P

Went back today, SO GOOD! I decided to just get a soup this time because the soup and wrap combo was too filling for me. I ordered the beef miso soup (9.99) thinking it was a little pricey for soup but it's definitely worth it! WARNING IT'S SPICY!!!! Huge portion and generous amounts of all ingredients- literal hunks of beef inside! So so so good. I need to go back and try ALL the soups.

The girl that works there is also super super nice I'm not sure her name but she's awesome :)
