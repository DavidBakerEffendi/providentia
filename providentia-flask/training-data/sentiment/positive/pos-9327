Finally was able to try this place out. Once we entered and greeted by a couple of workers we were seated in 20seconds. Then our server introduced herself and made us feel welcome and took our drink order. Since it was Happy Hour we had their house made margaritas and was very pleased.

Everything was delicious especially their famous Flaming Fajitas. I opt for the steak fajitas and enjoyed every bite. The meat was well seasoned and wasn't over cook but consistent and flavorful especially the grilled veggies and I was surprised with the portion size for a single serving of fajitas.

My sister and I shared a Flan for dessert and didn't regret it, because it was simply amazing especially since we had one in awhile. The soft texture and not so sweet caramelized sauce was perfect.

Our server Noemi was very friendly and energetic like the majority of the employees including a manager on staff. From the outside it look like an average size restaurant but it's large and broken into three sections: Main Dinning room, Bar room & Patio facing Tropicana. Will be back in the future!
