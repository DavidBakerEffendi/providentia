Love love LOVEEEE this place! They are so awesome, from the hosts to the servers to the managers. Love them all. 

But the food is truly amazing. One of the best fish and chips I've ever had, great shoestring fries and a delicious batter. The almond crusted chicken tenders are my favourite. Also try the tacos. And the burgers. And the steak frites. 

Just try anything on their menu and you'll be happy. Even the kids portions are amazing!

Go. Go now.
