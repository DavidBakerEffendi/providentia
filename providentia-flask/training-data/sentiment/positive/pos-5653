Ncounter is the hip and happening place to be at lunchtime on Mill Ave. 

I had the chance to try this place a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised by the vast options on their menu and the quality of food. Everything on the menu looked enticing, but I ended up going with the bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado sandwich with a side salad. I placed my order and took my number to the table to wait for my yummy lunch to arrive. Once it finally did (it did take a while but they were slammed due to popular demand) my tastebuds jumped for joy with the flavors of a regular blt mixed with the egg salad (who would have thought?!?). The mixed green salad was nothing special, but it didn't need to be. Next time I won't be so healthy and I'll go with chips or something fried! Other menu items I'll be back to try will be their breakfasts...oh my goodness they sounded good. 

The environment at Ncounter is very busy, but it isn't overwhelming. Despite it being crowded they have a good system so that the ordering line goes quickly, there are clean tables and seats available for everyone, and the process is comfortable for all who walk in the door. The staff is very friendly and all seemed to be working hard to make everything run like clockwork. 

Ncounter is a top notch lunch or breakfast spot for anyone who wants a solid meal (with both inside he box and outside the box flavors) at a reasonable price. If you are hungry on Mill Ave give them a whirl!
