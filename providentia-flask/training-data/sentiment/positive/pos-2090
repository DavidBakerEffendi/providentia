There's no way to describe this place where it doesn't seem campy and cheezey - board games and coffee. In public...surrounded by people on first dates. But it's SO much fun! 

$5 cover charge gets you access to their massive board game collection, which include favorites like Monopoly and some obscure titles I've never seen. The atmosphere is very non-pretentious and everyone here looks like they're genuinely having fun - a concept so distant from the uber pretentious bars down the street.
