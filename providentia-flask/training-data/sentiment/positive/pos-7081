If you're looking for a new spot to make yourself a regular at, with incredible food and the service that consistently goes beyond your expectations, look no further - this is the place for you. 

My husband and I stumbled upon Juan's when we were going to in-n-out (who they share a parking lot with) and knew we had to try it - we are so glad we did. We were quickly welcomed by the host, who I believe is the owner, seated quickly, and had the best first experience - our server explained the menu, made suggestions, and was just a pleasure to be around. Every single one of our experiences since then have been just as awesome, or better. The service is always spectacular, fast, and everyone working always acts like a team. The last time we came on a weekend, they had a full mariachi band and chorus of singers - the atmosphere here is warm and comfortable, but also lively and fun... It's like they're welcoming you into their home. That's how great this place is.

Now the food - yes, the tacos are amazing. The chips and salsas (they have several- just ask!) are fresh and tasty - but they live by their name. The fajitas are where it's at!!! They have a great deal for fajitas for 2 - we always get chicken, and they are truly the best fajitas we have ever had. It's a huge portion and we always have leftovers. Plus we love when they come out, pour the vodka over the grill, and light the flames - what a presentation :) 

We're completely in love with this place and it's hands down our favorite mexican place in Vegas. Highly, highly, highly recommend!
