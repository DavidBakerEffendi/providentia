Ate brunch here on a recommendation and was very impressed. Between the two of us one ordered breakfast, eggs bacon and a hand made corn arepa, I had a chicken salad and avocado arepa. Breakfast was spot on, and the chicken salad arepa sandwich is now my favorite chick salad, bar none. Service by Angel was top notch and the price was the cheapest brunch I can remember in a long time. 
When you have the chance, time and and appetite I recommend this whole heartedly. Excellent food, fantastic service, and very reasonably priced.
