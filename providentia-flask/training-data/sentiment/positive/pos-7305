Denise was fantastic. She joked, she sang, she accurately delivered everyone's appetizers, beverages, entrees. 

We had a very large group for dinner on New Years Eve without a reservation. The restaurant seated all 10 of us in 15 minutes. 

The food was really good and I had to stop myself from eating my pasta and sausage before I got too full. The house bread was soft and the dipping oil perfect. We split 2 orders of artichoke dip and it was cheesy goodness that didn't last.

Many diners got the manicotti like pasta roll which looked like a smaller portion than other dishes, but no complaints.

They very efficiently split the checks and cashed us out in time. And they were very very busy.

Only negative is that my husbands dinner was last to arrive by more than 10 minutes. I guess the kitchen failed the checkpoint-twice. 

We would return, especially to sit in Denise's section and with this large group!
