Love this place! We went on New Years Eve of 2015. We made reservations and arrived early. They were able to seat us early and quickly.

Absolutely love the butchers platter! It is a "must-order"! I have gotten the Fish and Chips before (which was great. Cole slaw is on point) but this time I wanted to try the Scallops. They were delicious. Cooked just right. We also got the chocolate cake desert; amazing!

Definitely a fun, hipster ambiance with great beer choices and food selections!
