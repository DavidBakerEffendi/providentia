Stopped in for lunch with my son as he highly recommended it and all's I can say is WQW!!!
  I had the peppercorn burger and a side of scalloped potatoes.
Simply to die for!!!!
I went home with half my burger and half my potatoes it was such a huge portion.
They have tremendous specials every day of the week.
I wish I lived closer, I would eat there every day.
Great service and atmosphere.
