Great wings and amazing service. We tried Wingtime for the first time and it was great. The wings and fingers are cooked to order. The Texas toast tastes like heaven. I love the crinkle cut fries. The sauces are really flavorful. The combos and catering prices are reasonable. We will definitely be back!
