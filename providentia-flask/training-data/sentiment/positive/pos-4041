My boyfriend took me to Montana's CookHouse after work. We have been to Montana's Cookhouse couple times before. It was our first time having Montana's around dinner time. We arrived the restaurant around 5 pm. There are many people in the restaurant. We had a rib burger and Steaks for dinner. We also shared Shrimp as a starter. The food came out fast. The taste of the food was very delicious. Since we didnt order beers and wine, the food prices were cheaper than normal. In summary, we love our dinner at Montana's Cookhouse.
