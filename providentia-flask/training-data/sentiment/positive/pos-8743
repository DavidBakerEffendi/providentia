THANK GOODNESS I FOUND WHAT'S BREW'N!

i have always loved spending time in locally owned coffee shops and always prefer giving them my business over other larger chains (although I enjoy them from time to time as wall). I've only ordered food there once, a HUGE, fresh salad that completely exceeded my expectations. The coffee drinks are always good and they have free wi-fi!

My only complaint is their hours - they're only open until the early afternoon. If they were open later, I could see spending lovely evenings enjoying their atmosphere with a coffee!
