I absolutely love this place. I do my best to come here at the very least once a week. If you're timing is right and you have a group of 4 or less, you can usually get a great spot. I've had a lot of very good, high quality sushi from all over the country and have no problem coming here anytime to grab dinner and be satisfied.

The vibe, the atmosphere is fantastic. Typically very friendly when you come in the front door. Very typical, and welcome greetings from the entire staff when you enter. The food as mentioned is very good and especially when you start to consider the prices. The cost (determined by color of plates floating by) are very low for the food you are getting.

I couldn't be happier with this place, the staff and the service. Anytime I have visitors here from LA, Texas, I make sure to take them and they are always blown away.. and frankly jealous I get to live merely minutes from here!

If you're coming with a larger group, keep a heads up that you won't see immediate seating since this place is made mostly for smaller parties of 4 or so.
