MUST, MUST, MUST TRY THIS PLACE!! :) I logged into my Yelp account for the first time since I created it in 2010 JUST to recommend this place!

The atmosphere is as clean and fresh as the ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS FOOD! The food value and service is truly unsurpassed by anywhere else in the area (no exaggeration)! The owner is incredibly hospitable, frequently making rounds to get verdicts on the quality of food and service. The servers are super friendly and give excellent, knowledgeable recommendations on menu items based on dietary needs and general food preferences. 

We ordered the jalapeno-cilantro hummus with pita bread as an appetizer (totally mild, as I'm not being a fan of things that are spicy) and the SMALL is enough for four people to share...AND we were asking for more pita triangles because there was so much hummus on the plate!

I ordered the veggie wrap thinking that, at $8, I was paying for the organic ingredients and didn't really expect to get a very large portion and boy, was I wrong!! This thing was massive (and trust me, I can eat)...LITERALLY bigger than a Chipotle burrito!! The two pitas were STUFFED with brown rice, pinto beans and the best seasoned vegetables ever (I'm telling you, if  my veggies tasted like this all the time, I could easily be a herbivore). I could only eat half of a HALF of one and had more than enough leftover for a substantial dinner (the others I was with couldn't finish theirs, either).

You can tell that the owner and staff are genuinely passionate about the food and service that they are offering (our server even led us out just to open the door for us) and it is merely a testament to the "love" that went into this place.
