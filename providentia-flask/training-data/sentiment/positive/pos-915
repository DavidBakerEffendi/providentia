Cantina, which serves upscale Mexican food with an interesting twist, is a great place to go for a nice date. 

I so enjoy the chicken burrito - generously topped with a queso sauce - that I pretty much always get that.  My boyfriend really likes the Tacos Marco Polo (shrimp, bacon, and caramelized onion's in flour tortillas with pico de gallo and melted cheeses). 

The margaritas are awesome. I'd recommend getting a pitcher for your table. While every table gets chips and two kinds of salsa, I'd also suggest ordering the guacamole. The water mixes up the fresh avocados and other ingredients right at your table. 

Cantina isn't just a restaurant - it's an experience. Because it's so good, it's packed most nights. Call ahead and make a reservation or it could be a long wait.
