From Sunset to Anthem, to here on Rainbow the staff is bubbly & happy & the food is always consistently great!  Eating here makes your morning better.  I constantly crave their seasoned potatoes & thin fries!!  I even bought the seasoning!  Yes they sell it there, along with t-shirts & other cooking ingredients.  

Quick to get seated or seat yourself at the bar counter.  Quick to take your drink order as well.  The one in Anthem has the cutest toy train running from the lobby to the bar counter above your head, which is such a special touch.  Even the mural painted throughout gives you that neighborhood breakfast place feel. 

Food wise:  the skillets are flavorful, served in half & full portions, both very large & unique.  If so don't get a skillet, then I go for the healthy breakfast.  My dad used to live in Hawaii & likes the 3 Hawaiian type breakfast items, the Loco Moco mostly.  

Today I decided to get the Mexican Crepe & my taste buds swear to you it was the BEST!!  I am now stuck between this & the skillets.
