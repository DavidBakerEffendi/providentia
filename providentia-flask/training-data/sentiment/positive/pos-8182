Best Mexican food in Phoenix.  I have lived here for over 25 years and have been around most of the well known Mexican food places  from upscale Scottsdale to dive South barrio.  Via De is the best there is.  Their Pollo Fundido is the best and their burro selection can't be beat.  My favorite dish is the Calupas with a side of grilled corn.  If you are looking for the best Mexican food in a casual family friendly environment or if you like a W I D E variety of Tequilas to choose from, come here

I know they don't serve any IPA's, but hey, Mexican food deserves a Mexican beer or a margarita anyway.
