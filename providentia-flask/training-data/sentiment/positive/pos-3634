I LOVE LOVE in-n-out burgers! i usually get mine #2 animal style fries and animal style cheeseburger. I think the workers are really friendly and they try their best to make the food and customer service the best they can. I think in-n-out have one of the most flavorful burgers along with their fresh meat and fries. Their smoothie is also yummy!... You can order your fries with just cheese or even cooked longer etc. I love it here! My favorite burger joint
