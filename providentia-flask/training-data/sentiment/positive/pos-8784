One of the best Americanos in the greater Phoenix area and served in a huge ceramic mug. Let me repeat that: a HUGE mug, and I ordered a small.

After securing a two person table (the tabletop had cool artwork on it) and sitting in a super comfortable chair, I looked into the depths of my Americano and decided that I'd like something from the pastry cabinet to complement the espresso or I'd be flying higher than a kite, which ended up being a blueberry muffin with a strong fresh blueberry flavor. I would have had a scone too but then dinner would never happen. By the way, the lunch menu here looked  awesome, but it was close to 3 p.m. and for me, that means afternoon coffee.

The inside space isn't huge, but the outside patio space is. In fact, just outside my window a man sat eating an awesome looking salad. 

I absolutely loved the wall art and the funky tables, but the coffee and the food will have me coming back here every time I'm in the area. Urban Beans, you have my loyalty.
