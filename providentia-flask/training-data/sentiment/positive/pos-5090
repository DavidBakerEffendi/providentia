They have private rooms! Went on a Sat night for a Birthday party for 22, and can I just say I felt the service far exceeded our expectations for a Sat night AND a large party! Alex S. was one of two servers for our group, and my hubby and I felt like we were the only 2 in the party! He was so attentive and very accommodating to everyone in our party...and did it all with a smile and a great, fun attitude!! Love him! The other wait staff was just as wonderful!! What a bonus to the amazing food! The pre-selected menu was deeeelish! Everything served was beautifully prepared, perfect portions, so fresh, so tasty, so delectable! The chef did an AMAZING job! Again, for a large party you don't expect much, but we were so impressed with Arrogant Butcher's stellar service and quality, scrumptious food...we are definitely coming back and spreading the word! Being there for a friend's birthday was special enough, but a BIG THANK YOU to the chef and wait staff (Alex S!!) for making it a pretty incredible dining experience!!
