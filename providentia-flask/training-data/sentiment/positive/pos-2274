I love this restaurant! The items I've tried have all been amazing, the wine list is great, desserts lovely, even the cappuccinos are great (and are served with a tiny lemon biscuit).  The service is very good. All servers I've had have been very knowledgeable and helpful. It's even quite a beautiful restaurant in a perfect location...on the park in front of Mount Royal Village. It's one of my favourite spots in Calgary now.

My recommendations are, for brunch the brie stuffed French toast with a glass of sparkling ros√©, for lunch the onion soup with the butter leaf lettuce salad.  For dinner my favourite so far is the veal with barley risotto.
