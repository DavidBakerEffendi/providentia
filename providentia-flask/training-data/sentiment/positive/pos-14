To end our friend meeting road trip, we had breakfast here before driving back to Florida that morning. I had my usual meal: Big Steak Omelet. This meal is just a perfect breakfast meal with steak, eggs, tomatoes, and hash browns all in one meal. It also comes with pancakes. 

The location was convenient, friendly waitress, efficient service, clean interior/restrooms, and reasonable prices.I experienced no problems here.A typical IHOP in my opinion. Would recommend to anyone traveling in the area looking for a trust restaurant. This meal lasted until I arrived in Florida later that day.
