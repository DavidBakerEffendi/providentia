Ended up coming here with my wife and daughter a few weeks ago. Everyone that worked there was super nice and it was cool to see donuts being made behind the counter. That way you know it's fresh. We ordered a few plain glazed donuts and also got one of the Apple Fritters. I know a good donut when I see one and man were they GOOD!

Ended up talking to the owner afterwards and found out that I used to play basketball with him ~10yrs ago at my old gym. I then told him everything was delicious and next time would be trying the bacon topped maple donut. He then picked one out for me and gave it to me complimentary. Kindness goes a long way and for that I hope this business does well forever. Nice job!
