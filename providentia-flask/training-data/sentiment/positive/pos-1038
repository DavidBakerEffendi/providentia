great service
great food, like all breakfast joints it's more pricey than expected (usually around 15-25$ per person) but the food is amazing
the lobster or chicken bennys are both to die for
amazing atmosphere and very close to guy concordia (peel?) metro so accessible for most
very cheerful place and nice homey feel
eggs are healthy
delicious
