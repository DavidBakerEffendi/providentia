I love this place by Starbucks on the southwest corner of Power and Baseline!  They are consistently good.  

My favorite is the chicken yellow curry (mild spice) and my husband loves loves loves the pad thai chicken (medium spice).  Their egg rolls are addictive.  And the owners are the nicest people, and their prices are very reasonable.

Great for sit it (they have a small restaurant), but we usually order take out.

Enjoy!
