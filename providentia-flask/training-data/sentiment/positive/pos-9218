Tried this place for the first time the other day and let me just say, BEST DECISION EVER. I had the chicken and red pepper pasta, my boyfriend got the Maserati Omelette with hash browns and we ordered a side of fries with ranch. You ofcourse can't forget the drinks!! Blue Hawaiian was like a bay breeze and he got a beer which I can't remember the name. DEFINATELY GOING BACK SOON!!!
