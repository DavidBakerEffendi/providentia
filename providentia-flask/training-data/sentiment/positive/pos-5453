This is the second time eating here and again great. Service was spot on!! Good Job!

I visit Vegas about once a month and like to find great places. 
We went in for happy hour and the food was great. 
Fajitas (chicken) were very good. The wife and I went home full!!

Thanks again for a great dinner.
