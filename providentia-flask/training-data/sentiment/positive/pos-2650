I have the first start off by saying this is no Olive Garden nor is it your traditional Italian restaurant is it expensive well depends on what you order because this is more of a Italian Steakhouse the pasta dishes are meant to be as an appetizer and there's steak and fish are your entree so $17 for a pasta dish is a good price but it's not going to feel you you up by itself I started off with a tableside Caesar salad it's probably the greatest Caesar salad I've ever had just a sharpness of the dressing and it's just amazing flavor don't think about it it's not a true tableside Caesar salad which I was disappointed in so no making the dressing from the scratch it's already made but still really good next I had to steam mussels with the tomato sauce I have to say that was probably one of the top 10 greatest dishes I've ever had in my life the muscles we're cooked perfectly or maybe was the quality of them don't know they were fantastic but the tomato sauce they were in was undescribable it took every ounce of restraint not to drink the sauce out of the bowl I want some right now as I'm writing this this is the number one thing you need to get second thing was that rigatoni lamb Verde which was really good too love to pesto that was in make sure taste buds scream third thing was a squid ink pappardelle that was just okay didn't care for the sauce or the pasta I would skip the next time not much to say about that for my dinner I have a short rib alla vaccinara it was pretty good nice and tender the sauce I was with it was pretty good not real sweet and sour thing just well-balanced for the dish almost like a bordelaise sauce but not really and the finish it off are the best Tiramisu I've ever had headache chocolate ganache bottom with the tiramisu and I'm not a fan now for the service was all on point as well super friendly you everything about the menu I don't eat pork so they had to been changed for me this is what you pay this kind of money for if I can get more five stars I would most excellent experience and food so next time skip Mastro's or any of those nice steakhouses then try them instead definitely won't be disappointed so I will be going back for sure
