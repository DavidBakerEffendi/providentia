Good service. We were seated pretty quickly and given water right away. Our waitress was a trainee but did an excellent job. She got our orders right and was very proactive. The food was good. We ordered a marshmallow and strawberry toast and a popcorn chicken. Total came out to $19.00 so it wasn't the cheapest but I think the quality of the food and service was worth it.
