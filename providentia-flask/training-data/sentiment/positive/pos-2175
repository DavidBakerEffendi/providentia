Been there a few times, and have never been disappointed.  It is a busy place sometimes, but worth it in my opinion.  I am not vegan, but do believe in eating that way, particularly organic raw.  It can take some getting used to, versus the standard American diet, but my wife and I have always found it wonderful.  If it were not so difficult to prepare super healthy meals like this at home, we would do it much more. I believe there is now a Living Kitchen in the Raleigh area as well.
