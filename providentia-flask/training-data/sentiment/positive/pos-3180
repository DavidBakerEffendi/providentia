VIBE 
This place reminds me of Paris. Straight from the mirrors to the banquettes to the layout of the restaurant. Paris, Paris, Paris. In the very best way. Everyone knows Dave and Fred of Joe Beef but you really need to know Vanya and Marco. Just lovely folks who really care about food, service and people. 

FOOD 
I HATE Cauliflower. Capital letters H A T E. Where is the nutritional value? It's white? It looks disgusting. It's spraypainted broccoli (another childhood repulsion but at least it has nutritional value). Vin Papillon's touch with fried chicken bits and fat drizziling over the cauliflower made me a believer. So any chef that can turn a food you hate into a food you like is the mark of a true chef. I had the pickled plate. It was nice but I think I was expecting more pickles and less of a veg medley. Maybe I was lost in translation? It's filling if you do get it. 

Rum soaked baba will make you drunk and the wine gums (with wine!) are delicious. 

Basically the menu is date friendly and it really is a great date place and of course, with lovely natural wines. 

A nicer, lighter version of Joe Beef fare. Joe Beef lite? 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Floats like a butterfly but doesn't sting like a bee. Def. in the top favourite restaurants of Montreal list.
