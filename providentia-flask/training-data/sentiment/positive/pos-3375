I grew up in Scarborough where there's an abundant amount of HK Canteens. I feel like this is the only restaurant in Chinatown that matches the taste uptown (most overseas Chinese people migrated to Markham/Scarborough).

They got a killer Portuguese Baked Rice. That's all I have to say. Their curry was alright but that's not what I go for. 

The place is kinda hidden. You have to walk up the stairs; but there is a huge sign pointing to the restaurant. 

Try this place out. Get the Portuguese Rice
