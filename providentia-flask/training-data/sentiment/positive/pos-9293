I've stayed here twice now for a conference and each experience has been wonderful. The staff is always so welcoming and professional. 
This past time I ordered room service and it was amazing! I ordered the bagel with smoked salmon plate - wonderful presentation and definitely enough to feed 2-3 people. 
Food court options suffice but are definitely mediocre. Restaurants are good but there are definitely better ones on the strip if you explore around.
