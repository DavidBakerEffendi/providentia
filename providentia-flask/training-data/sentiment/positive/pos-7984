I love Fresh Cup!  It's my absolute favorite boba place.  I use to frequent Icy Juice, but that place isn't as nice.  I love their smoothies and drinks.  They will customize your drink for you if you prefer it less sweet, which I do.  They even offered to remake it if I felt that it was too sweet.  Their  ramen is good.  You can add different types of toppings to it.  I love the rice cakes.  =] 

I love to site at Fresh Cup and read with a good drink.  Their bulgogi burrito is pretty tasty, too.  It's not too sweet which most bulgogi is.  They have the best shaved ice in Vegas.  I love all the fresh fruit that they have.  They pour condensed milk over the ice and then load it with tons of fruit!  It's amazing.  You must try it!  The first time I had the Fresh Cup shaved ice, but then I didn't really like the red bean.  The fruit shaved ice tastes really delicious! 

They have really good customer service.  They will not kick you out of the store even when it's past closing time.  I normally don't stay late, but there were others in the store.
