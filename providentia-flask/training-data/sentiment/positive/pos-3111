This is my "go-to" place when I am meeting someone for a nice, simple lunch.  The customer service has always been fantastic, family run business.  They remember me each time. Sandwiches are great and it is a nice touch that they give you small fruit instead of chips or fries. The ice tea is fresh and atmosphere is casual. Important to note, I always custom order my food, and not too many places appreciate that -- here they have no problems and do it happily. Parking is tricky and there is not much of it, you have to park across the street. Haven't tried evening or wines, but it is on my list of to do's. 
I recommend the smokey joe....
