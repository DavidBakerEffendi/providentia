My friend and I came across this place and it's honestly quite fantastic. It's small and sort of easy to miss if you're driving by, but the food, interior, and service is all amazing.

The waitress was incredible. Super personable, funny, and easy to talk to. Very informative as well about what's good on the menu. 

I ordered the "Fork Scramble," which was a caramelized puff pastry with soft scrambled eggs on top, chives, smoked salmon, whipped crème fraîche and fresh dill. It's MASSIVE. The picture doesn't do it justice. And it was DELICIOUS. 

We ordered a side of the red velvet pancakes which comes with a vanilla cream cheese frosting and it was also yummy and soft. 

The waitress gave us sample size smoothies and they were refreshing and went well with the food.
