The restaurant is under new management and it's located near the I-15 South exit in Sahara Avenue. We came here for our friend's birthday dinner and we absolutely love it here! The place is huge - separate area for sushi, korean barbecue, and a family room if you want it to be more traditional Korean dining. The food was great for the price as well. $25 for AYCE sushi + korean barbecue and $19 if you just want either. The service was amazing, the owner of the restaurant even took care of us when we were there! Cool right? This place is a must try. Or a #1 go-to place when you're actually craving for some great Korean barbecue and some yummy sushi. :D
