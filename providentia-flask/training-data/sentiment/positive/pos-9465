Absolutely wonderful place.  I just recently moved into the area & frequent the restaurant often.  All the salsas are made freah, daily & are available in a salsa bar. The heat range varies from mild to pretty hot & the menu is simple but ample & tasty. 

They recently started serving breakfast too. The bkft burritos are fresh & great portions.  Forget about fastfood chains; this place is local & authentic! 

Open daily except Sundays.  Highly recommend!
