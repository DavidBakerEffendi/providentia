Came here for Summerlicious with a girlfriend and loved it.

The service was fantastic from the greeter to the wait staff.  It had a very fancy feel to it.  The food was excellent and my steak cooked perfectly.  The portions were hearty, and I definitely felt full at the end of it.

A great place for a date, or a girl's night.
