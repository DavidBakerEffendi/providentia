A friend of mine was stranded because of the CLT airport fire, and while this location had on the web that they stopped delivering at 11 PM (and a nearby Pizza Hut refused to provide service, though they were listed as delivering until midnight), they said they could do it, took the order, let me pay for it (so my friend wouldn't have to), and were very accommodating. We'll see if the order comes through, but I can't fault the customer service! UPDATE: The order arrived promptly and was hot. Excellent work, PJ!
