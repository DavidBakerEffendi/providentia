It is really hard to find decent Mexican food in Vegas. I have been twice and had the beef fajitas both times. Really delish. Great sides, chips, bean dip, peppers & onions and salsa. Omar was our server this last time and he was great! Attentive, comes by often even though there was a full house. Even other employees stopped by to check on us. Good value. 2 for $20.
