I love this place. The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious. They have excellent appetizers. We have tried calamari, meatballs, bruschetta, garlic knots and they have all been wonderful. I love their veggie pasta and usually always stick with that but they had a wonderful fish special. Wish I could describe it better but it was also great! Service is always great. We've been here maybe 10-15 times and never had anything but fast, friendly and helpful service. Super cute place for date night, birthday dinner or anniversary and reasonable prices. Worth trying for sure.
