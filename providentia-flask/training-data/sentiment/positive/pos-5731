Frank & Fina's used to be my go to Mexican sit down restaurant in town until I discovered Juan's. The name is super cheesy but it's the closest I've found in LV that I feel is similar to the food in San Diego that I grew up on. 

I like that they give you bean dip and onions with your salsa and that it's not too salty. Though, it'll make you eat more chips than you'd like! 

I had the best carnitas plate here. Soooo good. Crips edges and moist pork.....that's my favorite thing there!

Of course, the margaritas are great and the service is always quick and super friendly. Love!
