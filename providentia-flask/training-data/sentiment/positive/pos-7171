We went to the one in Mesa (Dobson/Baseline) after seeing it was rated as one of the east valley's best pizza places. No arguments there!!
Delicious! We had the white pizza, some garlic bread, a dozen wings (Joe's sauce), and drinks...for about $25. 
Plus, if you sign up for their VIP club, you get some awesome perks! Read: free pizza on your birthday and anniversary, as well as points for every dollar you spend!
