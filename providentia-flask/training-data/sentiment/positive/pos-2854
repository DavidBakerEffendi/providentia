Very impressed with quality, portion sizes and price.  All the staff were also exceptional! Even looked like the manager was pitching in right along with all the employees.  The food was hot and fresh and was actually real food for a fast service restaurant.  I had the grilled shrimp kebob with a Greek salad and all of it was fantastic.  My husband had the steak stack and roasted potato salad and it was delish too. Would highly recommend giving it a try.  Many locations to chose from but this one has the exceptional staff that just makes the dining experience even better.
