This is an opulent and beautiful Renaissance Hotel! (Who has that kind of money!?!?!?)
It is fussy and EXPENSIVE but a place that you should definitely tour.
It is connected to the Palazzo Casino by a large and expensive mall filled with designer stores some of whom I have NEVER heard of but they're still expensive!!!!

Anyway.... It's clean nice and bright and gaudy and it was very busy and filled with life.... except when I lost at the craps table with the miserable people I was with....
I then found some slot machines I liked and won a little money!

There is also the Venetian waterway and mall that features singers who will row you on a gondola through the mall that has a food court and some expensive stores in it!

A must see !!!!
