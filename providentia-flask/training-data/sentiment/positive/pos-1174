I've always stayed at the Venetian every time I come to Las Vegas, but never got around to reviewing it. I should like to say that, for luck of a better word, it is like a palace.  You can get better deals if you book in advance or if you take advantage of their specials during the less busy times, but I can tell you that a one night stay ranges from $150 and above.

What you pay for is the impeccable service, large suite style rooms, and exquisite housekeeping. I cannot stress how prompt and efficient they are. If you haven't seen the pool garden, you need to check this place out. Did I mention all but the largest pool is heated? And the shopping area with the canal and square - C'est magnifique!

The Venetian is very reminiscent of what you would see in the actual city Venice. The hotel/casino really brings with it the feel of a place of another time. On a recent trip with my family, we took the time to enjoy the restaurants, decor, shopping, and in-house shows. Whenever I have the opportunity, I never hesitate to book here first. 

For those who can afford it or just want a comforting time in Vegas, I recommend it.
