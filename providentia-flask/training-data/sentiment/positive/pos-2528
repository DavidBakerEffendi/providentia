Welp, I have to say, Pita Jungle never disappoints! It was after 8 PM on a Sunday and I was literally craving a Greek salad but for the life of me, couldn't remember who would be open at this hour. And then...DING DING! Duh, Pita Jungle is right by my house and open later than most quick places. 

I am absolutely in love with their Mediterranean Chicken Salad. I could drink the lemon dressing. It is so light and refreshing. The salad is packed with their delicious marinated chicken, golden raisins, taboule, corn, feta, onions, roasted bell peppers, cucumbers, toasted pine nuts, and cilantro. 

If i'm feeling VERY hungry, i'll get a small order of Baba Ganoosh with a pita! This is a delicious dip consisting of broiled eggplant, tahini, greek yogurt, garlic, evoo, lemon juice, and a ratatouille garnish. It is different than hummus and SO dang good! 

I will say, for the salad and a small baba to go, it is usually around $18 but hey, it is fresh, healthy, and WORTH IT! 

Their Happy Hour is also definitely worth mentioning. They have a variety of tapas ranging from $1-$3 and house wine is only $3 is well! Can you say, YES PLEASE?! It is Monday - Friday from 3-5:30 PM and reverse is daily from 9 PM - close. 

I'll be back soon!!
