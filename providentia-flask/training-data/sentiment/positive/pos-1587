I've been eating at this little place in the mall for over 10 years now... Quality is consistent and the food is fresh and delicious! I especially love the chicken gyro! I also frequently get the spinach pie and the tabouleh salad. Now if I could only figure out how to NOT get the sauce all over my face!
