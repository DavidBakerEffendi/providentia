I love this cool thai place, definitely my fav. The duck is nice and crispy on the outside instead of oily. The pad thai was pretty original but tasty as most. The Pad Hen appetizer was amaaazing, full of flavor would order 2 orders for myself next time. Most reviewers seem to enjoy the spicy herb spring rolls but they were pretty average to me. I will definitely be back over and over again. I think their prices are fair since they have quality dishes. The restaurant itself is on the small size but with great decor which makes it intimate and a good place for a date. Enjoy!
