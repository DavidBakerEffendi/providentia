I've had this spot on my list for awhile and I finally made it in this week. The food and the service were definitely five stars.

The service was great. We were seated quickly and the waiter didn't delay in taking our orders. The food came out so quickly! Our waiter continued to check in on us and refill drinks well before necessary. 

I ordered the Shrimp Fajitas and loved them. The flavor of the shrimp and vegetables was delicious. The tortillas were warm and soft. The sides that go with the fajitas were tasty as well and I really liked the guacamole. The salsas and grilled vegetables that come out with the chips before the meal were all great too.

Something unique to this restaurant was the option to get healthy options. Fajitas can be ordered with romaine lettuce instead of tortillas and rice and beans can be substituted for steamed vegetables. I love when restaurants offer healthy alternatives.
