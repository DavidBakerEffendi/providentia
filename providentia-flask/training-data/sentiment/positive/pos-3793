We bought a Groupon several weeks ago for Davidson Pizza Company and decided to try it tonight. The Davidson location is very small and is Carryout only, but there are several picnic tables with umbrellas outside in case you want to eat there. They do sell some drinks as well (didn't pay attention to specifics). Our pizza was delicious! The large is huge! We got 3 toppings and it was about $17. Good value for the quality. I'd highly recommend it and we'll definitely be back.
