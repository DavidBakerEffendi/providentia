The ramen and chicken karaage was pretty good here. I must admit that the ramen here is one of the best in the Phoenix area. It was flavorful. I just wished that they had the type of chili powder that other ramen restaurants usually use. The chili powder they use is more of just spicy rather than seasoning as well. The chicken karaage could have also been a little more flavorful with more seasoning. There was only one server there and the place was pretty full. The server handled everything very well and did not seem stressed at all from all the people, which I liked. Overall, I had a good experience there.
