Winchell's have the best softest donuts! They are a further drive on East Tropicana near the 515 freeway and are located in the Vista Plaza shopping center near Gardenas. I came around lunch to order a box of donuts for a co-worker's birthday. It's $9.99 for a dozen and the donuts are made fresh daily. They keep the display case well-stocked and the quality of service is nice. They have an assortment of flavor and fluffy donuts like Sprinkles, Glaze, Peanut Chocolate, Boston Cream, Caramel, Apple Filling, Raspberry Filling, Cinnamon, Apple Fritter, and the list goes on. They all taste great! My absolute favorites are the Apple Filling, Cinnamon, and Apple Fritter. 

In addition they serve muffins, croissants, Danish, quesadilla bread, bagels, breakfast sandwich, and they make cold drinks like freshly squeezed orange juice, carrot juice, strawberry and chocolate banana shake. For hot drinks, they offer coffee, tea, cappuccino, and hot chocolate. I'm just glad that Winchell's Donuts open 24/7 as most donut shops close early. It's a great place to come by for a simple date night, share a sweet treat, and have a tasty snack. Their location is far from where I live but it is well worth the visit, and I have a good feeling I'll be back for more.
