If you haven't been here, then you are missing out. I was in there last Friday for lunch. The owners (Craig and Janine) came over to meet us and thank us for coming in. The food was great, the service was phenomenal and the place looks great. I would highly recommend this to EVERYONE! I live in  North Phoenix will be driving 40 Minutes to go there again for sure!

And to everyone who has left a negative review.. I ask you to give them another chance. They have a new staff, new chef and a new menu. You will not be disappointed! I promise! (And No.. I do not work there)
