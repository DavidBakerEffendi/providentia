Really cute quaint little place with great breakfast choices one of my favorites is the egg white breakfast and then I had a side of cottage cheese very healthy. Also really really good eggs benedict with avocado. Only downside is I wish they had their liquor license so you could have a mimosa or Bloody Mary
