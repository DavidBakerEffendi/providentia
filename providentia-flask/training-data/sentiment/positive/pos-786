I  love this place for what it is!  Cheesy decor, good late night eats, drinks  and friendly service, and for me memories of trips to Vegas as a child where this was our breakfast spot before heading back to CA.  Our party of six arrived at about 11 on a Saturday night and were quickly seated.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and while they weren't the most amazing version of Eggs Benedict I ever had they were tasty and with three eggs and hash browns included more then enough for one person.  I would highly recommend the Key Lime Pie Martini.  Delicious and tasted just like the desert with a graham cracker crust  rim.  A photographer came by and offered to take "free" pictures of our group with no obligation.  Of course to upgrade to a nice full size photo without the Peppermill logos all over turned into $10 but it was a nice memento of the evening and easily scanned and divided among six of us!
