This place is my favorite type of restaurant. Incredible, unpretentious food where you can tell that the staff care more about making people happy with their food than making a buck.

Luckily for Jon, people love his food so he gets to do both. 

I would wager pretty heavily that Smoky Jon's is the best BBQ in the Midwest and the ridiculous NATIONAL bbq awards would back me up. You will seriously be blown away by the sauce (which you can actually buy bottles of - pro-tip not great at dipping nuggets for but it is excellent for cocktail weinies!). 

The ribs are solid - especially with the sauce, but what you really need to do is to get the beef brisket. Flavor country, population you.

Also, it's super plain, but the grilled chicken sandwich with smoky jon's sauce on that tasty bun is phenomenal.
