It seems that I have inexplicably done my best to avoid trying Poke Express. I couldn't resist any longer, subconsciously or otherwise, when my friend brought a fine selection of their poke to football night.

There were four items. The spicy avocado ahi was delicious even though I personally couldn't handle the burning sensation after a while. Luckily, the heat didn't linger. The furikake ahi was more pleasant in my mouth, and it had the more typical onion and cucumber mixed in rather than the avocado.

Next, I had the kimchee crab, which also surprised me with heat, but I loved the tender crab more than enough to tooth my way through several pieces. Finally, I tried the kimchee mussel and eagerly went back for more. Not as spicy, but about as relatively tender as the crab. Mussel fans should definitely try this.

I was so happy with the poke that it didn't seem right not to weigh in immediately. I'll have to go some time and grab a couple of orders of poke for myself, and perhaps snap a few photos too.
