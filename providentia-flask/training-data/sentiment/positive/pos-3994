I made a return visit to Trinity Common yesterday, during Kensington Market's last Pedestrian Sunday of the year.  It was my 1st visit since Aug., from which my previous review is taken.  This time I cane with 3 others so we were a party of 4; we were asked if a seat further back inside would be okay and we said yes.  The service was quite prompt and friendly; we ordered drinks only and I had a beer, namely Confederation Amber Ale by Flying Monkeys Brewery, which I really enjoyed.

Perhaps due to us being there on a Sunday, my (our) drinks were discounted so I received .81 off the regular price.  A pleasant surprise.  As a result of another enjoyable experience there I see no reason to downgrade my prior 5 star rating.
