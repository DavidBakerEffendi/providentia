Who knew hot dogs could be so amazing?  Seriously.  My taste buds go crazy every time I eat here.  Peanut butter + honey + sriracha + hot dog = deliciousness.  That is one of my favorites.  But, there are so many great hot dog combos.  Love to take our out of town guests here for a weekend lunch.  It's pretty quick with a walk up and order counter.  And they have a great patio up on the roof!

We had them cater for us last summer with their little food truck and it was the hit of the party!  Highly recommend!
