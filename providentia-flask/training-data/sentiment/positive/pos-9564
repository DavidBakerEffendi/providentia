I absolutely love this place.  Such a great place for meeting with friends, having drinks and their food is really tasty and well priced too!  The building is beautiful.  They really did a nice job with it.  The service was very good both in the restaurant and on the golf side.  I will say it gets VERY crowded so come early as you could wait a while for a bay.  The price for golf is a tad bit spendy...but they also offer memberships that could be an option.  It is a great place for families, couples or just about anyone.  I really enjoyed my first visit and can't wait to go back!
