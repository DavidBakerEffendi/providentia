They came by my work two Mondays in a row. First time I skipped out on it because I was under the impression it was cash only. (I was wrong by the way.) My boss came over with a little Styrofoam container, plopped it on my desk and said "No seriously. You're welcome." 
I don't argue with free food. So, I absentmindedly took a bite of my pork taco, not even looking away from my screen. 

Sweet Mother....  

I literally craved those tacos until the next Monday. The slaw was sweet and savory and the pork tasted like a spicy adobo sauce. Everything just came together nicely. The tortilla was fresh and the portions just right. It was out of sheer restraint that I only ordered 2 the next time they came around. Pork and chicken this time. Equally as good! I was trying to decide what I liked better, and it was honestly a draw. 

I will have to track them down again by dragging my boyfriend all over Cleveland to find them, OR they can just come back to my place of business. I still need to try the beef tacos, shrimp tacos, and the fries! PLEEEEEEEEASSSE COME BACK!!!! 

You guys made Monday's something I looked forward to!
