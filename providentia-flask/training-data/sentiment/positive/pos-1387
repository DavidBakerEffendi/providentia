Oh wow ... it turned out to be one of those meals where I ate so much I could hardly move -- everything was so good! Though I wasn't exactly very hungry when I came in, the starters of oil-cured olives and lemon, fresh-baked bread, and spiced roasted carrots revved my appetite into high gear. I ordered the beef couscous; the couscous was perfectly steamed and fluffy and the beef was braised until fork-tender. A generous side of peas came with the order and complemented the couscous and beef really well. Hot fresh-mint tea was refreshing and also served as an excellent cleanse for the palate in between the very flavorful bites of the meal. Abdul served the meal with utmost friendliness and courtesy; I felt at home from the moment I entered the restaurant. He let me try some other items in the restaurant: a creamy date shake that by itself could have served as a delicious dessert; bastilla, a scrumptious sweet and savory pastry with chicken; and some other dessert pastries.  You definitely MUST come to this corner of Morocco in the heart of Phoenix ... and when you do, here's a tip: parking is at the back; if that gets full, you can park at the parking area in front of the establishment next door, to the west of the restaurant; that next-door establishment has been closed seemingly forever and it appears that it'll be that way for some time to come (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/couscous-express-phoenix#dXi9qyhO8V_NEETRenTVDA).
