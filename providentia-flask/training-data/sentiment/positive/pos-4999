The food was great and great prices. I have no clue what every one is saying about how much it cost. The prices are cheaper then Famous daves and the portions are huge. Only bad thing I can say is that they only have one bbq sauce. But that one sauce makes up for it because its amazing. I ordered Monster potato with pulled porkfor $5 and my wife order 1/4 chicken plus for ribs and two sides for $11. We both could not finish. I love this place and will continue coming baack.
