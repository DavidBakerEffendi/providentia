I chose to try out this bakery for my birthday lunch because I'd been given one of their cupcakes before (Almond Joy Cupcake...it was delicious) and heard tons of great things about their lunch menu. So we made the trek from the northwest valley and let me tell you, it was well worth the drive!

First impressions of the cafe: Nice location and really neat decor! Vintage/ Shabby Chic is the closest thing I can think to call it, but it's not so frilly that a guy would feel out of place. Some of the art was done by a local artist and overall it was bright, airy and very, very clean. The staff is AWESOME!!! If I could underline that twice I would, so I'll just say it again..The staff is AWESOME!!!

We ordered the Greek Chicken Salad, the BLT, and Roasted Veggie Flatbread and they were all equally delicious! They forgot to remove an ingredient on my son's sandwich and not only did they apologize and bring us a new sandwhich, they also offered us a complimentary treat for the "trouble"!  Now, these treats are the real reason to drive across town because their cupcakes and brownies are good even by gluten standards! I had the Caramel Macchiato Cupcake and it was delicious but then you can't go wrong with the salted caramel brownies either!  The loose leaf mango orange green tea was just another great component to a very wonderful meal. 

We'll be back for sure!
