Ahhh this place is too good to be true! This small pastry shop next to my hair salon is a hidden gem. Everything we got here were top quality and quite cheap actually. We got 4 things and total came to be around $15, which is pretty good.

So many delicious looking treats, it was hard to choose. I'm sorry to report I don't know the names of any of the things we got except for the eclair aha.. We got some kind of almond bread, the inside was super moist and soft. We also got some kind of almond-chocolatey tart thingy, SO GOOD. The eclair was good too, the best thing about it was the maple topping ahhh.

Overall a big 10/10!
