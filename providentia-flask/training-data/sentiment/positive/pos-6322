The best priced, old school, real diner in Las Vegas.  This place is a family friendly throw back to a time where servers and cooks cared about the food they served, the people they served and a time where breakfast didn't break the bank.

I love it at Lou's and it's always my goal to eat breakfast here at least twice a week.  Try Patty's homemade cinnamon rolls or the from scratch chicken soup, you won't be disappointed.
