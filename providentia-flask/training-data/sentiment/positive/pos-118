The food is so delicious! Even if you eat a lot it doesn't feel so heavy! My husband and I came in and got the gyro plate and the shwarma combo plate which came with hummus and falafel. Those falafels are the best!! You can't beat the pita bread too. The portions are huge. The gyro plate could have made 2 sandwiches easily and the combo plate would have been good for 2 people. Didn't get to try the sweets this time but we'll for sure come back and not order too much so we'll have room for dessert lol
