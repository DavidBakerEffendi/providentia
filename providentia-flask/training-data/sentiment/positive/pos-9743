Came here for dinner with my boyfriend on Friday night it was soooo packed. Make reservations!!!!! They don't speak good English here but they were super friendly. Food was so good. We had the spicy squid and pork....yummy. Portions are really big and its self serve all you can eat red bean rice. Will come back again but with a big group so we can try more items.
