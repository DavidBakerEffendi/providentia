SOOOO DELICIOUS! Thai Spicy Chicken salad - AMAZING, with delicious fresh mint, the Drunken Noodles, some of the best and freshest I've ever had (and it's a favorite dish so I've tasted many versions), and the Chicken Satay- also super delicious with a fresh peanut sauce- even my picky toddler loves! To top it off, both the manager and owner are exemplary with their customer service. Our family will definitely be ordering regularly from here. Thank you.
