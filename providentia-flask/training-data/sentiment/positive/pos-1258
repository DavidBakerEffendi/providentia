How come the rating is so low??? How can you not love this bar???!!! They always have a great beer selection and awesome monthly drink specials.  The new food truck menu is amazing (reminds me of home) and the shrimp and grits are to die for. Seriously! If I was on death row hickory tavern shrimp and grits would be my last meal.
