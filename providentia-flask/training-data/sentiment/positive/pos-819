Kunaffe!!!! Finally somewhere local to fill my random Mediterranean food and dessert cravings. Excellent food, everything is made fresh. Service is spectacular. Only thing I didn't like was the grape leaves. Sorry Duzan, nothing compares to my grandmother's. :0)

Get the lemonade. And the pita. And the kunaffe.
