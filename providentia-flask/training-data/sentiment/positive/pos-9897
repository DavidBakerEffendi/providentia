Great food, fast, courteous service. I went through the drive through and there was one car ahead of me. The wait wasn't long and the employee taking the orders and working at the window was friendly and efficient. The food was good, still hot when I got home and overall a good value. He menu had everything you could want at a Mexican restaurant. Lots of combo meals and sides.
