In reading my prior review you will know all about my pickup experience. Not the greatest but the pizza was fantastic. Tonight i brought my family, a party of 6 and Ed was our server and he was fantastic on totally on it. Nobody in my party had ever been here before and its fair to say they are serious pizza lovers ( or snobs, take your pick! ) We ordered a 89th street Sicilian which is perfection. A nice light fluffy bready pizza with melted cheese, pepperoni, and its probably the best pizza i ever had. I literally have to exercise restraint and not overstuff myself. The other pizza was a thin crust pepperoni & cheese. As you can imagine, i was really anxious to know thier thoughts. The vote was unanimous... the best pizza hands down! That means more miles on the odometer but its totally worth it. Thanks again Ed for making our experience a great one!
