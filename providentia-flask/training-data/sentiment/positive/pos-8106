We have stayed here on several occasions because Bass Pro Shops next door sponsors a couple of BBQ competitions per year.  We really love the Silverton.  It's far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the strip.  It has enough food options for everyone.  The staff is always helpful and friendly.  This hotel is on the relatively newer side so you don't smell too much cigarette smoke when you walk through the doors.  They also have a pretty nice gift shop.  This is a great place to stay if you really want to visit Vegas but don't necessarily want to deal with the crowds.  We will definitely be returning in the future.
