I have a new favorite restaurant!!! This place is amazing, I've been here multiple times, with and without my dog. The outside patio is nice and big and has a pretty fireplace right in the middle. The inside is beautiful, love the cabin feel. The menu has SO many different options, it's so hard to choose. Their happy hour is awesome too, and their special brunch menu is worth a Sunday morning trip. Highly recommend the green chile mac and cheese! Best thing I have ever tasted. Planning on going back this weekend already.
