YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(180/365) "Coming Soon"

The Al Pastor Kings(yes, no one does Al Pastor better than these guys!) have set up shop right in front of their future brick and mortar location on Decatur and Meadows right across Cardenas. A SMART move!

Prices and menu items are the same as their other locations on the streets,  and I'm SO GLAD that this location is closer to home and has a lot of parking space(used to be a Wendy's). This visit, I wanted to try something different so I went for the Torta Cubana. This is not made in the traditional Cuban style,  but TEBP does their own take on it and it does not disappoint!  This torta is loaded with pork, ham, al pastor,  hot dog, beans, cheese, escabeche of carrots and jalape√±os, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado on the biggest toasted bun you've ever seen!

Fully assembled,  this thing was bigger than my hand and head, and is a very good deal at $9.50!  If you're in the area or shopping at Cardenas,  swing by here for a bite to eat. Btw...The Tortas are enough to feed 2-4 people and are very filling! Can't wait for their restaurant to open so people who aren't too keen on street vendor style dining can enjoy sit down dining and see what I've been talking about since I first discovered these guys on Las Vegas Blvd and Bonanza.  ALOHA!!!
