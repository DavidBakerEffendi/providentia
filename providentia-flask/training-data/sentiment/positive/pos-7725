My absolute favorite breakfast, and lunch place here in Vegas. Not only can you get a hot Turkey Reuben, but you can get a bowl of Matzo ball soup along with it. Heaven! They have a full Deli and Bakery in there as well, everything is made in store.  Don't forget to grab bagels, freshly made cream cheese, and desserts on your way out! P.s. black & white cookies are my childhood favorite, and they do them of so well.
