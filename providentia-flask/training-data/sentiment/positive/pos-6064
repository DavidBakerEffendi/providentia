Minus a half star only for the unfortunate spot they have (more seating would be helpful) and street parking on the square is tough.  This is common with anything here, so I won't dock the review.

This restaurant is bright and colorful with vibrant music playing, well-staffed.  We were here for lunch and while the place was busy we still had immediate seating and an order of Doritos (puffed flavorful wagon wheels) and water along with the menus.

We ordered guacamole and chips because guacamole is one of my favorites but I can never eat it all at home before the avocado starts browning.  This was a light and smooth flavor, with homemade chips that were excellent.

My burrito was a classic, cut in half already to make it easier to eat and you can see by my photos they were stuffed.  I can't do very spicy food so I tend to wander towards the milder foods and this had just enough kick to make it tasty but not overbearing.  I also loved how the burrito shell was also cooked making it firm (no burrito toppings falling out of the shell!) and easier to eat.  

 Beverages were amazing.  I ordered a seasonal margarita which was hibiscus with cucumber and somehow accidentally got another drink which was a virgin.  Our waitress cleared it up (I didn't really want to switch drinks as the hibiscus drink I had was so good with a hint of cinnamon) by adding tequila to it and making it a unique cocktail I would look for on the menu!  

Gracias, Canteen, we will b
