Been here a couple dozen times now. Consistently excellent pizza, apps, salads, service. A neighborhood gem worth traveling to from other neighborhoods.

Some of the pizzas are great renditions of old classics, and some are creative new combinations: the "Mia" pizza, for instance, blends multiple cheeses, crispy pancetta, and a fried egg in the middle for a truly tasty treat! If you like "salty", try the "Elana" pizza, made with olives and soppressata salami.
