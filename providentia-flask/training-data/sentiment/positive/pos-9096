I'm the type of person that tries to order something new every time.  Pizza Bogo basically blows my mind.

I order quite a bit of catering so I've tried more pizza's than my waistline can bear...but let me tell you - they're all great.  I especially like the World Cuisines because they really are out of the box flavors.  I also appreciate that the manager Bethany is more than helpful and is always prompt with her deliveries.  I've never had a problem with timing or with orders and from the amount of times I've ordered from them, that's really impressive!  

Basically they're inexpensive pizzas with elaborate and inventive toppings.  For a franchise, it's top notch!  My only complaint is I wish it had sit-down seating because I don't live nearby and yet still want pizza Bogo!
