For a Motley Crue fan like me, it doesn't get any better.  They play Crue music/videos the whole time you are there and there is Vince Neil/Motley Crue memrobilia all over the place.  I've heard Vince himself comes here which is pretty cool.  The only thing I don't like about it is how far away it is from the strip, but it's a quick ride on the monorail.  If you're a fan of the Crue definitely check this out.
