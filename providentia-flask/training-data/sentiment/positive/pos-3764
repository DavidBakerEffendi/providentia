Went here for my husband's birthday because we wanted an above average dining experience.  Bricco was excellent.

Service was impeccable.  Our waiter was attentive, informed, articulate, and spoke poetry about the dishes.  He really believed in the product he was selling, which to me always speaks volumes in a restaurant.  He took the time to chat without being intrusive, and kept our glasses full and the table tidy.  It's really hard to find this kind of service in Canada: in my experience I've only had this level of service in fine restaurants in Europe and Argentina, where serving seems to be viewed as more of a profession rather than a part time job or something to do between careers.

Ambiance was gorgeous.  The large window in the front, combined with the airy interior and Danish modern decor create a perfect blend of natural light and modern style.  There's lots of space between the tables so you don't feel crowded in, and the lighting is just right.

FOOD: loved it.  I had the cod with scallops, and it was cooked beautifully with a slight smoky flavour.  Asparagus was tender and flavourful; sauce was rich but on a special night out, a little fat is OK.  We had polenta, salad, and potatoes on the side.  The polenta was delicious but quite heavy: you don't need to eat more than a spoonful.  No room for dessert though it was a temptation.
