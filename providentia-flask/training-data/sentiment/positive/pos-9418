We came here for dinner on a Thursday and were very impressed! My only regret is that we weren't hungry enough to do "the treatment" which is where you pay $50 per person and your server customizes a menu for your table. We ended up just getting a few small plates each and everything we tried was amazing. The scallops were fantastic and the poke bowl was delicious and surprisingly big! My friend decided to order the hanger steak, which we all poke fun at because it's a seafood restaurant, but it turned out to be incredible and one of the best things we tried! The tagliatelle was also very good and they give you a very big portion. Overall, we liked everything we tried! I was pleasantly surprised at the portion sizes because small plates tend to be tricky and sometimes end up being way too small. They also have an extensive wine list, but it's a tad confusing because it's grouped by what the wine will pair with and not the type of wine, so it's hard to tell what is red vs white, etc.

Overall, we really liked this place and definitely want to come back and to "the treatment"!
