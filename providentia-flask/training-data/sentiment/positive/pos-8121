My favorite pizza place in Charlotte. Sadly owned by Yankee fans (said the Mets fan) who brought NY pizza and desserts down south with them. The owners are a lot of fun to have conversations with. I always make sure to get an order of cannoli because they are the closest I've found to the ones I used to get on Long Island.
