They have happy hour all-day Mon-Th. Definitely get there early as they always seem to be pretty busy for dinner. There have been a few times where I've tried to go and left because the wait was too long. Everything is delicious and the prices are really reasonable, which is probably why they are so popular. The sashimi portions are also very generous. I always seem to forget about this place, probably because I've struck out more than I've been able to eat here, but will definitely keep it in my sushi rotation.
