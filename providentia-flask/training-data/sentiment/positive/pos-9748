Oh my god, just roll me down the stairs and out the front door.  The red velvet pancakes are absolute perfection, and the only quibble we could find is that the portions are HUGE.  I didn't order the pancakes, but I ate the equivalent of half of one in sneaky bites from my friend's plate, and he still couldn't finish his order.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, which is a sloppy mess of incredible deliciousness (loaded up with coleslaw on a crisp sesame bun), and again, couldn't finish it.  Our other friend opted for the bread pudding French toast, which was very tasty (he cleared his plate!), but I didn't feel the same compulsion to fork an entire slab onto my plate as I did with the pancakes.

We got there around 11:30, which is ridiculously early on a Sunday morning, but it meant that we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table (which we spent down the street at Coffee Tree).  Definitely recommended.
