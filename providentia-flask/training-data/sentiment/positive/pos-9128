I am originally from New Jersey and while I am partial to the thinner crust pizzas, I do really enjoy deep dish as well. As my uncle would say, "Hey! Good pizza is good pizza." Avanti's deep dish is really good pizza. 

Excellent quality. Thank you to all those who commented on the sausage, it is the best I have ever had on any pizza. The cheese, sauce and pepperoni were dynamite as well. 

It is kind of tucked away in the shopping plaza on Pecos and Wigwam, but well worth the visit. Very nice people at the counter. 

It is only for to-go and delivery as they have no seating area.
