Berthas is that cafe that you turn to in your dire times of need. I'm talking your boyfriend broke up with you, your boss ripped on you, or you simply need to indulge in a to-go order that would make a spread of your bed. The best part about it is that it's comforting without the calories. 

It's. So. Good. 

The pesto pasta is to die for. Full of pesto and peas; it's sure to please. You can get it as your side, catered, or in a salad and it stays good (or even gets better) after sitting in the fridge for a few days. 

I've had the grilled cheese, the vegetable sandwich, the egg sandwiches, the roasted red pepper and goat cheese salad, the balsamic salad, and a few more salads on the list. Every single one of them is in the category of one of the best salads or sandwiches I've ever had. It kicks the nearest five star lunch out of this park! 

When you walk in, don't be alarmed. The setting, decor, and atmosphere don't match the food you're about to put in your mouth. Just imagine you're on a French patio and perhaps you can appreciate the quality of food you're about to indulge in.
