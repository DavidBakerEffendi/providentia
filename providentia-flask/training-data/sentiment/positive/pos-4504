The Einstein Bros bagel shop is always a winner for me. I want my pumpernickel bagel and they always have it! Add some of the Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice, and I am happy. As I come early (last time I was the first customer of the morning) I never meet a line and the staff is happy to see that someone showed up! So I seek this location out, off the strip, easy to get to, big parking, and of course the best, the number one Pumpernickel bagels!
