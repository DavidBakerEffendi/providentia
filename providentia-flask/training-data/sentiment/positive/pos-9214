Taiwanese 33 is truly amazing. The first time I went here was this past week. Its located right beside the Starbucks on Shady Ave. Parking is difficult- you need to find a spot on a side street somewhere. 
They have a cute outdoor patio. When we went it was reserved so we sat inside. 
I ordered the chicken with sa cha sauce and my husband ordered the stinky tofu. We also ordered the won ton soup to share. Servings are huge! We were able to bring it home and eat it again the next day. My chicken was delicious. The tofu was, stinky. I wasn't a fan but my husband liked it. My daughter ate a little bit of all of it. 
Our waitress was fantastic. She made kids chopsticks for my daughter to use. So cute!
We will be back!
