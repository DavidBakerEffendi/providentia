I came here based on Yelp reviews and this place did not disappoint. We ordered all of the staples of Hotpot. Everything from the Beef to veggies to the dumplings to the noodles to the fish balls to shrimp.....mmmmmm just writing this has me craving it again.

Anyways this place is a la carte style and you have to pay for everything from the sauces to the pots to the ingredients etc. but the prices are actually pretty reasonable.

I came with a big group and we all ended up paying about $45 with taxes and tips all in and we ordered almost EVERYTHING so that was not to shabby at all.  The price would have been just as much as an AYCE place.

I will definitely be coming back here for my hot pot cravings! PotMan is Top on my list for sure!
