I'm going with 4.5 stars. I love this place. I think it will be my new "go to" pub in Toronto. Two visits so far -  the first being a Yelp event organized by Jennifer K where I got to meet lot's of great yelpers and a second trip for beer and appetizers before a concert. Here's the good:

- Cozy comfortable bar. Two floors of seating - tables or at the bar. 

- Great service. The bartender on the second floor was amazing, she made lot's of recommendations and knows everything about beer. When i was waiting for one of the Keg's to be changed, I got a beer on the house while I waited.

- Great beer selection. Beers from Germany, Belgium, UK, Canada, France, Holland and a few other places. I love the Belgium selections - the Grimbergen is my favourite. ALl the beer is served in the correct glasses. I tried 6 different beers so far and they were all good. 

- Prices are good. They have a few expensive items but most pints are in the $5 - $7 range.

- I love the Belgium fries and the portion is huge for $5. They are served with Dill mayo but I prefer Ketchup.

- Good Irish beef stew. Most of the food items are cooked in or with beer in some way. Dishes have a German, Irish and Indian influences. Food is not 5 star dinning but rather good for a pub menu.

What more could I ask for... well maybe my own reserved table at all times!

On the downside:

- This place can get busy, so try and arrive early to get a table.

- Why would a beer pub only have a one urinal washroom? There were a few lineups  to use the washroom. 

Highly recommended. I'm on a mission to try all the beers - I'm like a kid in a candy store when I arrive. They even have a Yelp sticker on the door.
