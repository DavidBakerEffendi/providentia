Great Mexican food!
We came around 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon and it was really busy. We had about 40 minute wait, and decided to hang out at the bar. There was no seating at bar either, so we had to stand, but bar tenders were quick and friendly. They have happy hour EVERYDAY! The margaritas were like $5 and cheap beers. The margaritas were not watered down. I had the Pina Colada flavor, and it had sweet pieces of coconut and pineapple. 
I also had a spicy watermelon that was not on happy hour menu, but only $9 nice flavors and strong. 
Our waiter was really nice and took our orders pretty quick. Then we had the complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip. The bean dip is sooo good, but no free refills. 
2 other staff members came by to check on us throughout our meal and even apologized to us for the long wait.
Our food was delish and tasted homemade. Beans were creamy and full of garlic flavor. My fave was the chile relleno. It was stuffed with cheese and had a nice crispy coating even with the delish red sauce on top.
I will def be back especially for the delish and cheap margaritas! Hopefully not much of a wait on the next visit.
