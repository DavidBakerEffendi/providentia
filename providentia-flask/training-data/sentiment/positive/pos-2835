Great little shop, love the decor and the 2 guys behind the counter were very desirable. That aside, the Sandwiches were delish!  

I had the Vermonter, with the most amazing mayo-like sauce I have ever swallowed...
The atmosphere is comfortable and I will definitely be back again and again, if not for eye candy then at least for a little lunch.
