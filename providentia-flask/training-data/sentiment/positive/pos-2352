Well, this is my 300th review and I can't think of anyone more deserving of it than the Chili Man. Sidenote: I'm writing this review while eating a salad. This is the definition of torture.

I know what you're thinking, 300 reviews and she's giving 5 stars to a hot dog street vendor?! Vic is a lot more than that. He takes great pride in making quality toppings and creative menu options. On top of great food, he is a one man show. If there's a line, it is completely worth the wait. From his stories and anecdotes, to the menu descriptions and Chili Man facts, you'll have a giant smile on your face the entire time. You can't possibly have a bad day when you see Vic.

On to the food, he has different specials during the week. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter to see what he's got cooking. #SeeWhatIDidThere. Vic has told me for weeks that I need to get the Life Changer. I don't want to say a hot dog changed my life, but hot damn I do believe it did. It definitely deserves that name. Cheese, chili, Chili Man's designer taco sauce, homemade spicy mustard, jalapenos and onion. HOLY. Like, holy should be in 72 pt font. I also got a dog with kraut and homemade spicy mustard. It took a lot of restraint to only eat two hot dogs.

Things to know: don't see something on the named menu you like? Don't worry, you can build your own. Dogs come with unlimited toppings. Say what?! He does take a credit card. Don't work uptown and need a place to park? I like to park a couple blocks away on Poplar between 3rd and 4th streets. There are meters here and it's way cheaper than the parking decks. Don't have change? Use the park mobile app. Takes all of maybe ten seconds to park and pay. And trust me, you'll be thankful for that little walk back to your car after the dogs.

Review #300 is in the books. Here's to the next 300!
