I have been wanting to get here for ages and today was close by. Wandered in with my hungry teenager for early dinner.

This is such a friendly little shop. Quick service rather than table service. We were walked through the menu, ordered, and the food was brought over to our table. They even checked in at our table to make sure everything was good.

Everything we had was ready fast and was delicious:
Three tacos, two chicken and one steak
Chips and guacamole
Fanta Orange (in bottles!)
Jarrito Mandarito

A clean and cozy spot. We will definitely return. All in I give it five stars because if the decent price point, attentive service at a quick service and tasty food.
