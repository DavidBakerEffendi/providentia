I am so excited to have a smoothie place close to home. The smoothies and bowls are yummy. I especially like the peanut butter chocolate bowl. 

However, the furniture frustrates me. I can only get my smoothies and bowls to go. The furniture is not kid friendly and seating is limited. I have been here twice in two days. I'll be back very soon.
