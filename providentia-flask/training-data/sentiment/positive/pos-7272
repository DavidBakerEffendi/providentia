Wow wow wow! This place is delicious. Don't let the limiting menu options fool you. So amazingly good. I'd give them 10 stars if I could. The crepes are airy fluffy and crisp at the same time and they are a good size so you get a good portion. I got the turkey cheese avocado and onions in my crepe. Absolutely delightful. Super delish. Polite and great service. Awesome place!
