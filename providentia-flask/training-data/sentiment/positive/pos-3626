Pretty little cakes!
My husband loves this place!   I love this place too, but I'm not so much of a creature of habit.  I'm always prying him to try other places.   His fave is the turkey on ciabatta bread with the house dressing and micro greens.  I usually get the salad with a little tuna sandwich on a brioche roll.  There's something about fresh mozzarella on a brioche that my son adores.  Since they haven't had that one lately, he's been getting turkey on brioche as a second choice.  Funny how kids' little taste buds change so quick.  He didn't ask me to pluck out the radish microgreens this time.  

Great selection on coffees and teas.  My little sweetie can't wait for the little coconut lemon or red velvet cupcakes...so good!  I can see ordering the regular sized ones would have too much icing.  You can always just shave some off before you eat it.  The mini sizes are perfect enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.  The cakes are amazing.  I'm not a fan of fondant, but what a pretty little sight.  I've had cakes that looks similar to Tammie Coe's, but it's usually pretty dry and bland interior.  Her cupcakes and cakes are so flavorful, rich and moist. 

So glad it's quite a drive to get here.  Too much temptations!
