I visited Everly with some friends a while back but just now getting around to writing a review. I was so impressed with nearly everything about this place. Everything was so professionally done that it almost didn't feel like a neighborhood restaurant. We got there early and even though there wasn't room to sit at the bar it took no time at all to catch the eye of a bartender. My only negative critique is the size of the wine pour relative to the price. I appreciate the fact that the bar was trained to pour a precisely calculated pour but I'd rather pay an extra buck and feel like I got a generous pour. Also, for me, I'd prefer to have a small selection of popular national liquor brands in addition to the smaller craft brands. Lots of credit though for sourcing and supporting the small guys. Overall small concerns in light of such a positive experience. Everyone was friendly and our server was so pleasantly enthusiastic about the food and made lots of suggestions. We were with a vegetarian and there were plenty of vegetarian options that we were able to share among the group. The plates were small but it was nice to choose several options. After sharing vegetarian apps, I was ready for some meat and chose the steak which was served with bone marrow butter. I was a little skeptical at first but it ended up being amazing. I told the server about what a pleasant surprise it was and she offered to give me some to take home! I declined but word must have gotten back to the rest of the staff and when we were asked about our meals on the way out, the host said he heard I liked the marrow butter and offered me some to take home a second time. While a little unusual, I thought it was as friendly as you would expect from a neighborhood restaurant as it was professional and high end like you would expect from a fancy downtown restaurant. Looking forward to going back!
