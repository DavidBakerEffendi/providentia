THE FOOD.  I brought a couple of friends here, neither of whom had heard anything about the place beforehand.  They were weirded out by the decor (one of them asked me why we were in a sketchy hipster bar when I'd promised them dinner), but once our food started arriving, they were on board.  The menu is small but carefully chosen; we had a salad to start and then the tempura prawns (recommended by our waitress, and we loved them so much we ordered a second plate).  We tried the squash poutine, which exceeded all of our expectations.  The spicy chicken rice bowl wasn't particularly spicy, but it was filling and delicious.

Definitely worth another visit.
