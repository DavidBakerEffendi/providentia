Great atmosphere here. I love the wall art which is by a local artist. The space is quite big for queen street and is a variety of booths in the bar to sit at by the coffee bar. Very good ALL day breakfast selection. All breads and biscuits are made in house ! And the prices are great. Duely note it is cash only right now but the debit machine is coming soon! Lovely staff who are are very friendly snd welcoming who make u feel like an automatic regular. There's choices of big tables of your coming with a group or side tables of your coming with a friend or so. It has a very homey vibe- I can see this becoming my regular break my spot fast. Speciality coffee drinks here are quality and great prices. Side note- I really like the music playlist they have here.. Super mellow and fun- all round great breakfast experience. Plus u can come come all day for it since they're open till 8pm serving it! Shout out to the chicken sausage it os DEELICIOUS and I really like the salad dressing they use its fresh and flavourful.
