Vegas has weird weather at times and last week it was windy and cold, the perfect weather for soup. I just didn't know what, and I didn't want to go far for it.  I asked my cousin and he suggested Pan Asian. 

Looking at the menu, everything listed looked so appetizing.  I wanted to try them all.  My budget for that day for lunch wasn't more than $6 so I ordered Tom Kha soup made with coconut, chicken, some different herbs I've never seen or tasted before, lemon grass, and amongst other things.  

It was the exact kind of goodness I just needed on a cold windy day.  The sour taste was just perfect and not overpowering the whole dish.  Everything together was combined well.  The service was also comforting as the employees all were very patient, and easy to talk to.  It's also great to be able to speak with the chef.  It's rare that chefs talk to their patrons anymore.  It definitely was a nice change.

I am curious about their penang curry and the other curries they're serving.
