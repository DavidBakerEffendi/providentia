Omg these tacos are to die for they're sooooo good I can't even describe how amazing they are. I got these tacos called el jefe which is a hard taco with a soft shell. The tacos are seasoned perfectly and also the service was good. Not to mention the lady who sat us was smoking hot. If you're downtown and wanna have a some good tacos and possibly pick up a chick go to barrio.
