Impressed yet again with a place in Chesterland that I did not have high expectations for! Kudos Chesterland, you are changing my opinions at every single turn!!

I have had two lunches from Farmer in the Deli. First time I ordered a scoop of their tuna salad with some horseradish cheddar cheese - decent experience and a good introduction to a new place! However, it wasn't until last week, when I ordered a roast beef sandwich, was I utterly satisfied and officially hooked. I got all the toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion) plus the jalapeno havarti. Add a little mayo and a smidge a mustard.... Wow. The sandwich was large too! Definitely worth the price of $7.99-8.99 depending on your order.
