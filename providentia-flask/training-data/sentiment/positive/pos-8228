Best pho place ive been to so far. Huge portions, good prices, and the service is great. 

I ordered the pho with tendon and eye round steak and shrimp fried rice

The restaurant has a large variety of food in their menus including desserts such as macaroons and ice cream, they have sandwiches, and great appetizers

Will come back again when im in the area
