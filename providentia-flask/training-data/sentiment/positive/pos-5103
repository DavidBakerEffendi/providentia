What a gem for the Gibsonia area! I was able to stop on the second day they were open and had a wonderful lunch!

We were greeted quickly and seated just as fast. Drinks came quickly and we ordered lunch. I had chicken pad Thai at a spice level of 4(1 to 4 is your choice Lunch came with a free spring roll, which was a surprise! Super fresh and crispy. My pad Thai didn't take long to come after that and was absolutely delicious. It was spicey but wasn't overly spicy. Just right! The bean sprouts on it were sooo fresh and crispy! 

The service here is very quick and nice. I can tell the owner and worker I saw really cared! We were in and out in less than 45 minutes!

I am so happy to have another option in the area and will be coming back for more! A good, quick, and super yummy lunch option! A must try spot in the area
