Still five stars all around! The flavor is spot on with anything I've ordered. The portions are huge and the price is right. My husband and I can order several things for under $20. The staff is always friendly. They also have daily specials for $5.99 that are very tasty. I love that their food isn't overly greasy and is made fresh. 
Some of our favorite items to order are the carnitas burrito with guacamole, beans, and pico, any one of their chimichangas are always huge and yummy, the fish tacos, chile relleno, and the al pastor taco salad. This place also gains points in my book for being open 24 hours!! Anytime the need for some solid Mexican munchies hits Rubalcabas is there!
