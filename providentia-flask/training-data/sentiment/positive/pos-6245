Vin Papillion is an excellent concept. Unlike its sister restaurants down the street VP does not take reservations, so you can go on a whim and there is no need to plan your dinning schedule 3 months in advance. The resto has just expanded so waiting times at peak periods should be reduced. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but if you show up early or late in the evening there is a rarely a wait for a table.

I think that the food and atmosphere are terrific. They have a really nice terrace in the back where they have a charcoal BBQ. The menu is written on a chalkboard by the front door and is updated regularly (I've uploaded a pic of a recent version). Dishes are small tapas style offerings, great for sharing with friends. Some of my favorites from recent visits include the grilled calamari, the Spanish style toast with tomatoes & muscles and the corn profiteroles. Special mention go to the profiteroles as they are a truly unique dish. They really mean it when they say corn. They are made with corn flour, topped with popcorn and what I think is some sort of a corn syrup based sauce. The taste of corn is very strong and unique, much less sweet than you would expect. Even if you don't enjoy the corniness, you will certainly appreciate the unique flavour that has been created. 

Oh, and of course there is a great wine list.
