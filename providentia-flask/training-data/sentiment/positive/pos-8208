I dont understand why people hate this place so much. I've been going to bubble republic since i was 11, that was 8 years ago I even applied to work here before but I was too young and didnt have enough time.

Seriously this place is probably the best place to go for bubble tea in mississauga, its even better then Cha-Time and Bubble Tease.

Their bubble tea hasnt changed its amazing taste, they feature TWO SIZES of tapioca, which you wont get any other place.

Their Taiwanese chicken is probably the best ive ever had, always crispy and seasoned perfectly. 

The only 2 things i dont like, is that they dont offer delivery and more locations, and even so i would walk after a long day at work to order their delicious bubble tea.

Their prices are pretty expensive for bubble tea, but good quality bubble tea is so worth it. I will continue to support them.

This little bubble tea shop is a gem to mississauga and remains unbeaten all these years and ive tried a lot of bubble tea in my years. 


My recommendation:
-Panna Cotta Bubble Tea
-Caramel Pudding Bubble Tea
-Smash Oatmeal Bubble Tea
-Vanilla Ice Cream Bubble Tea
