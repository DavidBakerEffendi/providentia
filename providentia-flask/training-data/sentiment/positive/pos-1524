The cookies here are really good. Every time you go in you can get a hot chocolate chip cookie. They are the best that way! You simply MUST try it. I have tried several of their other cookies and they are all really great.

The people there are always really nice and friendly too.

Now they have chocolate covered chocolate chip cookies. While they are not warm like regular chocolate chip cookies they are still a MUST HAVE!
