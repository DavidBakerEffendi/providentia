Very nice place. Brought my family here for a great dining experience:

Location - A bit off the beaten path, but that adds to it's "find" as a nice place to eat.

Ambiance - A bit sterile, but clean and warm. since this place is out of the way, and it is a bit sterile, it has a very modern feel. Overall, it is pleasant and not an issue.

Food - Fresh, good quantity and flexible. You can order any size dish you want, vegetable, pork, chicken and beef as well as seafood. Nice appetizers and great tea. If you haven't had Genmai tea yet, try it. Nice green tea with roasted brown rice. Very flavorful.  Cooking the food in the clear water or the sukiyaki (suggest you try both) is fun. They give you dipping sauces for the clear water method and while not extremely taste overpowering, it is subtle and refined. For those that enjoy being overloaded with powerful taste or spices, you have to prepare yourself for the subtlety that is shabu shabu at it's finest.

Service - For one waitress, very excellent. She will also "train" you on how to eat Shabu Shabu and how to cook it.

Price - Very good.  For three people, with drinks and good amount of food, you might spend up to 75.00. Figure on 20-25 per person depending on what you order.

Reservations - not required, but they have three tables of four, nd one long table that perhaps seats a total of 18 or so?

Parking - Very easy. In an underused strip mall in the burbs.

Finally - You gotta try it. this place will grow on you. I have taken family and business partners there.
