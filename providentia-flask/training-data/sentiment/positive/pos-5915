I went here for a birthday and wasn't expecting anything fantastic considering it was a fixed menu for a large group. Wow was I ever proven wrong. 
The salmon tartare was DELISH, drinks were on point, calamari was super fresh and crunchy... we had plate after plate after plate after plate being served to us. I can't even remember half of what I had but you MUST try this place.
