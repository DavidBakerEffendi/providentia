Consistently good in with their food and always great with service.  Tonight we came for their Sunday Fried Chicken, which might be the best fried chicken in the city!!  Four delicious pieces of chicken, honey glazed carrots, and mashed potatoes for $22.  You can't go wrong.  I started with the Caesar Salad which is so good.

The kids had their usual Salmon kids meal which is such a bargain and just a great dish.  My wife tried the Margherita Pizza for the first time and finished with her favorite Bread Pudding in the city!!

Kudos to Honey Salt for keeping us coming back week after week.
