I live about 45 minutes from AB so I'm not exactly "in the neighborhood."  Yet, we end up there more times than I can count.  And why is that?  

The service is fantastic.  The drinks (especially the drinks of the week) are extremely tasty and it's just an all around good time.  We went there last night after a less than amazing experience across the street at the Bitter & Twisted Cocktail lounge.  Our awesome server (I can't remember her name but she looks like Carrie from Mythbusters) smoothed over our rough experience and was present without being too present.  It's kind of like going to your best friend's house - comfy and fun.
