I had heard great things about this place from fellow Yelpers and coworkers, so I had to check it out. It's only a minute away from where I work, so it's very convenient for lunch. 

It's a an interesting location -- in the building that's almost part of the gas station. There aren't many tables, so it's probably easier to get your food to go. 

We got the Pollo con Crema and the Choripollo. The serving sizes are huge, so expect to have leftovers. Both of our dishes were delicious. They were even better if you mixed them together. I probably liked the chorizo dish more, but both were very good. 

This is a no frills, hole in the wall Mexican place serving up delicious food. Everyone I was with really enjoyed what they got. We all left stuffed. You get your food pretty fast -- within 5-10 minutes. 

This place is definitely worth going out of your way to check out! You will not be disappointed.
