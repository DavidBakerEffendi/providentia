I don't understand how The Root Cafe isn't more packed all the time--I love this place. It's sunny, homey, and fun, and their menu is always full of delicious, vegetable-heavy foods. From their sides (which can be as inexpensive as $1.50) like beets with basil and roasted sweet potato to their pizzas and sandwiches, everything is wholesome and incorporates fresh combinations of flavor. I haven't tried any of their baked goods, but they always look picturesque behind the counter.

The people at The Root make the atmosphere so comfortable. I've seen the owners' children there several times, and when they're playing in the cafe it feels like you're in someone's home (but in a good way--the children are well-behaved and charming). And I love that they have discounted pizza (the good kind) and beer for cyclists on Wednesdays; really, how could a cafe be more wonderful?
