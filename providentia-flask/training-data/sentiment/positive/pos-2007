I was searching for good Korean chicken wings and stumbled on to this place. To my surprise, it is superb. I always get the soy garlic sauce. It is very Asian and tasty. Wings are juicy and the batter is thin and crispy. Wings being so good, I tried other items on the menu and they are also really good. Portions are decent and prices are reasonable. Overall good value. I'm surprised that this place is not always packed because it is a hidden gem. The decor is good. Waitresses are cute and attentive. There is also a call button on the table to ask for service. I also like the fact that it opens late. It is good for people who works late or on busy schedules. I recommend this restaurant. I will be back often.
