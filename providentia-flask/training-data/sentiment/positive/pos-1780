Our party of 5 had food babies fathered by Rick Moonen.

JSYK, there's a downstairs dining area (more casual, entrees ~$20, 3 course prix fixe for $55 available) and an upstairs (more elegant dining, entrees ~$40, 5 course prix fixe for $75).  

No beating around the bush.  The eats were fantastic!  The oysters and octopus with falafel got our appetites going, and I'm really glad I ordered the walu entree.  Not knowing what to expect out of my fish dinner, I loved every bite of it!  The fish had the texture of a cross between tofu, flan, and fresh mozz cheese curd.  P.S. That description is supposed to get you excited, not weird you out.  It came accompanied with mini mushroom egg rolls.  Divine!

Don't skip out on dessert.  The strawberry short cake and irish car bomb offerings were a hit and ingenious creations. 

Waitstaff was attentive, informative, and warm.  The only thing is that we had literally 4-5 different people checking on us (were they supposed to be specific to some role?  That wasn't clear.), which was overwhelming.

A can't miss dining experience!
