I just ordered food to go- haven't even tried it yet but this place already gets five stars simply for service. I'm currently only eating paleo ( no grains, dairy, or sugar) and the owner let me trade items in and out to basically create a chicken fajitas place with only meat and lots of extra veggies with guac. This meal will be fantastic
