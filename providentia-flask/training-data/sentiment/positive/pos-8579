This place is new, and its amazing! On my first time, I order the dripping cheddar, roast beef sandwich... BLEW MY MIND AWAY!
Second time visiting, I ordered the Farmer's Market Bene, and I was sad once I was almost done ravishing it! 
closes at 3pm, everyday, which annoys me, because sometimes I need a late a lunch, or an early dinner while on campus  :(
