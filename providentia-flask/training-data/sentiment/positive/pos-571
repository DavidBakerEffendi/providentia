Love this Cheesecake Factory! The food is just right every time i eat there! This time. We had fantastic service at the bar during happy hour. The happy hour food deals are excellent, though there are no drink specials.

We enjoyed the artichokes-my fave and the artichoke crab dip. Both were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection.


I wish we had a Cheesecake Factory near me!
