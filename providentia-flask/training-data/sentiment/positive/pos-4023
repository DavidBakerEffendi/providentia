Fast casual pizza and salads at its best. I've never had a bad experience at Mod Pizza. Service is always great and staff actually look happy to be there.

One thing I love is customization. When you first order, you can choose one of the pizzas from the wall or start there and add more toppings or you can just say everything you want. Same goes for the salads. All the toppings are fresh and there's a large variety. And you can get as many toppings as you want even proteins at no extra cost. Pizzas go into  brick oven. And the salads are tossed in a huge bowl in front of you. 

I'm trying to make better decisions and honestly I love the salads at Mod. Having to choose between pizza and salad is actually hard here. I went with a salad. I got mixed greens, grilled chicken, salami, sliced tomatoes, Greek olives, sweet and spicy peppers, roasted broccoli, parmesan and croutons tossed in Italian dressing. It was light, but full of flavor. The lil' sweet and spicy peppers are my favorite. 

Definitely love coming here for a quick bite!
