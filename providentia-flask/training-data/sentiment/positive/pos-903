We love Bar Vinedo!  In fact, we've become "regulars" for good reason. They have a great wine and beer selection. Specialty cocktails too. I prefer a red or red blend such as Langhe Rosso, which they have on tap - SO DARN GOOD. The ambiance is relaxed and aesthetically pleasing. Their food is top notch and beautiful in presentation. My favorites are the ahi tuna (I ask for a side of their remoulade sauce and substitute the roasted bliss potatoes for their amazing housemade whipped or garlicky au gratin potatoes, only because of my personal preference, but all options are delicious), the grilled cheese with smokey tomato bisque, the Hot to Handle burger with a veggie patty (chefs Michael & Julie are very accommodating and will often add fresh habaneros to my orders - the hotter the better lol). My husband swears that their chicken wings are the best in town (he orders them grilled). He also enjoys their tender filet mignon and flavorful braised short ribs. They have awesome charcuterie boards too. Dessert? Heck yes!  I highly recommend their lemon buttermilk cake and chocolate pecan torte. I'm getting hungry as I type this review. :)  And finally, I can't forgot to mention their attentive, friendly staff; hands down some of the best in the industry. Give them a chance, you will not be disappointed!
