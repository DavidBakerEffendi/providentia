Delicious (but TINY!)
The reviews are great - I love my yelp community!
This was a hidden gem of a spot - all the reviews lay true.
Watch for the entrance to this spot - if you walk by you'll be circling trying to figure it out. The entrance is literally across the street from an alley way! Don't forget that part.
We waited in line for a solid 20 minutes before ordering.
There are only 10 tables in the joint, and you can only sit after getting a table number, you only get a table number after you order, and you only order after you've waited. Bizarre but strangely effective.

I ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon on a croissant! Genius (I thought so) as it's not on the menu but the owner was happy to oblige. (Yes I paid extra, no I didn't mind) it was worth it. My fianc√© also got the Eggs Benny with bacon on a classic English muffin and said it was good - but not as good as mine.

We followed our breakfast with hot tea and a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant to go! (Order it with your breakfast or there will be none left!)

Don't go if you're starving or in a hurry - we went there for 11AM and I could tell the people waiting in line behind us were not pleased with the wait - brunching in Montreal is not the same as Toronto or Europe.

Lovely breakfast and I will definitely be back - the only thing missing was music - it was crazy silent and the space is so beautiful - it was strange not to have soft music playing in such a lovely space.
