Tried their lunch buffet with friends from work. Very fresh authentic South And North Indian food. I liked the tava fish as it was lent, the place is clean and they include mango lassi and chai in the buffet. Krishna was stocking the buffet and answered my questions and really is a great Manager.  Try this place for authentic fresh and tasty Indian food.
