Another joy of living in Las Vegas is the ability to see the fountains any day.  I am never on Las Vegas Boulevard that I don't put the window down to hear the music and get a quick look at the fountains.  Sometimes, I play tour leader and station myself along the sidewalk by the fountains to take photos of couples who want to be in a photo together.

There's something soothing and very pleasant about the fountains.  The idea for this display was fantastic!  What a lovely way to welcome someone to the property.

If you visit in the mornings, you can generally see the raft with fountain crew going about tending to the jets and lights.  The raft comes out of an area under Olives Restaurant that's referred to as the Bat Cave.  These men and women tend to the fountain and make sure it's in great shape for the daily shows.

5 stars always for this grand Las Vegas experience.
