Another hit by Chris Bianco.  Restaurant has a great atmosphere.  Food was delicious.  From the awesome bread to the dessert.

I had homemade fettuccine with Bolognese sauce.  Perfectly cooked pasta and very tasty.  Love scooping up that sauce with the bread.  My wife had the braciole.  Again, cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth.

Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.
