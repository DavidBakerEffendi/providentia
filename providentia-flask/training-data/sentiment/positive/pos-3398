One of my favorite places in Charlotte! A great environment, always great service and an exceptional dining experience.

If you are looking for a healthy meal, look no further. Luna's offers a wide range of salads, entrees and appetizers to appeal to anyone's taste. They also have smoothies, cold press juices and make a fabulous Chai tea latte.

Looking for a way to kick start a new weight loss program or eating routine, try their juice cleanse. You will feel great and clean out the toxins from your body.

Luna's has an outdoor area for dining when the weather is nice and plenty of space to park you car or bike.
