Tina's Gourmet Sausages is a European Deli that serves cold cuts, sausages, fish, pasta, and of course pierogis! This place reminds me of a mom and pop deli in the east coast. Definitely brought back memories when I used to live in NY. :) The customer service is really cool. There was a young lady who offered us many samples to try like their smoked fish. It is amaziiiing! The fish just melts in your mouth. If you go, you have to try it! We bought a few of their cold cuts and their pierogis. They carry other brands of pierogis but if you ask, they make their own in the back. Really tasty! Will go back :)
