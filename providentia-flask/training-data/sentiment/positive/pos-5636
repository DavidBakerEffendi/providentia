Back at 602 after a long absence.  Greeted and seated immediately.  We both ordered #25 chicken and shrimp vermicelli bun with egg roll.  A handful of patrons here on a Sunday.  Food came quickly and was  beautifully presented.  The egg roll was crispy and fresh.  The shrimp and chicken were grilled nicely.  Very tasty with the fish sauce.  Glad we made it a return trip. Excellent prices and parking available.
