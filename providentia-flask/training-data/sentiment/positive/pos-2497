I kept seeing this place in my Facebook feed, so I finally went to check it out. The food was absolutely delicious. I love the fact that they gave you large quantities! The complimentary salsa, chips and bean dip were perfect. If you are able to make it during happy hour time, the portions are large and at cheaper prices. This is definitely a new favorite spot for my family!
