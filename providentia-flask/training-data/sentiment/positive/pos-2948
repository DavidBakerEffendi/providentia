Wierdest thing, as I was meeting a blind date there recently...and I realized that I had a tired but not-yet expired Groupon for the Cove.  So I arrived a few minutes early, and the bartender and 1 server were rocking and handling the entire floor together.  They were busy, but focused,  and they communicated well w/the guests and each other.

I told the bartender that I was meeting a blind date, and had a Groupon, and before I could ask she offered to help me get that part out of the way now so as not to confuse the would-be blind date.  What an awesome gesture!  But it gets better...

Having a small amount of a martini still in shaker, she offered me a little something "to take the edge off".  This was a a keen bartender (great drink!), and a great service-minded lady, who had my back all evening.  She gracefully seated my date and I at the perfect patio table, and the night was splendid!

The food?  Solid as a rock.  AND great beer, wine, and mixed drinks.  Jill is a class act and I look forward to visiting the Cove and sitting at Jill's bar soon :)  I have been there before, and why I waited so long, no good answer avails itself!  Go to the Cove, you'll love it.
