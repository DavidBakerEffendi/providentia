I love this place! Definitely my weakness. This is authentic Mexican food. My family is from Chihuahua, Mexico. This is the food I grew up eating. They make their tacos with homemade tortillas which is hard to find in any taco place. I'm always perfectly satisfied with the portions. The rajas gordita is my favorite along with the tripas tacos. The deshebrada meat is also very good in both green and red. Potatoes are not just a filler as somebody mentioned in their review. This is how it is authentically made in Chihuahua.
