I was with a group who was invited to sample the food.  I had a few appetizers, entrees, and deserts.  All dishes were extremely well made.

The chef was at our table quite a bit and he talked to us about how he wanted the food to be like.  He wants to combine all kinds of flavors into a dish instead of just filling it up with garlic.  Some dishes were made to be nostalgic but with a twist.

I can tell he does this when I was eating.  One dish was a salad with goat cheese and watermelon.  There were so many flavors to choose from to eat.  It all worked well together.

My favorite dish was the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was perfect.  The outer had a nice crunch.  The inner was soft and juicy.  The waffles were amazing.  I don't normally like waffles but this one had a nice sweet taste to it.  I loved it.

I also got a chance to speak with the owner.  He talked about how Pittsburgh is changing and segregated.  He ask what happens to the days when everyone of all nationality just get together and have fun.  So he wanted Savoy to be comfortable for everyone.

I agree Savoy is comfortable.  Everyone there is super nice.  There is a dress code.  You don't have to be super dressed up.  Just look nice.  Sometimes it's nice to NOT see people with sagging pants and butt cracks.

The lounge upstairs can be used for parties.  The patio is nice to hang out on a nice day.  There is a basement that can be reserved for small parties.

Fun fact, the designer of the place is from Penn Hill.

Overall, I love this place.  The food is good, the atmosphere is welcoming, and the people and service are super nice.  The chef is a real good guy.  This isn't your Eatn Park.  Don't come here if you want to spend $10 to feed a family mediocre food.
