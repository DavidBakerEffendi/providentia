Ok, so I came here with my wife because we had to visit some shops close by.  It literally has been at least several years since we have gone to a Panda Express and for the life of me, neither of us could figure out why.  

We came on a Saturday night and as you would expect they were decently busy.  This I will say about this particular location, it is the biggest Panda Express I have ever seen.  Which worked well for them because it didn't feel crowded.  We noticed several large families dining and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  

My wife still orders the same thing, Orange Chicken and she tried the new Honey Sesame.  She really enjoyed them both.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and the Kung Pao Chicken.  I enjoyed the tenderness of the Teriyaki and the heat of the Kung Pao.  Both were well done.  

The only complaint I had is that when we went to get drinks after we ordered, there was a cluster at the Fountain Machine. With that many people, they really needed 2.  

Overall we had a really good time!
