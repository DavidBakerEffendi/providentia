I've tried most of the Caribbean restaurants in the Charlotte area and I've got to say that the Caribbean Hut has been the best thus far. Granted this review is based on my first, the flavor and deliciousness were amazing enough for me to be confident in saying it's the best!

I ordered the chicken combo special (Jerk & Curry), with rice and beans and cabbage. The large cost under $15 and the portions were enough for 2 meals (a good amount of food). I knew the food was good because I couldn't stop eating it, even though I knew I was full. The jerk chicken was spiced just right with a subtle kick. The curry chicken was moist and flavorful. Every thing tasted so good. The grub was on par with my favorite Caribbean restaurants in Brooklyn and even my parents food (don't tell them I said that.)

This place is located in a strip mall and I would have never thought to venture there if not for checking Yelp. I'm already planning on visiting Caribbean Hut more often and will take advantage of their lunch specials. Next on deck: oxtails and the roti. I hope to have another 5 star flavor experience.
