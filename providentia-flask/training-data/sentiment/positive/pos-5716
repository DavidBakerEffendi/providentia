Delicious burgers, fabtastic onion ribs,  Lynyrd Skynyrd to  on the jukebox,  really tasty whiskey and Coke...not sure how life gets better. Oh,  wait,  I know! Buzzfeed tablet trivia, a very comfortable bar where the waitstaff remembers you, and invents drinks for you on the spot, and did I mention the burgers? The bathroom is clean and not scary, the crowd is clean and not scary,  they can make an old-fashioned, there's  a jukebox and pool tables, daily drink specials,  and you aren't spending an arm and a leg for a great evening. Hey, by the way,  order a burger!
