For a glass of wine and some appetizers in a pleasing atmosphere complete with a fireplace inside, firepits outside, live music some nights and great service... well, you can't beat Vintage 95 in good ol' downtown Chandler. What to wear? Anything your heart desires. While jeans and flip flops on the patio would be fine, you can definitely show up in a sexy dress and heels and not feel out of place in their dining room. 

A few tips:
+ For seating: Romantic, dark and seductive indoor setting. Casual, fun and relaxing outdoor patio.
+ Live music: Thursday nights are my favorite with Sarah singing and playing guitar inside. She can play anything from Bob Marley to Adele to The Beatles to Rihanna. Her voice is soothing and sweet. Love her! Don't forget to bring tip money! If you do forget, the closest ATM is a few doors down at that crazy Bourbon Jack's.
+ Sunday brunch: Must try! Delish! All that needs to be said.
