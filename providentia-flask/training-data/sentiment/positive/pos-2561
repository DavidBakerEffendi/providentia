I just stopped in Safeway and Pita Kitchen had a coupon on the back of the receipt. $2 off a entree and $5 off if you spend $20.   I decided to check it out. I ordered the Gyro combo with a Greek salad instead of the fries. The salad had a lot of feta cheese and olives, which most Greek restaurants skimp on. The
 salad was a meal in itself. I was almost full and was only going to take a bite out of the Gyro. It was so good I ate the whole thing.  I will definitely be back.
