Michael on the grave shift (1:40am) was super nice. I was feeling kind of down and his upbeat personality on the speaker and at the window put me in such a better mood. That was just the boost I needed for my day. You guys need to hire 100 Michaels! Can't wait to come back next time I'm in the area!
