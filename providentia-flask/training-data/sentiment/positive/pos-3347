I've written a lot below, but this deli is a great place to grab lunch in an atmosphere where you feel like you stepped back in time.  If you live in Cleveland or are visiting, stop in and grab a sub or a hot entree, you'll be glad you did.

I first experienced Biagio Deli back in 2003.  My office was down the road on Lander in Mayfield and there weren't many other good places to get lunch.  The place is named after the former owner, and yes his name is Biagio.  Great person who sold and retired to the South.  

The new owners are carrying on most of the traditions that made the place great.  However, there are two things they need to remember; first, offer a small sample of sausage or veal, or whatever hot dish is going on for the day on a toothpick to every customer that comes into the deli.  Biagio did this for everyone that came in, and it was a really great way to expose people to new things and or promote something that was profitable.  Next, bring back the Italian Beef.  He had one of the best outside of Chicago.

Not to take the spotlight off this business, but Ferrara's on Mayfield is a more full service deli.  I love them too.

Biagio for great prepared food.

Ferrara's for the same, and for spices, homemade bread, oil, wine, etc.  

Update:

Visited today and found that the sub just isn't what it used to be. The bread was nowhere near the quality of the past and the cuts of meat were different than when Biagio owned the place. Based on today's experience, Biagio's isn't even in my top ten sub places in the area. Too bad because they had a really wonderful product with that sanguich (yep, sanguich).

I'll try again in a couple of months just to confirm, but the sliced ham had no flavor and used to be cappacuolo. Seemed more like straight up ham to me. Sub bun was grainy, soft all the way through, and just not a good bread product.
