The food was fantastic! My wife and I went for the first time tonight. I have never liked curry, so I've never been a Thai fan that much, but this place may change that opinion. We had 3 appetizers, and they were all good, but the thailicious dumplings were both our favorite. They are almost meatballs with a small wrapper, and the ginger sauce was excellent!

I think take out on Friday is at hand now. Decisions decisions. :

The only complaint I had was the baseball place next door. Don't sit at the table with the big copper lined lamp over it. The noise and vibration from balls hitting the wall was ridiculous!
