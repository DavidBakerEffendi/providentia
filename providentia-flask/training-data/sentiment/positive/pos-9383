Came here on a Friday night with M for ramen. I was pleasantly surprised that their meat options could be made vegetarian friendly. Even their broth could be changed. The service here is very friendly and they are on top of everything. As I finished drinking my water they were already over to refill it (there were other patrons in the restaurant as well). I really liked that their veggies were charred as I think it added extra flavour.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone craving ramen. 
Parking is in the back and you have to pay for it...or it's easily accessible by ttc by getting off at Yonge and Sheppard.
