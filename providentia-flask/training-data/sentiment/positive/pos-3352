This noodle shop is located inside Venetian hotel. After reading good reviews I had to try it myself. 

All the servers and kitchen staff are indeed chinese which is a good sign. In fact, servers spoke to me in Mandarin. I don't speak Mandarin. The servers are very efficient and very on it. 

We ordered Hong Kong won ton noodles, brisket and tendon noodles, and shrimp chives dumpling. They were all excellent. I love how won ton noodles were very thin. 

There was a line but it went by pretty quickly. There's a big menu screen outside of the restaurant.
