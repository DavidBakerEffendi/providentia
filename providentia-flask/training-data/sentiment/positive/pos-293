I cannot believe I have not written a review for Yummy Yummy yet... This is my absolute favorite Chinese restaurant on the west coast!!!! The only thing better is in NYC so that's really saying something. I have had delivery from these guys a couple dozen times and occasionally I pick up too but I have never dinned in for some reason. I have never had a bad meal. Since moving away from Scottsdale I dream about yummy and when I visit arizona, this is my very first stop. Do yourself a favor and try out the best Chinese food on the west coast :)
