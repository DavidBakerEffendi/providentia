Kudos to the mastermind(s) behind this place! While standing in line watching all of the fantastic looking yummi-ness coming from behind the counter, I had to step aside because I couldn't decide! Finally, I ordered the Passion Fruit fusion tea and a couple of macaroons. Oh.my.gosh. Quite possibly the best non-alcoholic drink that I have ever tasted. It had very little ice and was loaded with fruit pieces. I just about inhaled the macaroons as well. So good; will definitely be back soon.
