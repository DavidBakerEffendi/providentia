Great vibe. Very relaxed and friendly service. The sides that came with the entrees were fresh and delicious. The servings were plentiful but lacked a little flavor, however the overall presentation was appetizing and excellent. The menu was more of a hybrid of mostly Korean and some Thai. I will be going back and highly recommend this chill spot for  a date night or even just meeting an old friend.
