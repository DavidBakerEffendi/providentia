Atmosphere was pleasant and I was seated promptly at the front bar. I was attended to and placed my order within a minute of sitting down. I ordered the Fire &I Ice ramen; the ramen bowl was absolutely divine. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was delectably complex; built upon multiple layers of flavors, it left me breathless. I will be returning again soon to try more items on the menu!
