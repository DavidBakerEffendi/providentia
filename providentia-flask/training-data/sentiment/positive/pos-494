I have to tell you about the brunch I had at El Chorro over the weekend... 

So good! It literally couldn't have been any better. It was a gorgeous day out to start with and we got to sit out on the beautiful patio. We ordered the Eggs Benedict (a must try!!) and the Smoked Salmon to split, and some Truffle Fries to snack on while we waited for our food. The chef also sent out a giant Shrimp Cocktail for us to try as well; probably the best shrimp I have ever had. Cooked perfectly and a great salsa/cocktail sauce to go with. The Eggs Benedict were absolute perfection. No BS, couldn't have asked for them to have been better in any way; it is hard to paoch an egg to perfection and they nailed it. The Smoked Salmon was very impressive as well; nicely toasted bagel, cream cheese, capers and a light salad on the side. 

You MUST go try their brunch on Saturday or Sunday. Amazing!
