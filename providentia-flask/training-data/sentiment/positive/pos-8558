I love this CPK!  it really is the best of all the locations.  Michelle has waited on me the last two times and always delivers warm and friendly service.  In fact, everyone is so nice here.  A sign of great Mgt.  I pop in here often when I am shopping and sit at the bar. Love there Moroccan and BBQ chicken salads.  The super thin crust marguerita pizza is excellent as well. Service is quick, food is good, what more can you ask for?  

P.S.  Try the Sangrias too! Super fresh!
