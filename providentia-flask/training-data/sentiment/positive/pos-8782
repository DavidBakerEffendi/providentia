I have stayed at this resort, partied at this resort and been entertained at this resort and I have nothing negative to say unless that it's so expansive you have to wear really comfy shoes.

The rooms are beautifully appointed and generous in size.  The staff is always on point and very helpful.  The pool areas  : ) and let's not forget the canals and all the shops around there.  Add to it that they now have one of my new favorite spots to haunt (Bourbon Room).

The Venetian is "as good as it gets"  Extra points that this is one place that actually looks better than it's namesake.
