I loved this spot, while I'm a fan of the whole Joe Beef thing this was so much fun, the no reservation slightly later hours meant that we could pop in for a "dessert" and glass of wine late night and still enjoy other parts of the night elsewhere.
Shared a fantastic clam dish with porchetta and bread crumbs and a lovely gamay. The prices can add up fast here but so worth it. Didn't try the orange wines but found that they make wonderful suggestions. Go if you have a chance.
