Yes it is good pizza--I love a good gourmet pizza. Is this the best pizza in Toronto? I don't know. But it sure is a billion times better than eating the pizza chain cardboard pizza we've all grown up on. That they make certified authentic Neapolitan pizza in an imported wood-burning oven (the focal point of their open kitchen) might convince a few to believe they are really eating a slice of pure gold. 

But here in the east end, we are blessed with a Liberetto that is much bigger than the crowded Ossington Liberetto. Most importantly, they take reservations here. Suckers!

You can't go wrong with either the grilled eggplant or the Ontario prosciutto pizza. The service is fantastic. Washrooms are downstairs, which also reveals an additional dining room and bar that can host private events. Most interestingly, if you bring a slice home and eat it the next day, it still taste fresh and awesome.
