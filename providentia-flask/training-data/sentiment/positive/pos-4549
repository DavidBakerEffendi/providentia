I've only ever had Americanos and cookies here. 5 stars. The cookies are incredible. Stick to the chocolate chunk or walnut chocolate chunk... you can't go wrong. Gooey and freshly baked... these are what cookies should be. I go out of my way to stop here any time I get a hankering for some cookie action and have never been disappointed.
