Along awaited and overdue! I cannot express how pleased I am this Phoenix staple has now joined the Scottsdale scene! A great venue for meeting old and new friends alike over some delicious nibbles and great wine! This location offers something over the others, much more draft beer! With 10 choices on draft, there's something to please everyone! And for those who don't know, Monday and Tuesday is the BEST deal in town! Team service assures the guests feel welcomed and their experience is special! Can't wait to be back.
