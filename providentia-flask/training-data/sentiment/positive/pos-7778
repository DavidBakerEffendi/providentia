Okay I was craving a steak and looked up on yelp for reviews on steakhouse that weren't to pricey. I found Loagans Roadhouse and read through all the reviews it was either 5 stars or 1 stars.  Most of the one stars were about service not the food so I decided to give it a shot. I was by myself so I figured that service wouldn't be a issue. I ordered the 20oz bone in ribeye and I have to say it's was one of the most tender flavorful ribeye I've ever had for a whopping $25 buck a steel of a deal. I sat at the bar and was greeted with a smile from a charming witty young lady named Mac (like the truck) lol great service great and chatting with her.
