After delaying for over a year to give this place a shot, my wife and I finally pulled the trigger. Part of the delay in trying this CLT hotspot was because of the ever-present consistently long line, and the other part was because I had the mentality of "I don't want to pay $12-$14 for a bowl of soup". 

On Friday, it was chilly in the Queen City (a blamy 65 degrees, brr) so I decided soup sounded nice, so I walked on over to the Futo. It was as if the stars aligned for us, and there was NO WAIT... on a Friday ... at 8pm. I knew right then that this was a marvelous occasion. 

In honor of the stars aligning, we opted for an appetizer to kick off our meal. We saw a lot of people ordering the Rice Crispy Squares (many people said they're amazing, so we're definitely trying them next go-round), but ended up with the steam buns. BONUS: they let you mix & match (2 for $10), so we got 1 duck confit & 1 smoked pork belly. Both delicious but, flavor wise, the pork belly was a clear winner with an awesome kick to it. 

After perusing our handy Yelp app, it seemed like the overwhelming consensus was favored towards the 'Fire & Ice' bowl. Because we always 'split' meals in order to maximize our tasting abilities, I decided my next best option would be the Miso (Hungry) bowl. And because, meat ... I had to go with the recommendation of adding the spicy ground pork. 

Both bowls came out to my surprise, my wife & I both said the Miso bowl was hands down the better bowl. So, much, flavor. Seriously, it was insane. I like it spicy, but not like "ughhh" spicy, and this was perfect. The waitress told me the spice all comes from that added pork, so do yourself a favor and make this your go-to bowl. 

Long story long --- this place is a must try.
