I don't care what anyone else says this place is Top 3 bars I have ever been to.  So much to do its ridiculous!  I have never had the food just the spirits and the games but my experience here has been nothing but awesome!  Over sized Beer pong, Giant Connect four, corn hole big and small, ping pong, four square like in middle school plus the drinks makes for a great time.  I have been coming here since 2013.  There is only a few set backs; Parking is a b****, The games get crowded at night. Besides that I think this place is Awesome!

PS.... LOTS OF HIPSTERS
