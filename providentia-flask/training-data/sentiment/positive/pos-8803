Dear Egg Rolls, how I do love you here at Saigon Kitchen. You are delicate, flavorful, and SUPER HOT. It's hard for me to wait when you come out of the kitchen but I MUST because you burn the crap out of my mouth otherwise. :) Love wrapping you up in a leaf of lettuce and mint leaves. Love dipping you in the wonderful sauce. You complete me......

We also enjoyed the vegetarian pho today and my son had the filet mignon beef stew. The meat in the stew was so tender it just fell apart. It was perfectly delish. The pho is what you make it to be! Add the fixings and make it what you want it to be and stop complaining about it being bland. It's SUPPOSED TO BE!
