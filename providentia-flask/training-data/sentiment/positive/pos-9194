I have only ever ordered from UberEats but I feel like this restaurant deserves praise for the food. I've tried the Jerk Chicken  on multiple occasions as well as the goat curry and am always impressed with the spice level and flavouring. The chicken is cooked very well and not dry, and the seasoning is excellent especially if you enjoy jerk. I recently had a chance to try the goat curry and was again very impressed by the quality of the meat and the delicious curry sauce which went very well with the rice and peas.
