You down sisig? Yeah, you know me!

The sisig [pork jowls, ears and liver] from Hey Joe! is as good as it gets.

They serve it on a hot sizzling plate and crack an egg over it.  It's served with a side of rice for $9.

The presentation itself was pretty awesome being that it came from a truck.

I'd highly recommend this truck if you're down with sisig!
