I wish this place were more popular!  Just got back from enjoying a late-ish bite here on a Saturday night, and it was deserted.  Too bad!  My posse and I appreciated the music - some pretty random Sirius station played at a dominating but not overly loud volume.  

I tried a new menu item, the chili, and was blown away.  Fantastic.  I couldn't decide if I liked the hearty chunks of steak, or the strips of turkey better.  The beans and veggies were good, and the overall flavor was not too spicy or over-the-top, which is how I like it.  A cup is a smoking deal at under three dollars.  

I tried the pepperoni, and as boring as it sounds, I think I have a new fave here.  The flavors balance perfectly - tomato sauce, mozzarella, and the sausage itself, plus the amazing burnt crust.  I noticed today for the first time that the crust includes a sourdough flavor - subtle, but it's there.  Mmmmhmm.  

We finished the night out with a pizza cookie.  Solid, but I won't remember it later as particularly stand-out.  I look forward to the revised dessert menu coming hopefully soon to see what varieties of pizza cookie they offer and what else they're going to add back.  

Allow me to note (again) their terrific Happy Hour: 3 to 6, every day!  If anyone is ever in the area and looking to hit it up for HH, shoot me a text!
