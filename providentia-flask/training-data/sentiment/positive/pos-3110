Okay.. So It's Roberto's a.k.a. Regreto's.... You know you're whasted af.. stumbling into Roberto's because its the carpe diem of Mexican food after drinking, and definitely NOT Taco Bell. I give them 5 stars regardless if they got my order wrong, they did slightly over charge me for a bogus rolled taco deal, almost skimped me of my LARGE side of crema (sour cream) I ordered.. and had to ask them for  little sandwich bags so I can munch on jalapenos, and carrots while I waited for my order. WHO GIVES A F $%&!?. Your here because your drunk, its a weekend.. you're not working out tomorrow.. the hottie you were working all night at the club,  left with some other person that probably wasn't even close to being as hot as you... and all you can think about is wrapping your alcohol absorbed lips around some legit, lard made tortillas, some carne asada pappas, and an extra order of anything on the menu to bring home to gorge on in the afternoon while suffering from your hangover. I mean!?... come on! You're most likely to wake up a couple hours after your binge, and puking your 15 bucks of great Mexican fast food ANYWAY. This place not only deserves 5 stars, but 5 GOLD stars for sobering my a$$ up enough to get me home.
