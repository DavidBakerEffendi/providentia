...Once you've had a taste of it you'll never be the same;
Yeah, it'll make you go insane.

Upside, inside out I'm luvin los Chino Locos!

OMFG.

A burrito stuffed full of delicious toppings and chow mein?! 
Now's that what I call creative asian fusion cuisine!

I had "Da Finest "($6.99 +taxes).  Sauteed basa fish, guacamole, beans, and noodles with fun burrito fixins in a whole wheat wrap.

With weekly specials posted on their website, you can try something exciting and different each week!

I'm hooked. I want a Chinese burrito every week.
In fact, I want one right now!!!

And you know what else is awesome??? The Mexican wrestler masks they have around the restaurant.  You can't help but think of Nacho Libre.  I wonder if they hold fights when the restaurant closes.  It's a small venue, with limited seating but they do have  a parking lot out back.

If they were giving out free burritos to wrestlers, I'd be there.  Hands off my Chinos Locos burrito!
