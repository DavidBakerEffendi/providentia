There is always a huge line there, could be more than an hour wait on Weekends, I can't stand the girl at the front desk but the food... The food is delicious !
Do try their Oreo waffle it's seriously divine, the little potatoes/home fries are amazing, generous portion, big plate, everything is just so good! Try it!
