Went to the Cork and Cleaver last night with my wife.  I had been reading about it and anticipating it for a while now but couldn't quite bring myself to go to a pricier restaurant when I'm usually perfectly happy with hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants.  It was my birthday so we decided to splurge a little.  

The reviews on this place have been helpful in anticipating what to expect from this restaurant and do a better job explaining about things than I will do.  Some other observations:

- I am amazed that a restaurant of this caliber is in the Broadview Heights, as opposed to Tremont.  The indoor setting really gives off the hip urban vibe that Broadview Heights completely lacks.  Outside, you totally would miss it amidst an old fashioned strip mall.  This place deserves its own building and a higher trafficked location, but I'm grateful for the close proximity and ease of parking compared to places in Tremont.

- lights are a little dim for my tastes.  It was hard to shoot pictures of the beautiful plating there and the pictures below make it seem brightly lit.  It isn't.  Nice to have candles on the table though.

- Wait staff was polite, but I would have expected them to ham it up a little bit more, seeing as the restaurant is a new place.  The owner did not stop by, which I was pretty disappointed by, but I guess one of them was in the kitchen preparing food.  Reading the other reviews, it seems like this was a common experience.  There was one fellow who stopped by to ask how our food was but our mouths were full and we were only able to nod "yes" it was good.  

- fantastic music selection.  This is unusual for me, because I like a certain segment of popular songs.  I was really surprised by this because I usually don't pay attention to this in restaurants.

- loved loved loved the chicken wings.  These were prepared in a completely unique way and I loved them.  I was a little bit less enthused when we realized that the fried chicken we ordered was prepared the same way as the wings.  It was still good, but I probably would have ordered something else was different if I knew it was going to be the same style.

- The server thought I said "Caesar salad" and brought it to me instead of the "C&C salad" that I ordered.  He corrected it after we brought it to his attention but there were some awkward moments when we told him.  It seemed that he relaxed more as the meal went on.  I personally think it'd be wise for them to change the name of the C&C salad to something more distinctive from Caesar so these mix ups don't happen as often.

- Loved the spaetzal in the Paprikash- wished there was more of it.  The Mac and Cheese was ok, but Lolitas was significantly better.  The cheese was slightly grainy and I was expecting it to be in a casserole format.  Enjoyed the playful "brick" of braised pork shoulder.

- I had a gin citrus type drink w/ some egg white in it.  It was pretty good.  They didn't cheap out on the gin.  Wasn't sure if the egg white was necessary.  For $8 it was ok- I might be fine w/ water in the future.

- my favorite part of the evening was the incredible pear pot pie.  Wow.  What a way to end the dinner.  Delicious flaky crust w/ a well seasoned pear/raisin filling and a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream.  Tasted fantastic w/ some caramel popcorn on the side.  I'd order this again definitely.

So, overall, I would say this was a 4.5 star visit.  Some issues that came up but there's a .5 star bonus because this amazing restaurant is in my own city.  I hope it thrives.  I plan to be back and make my way through the menu.  We are considering just ordering appetizers and desserts next time.
