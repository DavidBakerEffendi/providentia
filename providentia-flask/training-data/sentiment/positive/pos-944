I live in S. Scottsdale and was going to go to Matt's in Phoenix but, checked Yelp to see if I could find a good breakfast place closer. 

To my surprise, I found great reviews about Pesto Cafe and it is just a few hundreds yards from my house.  The shop is in a center that I have driven by hundreds of times and never been in.  

When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised.  The cafe is extremely clean and the staff, and customers, were very friendly. I ordered Croissant Breakfast sandwich and homemade iced Chai and both were awesome!

They make a lot of their items from scratch and are willing to customize healthy options.  They also have free WiFi and a few tables and chairs outside.   I am writing this review as I sit in the cafe and enjoying my breakfast.   

I met the owner, Nathan, and told him I would be sure to recommend the cafe to others.
