Lang Van doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's certainly not in the best location.  However, we had heard and read such good things about it that we had to give it a try.  We went there on a weeknight and it was crowded, so I can only imagine the waits on the weekends.  Fortunately, the restaurant has overflow parking in the back, since the front fills up pretty quickly.  

The entry way and dining room is nicely laid out, considering the space it's in.  You walk down a walled hallway and there are dining rooms on either side.  I think they did a great job with the space to give it some atmosphere.  The big storefront windows allow in a lot of natural light, too.

I started with my Vietnamese favorite appetizer: summer rolls.  They're always so light-tasting, healthy, and delicious, and they come with a deliciously sweet peanut sauce.  (And they're usually very cheap!)  I always describe them as an unfried spring roll and, to me, a much better option.  I'll take them over a spring roll or egg roll any day.

The menu is HUGE.  And there are no pictures.  Unless you're VERY familiar with Vietnamese dishes, it's tough to know what to order.  We sat there for awhile, trying to decide what might be good.  I can't recall the name of it, but I ended up ordering a rice noodle dish that was full of meats, seafood, and veggies, mixed with some kind of white sauce.  It was very flavorful and fresh, and although I'd order it again, I'd love to try a variety of other Vietnamese options that I've never tried before.  Next time, though, we'll study up on the menu before we go. :)  

Lastly, I must point out that the service was fast and friendly.  We'll be back!
