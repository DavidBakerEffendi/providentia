Came here after a morning hike with my girlfriends. This Bowlology is located in a very large plaza and the interior gives off a very beachy vibe. I got the Hula Pitaya Bowl which costed me around ~$9. The regular size is fairly large and was more than enough for me to eat. My bowl was topped with fresh fruits and crunchy granola! It was a perfect sweet treat to cool off from the hot weather!
