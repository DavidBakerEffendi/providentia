Can't say much more than what everyone else has already said - as far as old school Vegas Italian food places go, this is my favorite spot in town.  How can you go wrong with good, solid food and a Liberace designed interior? 

Calories be damned this time I went for the Shrimp Alfredo - which was absolutely stellar.  Wide ribbon noodles in a decadent, thick alfredo sauce that was seriously one of the best I've ever had.  The portions are HUGE - so I have left-overs for lunch today!  My husband had the Shrimp Oreganado which looked fabulous with a side of spaghetti - he liked it so much he polished it off.  He may as well have licked the plate. 

If you go - don't forget to take a peek in the piano lounge (supposedly the most haunted room in Vegas according to the magician performing there).   A charming room with twinkle lights in the ceiling, a piano-shaped bar, classic white Eero Saarinen Tulip chairs, and a fabulous mirrored piano a la Liberace!  Thursday happy hour has live music too!  Prices are reasonable - our party of four got out for half of what we paid a month ago at Casa Di Amore down the street.

Can't wait to go back - as Liberace's theme song would say...."I'll Be Seeing You"...definitely.
