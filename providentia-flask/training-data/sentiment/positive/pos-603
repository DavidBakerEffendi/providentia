Almost missed this place as it's  tucked behind the Ben & Jerry's. I was at the Davidson Farmers Market today and was looking for a place for lunch. My friend suggested this place and I'm glad she did. Friendly service, smiling faces and the food - my goodness! It was fresh and delicious. I had a salad with sweet potato and bacon - don't remember the name. I can't wait to return to this place!
