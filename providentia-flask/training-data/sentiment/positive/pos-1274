LOVED IT!!!!
LOVED IT and can't wait to go back...
For all that say its such a tiny little place. We were very apprehensive because one of us is in a HUGE Wheelchair. We were pleasantly surprised how comfortable we were especially since there was already someone else in another group in a huge wheelchair as well. Every table was occupied. But the wait was not too long at all. 
We were a party of 5 and a table was efficiently cleaned for us. 
We started with freshly squeezed OJ that was served in beautiful glasses and an order of pastries that were divine. Our coffee was wonderful as well. You could tell that they were freshly ground beans. Our breakfast/brunch was amazing. Eggs Benedict were truly the best ever. We liked them better than even the Eggs Benedict at St.Francis on Camelback. The Crab Quiche was divine. The Spanish Skillet was oh my... WOW... The potato pancake dish was amazing as well. The Croque Madame was perfect. Our entire group are going back for lunch this week. Then brunch again on Sunday. Then Dinner the week after. We can because the prices are so reasonable.
We loved the chef/owner Eric who had every right to be pompous because of the Fabulous food that comes out of his kitchen. But he is a humble normal unpretentious guy that makes you feel so comfortable and is so attentive to detail. The only thing I would change is, Eric get rid of the plastic flowers on the tables. Even if you have fresh leaves in it...Also please get rid of that plastic/silk plant on the ledge above the wonderfully fragrant Basil you have growing. The only reason I bring that up is because every thing about your cooking denotes FRESH... Alive.... Scrumptious. The beautiful woman that was serving us was hospitable and sweet. Great Prices. Great Location. Great Ambiance. One of the best food in the valley. Chef Eric is soooo creative in such an effortless way. Lets support this GEM and make sure it stays open forever.
