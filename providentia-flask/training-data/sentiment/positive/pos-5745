A fabulous restaurant experience to finish up our trip to Toronto!

Upon seeing reviews on Yelp, we headed to Fiermosca on our BixiBikes only expecting to have a tasty dinner.  It never occurred to us we would need reservations!!  However, our waiter was happy to seat us with the understanding we were limited to one hour as the place was definitely getting busy.  We were seated right next to the fire and our waiter was genuinely wonderful!

We ordered the Arugula fig appetizer special, Lamb chop entree, and Linguini di mama Netta.  Our waiter brought bruschetta to us after ordering and shortly after they brought bread, too.  Plenty of food, no doubt!  We also enjoyed a glass of Chianti.  While it was very tasty with the bread and salad, once our entrees arrived the flavors changed and we didn't like it as much, BUT maybe we should have finished it sooner ;)

The Linguini di Mama Netta was good--I liked the lightness of the sauce and the combination of mushrooms, shrimp, and other veggies.  I could have done without the chicken--it lowers the appreciation of the dish (in my opinion, that is).  The lambchops were UH-MAZING.  So tasty and made both of us very pleased we made the trip to Yorkville.  The place was full and we had reached our hour...we closed our bill and I asked our waiter for suggestions of dessert/coffee spots.  He laughed and instructed us to make our way to the bar.

I'm not sharing all of our details because our experience was very special---and one that I'm not sure happens to every guest, BUT Fiermosca was the best choice we made on our Toronto trip.  We enjoyed a few laughs with the owner and his staff, enjoyed his "I threw the leftovers together" dessert, as well as the Tiramisu (YUM!).

Yelpers, it's a no-brainer.  I don't give a 5 too easy--check it out.  BUT make a reservation ;)
