Just came back from breakfast here and it was delish. We had the breakfast wrap (soo good), egg/sausage sandwich and the turkey jalape√±o egg sandwich. Everything was fresh, the coffee was great, and the service was friendly. The casual dining area is cute, clean and comfortable. There's construction across from them right now, so I wouldn't sit outside until they're done because it's quite loud.
