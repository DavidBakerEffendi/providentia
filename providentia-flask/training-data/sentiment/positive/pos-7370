I've been to several Chuy's and particularly to the one in Charlotte. I have never heard the management team mistreat any of the employees or heard load, unprofessional comments towards anyone . On the contrary I've heard the management team joking around and laughing with there employees. Seems to me that there are a couple of sour apples (former employees) out to make this establishment look bad. Never the less, give it a try you may or may not like it.
