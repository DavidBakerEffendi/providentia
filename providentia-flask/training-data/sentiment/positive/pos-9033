I'll be honest! We saw this place on food network, and like the lemmings we are, we made it a goal to come here. I arranged a table for 6 for my husband's birthday on April 13 to come here at around 6:30 pm. This restaurant is typically a first come, first serve place. They do "call aheads" though when your party is a group of 6 or more which gives you priority seating. (Hint: Gratuity will be automatically included in the bill with parties of 6 or more and they explain that to you on the phone).They were really nice on the phone when I called, and just as nice when we arrived at this restaurant. That alone wins big points for me! (I can't stand when a restaurant gets a special reputation from being on tv, and then they turn snooty). Here, the staff gave us such great service!
Pizzas:
The Italian Stallion - amazing if you love meat!
Pizza Bianca - very good!
Mediterranean - also very good!
Um, I'm very convinced that any pizza you try here is really tasty and good! I suggest that each person orders a pizza for him/herself, because then you get to try a variety of pizzas and you might not have any left over because it's that good. Pizza sizes are bigger than the pizzas from Babbos Pizzeria but slightly smaller than/close to CPK pizzas (I guess b/c the heart of the pizza is on the thinner size, but the crust is still thicker but somewhat a bit flaky

I ordered the chicken marsala which I really enjoyed and because I shared pizza with everyone, I still had some left to take home. 
Hmmm - I'm getting hungry talking about this place. Maybe we will go there tonight... or at least very soon...
