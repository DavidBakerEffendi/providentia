I probably came here on the first few days of opening (forgot to review), and my first impressions of this Pho restaurant were great! It is newly opened so as you would expect, it's nicely renovated and cleanly kept.  The quality of food is top-notch, and since this is a family-run restaurant, the food has a homemade feel to it, which I see as a good thing.  The owners and staff are also extremely friendly! I ordered a Bun Bo Hue and I felt as if it had the perfect amount of spice, and all ingredients are fresh to the taste.
