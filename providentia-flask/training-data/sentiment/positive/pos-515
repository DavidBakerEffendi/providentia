HECK YEAH!! Always one of the best parts of VEGAS!

Make the water dance and do cool stuff to music! What else could you ask for seriously!!! This always a must for me. 

Got to see the show on Monday and it was HOT but once the show got started I cooled down real quick!! Of course there was a HUGE line of folks just waiting for the show to start. I wished that people who line up for the show would make room for others though! For some reason this is always a DIFFICULT concept for people visiting VEGAS. MAKE ROOM PLEASE BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO ENJOY THE SHOW, THANKS A BUNCH!!! 

The etiquette for viewing should be instinctive but we can only hope for that. Luckily for me I was able to find a good spot close to the railing which was helpful in taking pictures. The only issue I had during the show was being asked to move my head so that other people could take pictures, OK, and SELFIES!!! TAKE YO SELFIE business and shove it!!! SERIOUSLY!!! 

I get you want to take pictures but DON'T block the walkway and MAKE ROOM! 

Aside from this madness the show was SPECTACULAR!!! Kudos to the Bellagio for making this happen regularly and not restricting the show to hotel occupants or seasonal! Big ups to all who work at the BELLAGIO!
