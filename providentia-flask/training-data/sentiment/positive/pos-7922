A brilliant concept! Fresh tasty food and drinks (and a yummy looking pastry bar) all while you get the best car wash of your cars life! The wait for the car wash was well worth it and I happily passed the time while having a delicious lunch (crap cakes on mixed greens) and browsing the stores cute little market section. I just moved to the neighborhood and this will be my regular spot!
