Though I normally reserve 5 stars for places that make me want to write truly emotional, passionate reviews, and Taneko doesn't really do that yet... 5 is the only fair score it deserves. 

It's just got all the fundamentals, from A to Z. Friendly staff that's very obviously busting their butts to please. Lots of cash generously infused into the decor and environment. A great outdoor seating area. Cheerful bartenders. Good sushi, great beers, interesting appetizer selections (including the justifiably famous Hot Rocks.. yumm). The choices are a tad pricey, but you get what you pay for in quality and, of course, you have to expect to pay that northish Scottsdale premium that comes with the location. 

Only a few minutes from my office, I have no idea why I'm not dragging my loser friends (some of whom are now reading my Yelp reviews, damn them) here for happy hours more often. The scene is a bit older than what I know the management would prefer. In a recent Arizona Republic article they say they want to attract a younger crowd. I don't see that happening, due to the location. Which I guess I don't care about, since I'm not exactly a spring chicken myself. Life's rough being a 30something.
