I checked Cien Agaves out with a coworker last night and we LOVED IT. First things first: everything tastes very fresh. The salsas and chips were great, and we tried the cucumber margarita, prickly pear margarita, and the habanero marg, and they were all good, made with the veg/fruit/pepper FRESH.

We just had nachos but they were plentiful and mighty tasty. Big fat slices of jalapenos on top and visually appealing. 

The ambience isn't uniform in places (mixing early 90's modern furniture with homestyle Mexican decor and art), but it's just subtle enough to not be incredibly annoying. The male staff were very cool and relaxed, but the females were a little bit "in the way"... eavesdropping, it seems. We were one of 2 couples in the bar, though...

Regardless, this place deserves 5 stars. It's a very delicious, very easy Mexican choice in downtown Scottsdale.
