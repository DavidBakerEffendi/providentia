Excellent service, colorful interior, also looks like it'd be pleasant to sit outside by the pool if weather is nice. You get there by walking down this great hall that feels like an Alice in Wonderland set. I got the Croissant French Toast, drizzled with coconut yellow yogurt and topped with berries, which was delicious. The coffee beverages come with a brown sugar rock candy stick to twirl around in your coffee, if you want a little sweetener.
