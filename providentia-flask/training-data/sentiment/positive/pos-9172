You can't get any further from the Las Vegas Strip than Bob Taylor's Ranch House -- both literally and figuratively.

Bob Taylor's is about as far northwest as you can go and still be inside civilization in Nevada.  The dirt parking lot proves it.

You walk into a classy, yet Western themed restaurant that captures the feel of Old Vegas and the rugged West.  As you're led to your table, you walk past an indoor grill area where the meals are prepared.

Dinner, which for me, was the baby back ribs was exceedingly tasty -- and surprisingly affordable.  The prices run well below the celebrity locales along the Strip -- and every meal includes garlic cheese toast, soup or salad, and a side.   The ribs were incredible -- as was everything else on our table.  Our server was friendly and efficient.

In short, it's well worth the drive both for the food and the savings.
