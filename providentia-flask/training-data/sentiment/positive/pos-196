Bradley Ogden is a fantastic restaurant.  It boosts that is has the best burger in Las Vegas, and I would have to agree with that.  The prices  are decent for the type of place it is.  The menu is simple, and the food is great.  Worth trying if you're looking for a place to grab dinner in Caesars Palace.
