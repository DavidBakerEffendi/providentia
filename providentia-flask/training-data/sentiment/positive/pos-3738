My daughters and I came in her on a whim when we were on a quick break from their theater rehearsals, only 30 minutes. (We had planned to go to Culver's but it was packed) So needless to see we were in a bit of a rush to get a bite to eat. Right when we walked in the young gentleman greeted us and let us know it would be just a few minutes while they cleaned a table for us. I had told my girls to take a look at the menu so we could order as soon as we sat down, he quickly offered us more menus so we wouldn't have to share one. I thanked him and explained our situation. When he sat us he asked me if we were ready to order and I said yes, he made sure to go get the server for us so we could order right away. Which I greatly appreciated him doing without even being asked. 
The server came immediately and was very polite and attentive. When I realized we definitely weren't going to have time to eat there, I asked him if we could get it to go. He said, "Of course, no problem at all!" He brought us cups and straws for our drinks & had our food packed and ready to go within minutes, with silverware and everything we needed to eat it on the go. 
I greatly appreciated them taking the initiative to truly take care of us and ensuring all of our needs were not only met but exceeded. 
Thank you both for being so great. :) 
Definitely recommend this quaint little place! The staff alone is worth the visit and it definitely doesn't hurt the food was amazing!
