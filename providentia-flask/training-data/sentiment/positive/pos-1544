If I HAD to pick something to complain about when it comes to Oregano's it would be the amount of time I have to wait.... "I'm HUNGRY! I want to eat!" However, if I were asked to complain about something else...I couldn't think of anything (and we all know I complain a lot).

Anyway, every single time I go to Oregano's I am satisfied. The pizzas are great, the pastas are great (the zany ziti specifically), the salads are great...everything is great. 

Let's get to the real point here: The pizookie is the most amazing thing on the face of this planet. It get's it's own paragraph just so I can rant about it. I love the pizookie so much that I will force my stomach to make room so I can put that deliciousness in my belly. I would probably eat 10 if I were given the opportunity.

The service is always friendly and most of the time pretty funny too. The atmosphere is wonderful and it is a great place to go out with friends or family. 

Eat at Oregano's because you will most certainly enjoy it.
