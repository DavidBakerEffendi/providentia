Come here for ambiance: crazy beautiful golf course views, outdoor corn hole, big screen TVs for sports lovers, good live music & wrap-around bar. Great place to bring the kids & let them run around outside while parents chat. I feel happy every time I come here. Food is consistently good but nothing gourmet. I LOVE the Cobb salad.
