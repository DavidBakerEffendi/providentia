Nothing really drives home that modern Vegas feeling like these fountains. It's not just Vegas, but worldwide you simply won't find many fountains like these. And there's really no point in reviewing them because it's not like you can go anywhere on the Strip and not see or hear them. It's a free, 5-star show and if you rated it anything below 5 stars you are a sad sack and that is final.

It's gotten to the point now where we stop here to see the fountain, but more so to enjoy watching people take awful, crappy photos. It is astonishing how many people will not take the time to properly set a camera to where you don't have the flash come on and ruin everything in the shot. People, you're in Vegas. Take the TIME. No one is kicking you out of your precious spot at the railing. Set up, tweak your settings, and get that photo done right. And take the time to actually enjoy a show after you post it to your FB or Twitter or whatever so all your friends can look at it and go, "Yeah, been there, done that."

Remember, you're in Vegas. You aren't planting a flag. You aren't blazing a trail. No one cares. Get off your social accounts and LIVE.
