I am so glad this place is in Pittsburgh! If you work downtown, you know that there aren't many lunch options. Sure, you can walk to Market Square and sit down somewhere, but if you're short on time, your options are pretty limited to run-of-the-mill chain-type places. Bluebird is such a breath of fresh air!

From the signage to the decor, it is warm and inviting. And though the interior is on the small side, there's plenty of room to wait inside for when the weather is bad. They change the menu often depending on what is in season, especially the desserts.

I had been meaning to try this place for a long time now because my work friends rave about it, but because I often bring my lunch, I didn't get a chance to go until last week. Because we were having a pizza party at work, I decided to get a few sides and a dessert to the go with the pizza. It was a Friday after all, so I had to go all out. I had the housemade chips and a side of brussels sprouts with pecans and bacon jam. The bacon jam (which is so overdone at times) was really the perfect complement to the brussels sprouts and I had no trouble eating the entire thing.

For dessert, I tried the panna cotta on recommendation from the work friend. It was an earl gray panna cotta on top of a small piece of poppyseed cake. It was absolutely delicious. The textures of the panna cotta and cake blended together perfectly. There were so many sides and bakery items I wanted to try, and of course I need to come back for a real lunch sometime, not just sides and desserts. Everything looked and smelled incredibly fresh, and there are so many healthy choices as well. This is truly food you can feel good about.
