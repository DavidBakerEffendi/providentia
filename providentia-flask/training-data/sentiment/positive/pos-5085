Lenero Mexican Grill is one of my favorite restaurants. The Palo de Lena Al Fuego is an amazing grilled steak with a combo of grilled veggies and roasted red potatoes, always seasoned and smoked to perfection.  The Barbacao is another dish I always go for as the lamb, smokey charro beans, and tortillas are a great trio.  Add their warm salsa and its a solid taco.  The chips yes are not that great but really when was the last time you said, "you know who's chips I'm really in the mood for...let's go to ____."  Give me a break; I swear some yelpers look for anything to complain about.  Most authentic Mexican in the area hands down.
