Honestly this place took me by surprise. First bite and it brought me back to old fashioned Punjabi Dhaba (roadside restaurant)food. An that is a very good thing. The bbq Salmon is delicious. Served with some spicy green chutney as it should be. The Keema (mince meat) naan was by far one of the best I've had anywhere around here. Warm perfectly cooked naan. Delicious dal (lentils), paneer (cottage cheese) dishes. Biryani was fantastic. Albiet the goat curry was a little over done but manageable. 

Like mentioned previously, ambiance is the least of their concerns. Minimalist-1. Student friendly atmosphere and cheap.  Food may take time to come through. Worth the wait. Open till 2 am! Late night grub! Hole in the wall worth visiting again
