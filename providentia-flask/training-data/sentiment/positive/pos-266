I don't touch Mc dee's, Burger King, Jack in the Box, or any of those fast food burger joints anymore but I will never EVER quit In n Out!  Ever since I was little I used to go to the Sahara location with my sisters.  Not only are their burgers made to order but their patties "are free of additives, fillers and preservatives of any kind."
They also have a secret menu where I'm pretty sure many know about animal style fries and burgers already.  If you're really hungry, you can order a 5x5...or even go larger than that.
