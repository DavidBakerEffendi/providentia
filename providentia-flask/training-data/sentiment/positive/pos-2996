If I had money, Neiman Marcus would be my dream store.

But I don't, so I can only walk through it and wish I could purchase all of the fantastic items I see.

They only carry the best of the best.  The finest names in hand bags, clothing, shoes and home decor.  Here is where you'll find the latest in Prada, Gucci, Burberry, etc...and where you'll see the rich of the rich shopping with their tiny dogs peeking out of designer bags. 

If nothing else, Neiman's is a great place to people watch!
