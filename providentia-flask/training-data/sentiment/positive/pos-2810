We visited Rick Moonen's RM Seafood this past Monday.  We were very impressed with everything we had.  We had drinks & the oyster sampler at the bar while we waiting for friends to arrive.  3 atlantic & 3 pacific oysters all very fresh.  When our friends arrived we were seated downstairs in the more informal dining area.  

It's a huge place, with the bar & separate dining area downstairs and a lounge & more formal dining upstairs.  We have heard good things about the fine dining upstairs & will try it soon.  

We all had the special restaurant week three course menu with an extra appetizer.  We started with the ahi tuna duo - tuna tartare & lightly seared tuna.  The tuna was very fresh and delicious.  Our friends enjoyed the jumbo lump crab cake - looked like all crab & no filler.  Next up was a shrimp salad or clam chowder, both were very good.  Main course was choice of salmon or scallops.  My wife & I had the salmon - slow cooked with a nice lime butter sauce.  Our friends had the scallops, which I got to try.  Scallops were properly cooked with a nice sear.  Desserts were strawberry cream puffs or chocolate carmel mousse.  I didn't try the cream puffs but the chocolate mousse was fantastic.  Always enjoy a little maldon sea salt on top of my chocolate...really sets it off.  I highly recommend RM Seafood.
