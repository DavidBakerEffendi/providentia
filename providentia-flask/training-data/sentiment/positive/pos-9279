We stayed at the Venetian for 3 nights when we visited Las Vegas. Absolutely amazing experience, from spaciousness of the room to the cleanliness, to the decor and the service.

Our room overlooked the swimming pool and it was really nice to pull one of the chairs by the window, watching people in the swimming pool and reading a book. The Venetian has so many great restaurants (Bouchon, Grand Lux Cafe, Trattoria Reggiano, Grimaldi's etc) and just strolling around was a lot of fun. So romantic and relaxing, actually!

We enjoyed our experience and would definitely stay at the Venetial again when we visit Vegas the next time!
