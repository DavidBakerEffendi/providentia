I'm trying not to hand out 5's too freely lately, but the excellent customer service really pushed it over the top.
My wife and I had less than a half hour to eat before catching a show, and we asked if it was possible. Our host showed us which items should come out quickly, and rather than making empty promises - our server and then the kitchen ensured we ordered and had our food in less than 15 minutes.
We were thinking appies anyway. The poppers were a unique take with a tempura batter, but it really worked. The cumin/curry dip may not have been my first choice however. The turkey wings with a mustard/maple sauce were delicious. In case it isn't obvious, turkey wings are massive as an FYI. The blue cheese dip they came with was INCREDIBLE. Genuine blue cheese base and the only mistake was not asking for more of it. We also had the frites which were pretty good and a massive portion.
A pretty limited taste of the menu so far, but as it stands: the food is somewhere between a 4-5 and our service was an easy 5. Will be back.
