Papa Chang's always has a place in my heart. It is always my number one! And I think it will be staying at that number one spot for even longer!

Whenever someone asks for a suggestion of where to eat, I would always say Papa Chang's. This is back when Papa Chang's only had one location, but I always told people ... It was worth it! What I liked about the original location is the consistency. I always, always say this in my reviews, but consistency is key. 

It doesn't matter when I go to Papa Chang's. Morning, lunch or even late night. The food will be cooked the same and in perfect seasoning at any time of the day. It never changes. And that's one thing I appreciate. 

And fortunately, this new Papa Chang's Express location has nailed it to a tee. I'll be honest, I kind of had my doubts. Because whenever a certain food place starts to branch out, it won't be same as the original. And there will always be heavy differences between the two. But the Express location just slammed that all down. It was honestly like I had gone to the original location. 

I'm just super happy and relieved that I won't be having to travel so up North now to get my Chang fix, since Pmall is soooo much closer to me!

If you haven't tried Papa Chang's, you gotta try it! Absoloutely top notch Taiwanese food that just can't be beat!
