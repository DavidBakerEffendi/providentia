I love this place.
Outside of having an adorable Southern Charm Atmosphere, it is my go to place to bring out of town guests. 
They have a cute Cupcake Bakery in the back which has some ok cupcakes. They can be a bit dry but probably better if you get one fresh. 
The Menu:
    It's diverse American. What I mean is that it's Salads, wraps, burgers and pasta dishes but with some extras you don't normally see on Concord menus ( I.e. Beets on your sandwhich) I've never had a bad meal here. 
Do try to make it for breakfast on Saturdays. Hefty portions of stick to your ribs Country fair.  
Only gripe is that they aren't open later.
