As the food truck market is booming in the west the midwest food truck industry is lackluster, however the few we do have are amazing, I'm happy to be lucky enough to have the Fired Up Taco truck in the city. Easy to find and catch via, there Instagram, twitter or webpage, fresh made tacos, that aren't simply being thrown together the crew is amazing. The food astonishing.
