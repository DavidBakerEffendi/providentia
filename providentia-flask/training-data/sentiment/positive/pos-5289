This little hidden place in a strip mall has Asian style breakfast which is quite reasonable. I'm sort of reminded more of the Hong Kong style food here. 
Dad had the original egg crepe roll combo. It is delicious but quite heavy on the oil. 
We both had the milk tea and it was nice and strong! 
We both want to come back here for the Malaysian curry and the roti canai. 
Service is excellent. The waiter came to the table right away and asked if it was our first time here and assisted with making a selection. Great service, good food and a clean restaurant.
