Went here to watch the NCAA tournament games tonight.  We ordered the buffalo chicken nachos and they didn't disappoint.  These were the BEST NACHOS IVE EVER HAD.  The chip to topping ratio was perfect. Duckworths is an upscale bar with plenty of beer selections.  There are tvs everywhere so you will not miss a game!  Definitely recommend.
