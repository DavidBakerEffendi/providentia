Every time I'm in Vegas or should I say everytime I am in Vegas  every 3-4 months, I ALWAYS stay here or the PALAZZO!!
Love this hotel, the location, the restaurants around , the bars, clubs.  Perfect hotel for bachelorette parties or girls getaway weekened.
This place never dissapoints me. Love hanging out at the pool all the time.
Venetian, you never seem to dissapoint me... See you in 3 months!!!
