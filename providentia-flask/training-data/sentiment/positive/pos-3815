Delicious, unique dishes that do not disappoint! I have been frequenting Frank & Fina's for about 2 years now, and I have to say that the vegetable taquitos never get old. =) While my guests are always equally impressed with the dishes they choose, from all over the menu, I am always afraid to stray from my favorite!

Vegans rejoice at the extensive offerings you have here along with the fact that all of the servers and chefs know what "no cheese" or "dairy free" means. (Come on, you know that you've been to similar eateries before where you say "no cheese on the burrito, please" (because the menu doesn't list cheese as a topping on the side of beans, as well) and then your beans come out smothered in cheese!

Thanks, Frank & Fina's for delicious food every time!
