I've loved Served for years and really need to come here more often. I'm happy that they're now open for dinner on certain days because the dinner menu is just as delicious as the menu they've had for years.

The space is tucked away and you wouldn't know it existed unless you were specifically looking for it. The dining area is small, but modern.

Everything I've ever had is delicious, creative, visually appealing, and cooked to perfection. The flavors are well developed. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Most of the time you'll even see owner/chef Matt Meyer come out to make sure your meal is going well, which demonstrates the level of care Served is trying to give its customers.
