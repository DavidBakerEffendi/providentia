I've come here twice more since my previous review, and both experiences have been fantastic. 

Each and every person who accommodated our table was exceptional, as they have been all of the times I've dined here. 
Our waiter, Bruno, was amazing. 

Things to eat here: creamed corn, scalloped potay-tays, lobster bisque, ribeye steak, and the lychee martini (their drinks are on point).
