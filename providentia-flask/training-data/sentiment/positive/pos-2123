We visited this restaurant to try out their brunch. Wow! A small neighborhood place that didn't disappoint. The food is amazing as was the staff and owner. A Brazilian Fusion menu is what awaits you and the flavors are terrific. We had Vodka Cured Salmon, Tacos De Moda and Botequito Sliders! Everything is made fresh in house. The Crème Fraîche, Pumpernickel Bread. The salmon is cured in house. They offer Prosecco Flights and great Bloody Marys as well. We can't wait to return and try their dinner service and occasional dinner pairings. They are only open in the evenings (except for Sunday Brunch) and closed Mondays.
