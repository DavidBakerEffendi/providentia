Very delicious! Generous portions and low priced. Great place for a casual lunch or for getting take out.

I always get the chicken kebab plate which comes with a choice of saffron barberry rice OR a dill lentil rice. I usually get the first but they will allow you to mix as well. It's absolutely delicious. The chicken is so fresh and tender, the most tender I've ever had. It's seasoned perfectly too. You also get a side salad and they will give you tabouli, pink pickled turnip, hummus and all the other delicious veggies if you ask for them. I've also had the falafel which is good. I would like to try the beef too. The hot sauce is homemade and so tasty! The service is very friendly and it seems that the owner is always there. The staff seems to be Persian and this place truly is authentic!
