So I went there last night & It was super good! The apps were amazing. I think we had some sampler. The calamari and the potstickers were great! I forgot what else I ate..too much food!
Anyways, so I ended up having the "Maui Wowie Salad" ( pretty funny name in my opinion! ) But it was really fresh and really tasty! I had the rib-eye for my main course. I'm not really a big steak fan, but this was amazing! And finally, the chocolate souffl√© was a great way to end the night! Cheers to the chef, Brandon Konishi!(:
