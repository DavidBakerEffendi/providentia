One of my all time favorite spots in Phoenix! The best things at The Arrogant Butcher are the Polish Fix and the pretzel rolls with fondue. 

My friends and I dream about the polish fix. Perfectly crushed ice, lemon juice, macerated raspberries, and vodka. Perfection! 

I'm a fan of the sweet potato tortelli. Last time I was there, I added scallops to the entree, which were great.
