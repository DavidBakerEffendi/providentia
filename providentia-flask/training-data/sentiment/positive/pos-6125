Incredible wings!! I love wings so much and I eat them a couple times a week. We decided to try this one out and was so glad! I love the Louisiana ones. I forget the actual name right now but they are freakin incredible. The fries are on point too. The garlic toast is just shut the front door good! Love this spot and is a new favorite in the rotation!
