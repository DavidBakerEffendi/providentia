First time here and I like it. Customer service was great. The menu selection is good. Happy hour choice look good. I'll try it next time.

I ordered chef Trilogy, picked the tilapia dish and it was perfectly seasoning. I enjoyed it. I actually surprise for negative reviews. Overall my experience was great this evening.
