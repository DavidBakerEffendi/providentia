Royal treatment -- French peasants unite! Closest restaurant to Balthazar's in New York you'll ever get. Have the mussels and any drink the maître de recommends -- this guy knows his food and drink. The patio is impressante! So is the steak and Pinot. Don't leave the premises without ordering the crime brûlée -- I repeat, the creme brûlée will change your life. Bonne chance mon ami!
