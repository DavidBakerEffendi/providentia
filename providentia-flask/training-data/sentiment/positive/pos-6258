Always get the white corn dip and the chipotle chicken and Thai chicken half and half pizza!! Really nice place to come on a date and for family if you want a former type pizza, the ambience is welcoming as well as the waiters. The seasonal sangrias are delicious and would recommend the peach orchard sangria! Enjoy!
