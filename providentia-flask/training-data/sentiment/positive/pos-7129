What a fun restaurant to hold your event.  We celebrated my mom's 80th B Day at the Peppermill.  The manager could not have been more helpful.  The Peppermill made menus for our event in my mother's favorite color. The package included the menus, balloons, table clothes and our own waiter. The food and service was awesome. i would  highly recommend the Peppermill for your event!
