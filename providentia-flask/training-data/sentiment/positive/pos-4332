Best "Fast" Burger in Las Vegas.  Secret menu's make people feel special and In-N-Out's is no different.  There is nothing more satisfying than ordering "Double Double Animal Style - Ketchup/Mustard" with a side of Animal Fries.  Now if only I can get out of my car after i wolfed all that down.....This place is a monthly staple on the Meal Rotation board at our house.  Can't wait until next month.
