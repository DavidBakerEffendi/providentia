Fusion = Mouth Confusion. 
This sums up my first Buldogi experience. Its a hot dog; no its Korean, its sweet potato cheese fires, no its kim chee.. There was a major mind/mouth fuck disconnection. Every bite confused me!!! 

I came here with a group of friends so I had the chance to sample a few of their concoctions. 

We had to try the angry fries!
I think that they were goof BUT there was just too much going on for me. I like all the components just not all together. I couldn't done without the cheese and egg but we wanted to try the beast in its original form. 

This is my thought for my next fries concoction:
Regular fries
Kim Chee
Angry Sauce
Spicy Pork

* Angry Dog 
Banh Mi Dog
Bulgogi Dog

Of the 3 the Angry Dog was my fave.
The Banh Mi slaw was AMAZING! Now if only they could "borrow" the idea from sausage food truck and pair it with a longanisa (sweet one) I would die and go to processed food heaven. 

A word to the wise that one of these bad boys will fill you up!!
