I have to give it to the Porch! My first experience was far from perfect, but they have really worked on their customer service. Kalie, behind the bar, is friendly and went above and beyond to please our small group!

The bar is comfortable and fun. There were groups doing beer bongs out of the cutest flamingo! With the open-air floor plan, the games outside and the beer bong flamingo, this place really does feel like a porch party.

The food was never the problem, but everything was delicious. The twice baked wings were even better the second time! I can't stop thinking about them and being paired with a beer suggested by Kalie - it was perfect!

I'm confident the Porch will be part of our neighborhood for years to come and I can't wait to be part of it's success!
