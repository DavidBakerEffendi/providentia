Went to Bon Chef Cafe today using a local radio show certificate.  Service was very pleasant and helpful.  Real customer service oriented.

The restaurant is clean, relaxed, and inviting.  But I needed to do a takeout to get back to work. I ordered chicken fried steak and a cannoli.  The meal was ready in about 7 minutes.

I couldn't wait to try the cannoli so I took a sample before I left the parking lot..WOW!!!  I had not found my favorite cannoli in Las Vegas until today...great filling, high quality chocolate chips, light/crunchy pastry wrap.  It was gone quick, but I savored each bite.

The chicken fried steak and was another WOW!!! It ties for the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Golden-brown coating with delicious flavor, tender meat with very little to no fat, and real sausage gravy just like it should be.  I'm not sure, but it may have been pan-fried which is the real way to make this meal.   As a bonus, it stayed hot all the way to work so the container was good quality too.  It came with light and fluffy scrambled eggs (REAL EGGS!!), perfectly cooked REAL POTATO hash browns, and a pineapple slice.  Unbelieveable food find.

This place is great!! I can't wait to take my wife back there to try the rest of their menu.
