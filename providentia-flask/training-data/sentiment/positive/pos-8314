One of the best pizzas you will ever try! Everytime i decide to brin gsomeone here that is visiting from out of town, i like to describe it as the Subway of pizzas. Meaning when you get there you choose whether you want their original crust or the thin crust, i would go with original crust because the thin crust is almost as thin as a tortilla. Then you can tell them if u want one of their specialty pizzas on the menu, or you can start with the base of a Margherita, which includes sauce, mozzarella, olive oil and basil, and then you can add any other toppings you want, and just like subway, they are laid out so you can see them. And it's a lot of topping choices. 

The best part of all, they serve beer! and gelato! But the pizza really is amazing, i would reccomend sharing one pizza between two. It hits the spot but doesn't leave u too full. But if you are a really hungry man, then maybe you should get your own.
