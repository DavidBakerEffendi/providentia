This place is a hidden gem. Tucked back in an awkward shopping center, I would have never expected this greatness. Il Bosco offers one of the three best pizzas I have ever tried. The atmosphere and ambience of the restaurant was great and I hope I am in the area again so I can get another taste of greatness.
