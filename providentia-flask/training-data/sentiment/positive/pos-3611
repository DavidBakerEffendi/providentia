We're new to town and looking for a place to eat with my 14-month old son and my in-laws. We needed fast, close to home, afforable, and good food that's not too fancy for my in-laws who like to keep things pretty basic. I chose Tom's Thumb Fresh Market after reading the rave reviews on Yelp and they delivered on all fronts.  When I told my husband we were going to eat at a BBQ restaurant in a car wash he thought I was nuts. Now he can't wait to go back. 

You'd never expect that kind of quality to come from a car wash restaurant, but the ambiance was casually nice, the service was great, and the food was excellent! I loved my pulled pork sandwich and the rest of the fam thoroughly enjoyed their dinner as well. We also shared the creme brule cheesecake and peach cobbler for dessert and loved it!

 Since it's so close to home, I can definitely see this place becoming a regular spot for us.
