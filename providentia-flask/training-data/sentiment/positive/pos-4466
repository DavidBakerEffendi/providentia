You know a Hawaiian place is authentic when their Spam Musubi has more flavor than just the salt from the spam.  What a great local and family business that takes pride in their Hawaiian roots.  The family lived in Honolulu and opened their store about 6 months ago.  Besides the location and limited hours open, this place has delicious Hawaiian food that truly reminds me of the islands.

Kalua pork is very tender and juicy.  The flavor is all there when you take your first bite, and it keeps coming when you chew and swallow it down!  The sides of potato salad, rice, and cole slaw are tasty compliments to your main entr√©e.  I know all you local Hawaiians or Asians are asking about the mac salad?  The owner told me they will soon be selling it.  There perspective was most people may not like the mac, so they went safe with the potato.  Although once the mac salad comes, be sure to get excited.

The price is right, the interior feels like the Islands, but the location and hours are rough.  They definitely are a lunch place, and only wish they were opened a little later.  However, what a great place to enjoy authentic Hawaiian food.  My only question is, when is the poke coming?

We will see you again, Da Valley!
