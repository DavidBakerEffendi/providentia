Love LOVE this juice bar! Gorgeous amazing ladies that work there always greet my kids and I with lots of sweet smiles. They've even given me generous smoothies so I have enough to share with my littles. The owner will make you an incredible ginger smoothie that will make that nasty winter cold go right away. I am a loyal fan. Worth the price and drive. Two thumbs way up!!
