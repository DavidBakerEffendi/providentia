Still love this buffet. Price is now 14.49 for an adult for lunch. The desserts are great, there is sushi, soup, salad and a wide variety of hot items. Just wish I had more time at lunch! Egg tarts are great and so are the rice glutinous fried balls - sweet, with a tiny smidge of red bean paste in the middle, so fresh, warm and delicious. Staff is friendly and the restaurant lets natural light in, lots of room and a good place for a conversation.
