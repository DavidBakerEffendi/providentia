Have been here twice and their back patio is gorgeous. I got a chicken wrap and the butternut squash soup and it was a high-five in my mouth. Delicious and fresh. It's never too back so it's great to meet up with friends. It's a bit out of the way from all the hustle and bustle, but it's also right next door to one of the best Thai places in the city (Khao San Road). Come here for a superb lunch!
