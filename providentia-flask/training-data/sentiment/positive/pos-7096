As a KFC goes, this one is about the best you could ask for. Clean, bright, modern. Staff appears well-trained and food (was here for lunch) was cooked well.

Plenty of seating, wi-fi, and a self-serve soft drink area. Bright clear menus. 

A huge improvement from the nearby KFC at Mt. pleasant which looks like it hasn't been upgraded since the 70s. One can only hope this is the model all KFC's will aspire to going forward.
