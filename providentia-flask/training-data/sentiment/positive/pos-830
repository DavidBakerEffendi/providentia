It's been a while since I've been wowed by a restaurant.  Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina just fixed that!

Tired of our usual spots for lunch, we ventured to try this place based on the ratings from trust yelp.  Situated where the old Buzz BBQ restaurant used to be, it is right off of Tee Pee and Tropicana Ave.

We arrived during lunch and there were a lot of people there.  We were greeted and seated almost immediately.  Hot Chips, hot bean dip and salsa was set down right when were were seated.

The lunch menu was short, but still offered a lot of choices.  I chose the Chicken Fajitas with Beans and Rice.  The other option was grilled vegetables.  My friends ordered chicken fajitas, Chili Colorado and Mulitas. 

The staff was completely on it when it came to drinks.  Or cups were never left dry.  Chips, bean dip and salsa was replenished at least THREE times at our table.  It was that good.

My fajitas was lit on fire in front of my table which let out a 4 to 5 foot FLAME that endured for at least 5 seconds.  The heat from it could be felt.  It was a great show to add to our orders.  My fajitas came with corn and flour tortillas that was equally warm and fresh as our fajitas.

Great place.  Great people.  Great time.  Great prices and value.  GREAT FOOD!  Great atmosphere - very cozy and would be perfect to take a date to.  There is even outdoor seating available.  TVs are hung from the ceiling with various programming on.  You can tell it's a great place when you don't even watch the TV.   I loved this place with my friends.  I can't wait to take my family here!
