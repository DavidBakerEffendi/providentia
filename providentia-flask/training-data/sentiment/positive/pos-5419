So good! Came here on a whim with my mom for a pre Mother's Day brunch and definitely was not disappointed. I had the Eggs Benny with pulled pork - amazing (the dressing on the salad was bomb). Mom had the Pancakes with Bacon - also amazing. Both dishes were good portions and tasted super fresh. We sat in a communal bench table area which wasn't bad since we aren't really picky with seating  (Suggestion: come a bit earlier than you normally would to get seating you want or expect to wait as the seating area is not huge & filled up quickly). A lady beside us had one of their lunch bowls and it looked so yummy. Definitely getting that next time I'm at Cafe Neon since I definitely will be back!
