We went to 4 Sisters for an impromptu date night. Needless to say from the 5 start rating, we were not disappointing. 

I'm a huge fan of tapas and small plates to share and Verona was in great need of a fantastic restaurant - so this place was basically what I have been waiting for my whole life.

We ordered the cheese and charcuterie board which while heavy on the olives, had a nice array of items. The steak skewers, which were AMAZING, the risotto, and adobo tacos. Plenty of food for the two of us!

If you are looking for a great meal on the far west side, don't hesitate to make Sisters your next dinner adventure!
