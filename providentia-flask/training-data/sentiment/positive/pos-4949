Excellent food and excellent service! I had an amazing experience here!!! Italian fine dining in an intimate and romantic setting. Highly recommended for love birds. The menu has been recently revamped and I had the pleasure of pretty much trying the entire new menu. It was like a banquet setup for Marie Antoinette. For me so this review is biased considering not everyone will have the same experience. Did I mention they found my one weakness: TRUFFLE. So of course I'm going to absolutely think it's great, I was spoiled out of my mind.

Generally speaking the notable items on my 20 course venture: 

PASTAS are the bomb here!!!
Carbonara with Australian Truffle 
Caviar fettuccine with Australian Truffle 

Grilled Bronzino (YUM) 

Caprese Salad - simplicity at its best! 

 Service is definitely 5 of 5
