We love Lou's! What a little hidden gem of a place...the food is great, like the comfort food you would eat at gramma's house. The decor-comfortable vintage homey feel! The owner is frequently there to make sure your lunch experience was the best, they really care about their customers! I only have one complaint- I wish Lou's was open longer  They close at 3 everyday so plan accordingly.
