My hubby and I have been on a diner kick lately! About one week ago we visited Monty's for dinner. When I lived on the east side I would go there often for lunch. It has been years since I had the chance to check out what was on the menu. I was not disappointed. I had the mac and cheese and it was wonderful. Fresh and full of comfort food goodness. The service was great and we will be back for sure!
