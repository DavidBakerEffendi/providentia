Man, oh "MANWICH" -  It's the pulled pork and brisket sandwich equivalent to growing a mean Duck Dynasty style beard, and tearing up Route 66 on a choppered Fat Boy hog. It's one 'bad' sandwich in the best kind of way.

When you're hungry and you need meat and lots of it - Holy Smoke BBQ is the perfect quick cafeteria style lunch stop.  They serve up all the southern BBQ smokehouse classics like pulled pork, brisket, cornbread and sweet tea. Check out the "Buck-a-Ribs" they can't be beat! 

The Staff are friendly and the vibe is fun, and by-no-means-fancy with vintage hubcaps on the walls, and classic country on the radio.

Good luck trying to sample every kind of BBQ sauce. You won't be able to get through them all, but it sure is fun to try!
