Living downtown I feel a bit sinful for going to a chain. So many awesome independent restaurants. However if you want a steak, I think the Keg is a great bet. 

This location is particularly fancy, newly built and powered with renewable energy! 

For appetizers I love the tuna tartare, bacon wrapped scallops, and the classic shrimp cocktail. Nice way to start your meal - watch out for the bread though it's deadly, try to save room for the main event! 

I always get the 8oz filet mignon with bernaise and either garlic mash or double stuffed potato. They always seem to get medium rare right and I appreciate that. The meat cuts like butter and a little richness from bernaise doesn't hurt.
