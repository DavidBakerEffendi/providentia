Everything we've ever tried here has been awesomely good.  The garlic knots are to die for - I would go here JUST for those sweet little things.  The calzones are giant, stuffed with yummy ingredients and are always cooked to perfection...probably the best calzones I've ever had.  The crust on the pizza is a good combo of crispy and soft in the middle - it's very good, classic pizza.  Oh, and the meatballs are SO GOOD!  I haven't tried the subs yet, but they're definitely next of my list.

They also get extra points for being willing to deliver anywhere in Vegas.

Mr. Biaggio is so sweet and always accommodating - I don't know why anyone would bother going to a chain or a casino for great pizza/Italian food.  Support the local small businesses!
