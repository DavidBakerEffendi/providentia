I really really likes this place !! We went there for the happy hour and I was shocked at how good the sushi was! I'm a super picky sushi eater and my friends made me step out of my Comfort zone and try this and I was impressed . I had a spicy tuna roll , salad , and garlic edamame . The salad had this amazing dressing and it was also sprinkled with crap. The owner of the restaurant made sure to come up and ask how we were doing . There menu is huge and lots of selection. I felt bad there wasn't more people in there but it's because there a new business. I recommend it ! Support your small owned local businesses !!
