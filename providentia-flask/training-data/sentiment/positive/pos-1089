We were driving down 151 past Verona and decided we needed some lunch.  Gray's Tied House came up on the GPS and I'm so glad it did.  I thought this place was great.

First the atmosphere.  It's a new modern looking building.  Very bright and spacious.  Multiple dining areas.  High tops around the wood fired oven.  Large bar area.  Lot of booths and tables.  A huge aquarium w/lots of tropical fish.  Outdoor areas and more private areas.  It really has space for every need.

The service was also fine.  We were greeted at the door and led to a booth next to the aquarium.  Our waitress was polite and prompt.  She took our order, brought us our food, and answered questions efficiently.

I also really like that they brew their own.  Both beer AND soda.  I had the porter which was delicious - chocolatey and nutty.  For sodas, they have orange, cream and root beer.

Finally the food.  There were several things I really liked about the food.  I ordered the Black 'N Blue Burger which was perfectly cooked and delicious.  But what I loved most about it was the choice of sides: French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Kettle Chips or Dipping Vegetables.  When do you ever see Dipping Vegetables for a side?  The day we were there the dipping vegetables were carrots and broccoli and it was a huge amount of vegetables.  I don't like Ranch but I was able to get them with a side of Blue Cheese. I was very pleased with the options, the amount, the freshness, the ability to substitute, and the price.

It was a really great experience at Grays' Tied House and I look forward to returning.
