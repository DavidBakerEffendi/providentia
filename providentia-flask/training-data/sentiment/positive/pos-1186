Best tacos I have ever had in Arizona and I have lived here for over 10 years. It is slow because it is quality ingredients and made with love. The chef's and front counter people are super friendly and it's worth the wait. Had the Gorditas and Tacos and I will return whenever I want the best tacos in Arizona.
