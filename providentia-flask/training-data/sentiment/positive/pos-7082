Still by far one of my favourite breakfast/brunch spots!! If you haven't beenAND you live in the area, you've been missing out! 

I get the hash with eggs over easy - highly recommend. It's a tasty hash that you can barely find in other breakfast spots. They also have all the regular breakfast combos that you can find in most places. If you're more of a sweet morning person, the pancakes are really fluffy and I don't think it'll really disappoint. Also they offer white, brown or rye bread, and that rye bread is always my go to.

As for the environment, it's awesome. If you life feeling homey, and in a cool old school type of place this is perfect! It's a cute diner where there are regulars who greet each other and stop to chat. It's the closest thing I've seen to the cute small town feeling in a bigger city, which is amazing!
