I like this location even more than the Green Valley one, which is where I go most often.  The restaurant is clean with lots of comfortable seating.  I've never had poor service here.  The wait staff are always so friendly and attentive. 

Holy coffee cake.  I literally can't believe something so a-freaking-mazing comes with my breakfast!  The flavors are always different and the highlight of my meal is finding out which one I'll have that day.  I've loved all the meals I've ever had here.  And the seasoned potatoes are a total guilty pleasure.  

The prices can't be beat.  We always get a buy one get one coupon in the View newspaper.  

The Cracked Egg is such a no-brainer for breakfast (even at lunchtime, which I do often!).
