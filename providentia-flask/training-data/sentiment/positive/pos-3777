I am in love with this pizza place. I dream of the menu and the gelato. It is our favorite place to take the kids. We can't go too often because the prices are a little expensive.... But really for the quality they should be. I'm having trouble figuring out if they deliver. If they did, I would be in more trouble. We have tried a variety of items- fried mozzarella appetizer, yummy but crunchy, the marinara is great with it. We tried the seafood Fra Diavolo pizza- also awesome but not the best for reheating because the calamari gets a little weird. My kids have destroyed the kids menu options and they are happy with them. We had the Old New York and the Spring Street as well. Man the sausage on the pizza is killer! My one disappointment would be the cannoli. A little more delicate, larger and with more filling and I could really wreck myself!
