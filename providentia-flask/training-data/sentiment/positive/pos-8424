While being a little reserved about the name... we ventured in. The atmosphere was very nice, staff right there; Hello and welcome to Lazy Dog!

After being seated and granddaughter settled in, we looked over the menu to 2 items: Lamb Ragu and Buffalo Meatloaf... wha.....?

A pizza off the kids menu was as big as our 2year old granddaughter, we were ready... so we thought.

There is no way to describe these 2 dishes other than "stupid good" Seriously! The lamb was shredded and cooked perfectly along, with exceptional pasta. The Buffalo meatloaf was delicious with mashed potatoes, saut√©ed spinach and a perfect gravy.

These are seasonal items but approximately $16-17 each and well worth every penny!! A must for the foodie!!
