Since most all the Waffle Houses are in the south, was not sure what to expect from one in Phoenix.  Especially since the company refuses to build in Las Vegas telling us they need a distribution center in between Georgia and here.  So why is there one in Phoenix and looks like its the real thing??  White Castle figured it out!!  

But i digress.  This is the real thing right down to the cute little old lady who was our waitress, complete with an apron filled with buttons and badges.  the Waffles were the same as I remembered from the south.  Tasty, a little chewy and round with their syrup... Absolutely heaven... The hash Browns are the selling point.  Smothered and covered!!  So easy, yet nobody else has figured out how to do that!  

They move you in, get you seated and fed and move you out... Love it...
