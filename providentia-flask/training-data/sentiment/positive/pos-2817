Came here in a group of 6 ladies after Bollywood dance class, it was perfect.

We had the buffet lunch, the price is right, the food was delicious and fresh ( the best Indian food in Scottsdale) so far. The staffs were very friendly and the restaurant was nice and clean, what a perfect day for Indian food.

Will definitely recommend to friends and would love to comeback for more.
Thank you!
