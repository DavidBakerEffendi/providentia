Postino is never a disappointment no matter which location you go to. This time I tried their newest one at Kierland Commons and the setting was just perfect. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour so we opted to sit at the bar which was a lot of fun. We ordered the bruschetta board with a bottle of rose from Spain since it was their Tuesday night special for $20! 

Each bruschetta is seriously better than the next. I have listed all the flavors in  my picture and I can't even pick a favorite, because they're all so good. For the amount of food and alcohol, the price is incredible! The service is also top notch and super friendly.

 It's a great place to catch up with a friend, go on a date or even celebrate a special occasion!
