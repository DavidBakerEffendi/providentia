A fabulous variety of Vietnamese food.  The Shaken Beef is my favorite dish.  It's filet with grilled onions, rice, soup and salad.  I have a hard time trying other dishes because I get the shaken beef everytime.  The garlic noodles and beef is awesome and the spring roles are a great appetizer.  We've been eating here since they opened in Surprise and it's one of our favorite places to eat out here.
