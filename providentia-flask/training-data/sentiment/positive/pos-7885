If you're a wing lover, this is a place you should try!!!!! The suicide sauce is delicious but do is every other sauce. I get these wings all the time just for that amazing wing sauce. I have tried the slices of pizza and wouldn't recommend them unfortunately. There is too much oregano or some green spice that ruins the taste of the pizza, but whatever I still get wings all the time! Amazing!
