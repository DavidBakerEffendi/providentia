Driving around looking at Yelp resulted in lunch at Nonna.  Luckily there was a sign on the sidewalk pointing us back to their location because it was a little tough to find.  It's a cute little place with a bunch of tables, open kitchen and small bar.  They make their own pasta which was a pleasant surprise to say the least.  We tried the tagliatelle bolognese  and a burrata/eggplant dish both were incredible.  The menu is small but they seem to have it all covered - excellent pasta, seafood lovers, veggie peeps and everyone in between. 

Service is personal, it was just the two cooking/serving at lunch and it was incredibly efficient despite having a few tables occupied. We dine out quite a bit but I haven't tried a place this great in a long long time.  Don't miss out!!!
