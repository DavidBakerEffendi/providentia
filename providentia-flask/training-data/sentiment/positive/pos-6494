This hotel is AWESOME!!!  So Roomy...  BIG PLUS ITEMS:  2 TVs; One in front of the beds, and one in the sitting room...  A sunken sitting room.  As you come into the room, the beds are frist, and after that are two steps down to a couch, coffee table, desk, and a couple of single plush seats...  again, with your 2nd TV.  ONE WORD:  SPACIOUS!!!  

Restaurants here in this hotel are amazing...  If you're ready to indulge yourself and you LOVE steaks, you've got to check out Delmonnico's (sp)  It's an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, (see my review on this restaurant)  It's SOOO WORTH IT!!!  Also the Luxor Cafe has great food at decent prices.  Check out their caesar salad and their misoyaki salmon...  that is if it's still on the menu.  

I so love this place and would gladly stay here when the rates are low.  I guess I better gamble here a bit more so I can hope to get freebies here...
