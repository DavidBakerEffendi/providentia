I've had several different dishes here including the cheesesteak, butter burger, ribs, wings, pizza, steak and the chicken burger. The food has always been well above average to great and the service friendly and prompt. I have taken friends there and it has become our go to local place. So even if you're not a Packers fan, do your tastebuds a favor go there. Go there NOW!!!
