Um...this is seriously the BEST FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD. 
Chik-Fil-A ain't got nothing on Blue Ribbon. 
Crispy fried batter + delicious seasoning + juicy tender chicken = perfect

Also, this restaurant is super clean, service is really friendly, and they have their own soda! :)
Fries are crispy.  
Cole slaw is a light and crunchy.  
Pickles aren't overly salty. 

*Tip: get the chipotle honey!!!!*
