I frequent this Dunkin a lot.  I run a business out of my home, so I use this location to interview potential employees.  The staff at this Dunkin aren't just friendly, they are consistently stable.  I would think in this type of industry the turn over would be pretty high, so the management must be doing something right because I see the same faces all the time.  The coffee is always fresh and hot.
