Thank you once again Yelp Las Vegas!!!

I was searching for a yummy lunch spot and I came across Amena!

I not a huge fan of falafels but I'm a huge fan of pita :D

After having Amena's falafels in their fluffy pita pocket... I'm sold!
Not a huge fan of their hummus or talziki sauce but the falafels and pita bread are amazing enough to make me want to come back soon!

Next time I want to try their chicken shawarma! Haven't had it since I was in Dubai. Oh and their baklava :D

If you love pita bread... stop by Amena's for their daily fresh baked pitas which comes in minis and regular size. I got a bag of minis to go :))

After lunch here today with my gf... I'm a big fan of Amena's falafels and pita bread! We both enjoyed Amena's!

Casual in door seating. reasonable prices. no stress free parking.

I'll be back for my middle eastern fix!
