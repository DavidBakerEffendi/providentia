This place knows exactly what it is and sells it which is why they get 5 stars. We went on a Saturday evening (they close at 8) and I would recommend this place more for lunch. They have a very big menu with almost every kind of peanut butter and jelly sandwich you could think of. Also they gave grilled cheese so other menu items if you are. It into PB & J. The sandwiches range in price from 2-6$ which really is not bad for all the items you can get on the sandwich plus they all come with a choice of a size including bag of chips, animal crackers or vanilla wafers. I went with the peanut butter and Nutella sandwich pretty basic and very tasty. I also got the funky monkey which came with crunchy peanut butter, crushed up pretzels and chips with sliced bananas. It was amazing! We had a $25 gift card to spend which was actually hard so I also got a yogurt parfait which had granola and lots of fresh fruit. For dessert we got dirt- have not had that since I was a kid with gummy worms and all. I would love to go back for lunch as the are so many other sandwiches I want to try. The staff were helpful and friendly and the place is very cute inside. It would be a great place to take kids.
