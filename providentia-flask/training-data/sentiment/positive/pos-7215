So we finally made it to Pan Asian!

I am happy to say, that it does not disappoint! Chef Wong has some very delicious cooking here! He was also very friendly and came to talk to us, and said he made the basil special just for us by cooking it and searing it...which really made it fragrant and added a nice consistency! I will ask for it like this next time for sure!

The drunken noodles (pad kee mao) was my most favorite way I've had this dish! And I order this EVERYWHERE I go! Chef Wong was NOT afraid to add spice, so it was a good heat and excellent flavor, especially with that basil!

The "Basil sauce" (pad ka pao) was good, and also had a nice heat behind it, but I really like it when the chicken is minced into very small pieces...the meat really absorbs the heat and all those juices in the sauce that way. Since these were large pieces of chicken and there were tons of green beans in there, this wasn't my most favorite way of doing it, but still good!  I don't think I've ever had more green beans in a dish before lol :

And lastly, the pad thai was also good. It was a little on the sweet end, but we normally don't order this dish, so I can't really compare it to others in town. It seemed like it had a better taste though than we have had before.  It also had a great presentation :

Overall, this is an excellent place to check out, especially with their lunch specials and great food!  Prices are a little cheaper here than most in town, but the servings are a tiny bit smaller too, so it works out overall.

I am not sure if I can jump out and say it is my most favorite in town, but with them making the best version of drunken noodles I've had, I will be back again for sure!
