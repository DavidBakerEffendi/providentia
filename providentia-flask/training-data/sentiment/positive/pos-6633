Few things make me as happy as the Fountains of Bellagio. There's a magical quality to this show that makes you feel, if just for a few minutes, that the world is good and everything will be ok. It is an absolute MUST see for everyone!

One of the best parts is that the show is FREE, yes free. All you have to do is show up and elbow a few people to get a good spot. But, the show expands for almost an entire block so there is plenty of room.

More times than none there will be folks performing on the street. Some in costume some playing instruments some might just be drunkards. There's entertainment all around this event so keep your eyes and ears open.

I really like the wide variety of music. Songs from Elvis Presley to Celine Dion (ha) to Frank Sinatra to Michael Bolton (ha ha) and everything in between. It's a very American, patriotic show to say the least. Quintessential Las Vegas. 

It really doesn't matter where you stand, sit or slump to watch the show. All vantage points are great because, well, you're in Las Vegas!
