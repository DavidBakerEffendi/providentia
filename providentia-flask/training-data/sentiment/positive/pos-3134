Since I am on this pho roll, as opposed to California ... ( waiting for laugh track)  

I will mention a place that my cousin and her husband have taken me time after time again, they have gone here with their parents since the 90s because I remember them treating me to Pho here when I used to come and visit Calgary.

This is like a little secret hideaway restaurant nestled on the edge of Chinatown and near the river.  It is dark inside and has awful wood panelling and very old 70s furniture and plastic plants but I must admit it is one of the best places in the city to get Pho.  My cousins swears by it.  

I was soon reminded about how good it is here because a piping huge Pho was placed before me, the tender beef so juicy and spicy, the broth so hot and a little sweet.  

Another time we came to visit, I decided on the pork, spring roll and vermicelli and it too was a large portion and the spring rolls were so crispy and delicious.

The long line ups can attest to the great food here and the extremely friendly service; since my cousins eat here often they are treated like family so although I don't like to be favoured, I think our portions have a little extra...or perhaps my eyes are just way too big when eating.
