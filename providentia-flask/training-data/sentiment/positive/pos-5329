I am very impressed with this restaurant. We got a flyer at my work and the pictures of the food looked amazing. My coworker and I went for lunch. I got the turkey dog and my coworker got the chili cheese dog. We got fries too. About 3 bites in I was thinking "Damn, I wish I had ordered two of these". These are not hotdogs. These are gourmet  hotdogs which makes them like a whole other thing. They are SO good!! I told my other coworkers they needed to go there so they did the next day and everyone loves it. Even if you don't like hotdogs just give this place a try and I'm sure they will change your mind. I will certainly be back!
