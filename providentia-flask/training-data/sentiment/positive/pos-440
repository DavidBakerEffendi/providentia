Celebrated my birthday here last night and we had a great experience.  We had reservation for 8 people but ended up having 10 people.  They were able to accommodate us really quick. Our table was ready on time and we were sat within 5 minutes of being there.  They bring out this thin bread with sweet butter right away. The butter was sooooo good!!! We ordered pretty much the entire menu and everything was delicious. I had the filet medium well, and it was perfectly done. It came with fingerling potatoes and kale which was ridiculously good.  I also had side of the truffle Mac and cheese which was also wonderful. They bought a little chocolate muffin for my bday and also full plate for the whole table. Service was also top notch. I will definitely be back and want to try the lunch menu.
