This is my second time at a Ray Azteca and I love the food! The wait staff here is friendly and the one waiter came out with I kid you not 6 plates stacked on one arm he had an arm sleeve like oven mitt on, was interesting to watch! We got the Texanas? Dinner for two and it was delicious! Love the combo of the shrimp, chicken, and steak! The shrimp is my favorite! Grilled just right. Trust me you don't leave her hungry :) will be coming back to this location again
