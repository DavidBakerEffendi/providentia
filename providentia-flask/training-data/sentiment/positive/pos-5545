My boyfriend and I have been regulars here for a year, coming about two or three times a week. We always get a chicken pad Thai, and a green curry which are both unbelievable. The perfect amount of spice and flavour in each dish. The kitchen and wait staff are extremely consistent every time. We refuse to eat anywhere else for Thai now!
