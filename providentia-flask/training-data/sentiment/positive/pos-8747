Listen...when you're in Vegas and you're down on your luck go where the locals go for the best dam food in town!!  Their breakfast is the best bar none and the fire place lounge  (over 21 only) is a really great place to rehab, get a bite to eat, and that last drink before you go back home after a long night in the club!  The parking lot is an awesome make shift camp site when you can't quite drive yet and need to chill too!!
