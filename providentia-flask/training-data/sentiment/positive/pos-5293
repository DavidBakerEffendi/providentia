We've eaten at Yoli's so many times I can't count them all! Our go to breakfast is the Chorizo burrito, it's huge, delicious, and always fresh. My favorite lunch time meal is a tie. I usually order the grilled ham and cheese (yes I'm an adult, but it's soooo yummy), and the Luau Pulled Pork. The pork sandwich comes on this roll but they toast it (delicious) and it has a crunchy coleslaw with pineapple and jalape√±os in it! Are you hungry yet? What I love even more is that you can order their amazing steak fries or if you want to be healthy they offer cottage cheese as a side. As you can read I'm a huge fan and we will keep visiting Yoli's!
