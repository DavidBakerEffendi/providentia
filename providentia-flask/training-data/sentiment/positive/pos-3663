Excellent food! Busy place! I can see why. We took counter seats to avoid a wait. If you want to watch a serious game, sit there and watch how great the kitchen guys handle the food. There was a lot happening and not once did any one show stress or impatience. Seems as though kitchen help always gets over looked. These guys rocked it! Way to go! 

9/9 our visit today was great! Brandt was a great server! He's very friendly. Thanks!
