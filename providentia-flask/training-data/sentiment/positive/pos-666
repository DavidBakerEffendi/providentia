I was so excited to see that Dottie's was opening a location here in AZ. The boyfriend and I went to the original in San Francisco and loved it so we had high hopes for this version.

We went on a Saturday morning and got seated right away. We chose to sit outside but there were lots of tables inside as well. It is much bigger than their SF counterpart. The vibe is very different as well. SF was, well, more San Francisco. More eclectic and hectic. The atmosphere here was very laid back and overall the clientele seemed older but it may have just been that day.

We both ordered pancakes. I got mine with fruit and he got the blueberry cornmeal. The servings here are huge. my pancakes were very dense and filling. Not light and fluffy but very flavorful. They had almost a light cinnamon quality. Boyfriend loved his pancakes. So much so he tried to recreate them at home the next day. But the best part of the meal was the bacon. It tasted like it was barbecued if that even makes sense. It had a smoky flavor to it that was very unique and very delicious. It's not often you get something different with your bacon!

The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable. I hope they make it in this location - it seems like a lot of businesses have failed in this spot. Go there now to make sure they last!!
