From the outside, it looks a bit sketchy and ghetto. From the inside, it's not that much nicer, but don't let the deter you from coming! The service is fast and friendly. The food... amazing!

We tried the beef tongue taco, pork burrito with green chile and a chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla came out like a pizza - different, but good and worth trying! The burrito wasn't overstuffed with rice and the taco was amazing.
