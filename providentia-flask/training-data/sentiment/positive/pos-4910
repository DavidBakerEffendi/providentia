I was reading in the Talk portion of Yelp about what people preferred to eat, In&Out Burger or Fat Burger.  Of course my preference has always been In&Out Burger because of the simplicity of the burger.  It's not fancy and has a whirlwind of grilled burger flavors.

Because of the topic at hand, I ended up craving for In&Out.  I chose this particular location because the line isn't ridiculously long like all the other locations.  I normally have to wait for a little more than a half hour before I get my food.  Here, it is what it's named, In and Out.  You're in to get your order, and out in no more than ten minutes.  I don't know how long this will last a people will more than likely catch on.

Service is efficient, and food is always cooked to perfection.  Fries can be sometimes too dry for my liking.  But, I prefer it over any other fries.
