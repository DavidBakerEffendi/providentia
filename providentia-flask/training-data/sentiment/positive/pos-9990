We've spent years looking for a superior sushi bar in Phoenix. Little did we know we'd find one right downtown. Catering to the work lunch crowd, it offers reasonable prices, and a wonderful evening out as well.

The atmosphere is casual, yet classy, trendy and modern. And yet, one can tell it is at heart a mom and pop operation, with authentic Japanese cuisine. 
We have yet to find a bad dish, but don't miss the Finding Nemo, nor the signature OMG roll--it's truly "OMG!"

Very reasonable prices for such a fantastic dining experience!
