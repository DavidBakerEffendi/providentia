I know this is a chain pizza restaurant...but their pizza is consistently good!     

And they finally opened up at 344 front street west!  Which is just about 2 doors west of Pizza Pizza and across the street there is Pizza Nova.     That's a lot of pizza competition, but that's okay....because both hubby and I would still go get Dominos when we can.   Why?  Because it's just better pizza.   

The new store is very pretty!  New Domino chain layout.   The new stacked pizza ovens means they can churn out pizza's quickly, to meet the demand especially during roger centre sports and events.   They also have a sitting area on the 2nd floor....which is the first time I've seen a chain have upstairs seating for takeout and delivery.   

My hubby has been looking forward to them opening for a very long time....and finally it's here!  He likes to get a large pizza usually with two kinds of toppings....as well as usually Parmesan cheese bread bites.  My dog loves pizza as well (mind you what dog doesn't? )  :-) 

Fast service, beautiful new store, walking distance ...not much more then I can ask for.
