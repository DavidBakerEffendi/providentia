Truly a 5 diamond hotel. It's all in the details! Nothing is left out. 
From the gorgeous lobby when you check-in to the friendly staff checking you in (no waiting)

The elevators are a bit of a walk from the lobby (they want you to pass by some slot machines ;) smart 
(Check-out is easy too, just send a text message and you can leave)

WOW the suites are gorgeous! HUGE glass shower, bath tub, toilet has door, double sinks! Marble everywhere! Vanity, plenty of outlets!

Now onto the room, huge and comfy king size bed! Lots of outlets that you didn't have to search hard for, automatic open/close curtains!!! And the details of the rooms!! 3 TV's total, crown moulding, wainscoting, wallpaper, paintings, every little details was perfect, very clean and everything fits the theme.

Parking is free!!!! Go in and out all you like (get a rental car if you come to Vegas!) 

Would stay here again and again! Perfect location if you like to walk also! It's in the middle between all the high end hotels, wynn, Caesars palace, ballagio...
