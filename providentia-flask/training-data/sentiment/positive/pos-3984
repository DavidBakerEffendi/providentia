Food was awesome. We got orange chicken, crab puffs, and vegetable lo mein. Food was fresh and hot when we picked it up, the girl working the counter was very nice and friendly even walked my drinks out while I was putting the food in the car. 30 minutes before it closed and it looked full of customers in the dining area still which is always a good sign. I would definitely recommend. My only complaint is they don't deliver haha

Literally the best Chinese food in town since the Chen wok on 35th and thunderbird closed down.
Still bummed no delivery but they are so good, fast, friendly that I can drive down the street to pick up lunch with a smile on my face.
