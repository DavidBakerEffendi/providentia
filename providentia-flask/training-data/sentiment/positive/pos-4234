We made reservations for Onda because of its convenience near the Terry Fator theatre. While we're local Las Vegas residents, we'd never dined at the restaurant. When we arrived, we weren't sure what to expect as the bar dining entry area is rather brightly illuminated and without the Italian upscale decor we were expecting for a romantic dinner. After a brief walk through the bar area, we turned the corner into what seemed like a different restaurant. The decor, ambiance, lighting, configuration and atmosphere was exactly what we were hoping for. (Candidly, the chairs are so comfortable we both expressed how in the future we'll linger for an extra hour enjoying after dinner drinks and desert.)

The wine list offers an extensive selection of Italian vino and the General Manager (Chris Zadie) offered wonderful insights and selections based on our preferences. We really enjoyed the quantity of 375ml bottles offered on the list and ordered two. 

The pasta dishes are all home made and our two selections were 5*. In addition, that night (Jan 4), they had Italian White Truffle and we enjoyed the 5 oz shaving. 

We didn't have time for desert because of the show; however, we both really enjoyed the dining experience and look forward to returning. 

I recommend Onda and anticipate I'll be hosting family and business events here. It's conveniently located near the Terry Fator theatre and great restaurant for a couple seeking a pre-show romantic Italian dining experience.
