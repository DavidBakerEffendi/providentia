I loved everything about this place! So gorgeously decorated reminding me of Europe. Perfect spot to take the girlie-girl in your life. Breakfast with a coffee and chocolate croissant would be pure perfection. Seriously though, reminds me of Paris. The food was so delicious. My husband and I split the Mediterranean Chicken Crepe. It was savory from the tender grilled chicken, cheesy from the mozzarella with a finish of tartness and freshness from the sundried tomato aioli. A must try. 

My dessert (I got the large) was the Strawberry "short-Crepe" not surprisingly, I ate the entire thing! So creamy with the whipped cream, tart from the berries and sweet from the crumbled Biscoff cookie. Once again, the Crepe was tender and delicate. Yum, yum, yum! We went in for lunch so I didn't have coffee or the chocolate croissant but, I will most definitely be back for that! Coffee date anyone?
