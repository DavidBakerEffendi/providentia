I give the Tic Toc a full five stars because it has all the necessary ingredients for a great meal out: genuine character, good comfort food, cleanliness, and a cute older couple that runs the joint. Tic Toc is a really great hole in the wall diner that I know most people don't probably think twice about if they even notice it at all. The first time I visited was out of necessity for an impromptu business meeting.

Honestly though, you are greeted by the owners when you go in (I think they are British), grab a mug (if you want coffee), and grab a seat. If you go here you should not expect everything to be new and shiny... instead, expect patina and charm. Even the mugs are a random collection similar to what you might see in a thrift shop - but it works for this place and I love it!

The food is standard diner fare but good nonetheless. They have a variety of specials offered throughout the week and I know other yelpers speak to how good they are but I have yet to venture out of my usual (eggs, toast, coffee). Regardless of what you get, one thing is for sure, Tic Toc is a great value.

I'll be back!
