No matter how hard I try to fall out of love with burgers&fries, I can't do it. I keep coming back to seek out another juicy treat! I decided to try out Bareburger because it is new, looked cool, and I like their fresh approach to using quality ingredients.

I love this place!

The ambience is modern in that cozy cabin way. It is not at all stark inside, and the dim lighting makes everyone look good. I also did NOT notice an overwhelming sense of hipster, so that was a definite plus for me. There is a neon sign about ukeleles on the wall that is a bit 'trying too hard' for my taste, but aside from that, I do like the decor. The way the interior is set up is also very pleasant. Having a bar and bar-seating is great too.

The service was amazing. Everyone was friendly and clean looking. 

I got one of the popular burgers - I can't remember the name, started with an S. It was on a Brioche bun that tasted like Heaven. SOOO good. 

Fries were great too. Nice and salty. The size of the fries was normal size - NOT shoe-string like Earls fries, and not at all wedges. They were the diameter of Swiss Chalet fries, but longer in length. Usually I like just slightly thinner fries, but these just tasted so good I ate them in like 1 minute.

I really wished that I ordered a shake. Next time!

So go check this place out! It's great!
