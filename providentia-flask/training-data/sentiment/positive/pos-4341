Crepes are amazing.  It's a fact.  There's something for everyone.  There are sweet crepes.  There are savory crepes.  On The Crepe Club's menu, you have Parisian and Nutella and Creme de Lemon crepes along with Chicken Florentine and Italiana and Caprese crepes.  See the full menu here:  https://www.thecrepeclub.com/menu.html.  

But catch this...there has been a contest going on.  My girlfriend and I each got an APPLE SPICE crepe, which is only available through Sunday as a part of the contest.  Apples, cinnamon, brown sugar, and powdered sugar.  Soooo yummy!  Check out the photos I uploaded and see the finalists here:  https://www.thecrepeclub.com/vote.html.  I'd highly you get the Apple Spice while it's available (through June 26).  

Now, I've been to the ASU location of The Crepe Club though that's a small walk-up window.  This is the main location with plenty of seating and other dishes beyond just crepes.  The staff are very knowledgable and helpful.  In addition to a pair of mini Apple Spice crepes, we also each got a mini Mediterranean Chicken crepes.  I strongly recommend that you get two mini crepes instead of one large crepe.  Sweet and savory together are a plus, and when you order at the Biltmore location, you can even have them bring the sweet crepes to you for dessert once you finish with your savory crepes.  

Also, look at your receipt and complete the survey for $5 off your next visit.  That is more than enough to cover a mini crepe or most of a large crepe.  It pays to give feedback.  

I definitely recommend visiting The Crepe Club (any location) though if you can make it to the Biltmore location by Sunday, get the Apple Spice crepe!
