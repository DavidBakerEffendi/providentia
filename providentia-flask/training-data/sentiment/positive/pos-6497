I loved this place! I saw this place when it was being built a few years ago so I added it to my list of places to go to the next time I was on this side of the strip. It's not only a candy store though, it's also a fun restaurant. 
I had the pizza and tried the chicken strips. Both were good. I'm not usually a fan of chicken, but their's was really good. It was not too cheap, but it's on the strip, so it was expected. 
We sat at a table inside near the doors at the front entrance. We had a nice view of the Bellagio, which I enjoyed. 
We had a wheelchair with us and they were very accommodating. You can get inside by going in through Paris hotel and going in through the bar. 
The service was good. We got everything very quickly, even without ordering drinks, which I find to be rare. We were one of the only groups in there in the middle of the day during a busy time. The atmosphere was nice. I really liked the look of the restaurant. Their drinks were even themed. 
This is a fun place to go if yo enjoy
