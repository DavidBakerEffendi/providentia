I really liked this place. We dropped in for lunch soley based on the Yelp reviews. I had the ribeye sandwich with fries. daughter ate the kids chicken with fries and husbby had the patty melt with fries

We also tried the fried pickles- they were very hot and enough for 2 (two) PEOPLE TO SHARE. they were very tasty, and the ranch was nice to except for it being to thin.


my steak sandwich was realy nice. cooked to my liking but the seasoning was almost not there. I had to salt and pepper the heck out of it.

hubby's patty melt came on rye bread. he felt that the meat had no seasoning what so ever. 

we had a nice lunch, but keep in mind this is a tavern so dont be shocked if the annoying dude at the bar keeps hollering at the game above the bar. or the loud overbearing people in the table near you have had to many beers at 1 in the afternoon. (yes people we were annoyed but your obsurd behavior!)

our server left something to be desired. I don't think he has waited on tables very much. we left him only a 10% tip- which is more than I had wanted to leave. 
he was NOT attentive, he acted like it was a bother to come serve us. ANOTHER server kept refilling our drinks. Wish we could have given the tip to her. 

I think we may try this place again.
