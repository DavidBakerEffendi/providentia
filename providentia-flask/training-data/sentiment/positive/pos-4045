Pasquale on ciabatta and an iced mad cow (expresso+ hazelnut+cream). Cute place, nice outside patio. Wish they didn't allow smoking though. Their uniforms are god awful too. The cashier wasn't that great when I asked her it was my first time here she said ok take your time and left the counter.. Recommend me something? I don't bite. The menu is extensive. From sugar loaded red velvet blended drinks to protein and "supermodel" sandwiches. I'll be back.

Update: went in at 7am and SKYLAR was awesome! Even though he's a Virgo.


Update: ordered a lox & bagel. Wasn't busy at all. Asked for no onions and then he repeated the order back to me. Saying no onions right? Twice. and I got more onion than anything else. I'm so disappointed. You won't be seeing me anymore. Rude staff. I walked in to no acknowledgement and there are 4 other people in here with me. The cashier has this gnarly cut on his arm and its bleeding. What the hell

OK. Another update. The coffee is so good I can't stay away. No-lo (sp?) and Skylar (again) were AWESOME!!!! They made my day so much better. Super cool and courteous. They immediately recognized me as the girl with the onion problem and gave me a discount for my trouble last time. AND made the best lox& bagel I've ever had. I'm full and I'm drooling at the thought of putting my lips to another one! GREAT STAFF! Their customer service is impeccable. And fast! Management did a great job at keeping their regulars happy. And be sure to wish Skylar a happy retirement from the coffee shop. We'll sure miss you!
