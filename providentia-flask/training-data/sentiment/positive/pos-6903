I came here last night with my family. Super fun place and not as expensive as I thought. We payed $50 and got to play for an hour. You do pay $5 per person to get a membership card but I consider that not to be that bad. I will say playing golf is harder than it looks. Takes a few minutes to even get comfortable with the swing. This place is definitely a fun little thing to do in the night if you want to hang. Good atmosphere and insanely good food in my opinion.
