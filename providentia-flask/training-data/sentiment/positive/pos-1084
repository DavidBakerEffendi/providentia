Yes, the Resturant is small but they just opened a new bar area that offers much more seating and they have some great speciality cocktails on the menu. The bar manager is great, very friendly and a great mixologist!  
After some wonderfully prepared and great "bar-food" in Maximus a few days ago, we went back today for brunch 
The cocktails we had the other night were great, only to find the best Bloody Mary in town this morning. 
As recommended by our wonderful server, I had the steak scones whereas others in my party had the eggs Benedict and the Spanish Skillet, all of which were nothing short of magnificent!
We love this little place and will surely continue to return over and over again!
