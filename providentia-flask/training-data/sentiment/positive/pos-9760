Boulder City is a virtual oasis here in Southern Nevada. It's not a city by any stretch, but a town.  But Boulder Town sounds ridiculous and like something straight out of a Mad Max movie.

BC is comprised of many different people who live in many different dwellings.  From let over housing from the Dam building days, the proverbial trailer park to million dollar mansions it's got a little of them all.

I have spent a lot of time there in the past couple of years that it does not feel "touristy" to me anymore.

Come out and enjoy the parks.  Xeric landscaping does not really exist in the community. The city and many neighborhoods are still very green and well manicured.

Have fun exploring the main drag on Nevada Highway.  There are many shops and restaurants to choose from.

BC also has one of the premiere mountain biking spots found in Bootleg Canyon in all the world or so I am told.

My one recommendation is to watch out for the mass exodus of travelers that use the town as an egress route when returning back through Arizona.  The traffic can be quit heinous.  My suggestion is to by-pass all that and make the right turn on Veteran's Memorial Drive.  Follow it to Adams and make a left.  When you hit Buchanan hang another left.

But there are those rare times when not even this can help you as traffic can back up to Rail Road Pass.

During the week BC is much less chaotic.  While sitting down in a diner and staring out the window I am reminded of home and for a brief second forget that I live in the Mojave desert.  BC is a special place and I understand why those that a fortunate to live there do.
