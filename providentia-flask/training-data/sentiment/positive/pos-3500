I ordered the steak and ranch pizza with an order of zucchini strips. The Pizza had great flavor except it would have been nice to have more sauce or a side of ranch served with it. The zucchini strips were crispy and flavorful with a side of marinara. Delivery was prompt and the food was hot. I'm looking forward to trying other items from this restaurant!
