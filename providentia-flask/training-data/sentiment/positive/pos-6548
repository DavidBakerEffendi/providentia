As I was walking through the Christmas Market, I saw a kid eating her waffle, I couldn't stop staring at the beautiful creation. I got in line, they took my order promptly. They have about 5-6 items on their menu. The wait to get your waffle depends, I had about 4-6 people ahead of me. It took me about 5 mins or so, felt longer since it was cold outside. I ended up getting the waffle bites with white chocolate fudge as my dipping sauce. It was to die for. I'm drooling at the thought of it.
