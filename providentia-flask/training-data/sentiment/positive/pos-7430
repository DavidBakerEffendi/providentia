8/2017: EXCELLENT SERVICE! We had a party of 9 (4 adults & 5 kids). The food is excellent, establishment very clean, service impeccable! What a great experience. The grape leaves are wonderful, the pizza perfect, the shawarma delicious! Kids items are great (I'd add buttered noodles or mac & cheese, but no biggie). The owner is a wonderfully personable man and we Loved it!
