Portions are big, so order wisely! You get so much food, it's actually a deal.

Kimchi soup was perfectly spicy, very hot, and was loaded with kimchi.

Fried chicken was super crispy and delicious! We tried the soy garlic and supreme sauce flavors. My bf liked the soy garlic, but my favorite was the supreme.

Half bulgolgi half potato pizza was ok. I think we just happen to prefer red sauce with little to no sweetness but this had a lot of sweet flavor and not up our alley. For someone who likes a sweeter red sauce this would be really good though.

Loved the atmosphere, the Kpop music, the decorations, and the server guy was super super nice!! We will definitely come back again. :)
