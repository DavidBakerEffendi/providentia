I could probably just hang out here all day everyday if I didn't have to work. I may start working here actually. Not for the place, although it would be a cool place to work. The guy who was working there today was a really nice guy. I tried a couple pieces of the white pizza and really liked it. I had the turkey wrap and it was awesome. The coffee was great also. I am glad that I finally tried this place. It is probably one of my favorite places that I have been in a long time. I wanted to take a nap on the little bed looking couch chair thing. This may be my favorite coffee house in town. I hate to say that because I really love the staff at E 9th Phoenix. There is just more food here and it is very relaxing to hang out. There also were not any of the banker guys from the Federal Reserve that I cannot stand hanging out here.
