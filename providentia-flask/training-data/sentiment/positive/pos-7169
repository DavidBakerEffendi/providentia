Hi-
Hubby and I are trying to find new places to eat. We recently checked out this place and loved it. Arriving late evening we weren't looking to be shocked. Found out they have OTB and I really liked the ambiance. The dining room had cool tables set up for late night intimate dinners or fun evenings of shots and pool. The menu was great, lots of dining options and all sorts of specials. Our server Ryan was so nice, helping us make our final decision having the Fish and Chips and their specialty 'Penne Pesto Pasta. They both were so delicious, the fish was crispy and cooked just right, and the 'signature dish' was full of flavor and easy on the eyes. The manager Mike came by and made sure we were happy.We were.
