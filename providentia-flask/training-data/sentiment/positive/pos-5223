Very nice experience here! Even when it was full they were very accomadating. Service was lovely and food arrived quickly ( the food got to us before we finished the bread). We ordered calamari and their feature pizza (pepperoni and sausage). The calamari was amazing, very crispy breading with soft squid. The sauce it came with was one Ive never had before. The pizza was good, not spectacular. Solid dough and sauce, and the ingridients tasted fresh. Very worth its price point (paid $36 for both) and would go back to try more!
