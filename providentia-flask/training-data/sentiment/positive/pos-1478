The sprawling Venetian/Palazzo complex may well boast the best collection of restaurants in Las Vegas. From the low-end (Grimaldi's, which is excellent) to the high-end (Bouchon, which is transcendent), you can live here for a month and not even come close to tackling all the food.

That, coupled with the shopping of the Canal Shoppes, the suites themselves, and the Canyon Ranch Spa, makes the Venetian my go-to for hotels from here on out.

The suites are big, modern and kept immaculately clean. Each of the standard suites has a bathtub and shower in the sprawling bathrooms, and a pair of televisions in the tiered main area. It felt homey, as any place with an excellent bed and nice linens can feel.

While all those big things that I've already mentioned have strongly colored my experience, the smaller things made the Venetian such a gem of a place for me. There is an Avis car rental on-site, if you want to take daytrips. And at the base of the tower I stayed in was a Bouchon Bakery, which is perfect for a quick and outstanding breakfast.

Overall, a wonderful place. Food, spa, casino, shopping, rooms. Everything about it was great.
