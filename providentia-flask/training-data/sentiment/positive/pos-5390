Shabu Shabu!!!!!!  Say it three times really fast... 

I love this Shabu Shabu place.  They have a super fancy high chair for your baby or toddler.  They also offer toddler spoons and forks.  Music is wonderful and ambiance is lovely at night.  

If you don't know what Shabu Shabu is that is OK.  Your waitress will walk you through it and make sure you have a great experience.  

Faves are the unlimited vegetables, rice and tofu.  The ramen noodles come in small portions though, so if you want a decent amount or a lot, need to order at minimum 3 servings.  The beef is the best option for meats IMO, but add the shrimp and scallops in and you will not be disappointed.  Don't be afraid to cook it up, too.  You'll get the hang of it fast enough.  

No carry-out / no to-go.  

LOVE this place!  YUM.
