I love this place and wish it was close to me. We go when we are leaving town on the way to California and have never been disappointed. Service is always friendly and skilled. The food is good old fashioned  comfort food. Highly recommend this place. Breakfasts are great and have all the biscuit and gravy options as well as traditional breakfast fare.
