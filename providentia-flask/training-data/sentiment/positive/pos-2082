There should be a live feed to watch all the counter banter especially if Jimmy is slinging words.
The portions are huge so you better be hungry to take down a large.
I like the salad, everything in a shawarma mixed up so the flavours get busy together. 
I used to bounce back and forth between chicken shawarma and donairs but now I just go for the combo.
Their garlic sauce is second to none. 
The baklava is always fresh because they have lots of turn over, so you might as well round out your meal.
