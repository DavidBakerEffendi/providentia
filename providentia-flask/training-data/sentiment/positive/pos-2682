We were at the second night of Wolf Creek Tavern's Grand Opening at the recommendation of some friends. What a wonderful time! Even though they were filled to capacity and overflowing to the outdoor seating, my husband and I found a cozy little place at the main bar inside where we could hear the Irish band. The food was delicious and the drinks superb! You have to try the Fried Green Tomatoes and if you enjoy Mint Juleps, you need to try the Black Mojito. They also have an Irish Cider on tap that's very mellow. They were out of the Creme Brulee, but the server suggested a fabulous fresh Strawberry Tart with homemade whipped cream. They use their own fresh ingredients and are supporters of sustainable agriculture and local producers. Vegan and gluten-free menu items can be made at requests, too. We'll definitely be going back and this is our new favorite place to eat!
