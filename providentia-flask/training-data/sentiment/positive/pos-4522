Totally digging Freshii!! I've been twice this week already! The tortilla soup is great, and it's a huge portion size for $8. It made two lunches for me.  The kale in it really sets it apart from any other tortilla soup I've had. Oh, and thank you for not charging extra for avocado! Yesterday I got a detox juice with my soup, so today I went back to try the revive juice to go with my leftovers. Both juices are delicious and it's really convenient and quick to be able to grab them and go. Price wise, maybe a tad more expensive than other places around, but I'm willing to pay for fresh, clean, and delicious food. Looking forward to trying all that Freshii has to offer!
