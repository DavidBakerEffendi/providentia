My husband was taking me out for birthday dinner. He went to yelp to look for the best rated thai restaurant in town & found this place. A bit far from our house but we went there because of the ratings. We ordered lots of foodand they're all excellent.
1. Appetizer, I forgot the name but it was scallops wrapped in banana leaves
2. Crying tiger salad
3. Grilled tiger shrimp mango salad
4. Seafood soup
5. Chricken rice noodle soup
6. Beef panang
7. Pad thai
8. Fried ice cream
It's a husband & wife business. The husband was our waiter, really friendly guy and the wife was the cook who really know to cook good food. Overall, really good experience.I wish it is closer to my house.
