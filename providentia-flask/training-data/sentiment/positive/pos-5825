By far, one of the best brunch place in the NW Calgary area! It's comfortable, clean and spacious overall. The eggs Florentine was delicious. The food overall, is quite cheap with the large portions. The hot chocolate is quite tasty, although taste like cheap powdered version. The potatoes are delicious with the right amount of seasoning. The spinach and hollandaise sauce on my eggs are generous in portions! Overall, a great brunch place to meet friends and have a relaxing chat on a week day. Will be back again for more!
