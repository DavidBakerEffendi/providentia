Great service & Great Food.

Visiting the Pittsburgh area and stopped at this location since my go to stop was closing soon. This is a more high end restaurant and I was completely under dressed just leaving the Steelers game. 

Service was good and my waiter recommended a good wine & meal which I enjoyed both. I was completely wasted but I do remember enjoying my food, wine & service .

I would recommend and would visit again.
