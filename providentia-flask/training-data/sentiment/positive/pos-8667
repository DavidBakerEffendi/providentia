Damn, that's a good burrito.

I went in about ten minutes before closing on New Year's Eve, and got none of the attitude I most certainly would have given in the same situation. I'm not sure of the gentleman's name, but he was incredibly helpful in taking my order - making very useful suggestions, asking about my spice preferences and what not, and making conversation while making the burrito. Definitely a friendly atmosphere, and I can see why my friends rave about the place.

The burrito itself is amazing - incredibly tasty, though I probably should have reconsidered my request for very spicy. Good god. I've only eaten half so far, and am needing to take a break. I aspire to finish this kind of burrito in one go, but I'll have to work my way up I think. Others please choose wisely, at least on your first trip.

Be forewarned that there's not tons of space in the restaurant itself - a couple of seats, not much more. Definitely a take out sort of place.
