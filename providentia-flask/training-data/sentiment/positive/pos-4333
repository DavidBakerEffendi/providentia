Me and my lovely fiancee have been to this place twice and we absolutely loved their food. Price are cheap and the quality are pretty awesome. I always try their combo while my fiancee always try to venture out of ordinary. So far so good.

The server/owner Russel have been very very accomodating and friendly  as well as being a very nice guy to talk to.

I come back more often if its not too far from my home on the west side.
