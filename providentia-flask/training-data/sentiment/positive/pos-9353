Crepe heaven! 

So, let's start this review with the fact I was under the misconception that crepes were for only dessert and sweet. Wrong! This trip on my birthday to tasty crepes educated me on the other crepe options.

We found tasty crepes due to our trusty best friend Yelp. Five stars and truly a hidden treasure. You can't really see it from the road way and that I a tasty shame. 

Walking in the decor throws me back to child like themes and sweet shops. Pastel colors cover the walls in an inviting happy color splash. Lime, bubblegum pink and light blue. The place is very clean, open and plenty of seats. 

The menu is very easy to read, understand, and see the different options. They have deli crepes, savory crepes and then sweet crepes. The deli is similar to a deli sandwich except with crepe instead of bread. Savory was to die for. We got a savory crepe with turkey, bell pepper, onion, mozzarella and spinach. It was delicious. Mouthwatering. Big enough for two to share. The crepe was crispy yet pancake soft like. We also got a sweet crepe to share with was huge too. I was excited to see that they serve thrifts ice cream with their crepes as thrifty is one of my favorite. Sad there are not any rite AIDS out here. We had a ice cream crepe with crunchy chocolate ice cream with banana, strawberry and Nutella inside. Mmmmm. Loved that there was a great amount of ice cream and fruit. The ratio was perfect and flavored complimenting each other. 

The service was fantastic. The owner came over and explained what they sell, different options, the favorites and lastly he came over and asked how it was, while taking our plates from us. I couldn't have been happier with this place.
