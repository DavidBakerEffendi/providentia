I love hot dogs. Full disclosure, even as a kinda foodie, hot dogs rank in my top five favorite foods. I've had them everywhere that they serve them, from New York to Chicago, Happy Dog is still by absolute my favorite. The ambiance, the selection of beers the surplus of toppings.... it is hot dog nirvana. Go there and enjoy yourself!
