A perfect place for breakfast or a snack. We got our table quickly and our waiter was super fast at serving us. We got out coffee and soon after our bacon and eggs.

The manager was making sure everything was ok, and the staff seemed happy. Locals seemed to be regulars and that's a really good sign of quality to me.

See you all next July!
