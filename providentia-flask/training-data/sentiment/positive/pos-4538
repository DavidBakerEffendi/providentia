This place is a gem. As someone in the industry who often doesn't get off work til midnight, Joe's is a god - send since they feature their entire menu until 2 am! You can get anything from blistered shishitos to roasted shrooms, grilled pulpo  (octopus for you non-spanish speaking folk) to skirt steak, sweetbreads to scallops, as well as ahi, burgers, a flatiron steak, and foie gras.
The wine list is pretty great, albeit modest in size. They feature a few AZ wines, which is killer in my book! With over a dozen beers on tap, you can actually purchase Forties to enjoy on-premise or to go! Boom. 
Get down to Joe's for incredible food from 11 am-2 am! Brunch on wknds. Kickass music and overall vibe. Friendly & knowledgeable staff.
