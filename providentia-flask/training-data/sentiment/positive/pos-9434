$4 cocktails and mac n' cheese is there specialty...hmm...sounds like the best thing I've ever been apart of! Kelly's is a great spot with excellent food in an awesome setting. The restaurant is truly something out of a movie. The vibe and decor doesn't try to be cool, it just is. I know how cheesy all of that sounds, but it's the truth. Now in Pittsburgh, you go into a restaurant and they have spent all of their energy on picking out deer heads and granite table tops and no thought was given to the menu or level of comfort you want your guests to feel. Sometimes there is just a space that speaks for itself and that's all that is needed. Kelly's is that pace. The old booths and relaxing atmosphere could easily read dive bar...and to an extent that is a truth. But the great cocktails and awesome food prevents it from being overly kitschy. 

Each day of the week there is a cocktail special that is $4. Mondays are Presbyterians but there are other classic cocktails on the board such as a Cuba libre. It doesn't matter if you get the fried shrimp platter with hush puppies or a simple BLT, it is all done right. The prices are also spot on. The other day, my bf and I got two meals, one beer for him and a cocktail for me...the bill totaled under $25 before a tip and was delicious! The service is good and the wait staff is helpful. I have no complaints and don't expect to ever.
