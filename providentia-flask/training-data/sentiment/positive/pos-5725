I think this is the best Mexican food I've had in this town & the service is outstanding! They just opened this week & we've already been there 3 times (dinner,  happy hour & a take-out meal). Their shredded beef is to die for & their chicken fajita nachos are ridiculously good!  We also had the pleasure of being greeted by the owners & based on the food & service we received, we feel that they have accomplished what Vegas has been missing-a truly first-rate Mexican restaurant (& you have to check-out the fajitas-they are served literally flaming at your table & stay in a lit pot so they stay warm while you eat)! We'll be back tomorrow!
