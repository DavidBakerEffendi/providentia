Was introduced to this place for the first time today and can say that I will definitely be going back! It doesn't look like much from the outside but its a hidden gem!

My boyfriend and I ordered the Large chicken Shwarma to share and it was more than enough for 2 people. We were both stuffed. Everything about this meal was fantastic. Best Shawarma I have ever had and the price is excellent.

I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!
