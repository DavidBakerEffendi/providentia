Most seafood I have ever seen in one place. Cold crab legs, mussels, shrimp, clams, crayfish, and oyster. They also had various styles of cooked lobster, clams, and mussels. The sushi bar was really delicious, and had a nice selection of fresh fish for a buffet. They also had a lot of other cooked items I did not try, but they still looked good. 

The service was really fast here. Our waiter was always one step ahead of us and dumped our shells faster than we could crack them. That's always a plus. 

Desert bar was really good, they have a really nice section of gelato! All you can eat gelato, and it's $5 for a scoop on the strip alone. 

A lot of people mentioned the long wait. I came right at 4pm where they open and there was only a ten minute wait. 

Got this buffet for 29.99 by going to half priced tickets at the Fashion Show Mall, they also have many other locations. I'll definitely return to this buffet next time I'm in Vegas, especially if I can get that price again.
