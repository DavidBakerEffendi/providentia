The case for Mozza:

I really don't know why Mozza is getting all this bad rep. It's a staple for myself and just about everyone I know. What I think turns everyone off is the service. For such a big restaurant with so many different components (bar, terrasse, enoteca, indoor seating) there's bound to be some shortcomings. 
The hostesses are ditsy Laval 15 year olds that can't address you properly because they're too busy holding their micro-skirts up or pulling their plunging necklines down. The male waiters are very competent and the menu is not THAT «one trick poney». I would say stay away from the sandwiches and main meals and you're good.

The pizzas are like no other and the pasta is fresh and flavourful. My favorite is the Gladiatore and the gluten free pasta. The butcher's block is 18$ and the amount of cheese alone on that plate cost about that much if not more. It is a great value. I've eaten at too many restaurants in Montreal AND Centropolis to not appreciate a place like Mozza. 

The portions are more than generous and the pizzas are perfectly cooked. If you are a fan of Italian food - NOT fusion Italian but actual simple, fresh Italian food- than you go to Mozza. 16$ for a plate of pasta that size and 15-20$ for a family pizza with fresh toppings, but so fresh you can taste it, is not a very expensive price to pay. I've been to Mozza on as many Saturdays as Tuesdays and the quality of food doesn't change. 

The alcohol and the deserts are pricey but you haven't tasted a nutella calzone like the one you do at Mozza. 

If you're not into restaurant experiences that revolve around the waiter  presenting you with a bottle of sparkling water like it was an aged fine wine...then youll enjoy this place. It's good, fresh food at the best value I've seen in Montreal OR Laval....even if I seem to be the only one who says so on Yelp.
