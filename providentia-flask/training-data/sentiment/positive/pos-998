Dimmi's has existed in Yorkville for 18 years and is a remembrance of times past.  The restaurant is closing down for a month or so in January to under go a complete refurbishment and redesign.  It should look fabulous, but get there before the closing to enjoy the kind of dining sadly missing from the majority of Yorkville establishments.  

This is a bar and trattoria that welcomes you with open arms and hugs you with delicious, well priced food.  It reminds me of the restaurants scattered through the hill towns of Italy where you feel you have been invited into someone's home.  Raymond, the charming owner and manager, is always there, welcoming you, seating you, suggesting dishes, whisking away empty plates, answering the phone; a whirling dervish making sure everyone is happy.  He obviously loves what he does.  The rest of the staff emulates their leader, working hard, but with that warmth which is an integral part of Dimmi's.  

The food is delicious.  This is not precious dining.  Everything is hearty, filling and satisfying.  Appetizers from the ubiquitous Caprese Salad to the grilled octopus are great.  Pastas are cooked al dente, with home made sauces and all are bread dipping good.  Dimmi's offers a variety of thin crust pizzas and they are perfect for take out.  Prices are unbelievably reasonable for chic Yorkville.

While other Yorkville dining locations greet you with their noses ten feet in the air and leave you with a check costing hundreds of dollars, Dimmi's envelops you in warmth and leaves you with a smile on your face.
