The food was out of this world, knock your socks off good.  A fabulous addition to the Cleveland restaurant scene.  Drinks were creative and delicious too.  Cool space as well.  

Stopped back in at the Plum for dinner again tonight and had the food was even better than I remember - beef tartare was excellent, stuff poblano, fried chicken was perfectly cooked and more than enough for two people.  Really love this place.
