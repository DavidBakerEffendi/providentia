Such a nice place to come to with a big group! We came with 13 girls and no reservation. They were able to sit us almost right away and service was outstanding! We came for a birthday dinner and Pizzeria Bianco went above and beyond to make our experience amazing. Complementary mozzarella for the whole table and then a birthday dessert to finish up. Rolando and Adam took great care of us! We'll be back!
