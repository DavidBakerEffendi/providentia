My new favourite sushi place in Calgary. I've been here three times and have had nothing that hasn't impressed me. First and foremost: Rice is perfect. With that rice the chef makes inestimable nigiri (PLEASE try the "unagi surprise," you won't be disappointed, and the cajun prawn is incredible with big luscious lumps of prawn that could pass for lobster) and delicious, creative rolls too, especially in my experience what they call the "flames roll." Service is very sweet. LOVE this place.
