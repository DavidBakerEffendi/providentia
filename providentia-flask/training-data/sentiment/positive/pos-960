This place is a God send! However, their hours are short and they run out of their delicious treats fast! 

The rocky road, ehhem, GLUTEN-FREE brownie is phenomenal, even for the people not worried about that stuff! I crave it and can eat all the gluten in the world.... check the other reviews. Haha 

The caramel brownie is also delish, but not as much as the rocky road one.
