Early Saturday Morning, Trying to figure out what to eat, didn't feel like going to Ihop, then turned down 32nd street going north and my friend told me about this place called The Farm. We pulled up the long drive way, past a wedding reception that was getting set up under a huge vine covered canopy. The place took my breath away, large flowers shot from everywhere. We went into the outdoor seating area and were pleasantly surprised--there were lots of young couples, all savoring the last of our beautiful spring weather before it gets too hot. We sat under the Mesquite trees and I had one of the best cups of fresh squeezed orange juice, I then dug in to my favorite--Eggs Benedict, and savored the ever so thinly sliced smoked ham, that it almost tasted like Prusccioto! An elderly woman, was so overtaken by the joy around her that she smiled at me in her cool shades and exclaimed as she sat down, "oh it looks so good!" To which I of course replied and confirmed it was the best Benedict I had eaten in a while. Too bad it will be hot soon and I won't be able to sit on that beautiful area....There was a small chicken coup, and a small art studio there with amateur art--still it was nice to walk about in the Pecan trees and feel a little heritage our valley has so quickly traded for cookie-cutters and those awful subdivisions.
