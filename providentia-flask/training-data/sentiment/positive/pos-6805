This place is AMAZING.  I'm obsessed with the kale salad and the filet.  Desserts are great too.  
The staff here is THE NEXT LEVEL.  
The first time I went here I was eating at a restaurant for the first time after a very strict diet due to being in treatment for disease.  I misunderstood the menu item I ordered and when it appeared I knew I couldn't eat it. 
 I HATE a-holes that send back exactly what they ordered, but I didn't want to risk my health progress or getting really sick in public.  SO... I just told the waitress (in a few words) my situation and she helped me special order something, no charge for what I sent back.  I seriously was mortified sending it back and she made me feel a lot better.  
Since then I have frequented and I'm happy to order whatever I want.  It's all really delicious.  Even when they are super busy you get great service.  I can't say enough about this place, please go and experience it for yourself!!!
