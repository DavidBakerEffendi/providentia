Went last night and all the employees were so friendly! My dog and I went drive they and of course they fell in love with her (duh), but what I thought was so cool was they offered to give her a dog treat!!! I had no idea they would even have that?!?! It wasn't a chicken thing or anything, but an actual box of some kind of hard crunchy dog treats. I thought that was so cool and so sweet for them to offer it to her. So on top of already good food and good values and service, they treated my dog with good customer service. My dog is my life so I really liked that!
