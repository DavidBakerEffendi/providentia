OMG!!! CAn I say that this place is just fabulous fabulous fabulous!!!!! I love it!!!  First of all I went there with a friend and she said that you will love it and I am just going to order you drinks and food and just trust me!  I did it and I am so glad that I did!  She ordered me "the pink drink" and it was amazing!  I mean I got a buzz off of it...maybe because I had not eaten anything all day and I was saving up for this great meal!  I finished it and it was on to the next one...and she ordered me a "maid in mexico" at this point I felt amazing!  We had the potato fritters and the soft pretzels with the cheese fondue!  I could have just eatne that!!!  OMG!!!  I did not want these appetizers to end...I told my friend that we just needed to order those again for the rest of our meal!!  She was like no you have to try the jambalaya!  I gave in of course...I was feeling too great from the drinks to argue and I love spicy food!  They brought the jambalaya out and I was in heaven!  I was spicy...spicy...and spicy!!! YUM YUM YUM!! I wish that it would not end!  It was so flavorful and delicious and I literally licked the bowl clean!  I also had another "maid in mexico"....then we split the peanut butter cup and gelato!!! OMG!! I wish this place was closer but its right downtown and it is in such a great location and its perfect!  Our server was awesome and just kept it so fun and fabulous the whole night! I will be back and I want this to become a regular place for me!  This is great for a date or for a group of friends!  I love it and I would recommend it to everyone!
