I had to try this place a second time because I thought my first time was too good to be true. A friend recommended this place and he eats here all the time so I had to why on earth is he always here. I love me some red meat so I picked the steak kabob with salad and potatoes because come on, potato is life. 
I had a long day at work and was going to cook but decided on a whim to stop by here because it's a healthy option to eat out. I got the same thing again and what on earth. I had to stop eating just now to type this. The food is delicious. Carry out service was excellent and everything was prompt, professional, and to the T! I'd definitely recommend this place :) I'm only sad it's across the street from me and I'll be spending a lot of my money here haha
