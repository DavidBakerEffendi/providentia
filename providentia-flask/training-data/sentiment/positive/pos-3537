Saw Big Pete Pearson at Janey's in Cave Creek on Friday night. Really nice setting, great wine, beer and coffee/tea selections. Their patio is really beautiful - you are sitting in the desert with huge boulders watching a band and enjoying our cool nights with a couple of outdoor fires. Very comfortable, reasonable cover for the quality of the band. Big Pete was really fun to listen to. We will be back soon and bring our friends and family!
