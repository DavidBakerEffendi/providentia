Wow, has it only been two years since Bradly and his Beef Shack have been open??

What can I say that already hasn't been captured by past reviews....probably not much so let me summarize the highlights.  

Great food...yes, his sandwiches (be it the beef or newly added pulled pork) are fantabulous!  Juicy, FULL of flavor and are huge!  The choice of toppings are enough to provide a good selection but never too much to drown out the beefy goodness!  Remember, we're in Alberta where the cow is king!  Or would that be the "cow" is queen and the "bull" is king?  Regardless, whatever bovine is perfectly cooked and sliced and loaded onto his sandwiches is as close to perfect road food you'll ever find.

Service...yes, Bradly and his small gang never fail to impress.  They're friendly, never fail to engage in some great conversation and still keep you moving through the queue ASAP. 

It genuinely makes me happy to see a small business owner find their niche and succeed.  In our market where generic "roadhouse spork" (aka Earls, Tony Roma's, Joeys...which don't get me wrong...will fill the void) is rampant its awesome to see something unique like CowTown thrive!
