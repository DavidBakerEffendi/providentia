The food and service is great! The guy behind the counter doing food prep was generous with his samples and very personable. The lady who rang up our order couldn't have been more kind. We had gyros, grilled chicken salad (juicy chicken and a yummy sauce!) and baklava...all very delicious and very well made. Love this place!

HOWEVER: painfully slow! I'm sure that's because it's freshly made, and I'm in a hurry today, therefore I won't complain about it. Just know that our simple two person order took 25 minutes, which for a mall food court, is pretty slow. Not someplace to eat when you're on a time constraint. So come a but early and enjoy the excellent food here! We will definitely be back.  :)
