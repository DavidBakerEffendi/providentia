I'm going to have to update my review to 5 stars. I've been back here many (many. MANY.) times since my last review - so many that I don't always check in for fear my friends will see just how obsessed I am with this place - and everything has been above and beyond delicious.

The sandwiches are amazing. Try the specials. No really. They know what they are doing. This is coming from a creature of habit who usually finds one thing she likes and orders it over and over again!
