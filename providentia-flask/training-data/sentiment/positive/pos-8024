Great breakfast stop!  Good service.  The waitress said many on the wait staff have been there 5+ years...some 9+ years.  They have a good manager and the place is fast at getting food to the table even when it's busy.  And it's always busy but that's just because it's so darn good!  If there's just two people I recommend sitting at the counter to avoid the wait.  Happy eating!! :)
