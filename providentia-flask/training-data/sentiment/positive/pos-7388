Now let me first say hot dogs really aren't my thing, or more so weren't my thing. JJ's however has changed my view on hot dogs forever! This place is amazing! I stumbled upon it in the Dilworth area about a year ago. I gave it a try because of its retro theme and cute rooftop patio. I didn't realize they were famous for their dogs. 

The first dog I tried was the dirty jerz (relish, onion, mustard, sauerkraut). It had the perfect amount of toppings to dog ratio. Also the hot dogs fit the buns perfectly so you're not stuck with extra bread.  My husband got the quarter hounder (queso, bacon, lettuce, tomato and special sauce). OMG! That dog changed my life. I wanted more!!!!! 

Since our first visit my husband and I have made it a tradition to go on a walk with our dog to freedom park followed by lunch or dinner at JJ's every week. It's a family tradition I hope to keep. 

I have also had the veggie dog, which was very good! You can't really even taste the difference! If you're a meat eater I dare you to try the veggie dog once. 

My all time favorite dog has been a seasonal dog that features pimento and fried jalape√±os!! It's bomb.com! The only dog I didn't really care for was the southwestern dog, but only because the beans were over powering. 

Besides the food, the staff has always been friendly and the owner even personally thanked us for coming in. It's always been clean and we never had a bad experience and we have been there 10+ times. I don't think enough people in Charlotte give this place a try or enough credit- but they NEED to!!!

We love JJ's!!!!
