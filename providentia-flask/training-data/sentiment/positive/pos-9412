I love Rock Lobster. From the moment you walk in, all the servers and bartenders, everyone is so friendly and makes you feel welcome. The lobster caesar is an amazing drink, and the food is delicious. I recommend the lobster roll, the lobster poutine and the lobster caesar. You can't go wrong with the lobster. Oh! And ask for the biscuits. They aren't always on the menu, but they are delicious, with cheddar and butter. Yum.
