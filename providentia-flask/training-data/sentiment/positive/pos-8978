Bravo is an excellent upscale Italian chain with a new location at Summit Mall. This is the fourth location in NE Ohio, with other locations in Canton, Woodmere, and Mentor. I've been to the Woodmere location as well and this location is smaller. There was a pretty sizable crowd for a Wednesday night. Our waitress was very friendly and personable, which always adds to the dining experience. You are given a complimentary serving of bread with olive oil. The bread was excellent, as it usually is at Italian restaurants. We also got a calamari appetizer. It was really good. It came with two sauces, marinara and aioli. I wasn't really sure what was in the aioli sauce. Of the two, I preferred the marinara sauce, but the aioli wasn't bad. For my entree, I got the orzotto with mushrooms and prosciutto. It was excellent. I loved the hearty mushroom flavor, which dominated the dish. The parmesan and the boursin cheeses just added to it. Overall, if you're looking for a good place to eat in the Fairlawn area, head over to Bravo. You won't be disappointed.
