SushiSamba...... where do we start????   Ok, lets start with the first thing that was delivered... its my neverfail when I go for sushi....  Spicy Tuna Roll....   even if the tuna isnt the highest of quality somewhere, the spicy tuna roll isnt half bad because of the spicy mayo.....   ok...   Sushi Samba Version is HANDS DOWN THE ABSOLUTE BEST SPICY TUNA ROLL I HAVE EVER HAD..   woah, time to calm down about it....  The sushi roll literally melted in my mouth, the tuna was uber fresh, the spicy mayo was applied in moderation let his presence be known....   this thing was absolute perfection....  Everything else we ordered was great, not to the perfection level of the spicy tuna roll, but it was still GREAT.  Wayyyyy better than good.  Had some yellowtail roll, oh yeah a $36 Kobe Beef sashimi roll with some deliciousness baked into it, JUMBO Shrimp - straight from the ocean fresh...   Some Japanese beer, some of this some of that, an hour later and $200 tab we emerged with smiles from ear to ear....   I had always heard good things about the place, but until I experienced it for myself, could never truly know how great it actually is.  I will be going back shortly, even if its only to order the spicy tuna roll...   I would trust that everything they have there would be to the quality in which i encountered in my meal.... Fear Not Yelpers... this place will treat you right....
