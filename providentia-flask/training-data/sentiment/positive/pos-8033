It's really hard for me to find a philly cheesesteak that I like, much less love. But Geno's got me hooked. With their fresh, piping hot, cheesy extra onion n' pepper cheesesteak, it was nothing less than spectacular. It melted in my hands and mouth.

I usually imagine a soggy, tasteless, sandwich like Charlie's, but this place is quite the opposite. The bread was crisp and crunchy, meat was plentiful, and veggies were flavorful. Good presentation, should have taken a picture but I wolfed that mother down. Staff was friendly, and place was clean and stocked. Kinda strange I was the only person there at the time, but it was like 3 in the afternoon. Job well done.
