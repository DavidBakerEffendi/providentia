Hey all! I wanted to write in because my hubby and I moved close by 32 Shea and just love it - the food, wine, the dark but cozy atmosphere and even the service. I don't understand the reviews that go on about the servers having poor attitudes. We've never felt a negative vibe. On the contrary, the servers and owner know our names and even our baby's name. It's so great to have a place that's not the typical chain in your neighborhood. I recommend 32 for sure!
