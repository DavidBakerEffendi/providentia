I've eaten here for breakfast a few times now. Always made fresh to order, which in turn does take some time, but they will customize as much as possible (ie egg whites, double hash browns, bacon instead of chorizo). Amazing food. Decent wine selection for lunch/dinner options. And they ALWAYS have their smoker going = fresh delicious pork!
