By far THE BEST crepé's I have ever had.
I remember, before leaving Las Vegas, a girlfriend of mine insisted we make a stop over at the Paris for brunch and I'm forever grateful for her introducing La Creperié to me. 
I had the D'Anjou - a pear,  with caramel, almond paste, whipped cream and walnus. Pretty much a heaven treat in your mouth, chased by some refreshing, Organina. 

They have plethora of choices to choose from though to lure anyones taste buds in. Shrimp and hollandaise sauce, Nutella and almonds, etc. You won't be disappointed.
