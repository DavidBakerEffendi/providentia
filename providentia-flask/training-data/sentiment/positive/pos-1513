I remember eating here with a friend several years ago, and discovered it again while looking for an Indian buffet in my work area. Just know that it's BEHIND the Audio Express, so that's your landmark to find it. Just got in from the lunch buffet ($9.95 +tax, water only).
Absolutely scrumptious! It's one of those things like "if exotic love had a flavor."
I tried a little of everything, like I always do with buffets, and everything was nice and I repeated my sampling with the next plate. Service was spot on, and the atmosphere was quiet and calm. Perhaps it's more bustling around noon, but I arrived a little after 1pm. I was sufficiently full after 2 plates, and I don't think I'll need dinner except a beer. So glad to find this place again, I could eat at my own pace yet be back at work within the hour. 

INSIDE SKINNY: Chutneys! Good with your naan. 
Also there's a mango yogurt drink (lassi) on ice if you like that.
I didn't try it because I don't like yogurt.
