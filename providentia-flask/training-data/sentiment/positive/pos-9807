Absolutely incredible Indian food.  Definitely recommend the masala dosa, which is slightly cooler than most of the other spicy food and is good to have around to temper your mouth-fire.  We also had the samosa chaat, lamb vindaloo (FIRE!!!), chicken biryani hyderabadi, and chaat masala.  Make sure you order naan - you'll need it to sop up the awesome curry sauces and to put on your burning tongue like an ice-pack.  For dessert, we had the kala jamun and mango kulfi, both of which were icy in sensation and great after the burning meal.  Song of Fire and Ice, anyone?

They also serve cocktails, which will shore up your courage and make it so you're slightly less apprehensive about eating what you know is going to be authentic Indian spiciness.

I'm not even sure of the ingredients of half of what we ate, but it was all delicious, and we devoured it.  I recommend coming here with friends as you can order family-style and try even more dishes. 

This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  We'll definitely return!
