I love this place!  I have dined here three times and each time the food and service has been great.  The 'salmon lovers' sushi rolls are so tasty!!  I tried so many dishes here - the udon noodles have a kick to them and are very tasty, salmon sashimi salad was good, salmon natu - it's got a bunch of things in a small bowl -salmon with sauce, cucumber, pickled radish, avocado, quail egg - you mix it up and wrap it in dried sea weed ...delicious flavours!!  I enjoyed the unagi on rice and of course the butter kalamari.  The atmosphere is very hip, it's open concept, rustic looking and they play a nice mix of music.  This place is definitely worth checking out..great food, service and reasonable prices and portions..enjoy!
