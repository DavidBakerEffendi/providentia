That a place so awesome is so far from civilization is literally the least fair scenario I've encountered in quite some time! Salad & Go lives up to its name--it's a fast food spot centered around greens--and lots of them. And while it's a bummer there's only outside seating, it's still one of my new favorite places to grab dinner. 

I started off with a salad that had goat cheese, strawberries, and sweet potatoes. It was HEAVY. Really packed with some good stuff--none of that iceberg lettuce crap you'll see elsewhere. Paired with a vinaigrette, every bite was bursting with flavor. Although I'm not a vegetarian, I added the mock chicken, a choice of several proteins to the mix, and it did not disappoint. 

And because I'm a glutton who tries several items before reviewing a spot, I had to load up on beverages as well. The kale-banana smoothie is already one of my faves. I love how it's not so loaded with sugar, and the strong ginger flavor really shines. The cucumber-mint lemonade is good, and tastes so much like a mojito I wanted to spike it with some rum! 

Finally, I've gotta point out that a lot of diners complain about healthy food being expensive. At less than $6 (before adding protein), this is dirt cheap! I'll be back to try some of the leaner salads, and even some of the richer salads, like the Southwest Caesar. I may even add chicken and get it as a wrap, an option for all items. 

This isn't your average salad bar, so give it a try!
