Yuuuuuuummmmm!!!!  Service here is slow, like the reviews mention, but staff is friendly and the place is nice. 

The food is well worth the wait with amazing sandwiches and yummy burgers. They even have homemade ketchup for the bucket of fries you get with your meal! The beef dip sandwich is amazing, with toasted buttery bread and slices of perfectly cooked beef and delicious beef gravy on the side. I'll definitely be coming back (and probably to order the same beef dip sandwich). 

They have 5$ beer specials all week and then specials for food every day of the week as well! Mostly rotating local brews!
