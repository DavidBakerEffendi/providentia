My favourite place to go for brunch on a Saturday! Their buttermilk fried chicken is worth the 20 minute wait. I've tried their fried chicken on waffles with red pepper jelly (which is to die for) and their buttermilk fried chicken main with scallion biscuits. Personally, I thought their biscuits were absolutely amazing, savoury and delicious, and I would order it with a side of the red jelly since it compliments the chicken so well! If you like super crispy and satisfying fried chicken, I would highly recommend this place!
