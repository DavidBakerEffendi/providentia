I am going to start by saying it has been maybe 7 years since i have been to a Fridays. This time there were 5 of us and it was one of the most wonderful experiences we have ever had.
It was a Sunday and my Godson's First Communion Day.  So we came here after Church.
We were greeted right by a wonderful man, who right away acknowledged my Godson as to his First Communion.  ( he could tell from the Outfit).
Our Server was incredible! His name was Seth. Seth made sure we had an incredible time and we did.
Our drinks were brought out immediately and he explained all the questions that my sister had about the menu.  
He made a fuss of Caleb(The Boy's special day)
Our food was amazing!! Friday's has really changed it up.
We started with appetizers.  We had Fried Green beans, Boneless Chicken wings, and Potato skins.  They were all incredible.
I had for the dinner, Salmon with Langustos, and the rest of the family had Steak, shrimp and Ribs. They all said they were fantastic!
Our wonderful server Seth even got Caleb any dessert of his choice. We all got a dessert and they were Great! We had a wonderful time and the Food , the service, and the atmosphere were lovely.
Even the restrooms were clean and lots of parking.
