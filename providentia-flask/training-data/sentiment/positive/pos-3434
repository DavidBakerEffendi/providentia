I decided to give this location another try today.  I had a completely different experience from the first time I ordered from there.  Once again I ordered online and picked up my order to go.  The woman who waited on me this time was very nice and when I arrived my order wasn't ready yet so she asked me if I would like a water or drink.  I said yes to the drink and handed her my card to pay for it.  She said oh no, it's on me.  I thought that was a very nice touch since I needed to wait for my food to be finished.  I'm so happy with this experience considering how bad of a first impression I had with this place.  I ordered the veggie fried rice in the small size and the portion was still really big.  The food was delicious.
