Best Italian restaurant I have been too hands down!
The food was impeccable, the scenery is gorgeous and my drink was fantastic! Don't forget to order the desert!!!! After you try the chocolate cake you wont want to order cake from another restaurant again! Service was amazing and they were packed!!!!! If you haven't tried Italian Restaurant, you need to!
