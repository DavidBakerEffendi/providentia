Have not been here in years..... wanted to try something new and we were not disappointed.  Miso sea bass was excellent as well as the nine piece sashimi.  The taquitos were to die for!!!!!  I wish I had more.  Hayes the Director of Hospitality was extremely attentive and Alex our server made it a wonderful experience.  If you are local it is right at the entrance to the parking so you can get in and out quickly and can avoid all the strip traffic.  Sake for days!! My wife says bring a sweater, their A/C is on!!!
Great dinner guys
