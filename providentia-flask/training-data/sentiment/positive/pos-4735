i love me a good sandwich. and jimmy johns delivers. you can really taste the freshness of the ingredients. soft bread, fresh lettuce and tomato, and perfectly sliced meats. makes me drool when i think about it. i've only had it through catering so i dont know how long they take at the shop. but i hope the have better timing than cappriotti's. even when you call in an order they dont have it ready.. anyhoo.. this place is great so go try it!
