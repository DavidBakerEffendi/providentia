I love Songbird, like "will you marry me" love.

It reminds me of some of my favorite coffee places back in Boulder CO.  It is the type of place you can just get the beverage of your choice, maybe a snack and hang out.  I enjoyed that you can sit and have a conversation with someone without feeling like you're interrupting everyones work.

Songbird is active in the community as well.  They sponsored our Neighborhood for nextdoor.com and have been active in helping it grow.

Make sure you try the Thai Tea, it's so good.
