I really like the place. Good food, good drinks, and awesome atmosphere. The outside patio is super European -like and coming from Europe it is always super relaxing and pleasant to eat or enjoy a drink outside. The inside is nicely decorated too, so I never really mind if we end up I side. A big plus is that there is a separate room with a big table that is good for larger reservations for special occasions. 
Their drinks are awesome and there's a large selection of cocktails. The food is good too. Another plus is the location - it's inside the gvr which is close to my house and there is plenty of stuff to do after dinner.
