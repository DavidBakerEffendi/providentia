People Dedicated to Quality... The name says it all. This fast food joint is truly awesome. Their kitchen is very open and clean, the dining area is large and spacious. The use of colors and lighting makes for a very friendly environment. 

I've had my fair share of chicken fingers and this place stands alone. Their chicken fingers are amazing! You can tell they use good quality chicken. They hand bread their chicken in a flour mixture. Their fries are hand cut too! I've been there three times and have had three different items off the menu. No matter what I've had, it's been great. 

Now I do not eat fructose, so eating out is always difficult, but here they cater to everyone! I've had the chicken sandwich wrapped in lettuce... let me tell you how tasty and moist that chicken was. Not only that, but I swear they use Claussen pickle chips, if not they use a great knockoff. 

Today I had the grilled turkey lettuce wrapped with no sauce... amazing again! The people are friendly and my husband loves this place way more than canes or anywhere we've had fingers. 

His favorite part is the sauces and the fresh squeezed lemonade. He's had most of the sauces and here is the kicker, they'll give you extras at no additional cost!

Not only that, but they have Frank's hot sauce and malt vinegar if you're feeling adventurous. 

The coke machine is nice and they have water for those not into sodas. 

Give this place a try!
