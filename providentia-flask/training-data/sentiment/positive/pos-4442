I finally made it to Futo Buta for dinner, and it was indeed as amazing as others have indicated!  

Getting there - Unless you're walking down the rail trail, you are not going to stumble upon Futo Buta.  The address puts it on Bland Street - this is not accurate for driving purposes.  It's hidden from the main road (South Blvd.) behind Crispy Crepe.  Fortunately, there is a parking garage between Crispy Crepe and Futo Buta - but, you need to know where you're going, because you still won't see the restaurant before pulling in the garage.  It's a bit hard to find, but well worth the effort. 

The venue - Futo Buta is small - I can see why there is often a wait to get in here.  (We went at 6ish on Tuesday and had no wait.)   There is a bar that seats maybe 8 - 10 people and then several communal tables and a very few private tables.  Even though you'll be sitting close to others, it has a distinctly romantic/intimate feel.  This is not a kid-friendly venue - it's really ideal for you and one other person.  

The menu - YUM!  You have a selection of high-end sushi options, several appetizers and maybe 7 different types of ramen.  We started with the rice crispy square - which was blocks of crispy fried rice and a jar of spicy tuna served with wasabi soy.  Quite tasty.  We then had the Miso (Hungry) and Fire & Ice ramens.  The flavors were rich and warming.  We also had a flight of sake - the bartender was incredibly well-versed on the sake options and could help steer a pro or a novice.

Overall, Futo Buta delivered on every count. I came in with high expectations that were exceeded!
