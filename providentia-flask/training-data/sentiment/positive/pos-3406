Pretty awesome concept.  When you first walk in there a whole bunch of games you can purchase.  Toward the back there is the sitting g area where you can order drinks and food and then there's an entire wall of board games to pick from so you can play when you eat and drink. 

There a $5 standard cover per person when you come in to sit down and play games,  that lasts the entire time you're at the place. They also have "game experts"  around that can help you look for things or help you if you're confused about rules and whatnot. 

I only had a flat white which was pretty good,  but I'd imagine most people come here for the games.  it's a really cool and unique idea you don't see too often.
