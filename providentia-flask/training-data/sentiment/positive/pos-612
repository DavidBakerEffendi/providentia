We have been to Fuddruckers off and on for years! They have the best burgers and I am pretty sure it's because all the burgers are fresh and cooked to order at time of order.

Fresh food is king!

Anyways, as others have mentioned, yes it can be expensive but when your frugal like me you can make it work.

I get the 2/3 pound burger for like $8 with no fries. This thing is huge especially when you add your toppings. Cheese is like a $1 extra.

The last few times we have been there we get a coupon on the receipt for a grilled chicken sandwich, drink (Soda) and fries for $8 and my wife loves chicken sandwiches so score!

Since we go on Monday's after 4PM kids meals at this location are only like $1 and it comes with a burger, fries, drink and a cookie.

The kids burger is huge especially with toppings therefore my nine year old son is tapping out after finishing his burger.

The chicken sandwich is a good size as well with toppings so with that being said I raid my son's and wife's french fries but they don't care because they are stuffed and can't eat all the fries anyway LOL plus I share their soda.

For my family, everything mentioned above with coupon, kids meal special on a Monday after 4PM we spend less than $20 and we are completely full and satisfied until the next day.
