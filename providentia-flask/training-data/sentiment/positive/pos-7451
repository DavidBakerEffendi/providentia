My daughter and I love Chuy's! It is our go to lady's lunch location. Granted she is 4, but that can be a great compliment from a toddler. :-) The stacked enchilada is great. I like to order extra verde sauce on the side because it's so good. Queso is tasty and of course the fresh made tortillas are a treat! The kids meals come with a push pop, which while my daughter loves, she still likes the queso and tortillas best! I think it's the only restaurant in the area that comes close to authentic Tex-Mex. We moved from Texas a year ago, so it was a welcomed find!
