Can you really get fresh seafood in the middle of the desert?  You can and this Red Lobster delivers fresh hot, steamy seafood.  The lobster is prepared to perfection, not to toughness.  Those cheddar bay bisquits are worth the trip alone.  So good that I'm not even ashamed to admit that I've stashed them in my purse.  Tip: dip the bisquits in some clam chowder and wow, it's like being transformed to an oceanside eatery.  Mmmm....

The service in Phoenix is above and beyond any Red Lobster in the Bay Area and Washington, DC, my old stomping ground.   As a matter of fact, EVERYWHERE we went in Arizona, the service and hospitality was so surprising GREAT.  

No wonder so many relocate here.

Oy yes, I know, the immigration situation is an issue.  But hey, don't punish the hardworking man for trying to do right by you.
