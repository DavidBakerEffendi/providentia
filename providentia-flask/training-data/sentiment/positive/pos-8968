I rarely rate anything 5 stars, but Hogtown has a special place in my heart. The expanded menu, which was introduced in December 2011, is something to check out. Tempeh ribs are bomb. The tofu wings are a bit smelly and might irritate the neighbouring customers, but they are also delish.

And yes, they are licensed now! That means I can have a glass of wine!

The only thing that I have against this place is that they don't take reservations.
