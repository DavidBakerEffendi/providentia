My father took me out for lunch at Le Steak Frites St-Paul in Saint-Sauveur, and brought a wine with us with a re-sealable cap because it was lunchtime,
 
 We were seated by the window, it was a view of the highway, but a view none e less.  The menus are written on chalkboards, and I believe in 3 areas of the restaurant to make sure you get a good view.

  Our waiter was extremely helpful and opened the bottle of wine brought out glasses and brought out waters.  
 
  I ordered the Petite Filets St-Paul it comes with fries.  The meal came with a salad which was nicely seasoned with a light cream sauce.  There are three steak sauces ( you can ask for all three) dijon, pepper and mushroom.  

For the frites (its all you can eat) and it comes with ketchup or mayo.  
 
 The waiter had a cart and wheeled out our matching steaks.  They executed everything to perfection.  We did not take advantage of the Unlimited fries, but they were crunchy and good, I like thin cut fries, these are super- thin cut..mmm.
 
 He ordered a cappuccino to finish and it was made perfect with a sugar stick on the side. 
  
I'de say they did everything perfectly here and I am looking forward to my next visit.
