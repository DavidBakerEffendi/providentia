Stopped in for lunch today with my girl. As soon as I walked in I saw a d j booth , no phat beats and mad bass at lunch but I hear Thursday nights it's bumpin. We were sat with Jennifer and I could go on for hours so I will just say she was "the sweetest thing", so nice. I had never been in before so I was looking about and ran into Julia who took me thru the whole place and showed me the artwork, bar, the rooms, the Kimmi dolls, very unique. Thank you Julia. We ordered miso soup, pork belly and brussel sprouts like I have never had before, outstanding. Great staff, cool spot, will hit it up again.
