I stopped in for lunch while in the area and fell in love! I'm always searching for great noodle places, and this one fits the bill! I wanted to try everything on the menu, but settled for chicken chow fun noodles and a half order of fresh spring rolls. Both were amazing! I loved that the noodles came packed full of crunchy veggies-My favorite! The broccoli, sprouts, onions and bok choi were phenomenal! Even their iced tea tasted amazing! I only wished I lived closer to this gem!
