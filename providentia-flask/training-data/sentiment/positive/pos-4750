Vic transforms hot dogs into mouth-watering flavorful goodness. 
"You will never order another dog from anyone else again after the Chili Man." 

I've been going to the Chili Man for a couple of years now. I'll stop by a few times a week. Make sure to select one of Vic's specialty sauces (homemade). I like to have a combination of sauces. Mixing some of the Spicy, BBQ, and sweet sauces, you create this explosion of flavor. 

The perfect combination, order: Heroin Dog (it's on the menu!) a few of us awhile back founded the creation of that dog; its flavor became popular. You want to have Vic's homemade chili, fried cheese, Naco Sauce, a BBQ and a Sweet/mango sauce, topped with chopped onions and extra shredded cheese. I can not emphasize enough that a simple hot dog just isn't going to cut it anymore. Vic sets a new standard! 

If you like Hot Dogs, the Chili Man is the way to go! Nothing else compares.
