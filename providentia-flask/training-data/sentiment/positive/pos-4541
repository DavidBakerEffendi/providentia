My favorite authentic Japanese food in town! It's a small family owned restaurant. Love their lunch specials. They usually have two or three different lunch specials every day with generous portion at a very reasonable price. Every dish from agedashi tofu, tonkasu-don, ramen, nabeyaki udon to cold soba with tempura is simply delicious!
