I don't ever go to Olive Garden but this location was awesome!!!!! The food was amazing and the service was phenomenal, one of the best olive gardens I've ever been to :) we got the soup salad and breadsticks and split a ziti. Everything came out fast and our server was soooo nice. I didn't get her name but she has glasses and brown hair, she was absolutely perfect and super attentive :)
