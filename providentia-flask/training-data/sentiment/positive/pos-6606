My favorite place to eat in Downtown Summerlin because the food is always great and the price is very reasonable.  

The breading they use on the chicken is incredible and the meat has never been dried out.  The fries are skinny and crunchy, they give you a lot but I always eat them all.  They have sauces on all the tables and I recommend trying them all, my favorite is the chipotle honey.

They also have the best drink fountain, all sodas have the superior cane sugar and lots of flavors from classic to lime.  the drink selection is probably my favorite thing about the place.

The staff is also amazing.  They are patient and go the extra mile to make sure you get exactly what you want.  I love it when you know the staff loves their jobs.
