Right at the end of the strip past the Stratosphere on your way to downtown Las Vegas is this small hole in the wall place that everyone that loves gelato has to come and try. 

Right from the start we were greeted with a friendly smile and hello.  Their name says it all. They have some very unique flavors like roasted peanut butter and jalape√±o and red, white miso with almond toffee, and fagioli rossi. 

There was one I didn't care for which was the basil one but someone in our party did so hence there is something for everyone. 

I hardly ever write a review right there on the spot but I just had to as this was truly 5 stars all the way.
