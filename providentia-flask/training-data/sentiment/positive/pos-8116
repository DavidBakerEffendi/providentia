Jewels Bakery & Cafe is one of my daughter's favorite restaurants. She has Celiac Disease and we have been coming here for nearly four years.
I ordered the green shredded beef chili tacos. They had just the right amount of heat to them. My daughter ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and my husband ordered the Arizona omelette with home fries. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious.
We had great customer service. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient. The cafe was clean and bright. It's a nice place to come for gluten free food. The prices are reasonable. The portions are nice sized. We will definitely be returning.
