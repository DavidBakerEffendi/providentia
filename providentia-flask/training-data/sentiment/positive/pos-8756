It's a hidden gem... well, it's always packed so I guess it isn't all that hidden. I love everything about this place: the authenticity of the food, the fast pace of the servers, the four fortune cookies you get with your order. It's perfect. The shrimp pho and summer rolls are the best. Ask for hoisin sauce.
