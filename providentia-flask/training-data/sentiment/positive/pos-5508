UPDATE:  
I'm pleased to report that Mr. Ramos got in touch with me about below.    He was understanding about how I felt, and has worked to make it right.  I am pleased with the resolution.  Thank you Mr.  Ramos and family.  Keep on making awesome food!!



I'm very disappointed. I've been several times during the week and the food is awesome.  I convinced my husband and 2 young boys to come for breakfast Saturday am.  They brought my food and my husbands.  We had to eat while the kids watched.  Then my oldest sons came and he ate.  My youngest son just sat there watching us eat.  When they finally brought it,  the eggs were cooked wrong.  Instead of leaving my kid something to eat like the croissant and bacon they took it all away and we had to wait another 5-10 min for his food to come.  When it finally came we were all done.  She came and cleared our plates and said have a nice day, after he had just gotten his food.  I would not have minded waiting for mine, but my kids should have been served first if it needed to be staggered.  Probably won't be coming back with my family again.  It just was not a good experience.
