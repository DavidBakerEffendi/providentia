I recently moved from Tucson and had a local coffee shop I loved. Didn't think I would find somewhere in Surprise that could measure up, but I was wrong!
I love around the corner from Sunsational Coffee and decided to give it a try. I ordered a chai tea. Great spice and really tasty. They also have a pretty large menu with breakfast and lunch items. We will be going back for a meal soon. 
The staff was wonderfully friendly and helped me with the menu (as it was my first time). Great experience all around.
