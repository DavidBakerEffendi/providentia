Most Indian restaurants I've been to have tended to look a little run down.  I don't know why this is, perhaps most of the emphasis is usually placed on the food.  

Origin India breaks that mold by having a snazzy, modern dining area and delicious Indian entrees!   Oh and it's got a great location too, right across from the Hard Rock, not far from the strip.  

Best Indian in Sin City.
