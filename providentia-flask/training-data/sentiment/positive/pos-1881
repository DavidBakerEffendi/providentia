The dining area is really cramped and awkwardly laid out. There's no counter or booths, or any view of the kitchen or prep area. So it's not your typical diner atmosphere, and every once in a while you're elbows will get bumped by a server trying to pass. But it really isn't that much of a deterrent, as the breakfast itself was delicious. I ordered a broccoli and cheese omelet, and for no charge I was able to add an extra egg. Who said nothing in life is free? The broccoli was actually seasoned and fresh, and the Russian rye toast was different then standard rye and tasted like pumpernickel. My wife's poached eggs were done perfectly and the staff was friendly and fast. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a cheap, good breakfast spot in Bellevue.
