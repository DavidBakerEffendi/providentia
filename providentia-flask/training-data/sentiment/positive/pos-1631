Chili man is a must try and deserves every bit of its #1 ranking on Yelp. Not only do you get amazing hotdogs with made from scratch chili and sauces but Vic also provides entertainment with all of his stories. You'll never be bored waiting in line for a hotdog with him behind the grill. Initially I went down the build your own route which was fine but Vic's recommended hot dogs are the way to go. The Life Changer is a definite life changer and the Frito Pie is another great one. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook to find out where he will be.
