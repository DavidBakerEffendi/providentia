I've tried 97.8% of all Ramen spots in Vegas. That being said, this is sure a top contender in the valley.

Tan Tan Men: Fukumimi's is still the best in town.

Karage: BEST IN TOWN!

Gyoza: has a nice crunchy layer underneath, and will give 4.5/5

Tonkatusu ramen: 4/5, not the best i've had in town, but still VERY delicious. Not too heavy.

Spicy miso: 2nd best in town (Ramen Tatsu's #1).

Garlic fried rice: SO DAMN GOOD! Has a smoky undertone, which makes it amazing.

Customer service: as good as you'd want.

Overall: 5/5, i put it in the top 3 best spots in town for ramen/side dishes!
