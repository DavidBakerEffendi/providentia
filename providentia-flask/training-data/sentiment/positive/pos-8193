This place has been non-stop packed since their soft opening, so they've had very little time to catch their breath. My wife and I run an Ugly Christmas Sweater Bike Bar Crawl in the Arcadia area and the Porch happens to land right in our normal path. Knowing they were still in their soft opening at this time and wouldn't necessarily be prepared to welcome 65 rowdy drinkers with the Christmas spirit (that's what we'll call our drunkenness) I decided to ask the GM if he'd be okay if we came in on short notice. He didn't hesitate and said they'd love to have us.

A few days later, we rolled in to an already jam packed place on their first Saturday afternoon and everything went off without a hitch. We got a warm welcome, great service, and a great atmosphere. Reviews so far don't do this place justice and you'd know what I mean if you got to drive by the Porch every day. It has been busy every day since it opened and it's a great addition to the Arcadia area!
