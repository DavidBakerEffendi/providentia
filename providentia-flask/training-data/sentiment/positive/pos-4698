Wildflower bread company is such a wonderful restaurant. I pop in for a quick meal fairly often as I live across the street. The ingredients are always fresh, healthy, and delicious! You order at the counter and then sit wherever you like and they bring your food out to you. The staff is always extremely polite and eager to help, which is great  to see. The restaurant is decorated with beautiful blown glass artwork by Newt Grover. The style is casual but still very nice. There is a great patio and plenty of seating indoors as well. There are fresh made breads and pastries daily that are yummy! I like to take the children I nanny here when we are headed to the train park as an alternative to the food there, as it is very conviniently located across the street. They enjoy sharing the meatballs and grilled cheese, as well as the fruit bowl. My favorite dish- the Sausage & Egg Sandwich, which has scrambled eggs, sausage, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar and cilantro on a buttered Ciabatta Roll... It's only 4.89, which is about what you might spend at a fast food restaurant on breakfast so why not stop by here and get something delicious instead?! It's always big enough for me to take half of it home too, which is wonderful to look forward to later. ;)
