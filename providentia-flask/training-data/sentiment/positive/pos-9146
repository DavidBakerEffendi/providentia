Best burrito in Vegas hands down! Great quality food, and wonderful owners . All their food is top quality angus beef and high quality ingredients . Man, I just love this place . The food is enough to share. Birthday food, straight A food too! I really love this place, but the location is a little bizarre. Wish they would be out of the gas station, but it doesn't stop me!5 Stars!!!
