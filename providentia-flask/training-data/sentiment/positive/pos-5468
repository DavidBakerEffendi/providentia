Came in for lunch since I heard such great things about this place. Sat at the bar so I wouldn't have to wait for a table. Nice atmosphere and around 11:30am the business suits started rolling in from the surrounding buildings. Great service at the bar. He suggested the chicken quinoa salad, which had more lettuce and less chicken and quinoa.  Nice healthy portion and was just enough for lunch. Will be back for dinner sometime soon!
