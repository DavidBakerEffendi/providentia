I've walked by White Brick Kitchen many times and have heard many good things about it so I was determined to try it out.  I finally came here for brunch (actually late lunch) last Saturday with my hubby and son. The restaurant is small and cozy - felt like very initimate which I liked. We wre seated immidiately which I liked. The services was friendly and prompt but not overly intrusive. I ordered the mac and cheese which I shared with my son and my husband ordered the chicken and waffle.  The mac and cheese was really tasty - there was a lot of cheesy goodness in the dish. My son loved it.  My husband's chicken and waffle looked amazing when it came out. I was jealous and wished I had order that instead. He shared some with me and it was out of this world!  I am definitely coming back and getting that!  The portions were generous as well which makes this pretty good value.  Overall we had an awesome brunch experiences and and we willbe back soon!
