I'm a big fan of quiznos and always get the same thing every single time... regular size classic club, medium pop, and a cookie :) I love the fact that you can watch them make your food, and they're fast, attentive and nice! I also liked the fact that they had tables and chairs outside, so i didn't have to leave my dog in the truck and she got to come sit outside with us. Too bad this quiznos is far from our house, but if it was closer I'd come here more often...
