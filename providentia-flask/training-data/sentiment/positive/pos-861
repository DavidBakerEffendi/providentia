Get ready to taste some of the best Northern Indian food in the CLE area.  Be prepared, and know that they aren't really set up to dine in.  They are more or less a carry out place.  The good news is that they will deliver.  If you're in a jam, they can accommodate a few guests at some small tables, but I'd recommend the other options.  The are VERY nice people and will put the heat level wherever you are comfortable.  I could go on and on, but the other reviewers have summed it up pretty well.  Thanks to all you Yelpers out there.  Another great recommendation from the community.  Cheers.
