When I started my new job, the company took us here as a welcome aboard/ice breaking night and it was so fun! We had our own 2 tee slots up top in the building, and we had drinks and snacks. The food was awesome-hummus platters, chips and guacamole, sandwiches and pasta.  The drinks were awesome, and the wait staff were super friendly.

There was a gold pro helping us with our swing and aim.  It was very high tech and we were able to keep score and see what we were doin wrong and right.  It was extremely fun, and since work paid I am not sure what the price range was.  But all in all it was very fun and friendly atmosphere!
