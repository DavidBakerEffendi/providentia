I've been coming here for couple of years now and the food here is consistent. All the vegetables are fresh. I like that they offer more choices of toppings and sauces than their competitors. All the sandwiches I've tried are tasty. My current favorite is the BLT. I used to get Cuban sandwich all the time which is very good. 
I also liked the fact that the sandwiches can be kept in the fridge and it tastes just as good the next day. I just open it and toast it up.
