Molto bueno!  
I am always looking for a great Italian restaurant.  I have found some quality places in town, but they were not perfect.  I think that Gaetano's is the closest I have found to perfect in town.

I lived in Italy when I was younger; thus, I am an Italian food snob where I turn down my nose at those chain places.  

DH and I went last night.  Groupon offered a great deal, but they also have deals on their website.

I have a glass of pinot grigio, the pear and pecan salad, and gnoochi con gorgonzola.  The rate of how good an Italian restaurant is whether they have gnoochi and how good it is.  While, admittedly, my gorgonzola sauce is better, it's the best I have had in Las Vegas.  Also, the gnoochi was perfect little dumplings from heaven.

DH had the portabello mushrooms app and ravioli entree.  He enjoyed both, but said he would try a different pasta next time.  I had a tiny bit of his mushrooms and found them to be yummy.  I have to say that I completely ignored his main dish because I was too focused on my gnoochi.

While I didn't finish my gnoochi (dinner tonight!), I had a cup of cappuccino before leaving.  The taste was perfect!  

Fantastic memories of Italy were brought to mind when dinning at this fine establishment.  We will definiately be returning!

Staff was friendly.  Kept DH's drink full, offered more bread, and generally checked on us regularly.  One note for groupon users: they automatically added 18% tip on bill, which was fine with me, but FYI.
