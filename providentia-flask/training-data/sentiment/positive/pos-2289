I'm in love! The owners and employees of this shop are absolutely amazing. I went with a group of people after a friend and I found this hot spot on Yelp. The service was phenomenal, I'm pretty sure we each tried every flavor. I couldn't believe the amazing pairings, things that I would never think of trying just amazed my senses. Before I tried any, I read through the flavors and was a little intimidated, pear and blue cheese? Rose Petal? Rosemary and Extra Virgin Olive Oil? Oh my goodness, it was really hard to choose but my favorite was the Rosemary and EVOO under a scoop of Rose Petal. I savored every moment and I can't wait to go back. I've been raving to all my friends but to get my fill, I think I'm just gonna have to take them all down there myself.
