It's great! Like 8 restaurants in one place. I had the fish and shrimp, absolutely fantastic. Was having a great time with co-workers, then Hank walked in. The first thing he did was yell, "I'll have one of everything!  And a diet coke!"  I hid behind the corner so he wouldn't see me.  I peeped around and saw he was clearly intoxicated even though it was 11 in the morning.  He was swaying at the counter acting like a jerk.  They refused to serve him, because of his loud intoxicated state, but gave him a cup of water, and called a cab to take him home.  That's how great these folks are.  They called a cab for a jerk, instead of letting him drive.  From my location, peeping around the corner, I saw Hank empty the glass of water onto the floor as he sat and waited.  He pulled a bottle of Old Crow from his pocket and filled the glass.  He took one big gulp, then passed out.  His head bounced off the table and he fell to the floor.  Customers were stepping over him.  Finally the cab showed up.  I took 4 people to drag him out the door and set him in the cab.  I recommend WTF Burgers.  I do not recommend Hank.
