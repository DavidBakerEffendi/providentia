We had a great experience with outback tonight. The service was prompt and friendly. We were seated quickly and our waiter was very accommodating.  We brought in our two messy children and the waiter was very sweet he mentioned that he had children and he understood. The food was delicious as always and we will return. Hopefully next time with JUST dad and mom. 

Thank you!
