South Indian at its simple best. Well spiced with good proportions. You may get your dosa (go Tuesday night for 2-for-1) on a paper plate and serve yourself chai tea (add a good shake of sugar for the American palate), however you will know you are eating well. Ask your server what things to try and they will steer you in the right direction. Veg or Non-Veg try a little of each. Lunch time has great specials!!! No buffet Indian here, just excellently spiced dishes you never knew you loved!
