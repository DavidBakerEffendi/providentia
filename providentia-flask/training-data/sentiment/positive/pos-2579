Why 5 stars? Because this is how hot dog eating should be.

   ---   ---   ---

With fully customizable hot dogs with tons of niche toppings/condiments to choose from, every hot dog experience since Happy Dog has been ruined. 

Some of my favorite toppers are as follows:

Spaghetti O's, "Froot" Loops, Mac-n-Cheese, Andy Capp's Hot Fries, Peanut Butter, and a sunny side up egg. There are 18 freaking sauces that you can choose from as a condiment, mostly consisting of ketchups, mustards, bbq sauces, etc. 

I don't know how anyone could say that they don't like Happy Dog, unless you just don't like hot dogs in general.
