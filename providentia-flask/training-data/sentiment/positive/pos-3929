Nice decent Jamaican restaurant. Most convenient of a location. Great tasting food and I am very much appreciative of the staff members. They are very good people with delicious West Indian and Caribbean cuisine. I will recommend all to stop by and try out the roti, oxtail stew, jerk chicken, festivals. Thanks for this good food
