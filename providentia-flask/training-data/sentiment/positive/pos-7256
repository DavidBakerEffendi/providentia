Top notch Korean fried chicken.  The outside was crispy and light, the chicken moist, and the traditional Korean sauce was spicy and sweet.  There's multiple sauces to choose from so I'm looking forward to trying the others.  Also good value.  For $10 was given around 8 pieces.  Also came with the traditional side dishes - I wasn't expecting that as I thought that was just for Korean BBQ. They were excellent.  2 picked vegetables and a sweet potato salad (or regular potato salad with some sweet sauce).  
I will definitely try the other main courses.  Saw a hamburger steak and a katsu dish that looked good.  
Friendly employees and nice decor.
