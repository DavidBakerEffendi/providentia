Every time I'm in South End I have to stop at Living Kitchen. The food is amazing, fresh, and most importantly vegan/vegetarian friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed, the decor is clean and modern. The staff is friendly but you won't find them lingering at your table (which is a good thing IMO) My favorites are the Pura Vida juice (orange, apple, lemon, carrot), Living Burrito, & Rawco Taco Salad (its spicy but not unbearable). On my last visit I tried the Mushroom & Broccoli pizza. It was a smaller portion compared to the Living Burrito and Rawco salad but very filling and flavorful. Although I eat a primarily a plant based diet, Living Kitchen is a great lite lunch stop for anyone seeking a meal that makes you feel good and tastes great.
