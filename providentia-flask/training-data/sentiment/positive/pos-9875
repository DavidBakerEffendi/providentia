I go about once a week. The sushi is fantastic and you can't beat the lunch buffet price. Friday's at noon is a bad idea though. It's so crowded you can't get in the door and the food gets gobbled up almost as fast as they can put it out. They are usually pretty fast about getting more done though. So final word, avoid Friday lunch, but a must go for lunch any other day.
