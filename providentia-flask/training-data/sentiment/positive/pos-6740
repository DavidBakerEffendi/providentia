OMG this place is amazing!!! I am a huge fan of independent coffee shops with rustic mismatched interiors and a casual ambiance.. this place fits that description perfectly. 
After visiting the St Joseph Oratory, I was in need of a cuppa and found this place on Yelp. We decided to walk there which took about 10-15 minutes.
From the exterior, I knew I would love this place and the Yelp reviews definitely do it justice. 
We ordered goat cheese sandwich with caramelized onions and chutney, cookie dough cheesecake, tea and mocha. The mocha was delicious as was the sandwich but the cheesecake was to die for! I would go again just for that, it was perfection on a plate mmm!! The cookies and other desserts also looked delicious, need to try them all! If only it wasn't so far from home :(
