One of the top Chinese restaurants in AZ, they will serve you a Peking Duck at any time with no notice! Excellent lunch menu with a few dozen options to choose from, they specialize in hot and spicy foods but will make anything for you with no heat by request. They serve excellent fish dishes, including lobster and crab which is killed and cooked to order. Other seafood offered includes abalone, sea cucumber, squid, clams, oysters, cod, shrimp, scallops. Average dish runs about $9-$13, a whole Peking Duck is under $30. Love both the Wor Wonton and the Hot & Sour Soup, really the only weak item on the menu is the ribs appetizer which has too much sugary sauce and is pricey for the amount of ribs given. Love their Shredded Pork Schezuan Style, Baked Pork Chop With Salt & Pepper, Braised String Beans and Sizzling Plate Steak With Black Pepper (very unique, well worth trying!). They will make you Shrimp With Lobster Sauce with either brown or white sauce. Can't recommend this place highly enough even if you have to drive an hour to get there!
