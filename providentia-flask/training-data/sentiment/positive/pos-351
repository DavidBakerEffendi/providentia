Just got back from Italy and was looking for authentic Italian cuisine vs the American Italian cuisine/New York style etc etc. Have never been to a Chris Bianco restaurant because of the long waits and no reservation policy at the one downtown. When I called to get reservations for this one I was very pleased that they took reservations. Yes I do get the hype going with the simplicity of his cooking with the freshest ingredients available locally. That is simply what Italian food is about in Italy. Our son took us for Mothers Day and we all shared every course and had an exquisite 3 hour meal Italian style. Ordered each course as we went. Antipasti, a market Pizza that was heaven, Market salad, a fresh pasta dish, then the secondi, fab dessert w/coffee. The Chianti was excellent as well. This was the beginning of a new relationship with our palate and Chris Bianco's talents. Can't wait for our next rendezvous....
