Cheers semi-dive bar indeed but also a sports bar or is it a burger pit??? Actually its all three rolled into one very quaint but a total relic. It's been here as long as I can remember and unfortunately this is my first stop. While Phoenix continues to grow there are a few oldie but goodie stops this one included. It's now made it to my top list of favorite places to eat. 

Every night there is an amazingly priced special and where can you eat a meal for around $10 bucks!

First, I'd like to mention by no means am I a burger connoisseur. Truth is...I'm not into eating burgers but hands down this was the best patty melt I've had in a while! They went old school style with rye bread and this place actually makes burgers from fresh hamburger not some pre-made patty. I ordered my burger medium rare and it came exactly as such! Shoot, I can't even do that at home! 

We arrived and only a few patrons saddled up to the bar. It seemed like they all knew each other, a bit of an eclectic non-pretentious group. There were a few pool tables and a small dinning area. The bartender/server greeted us immediately and within a few minutes got us our drink order. 

Shortly after we arrived the place filled up and without hesitation the bartender was doing loops around the entire place without skipping a beat. Made my head spin really just watching her. Big kudos to her and to the cook! 

Everyone must go at least to try the patty melt if nothing these! And if you want to catch a game, there are enough TVs to go around for about 1 per person - no kidding! 

Cheers!
