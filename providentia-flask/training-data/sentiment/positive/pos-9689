Crab enchiladas? Yes, please. They are loaded with crab...real crab...not that imitation crap. Covered with grilled onions, melted cheese and red sauce, side of rice and beans... $13. Amazing. Also, the complimentary chips and salsa are bottomless, and I believe they make their own tortillas. Also I was surprised at the number of vegetarian options they had available.
