My family and I were on a weekend vacation from SoCal- my wife and I are originally from Oahu Hi - it's so hard to find Real Hawaiian style food where we live, made by real Hawaiian folks that were raised there so they know what the food is supposed to taste like- a local couple told us to come here and so we did and Wow..I'm soooo happy to have real Poke from folks that are FROM Hawaii!!! It makes such a difference! We also had local food from the restaurant part and it was super Ono!!! The good folks that work there are super nice and have real Aloha - We can't wait to come back!
