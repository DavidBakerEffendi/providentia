I have to leave a review for this location because of Anthony, the general manager. I had a company meeting and at the last minute, everyone wanted pizza. I called and spoke to him about all the things I can and can't have on the pizza, plus not being able to make up my mind on whether we should have regular soda or diet soda. Anyway, he sat on the phone patiently and took the order... which felt like a full 30 minutes of me debating with myself.

THEN, I call him back frantic because I didn't have cups for the meeting... and he went to the Walgreens next door and picked me up a bag of cups (at no extra charge). I couldn't believe he went above and beyond that way. The pizza got there at the scheduled time I asked for, along with my cups, and everyone loved their pizza. 

We'll be ordering from this location a lot now... thank you Anthony!
