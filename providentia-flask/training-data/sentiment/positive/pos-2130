Jun's is my go to place for Korean food cravings. Big portions of good food at low prices. They have the best homemade fried mandoo with filling that's mostly meat, not all bean sprouts and cabbage. 

Since they're from Hawaii, its also one of the few places you can find meat jun - thinly sliced and marinated beef, egg battered and pan fried. I guess meat jun is a Hawaii born "Korean" dish, so its hard to find on the mainland. 

I usually get the 3 meat combo plate for $10 - choice of kalbi, bulgogi, spicy pork, meat jun, BBQ chicken or spicy chicken. If you eat there you get all of the banchan sides, with take out you get a choice of 3. Their kimchee is slightly sweet and pretty spicy. My fav sides are the fried tofu, shoyu potatoes, cucumber kimchee, bean sprouts and fried zucchini. 

They're open everyday and I've always had friendly service. Everything is cooked to order with just 1 cook, so it can be a little slow if they're busy. But nothing crazy.
