Great little lunch place - nicer on the inside than it looks on the outside. Very simple menu, but the food is delicious. Not cheesy or greasy at all (in fact, there wasn't cheese on anything I ordered, and it still tasted great). 

Get at least 3 tacos, they are cheap but quite small, basically 3 bites each (for $2.50 a pop).
