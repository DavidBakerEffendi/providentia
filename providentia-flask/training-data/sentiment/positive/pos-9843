My wife and I have been 6 or 7 times.  We prefer this place over Libretto which is also nearby. 

The oven baked olives are delicious.  The beet salad is to die for.  They have Mill St in tap (even the more obscure ones like curious parrot)

The only entrees we have tried are the pizzas and we love them. I usually switch between the Margherita and the Capo.  Spicy honey on a pizza is amazing.
