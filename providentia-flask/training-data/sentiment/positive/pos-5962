Excellent pies!!! My favorites are 4 and 6. Every time we go the ingredients are super fresh and yummy. The crust is always cooked to perfection, just the perfect combination of soft and crunch. Also, the burrata is to die for!! I just wish they were a little bigger because the wait can sometimes be a little long. Totally worth it though! Best pizza in madison no doubt.
