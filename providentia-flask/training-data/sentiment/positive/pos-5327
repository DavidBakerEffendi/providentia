Yum! Haven't had Chinese food in a while but it's kind of my in-laws thing. We drove in from AZ to meet them and on our way to hotel stopped at this restaurant. The place was empty but your typical looking Chinese place. Sat down and ordered a bunch of food. Everything from pork with green beans to beef broccoli and ginger chicken. Of course they ordered way to much food but everything was great and flavorful. I'm so glad they wanted to eat here but it's someplace that they frequent while in town. Next time we're in town we'll stop by!! No pictures as the kids were hungry and I had to make plates and get sum bites in while I could.
