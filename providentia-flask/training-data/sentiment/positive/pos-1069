I've been wanting to go here since they first opened.....last year. I'm late in trying them, but better late then never. My husband surprised me today with the cutest box from French Grocery. Inside sat the most delicious coconut cake I've ever had. We both try to limit our sugar intake at night, but the cake is so good that it's worth a sleepless night. I literally cannot wait to devour the rest tomorrow so I can go and get another one or four.
