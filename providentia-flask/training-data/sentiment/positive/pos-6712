My friend from Ohio came to visit and we randomly stopped here for drinks one afternoon. SO happy we came across this place because WOW this place is tasty! Their banana coladas are to die for. Best tacos: island shrimp taco and tecate fish taco. Servers were very nice and attentive...went back the next week and had the same great service! Wanted to go to tequila tasting (last Thursday of every month) but had to work the next morning!
