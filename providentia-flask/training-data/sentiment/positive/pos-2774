I swear this is the only place that has taro-coconut or taro-Oreo or taro mixed with any other flavour.....what? Soooooooo GOOOOOOD!

Whenever I ask for these flavours at other bubble tea places, they look me at like deer in headlights! I've been pretty obsessed with bubble tea lately and I love coming here for their taro/coconut black milk tea with tapioca and grass jelly! it never disappoints! 

I always take it "to go" so haven't experienced their dine-in service yet. No matter how busy, they always try to go as quickly as possible to serve everyone. And never had any issues taking my order. They repeat the order back to you to make sure they got it correct. 

As long as my go-to bubble tea flavour stays the same I'll continue coming here!!
