OMG! 
Definately eat here! 
I ordered a delivery from EAT24.com , was a little put off by the delivery charge($5.99) but you can always find coupons for money off online so i used one of them and pretty much got it delivered for free.
Anyway, the food arrived, still hot in temperature, I ordered the Chicken Tom Khar soup (5 spicy) and the basil sauce with beef (5 spicy) and it was AMAZING! The best asian food ive had in vegas.
The soup was perfect, the right amount for one person and the right amount of spiciness.
The basil beef was amazing. The quality of the beef is superb,no fat at all and amazing taste and spicyness just right. 100% recommend this place and probably, will not eat asian food from anywhere else from now on.

For the quality of food, id even say the delivery charge is feasable.
