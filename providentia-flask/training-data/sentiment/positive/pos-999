Quality of the food was good enough for the money I spend. Considering it was a large order and the staff did not mess it up was good enough for 5 stars. Tried the General Tso's chicken for first time. It was good but I wouldn't say I prefer it over sweet fire chicken. Restaurant was clean and staffs were kind and attentive.
