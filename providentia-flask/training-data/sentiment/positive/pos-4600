Okay, I'm from NY.  This place is mere blocks from my house, and I've never been there before.  That will shortly be rectified.  Simply put, the best pizza I've had in Scottsdale.  Or in Phoenix.  Or in Arizona.  Hell, the best I've had west of the Poconos (I'd say west of the Hudson River, but there are some REALLY good pizza joints in Jersey).  Can't wait to try their Pananis.  I just keep saying to myself WHY haven't I known of this place before.   All that lost time.  Sigh.
