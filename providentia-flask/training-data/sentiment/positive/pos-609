i absolutely LOVE this hotel.  it's got food and shopping, two of Vegas prime, down pat.  you should stay at the Venezia Towers cuz it's newer and got its own pool.  even though there are only two beds you can EASILY fit like 12 people in a room cuz they have a pull out couch.  Split the costs and it's like $30 per person a night. Worth it!
