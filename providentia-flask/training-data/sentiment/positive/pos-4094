The husband and I went to Pita Jungle last night at approximately 6:30. I was very hungry, perhaps on the verge of hangry (a dramatic form of hunger) and so we promptly ordered an appetizer ( large hummus trio, to be specific). In my amazement, the large platter was set before me only seconds after I ordered. It was like magic. It was brilliant. It was faster than any fast food service I have ever received. The platter was visually appealing with a green hummus (cilantro), a red hummus (red pepper) and yellow (normal hummus).  I also ordered steam vegetables - partly to be healthy, and also partly for additional dipping options. I've never been to a place the supplied a good pita bread to hummus ratio - you always need an extra pita.  But, the carrots especially made a good hummus-to-mouth shoveling vehicle. 

That is the only problem I have with Pita Jungle though, I always have to order an appetizer in order to get full. And, it's not that the serving sizes are too small because the serving plates are large and completely utilized. So, I don't know, it's like how my kitchen spoons always go missing - I don't have an explanation. It's not like they ever leave the house.

Giving 5 stars for such a good service.  I've been eating at Pita Jungle for years and the food is always good, although I would probably give 4 stars if just on taste alone. But service in seconds? It's hard to beat that.  Friendly staff, outdoor seating, and wine help seal the deal.
