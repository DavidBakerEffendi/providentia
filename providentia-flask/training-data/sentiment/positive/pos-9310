A huge win for the NW corner of Tatum and Shea.

I was able to enjoy this restaurant during their soft opening and it's a Wow! Awesome decor, food, drink and service. They put a lot of effort (and $!) into creating a great space from the bar to the kitchen to the wine racks.

They've got some nice house cocktails to get you started and a good variety on the menu, from goat cheese bruschetta and ahi poke on the appetizers, to a tomahawk steak and nice looking salads.

I'm looking forward to coming back many more times.
