Located just past the Wynn Buffet, the Terrace Pointe Cafe offers up a modern take on classic American dishes. With entrees in the $10-25 range, it's a welcome alternative to higher priced dining options but still manages to keep some of the upscale charm that you'd expect from the Wynn brand.

You'll be given the choice of indoor or outdoor seating upon arrival. The outdoor seating overlooks the beautifully laid out Wynn pools. There's a lengthier wait time for outdoor seating, but you'll enjoy the laid back vibe of the pool scene. You'll take advantage of the shade of the patio umbrellas -- so as to not toast yourself under the bright Vegas sun -- while sipping on a mid-day pitcher of sangria.

The, usually immediate, indoor seating isn't a total wash, you'll still be able to most likely enjoy the pool scene through the floor to ceiling windows; that is, if you're able to successfully fight off the rest of your party to grab the pool-facing seats.

As you'd expect, the service is top-notch. When a nearby diner asked their server if they knew if there was going to be a UFC fight that particular weekend, she quickly excused herself and informed the hostess of the inquiry. The hostess walked over to their table two minutes later and was able to confirm the details of the match up that weekend, which she gathered from a quick call to the concierge desk.
 
Good food, a great view, and service that is willing to go the extra mile for their guests -- always a five star experience in my book.
