Since moving to Arizona I have become addicted to Thai food.  There are so many choices here it's exciting to have a fantastic place move in so close to my house.  The staff here have worked in a few other Thai restaurants around the area so they have hit the ground running.  The service is fantastic.  It's the fastest place to grab a sit down lunch on this side of town with excellent food.  It's actually amazing how fast the food comes out and how delicious it is.  They have about everything you would want in a thai restaurant. The decor is very modern and clean, the soup and salad that come with lunch are always fresh, and they have great noodles dishes and curries.  They even have a new thing I have never seen before, Thai Fried Ice cream not to be confused by Mexican Restaurant fired ice cream.  It's like a hot fried donut filled with ice cream it's amazingly delicious.  If you are nearby stop in and give them a try.  They are closed from 3PM to 5PM during the day as a heads up, but not unusual for thai restaurants around here.
