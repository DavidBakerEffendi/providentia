So Good!
Thanks to Yelp I found this hidden gem right by my house. It is located in a sketchy strip mall in Chandler.
We went in on a Sunday for dinner and we were the only non-asian people in the whole place (Great sign!!).
We were quickly greeted and our drink order was taken. There were ladies making fresh dumplings right at the counter. We HAD to order some! We started with the Hot and Sour soup. I was one of the best I have ever had! It was filled with tons of veggies, tofu and egg. It had a great kick and tons of flavor.
We also ordered those fresh dumplings, we chose the pork,shrimp and chive variety. They were amazing!! Our server mixed up a special sauce for dipping that was really tasty.
After reading previous reviews we also got an order of the beef pies. The arrived screaming hot (let them cool a bit). One bite into the chewy dough and the rush of broth and tender meat enters your pie hole (pun intended) you are going to be very happy. The meat was so tender and flavorful.
We really wanted to order some noodles, they make them fresh in house, but we were so full they are going to have to wait until a return trip which I see happening in the very near future.
Go here, support these great people and enjoy amazing food!!
