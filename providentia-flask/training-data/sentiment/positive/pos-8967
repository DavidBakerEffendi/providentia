This is a really fantastic place to try a great selection of beer in a super cool atmosphere! Just stopped in for the first time last evening and had a Coffee Dark beer that was FAAAAAAABulous!!! The food menu was small but impressive and I had the Poutine Special, which hit the spot. The BarKeep was cool and well-informed and was great with popping out to the patio to check in from time to time. The interior vibe is hip and fun and The Robina Courtyard is just the most excellent, tucked away spot to hang out...they've done a stupendous job in creating a cool and unique atmosphere, not to mention, it's dog friendly!
