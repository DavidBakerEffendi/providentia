Are you kidding?  Chez Vito is a mainstay of the Mile End scene, the place where all the goodfellas pick up their steaks and roasts, their pork chops and shoulders, their scottaditi-style lamb chops, their organic birds, and their hot and sweet sausages.  Chez Vito is also an unbelievably friendly family-run establishment--so full of good old-fashioned bonhomie that the place is almost a parody of your classic old-school butcher shop.  Whole porchetta is served gratis on Saturdays, and it's especially tasty (and plentiful) when you show up early.  Oh, yeah:  they also happen to have a pretty impressive collection of taxidermy, if you're into that kinda thing.  If they carried any grass-fed meat, they'd get a 6/5.  Essential.
