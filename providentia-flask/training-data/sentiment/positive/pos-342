Stopped in on a whim on my way home from work. A simple little italian deli where everything looked delicious. The service was super friendly. I ordered a veal parm sandwich...which was very good and a large portion and was only $5.99. A large veal parm for $5.99?!?! Youve gotta be kidding me, awesome deal! I'll definitely be back to try some more of their takeout.
