Four of us had dinner at the Sonoma Grill before a show last night.
  
First a couple of notes:  1) this is an upscale establishment, but casual attire is fine and the place is very comfortable and welcoming.  2)  Ever go to a restaurant and every delivery from the bar or kitchen results in conversations ceasing so that you can juggle contents of the tabletop to accommodate everything?  Not here.  Love that. 

Now for the taste bud party:  Pear Sangria.  Nice and light and a great intro to the tapas appetizer:  two of each:  scallops (good), shrimp (nothing special), pot stickers / croquettes / pork belly w/tamarind sauce (all fantastic).  We each had a different main course.  I had the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck.  It was spectacular and a really large portion - enough to share, served over risotto cakes with mixed grilled veggies.  Hubby had the Mixed Grill and chose the kabob and mango crab cake.  He loved it and could barely finish his meal.  Veal Saltimboca was a lovely presentation, the gnudi was the draw for our gnocchi lover and report was that it was very good.  Study of Hog was the fourth meal.  Notable:  one of the 'studies' was served with pepper spatzle and topped with a quail egg.

We had to decline desert - hard to do considering they had a RumChata something-or-other.

Our server was Cindy and, although they were very busy, she tended to us as though we were guests in her home - engaging and offering information and tips on the menu and origin of the local foods, contributing greatly to the overall great dining experience which we all agreed would need to be repeated.

Oops!  Almost forgot the Amuse-bouche! - Tiny little Sonoma Grill PBJ bites served between the Sangria and Tapas...  PB was cashew and J was four berry.  Single little attention grabbers to get your focus on flavor.  Well, they were very effective, as our bouches were highly amused the entire visit!
