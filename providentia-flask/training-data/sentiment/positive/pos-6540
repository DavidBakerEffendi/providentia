Absolutely fantastic food. I've lived in the valley for 3 years and have eaten at multiple thai restaurants. This place takes the gold so far. We ordered chicken satay, spicy fried noodles, sa bai fried rice, and the thai eggplant. All were perfect with some sweet heat and really solid portions. The staff was friendly and so was the price ($33 - what?!). I'll be back!!!
