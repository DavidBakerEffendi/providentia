This is my current favorite Vegas buffet. I visited for my third time over the weekend and needed to give 'em some credit on Yelp.  Good price for the weekend lunch buffett as compared to The Wynn and Bellagio.  The quality is good and the selection is satisfying.  Make sure that you visit the very back of the buffet first where the seafood (and most expensive) items are located.  They're smart and hide it back there past all the cheap carb options. 

My only negative comment would have to be with the desserts, although this seems to be indicative of all buffets.  For some reason the desserts are just never that good.  Instead, try the gelato over some apple cobbler.
