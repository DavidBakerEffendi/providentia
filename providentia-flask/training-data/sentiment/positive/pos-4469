So I was just yelping around for Oyster bars in the hotel room with my boyfriend and happen to come across this, WITH happy hour and that was when I knew we have to go try. Happy hour starts 3pm-6pm. $1 Oysters, $3 pint draft beers and 2 for 1 cocktails of the day. Oysters came with 3 difference sauces, horseradish, cocktail sauce, finely chopped onion in red vinegar. We both enjoyed eating the oysters with cocktail sauce with a little bit of the onion red vinegar. It was delish! So good, we ended up ordering at least 2 dozen of happy hour oysters and 6 additional Oysters that were not included as happy hour price, which were Big Cove. It tasted as it was described on the menu, sweet and buttery. :)

I don't know how in the world did I miss this restaurant during those times I have been in Vegas. If only I knew sooner. I will definitely come back here again.
