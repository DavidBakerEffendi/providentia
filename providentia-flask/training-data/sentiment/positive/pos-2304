Quando sono solo
sogno all'orizzonte
e mancan le parole,
Si lo so che non c'Ã¨ luce
in una stanza quando manca il sole,
se non ci sei tu con me, con me......

*Sorry*  Couldn't help myself.....whenever we go to the Bellagio Fountains, I can't get the Andrea Bocelli song out of my head.....it was used for their ad campaign when they opened and it's burned into my memory for life.

The Better Half and I love coming here because it's very romantic and peaceful.  We enjoy watching the show from the street level and from the Eiffel Tower Restaurant across the street @ Paris.  We have fond memories of this place.....her 1st Birthday dinner we celebrated together I got a table @ The Eiffel Tower Restaurant overlooking the Strip & Bellagio Fountains......we took wedding photos at the Fountains.....we've come down here numerous times when we check out the Holiday display at the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens.....good times.

I highly recommend stopping by if you're from out of town and have never seen it before.

Will I return?  You can count on it.
