We walked to this restaurant from home. Good thing I was looking up nearby restaurants in the neighbourhood and saw the one 5-star review from a fellow Yelper.

Service was excellent and all the servers are smiling and checking in regularly. 

The menu is pretty much one page. I love the simplicity of that. You have your selection of different soon tofu bowls along with Dolsot Bibimbap, Pork Bone soup, Bulgogi soup (with glass noodles) or broiled Bulgogi (hot plate). 

Our meals came with side dishes (kimchi, bean sprouts, those little sweet beans, and sliced radish strips). 

The purple rice came in hot stone bowls and you are welcome to scrape the rice out after. 

Overall this was a great experience and super close to home. This will be a regular spot especially on days when I work from home. 

Lastly, they accept debit, visa and MasterCard. :)

Enjoy!
