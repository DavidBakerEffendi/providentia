I'm a huge fan of Hogtown Vegan. I go every week with various members of my family.

Yes, the food is greasy. (That's sorta the point.) And, yes, it isn't all house-made stuff.  And, no, it's not beautiful inside. And, yes, the prices aren't low (though I'd say that they're not high, either). I don't care.

Hogtown offers massive portions of delicious, comforting food, served by nice people, in a fun environment. And the restaurant is dedicated to serving *exclusively* vegan food. That is enough to make this place my favorite restaurant in the city.
