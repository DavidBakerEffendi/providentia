We enjoyed a great dinner. We were referred by a friend to try something different. We don't frequent Greek restaurants usually.

We started with escargot & calamari. The calamari was delicious & tender. Escargot was good with plenty of garlic butter and cheese.

I ordered the double souvlaki plate and I cleaned my plate. Perfect in every aspect, taste, portion and overall value.

We will return when we visit again.
