This is a 5-star review. This chain restaurant deserves the 5-stars. Here's why:

*) Obviously a good training program implemented by management that encourages team work and employee engagement.
*) Most every employee seemed motivated, dressed in appropriate attire uniformly, appeared to have a heart rate above 90 (hard working!), and was pleasant and understandable .
*) Variety and quality and portion size of food and drink was acceptable for the price, served promptly (correct temperature...hot foods hot, cold foods cold, etc), drinks refilled/reordered with regularity, desserts were solicited, etc.
*) Well stocked bar with premium liquor and very large selection of wine and beers and custom, unique non-alcoholic drinks (and gambling)

Those of you who do not like this place are more than welcome to abandon the entire Las Vegas metropolitan area because this restaurant is the epitome of the culinary scene in Las Vegas: strong employee motivation, good price, good quality, plenty of space for large groups and throngs and throngs of small group... plus a dog-friendly patio and dog- friendly menu.
