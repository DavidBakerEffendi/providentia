Got a last minute reservation for my birthday last weekend. They are small, so I would suggest a reservation. You can sit at the bar, tables, or they have couches that are super comfy and fun to share a bit and drinks with friends. We had the bartender wait on us as we sat in the chairs. Everything was amazing, from the craft cocktails, to the bruschetta, salad, burgers and wine list. I almost went to Postino's - glad I didn't. This place blows them out of the water! Can't wait to come back!
