Musashi was an overall great experience. The restaurant is quaint,warm, and cozy. I was originally looking for a more generic Japanese meal like teriyaki chicken with broccoli, fried rice and shrimp sauce. The food they serve was not what I expected but was still delicious. It seemed like more authentic Japanese and was very fresh and tasted amazing. The chicken teriyaki was served with soup,salad, rice and noodles. The most outstanding part was the service. They went over and above to make sure we were taken care of! I highly recommend it!
