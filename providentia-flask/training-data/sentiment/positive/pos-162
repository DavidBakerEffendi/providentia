Oh my word, FINALLY CHARLOTTE. You have delivered and Fin & Fino did not disappoint. 

Justin didn't have high expectations walking in, but something inside of me did, and we both left so thrilled with our experience from start to finish.

We weren't able to get reservations since we were last minute walking home and decided to pop in for dinner, which was fine, because the bar was perfect for us and it was totally meant to be because Rebecca, the bartender, was knowledgeable, kind, soft spoken, attentive, just asked enough questions, and took pride in taking care of her guests. I haven't had service experience like this in a long time and coming from the industry myself, it was so welcomed.

We split the Tower of Power. Looking back, we should have probably done the smaller tower and ordered the hot mussels because J didn't love the cold ones (but I did). We were *slightly* disappointed in the oysters on both taste and size, but over all were very happy.

We are so excited to visit again and try other dishes...and of course, sit at the bar.

The open concept of this space is gorgeous, airy and light. Love the kitchen windows and the cleanliness and the decor. It's the perfect date-night spot on all levels.
