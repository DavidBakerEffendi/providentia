This place is awesome!!! Came here last Saturday afternoon with the boyfriend and we had a great time! 

Once we got settled in, we ordered drinks (I had the Strawberry Mule and the bf got a beer) and food (chicken with waffles and an order of the cheese beer dip with chips). 

The game was sooo much fun!!! I don't play golf and I had a blast. We played on the first level but next time we'll ask for the 2nd level.

We'll def be coming back this summer!!!
If your wondering what to wear, wear comfy, casual clothes and sneakers. Have fun!!
