My godmother brought me here for my birthday, and this place did not disappoint!  The atmosphere is classy and chic, and the service was not overly friendly but very good.  If I lived in Mount Lebanon, this could easily be one of my favorite places.

We started the meal with amazing complimentary bread and butter. The bread was served hot, and both my godmother and I lost track of the conversation when we tried the butter. What a way to start the meal!  We also ordered a hummus sampler, which came with plain, red pepper, and herb hummus. Again, holy cow. The red pepper hummus was absolutely spectacular. The plain and herb were also excellent, but we definitely polished off the red pepper first. Best of all, you can order this hummus for takeout

The actual meal was just as yummy. I LOVED the lobster macaroni and cheese, and it was loaded up with lobster. The actual Mac and cheese was delicious too.  My godmother ordered the crab cake, which was good, but it was definitely the weakest part of the meal. The sides were really odd, as rice and green beans did not go well with a crab cake.  Nonetheless, we really enjoyed our meals, and the lunch prices were crazy reasonable.

All the time while we were eating, we enjoyed some peach bellinis. They were very bubbly and a bit lacking in peach but all in all good.  There were loads of interesting drink options to choose from.

As we had heard from others that many unique characters come here, we were very excited to people watch. We were not disappointed on this front either, although the patrons are not controlled by the establishment.

The only downside is that their to-go containers leak really badly. All three of our boxes leaked.

Overall, this is a great place at lunch for a business meeting or nice meet up with friends. At dinner, it would be great for date night!
