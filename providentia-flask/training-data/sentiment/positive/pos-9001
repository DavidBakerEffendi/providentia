Best Mexican food (and affordability) in Montreal!!!

I've lived in this area for a year, and can't believe I haven't gone to Cafe Mezcal! It's located where there is an abundance of street music so you can sit outside in the sun and eat (which is what we did) and it was really relaxing and awesome!

I order the pulled pork tacos and wow, they were so tender, juicy and just the right size for a meal! Also, I hate when food gets too greasy, and surprisingly the pulled pork was just the right amount of savoriness and not greasy! We also got a side of refried beans, guacamole with chips and they were very good. The chips are homemade so they are harder, but minimal ingredients were used so that everything tasted fresh. Honestly, even without the great price, I would have rated them 5/5 just for their nice service, fresh food and atmosphere but dayummmmmm the total came out to only ~$12 for a main menu+appetizers which is great when you're poor af (aka college student)....Honestly, you can't get a better deal. 

I will probably be coming here....very often.... ugh RIP my already depleting wallet but YUM
