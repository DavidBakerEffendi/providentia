This place never disappoints. My wife and I have been coming for years and we always leave satisfied. The service staff is wonderful and always remembers our orders. We love A8 spring rolls!! I always get the rare beef and meatball pho while my wife enjoys the pho chicken. This is a great stop for a rainy day or just to enjoy some delicious pho.
