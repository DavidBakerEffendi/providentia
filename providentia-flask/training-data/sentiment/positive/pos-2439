We booked the Rialto suite for our group of 4 and it was enormous. At 1,100 square feet, there were plenty of space to run around acting belligerent after a few greygoose shots. The room had two full queen beds, an L shape sofa bed, three flat screen TV's, and just a lot of space! The service again was excellent and I can not complain. I like how all the Rialto suites are in the front entrance to all the other suites after coming out of the elevator. I just wish with so much space, they could had provide the rooms with bigger flat screens.
