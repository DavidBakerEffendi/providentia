Borrowing from Homer Simpson...."Mmmmm. ahhhh, uhhhHHHhhrghhhuuuuHHHggrruhhhHHhh..."  This is what happens each time I go into Chipotle Mexican Grill.

The their burrito bowl is like a magnet every time I am in the area....drawing me inside to purchase one.  It must be the fresh ingredients used along with the room full of happy customers also chomping down on their menu items that tells me the food here is great.

I could write more, but challenge you to just "Experience It!"
