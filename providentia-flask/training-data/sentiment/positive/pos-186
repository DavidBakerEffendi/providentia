This place is brand spanking new, serving up the culinary delights of Northeast China/Manchuria. The meat patty in fried pastry is absolutely to die for. They come 3 in an order and I saw people order it for lunch and wolf down all three in one sitting. The pastry is pan fried and the meat is somehow miraculously bathed in a savory soup. When you take a bite, the soup gushes out and overwhelms you, very much XLB style (Xiao Lung Bao). 

The dumplings, pot stickers, and hand pulled noodle soups are also quite good, as well as the noodle in the dark thick peanutty sauce. 

The ladies working there are pleasant and friendly. The restaurant is commendable for its cleanliness.

This place totally rocks and I recommend you all flash mob this place to keep it alive and well, serving up goodies for years to come.
