Madison has had a bit of a mini pizza renaissance within the past few years. In spite of not really being a "pizza town," we now have a solid number of pretty excellent pizza places.   

Salvatore's is probably now my favorite pizza in town. As an east coast expat I have a soft spot for NY style pizza, and there's no good NY style pizza in Madison. While Salvatore's is a little different from NY style, that's no bad thing at all. I really love their crust, which has just the right thickness and balance of crunch to chew.  Their ingredients are top notch, and there's always a cool special.  

I work near downtown and live on the southwest side.  I like Salvatore's so much that I'll drive into downtown after work to take a pizza back home, a good 10 miles and 20 minutes away.  I just warm it back up a little in my oven and it's good to go.  

I actually wrote a post about them on a car blog I write for, and Patrick, the owner, saw it because he's also a car guy. He hooked me up with some free fish tacos the next time I came in.  Score one for the internet!

The only bad thing I can say about Salvatore's is I liked them on facebook and now their delicious photos keep showing up in my news feed tempting me to buy more pizza.
