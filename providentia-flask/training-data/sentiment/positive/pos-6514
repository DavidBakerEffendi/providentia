I wasn't sure if I could eat here. I was asking the cashier some questions, she didn't seem to know but the person preparing the sandwiches overheard and was super helpful about looking up ingredients and accommodating me. I was just going to walk somewhere else to find food while my friends ate there but he looked up everything and assured me he could easily accommodate my food allergies. He made me a veggie sandwich and made a dressing as a sauce for me. The sandwich was really good and I was really impressed by the service. The guy making the sandwiches went out of his way to make sure I could eat at the restaurant with my friends and never once seemed annoyed or like "can't you just order something normal off the menu". I don't see service like this everyday and really appreciated the way I was treated here. Loved my vegan sandwich!
