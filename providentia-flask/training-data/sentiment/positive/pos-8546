I had actually heard about this place from Yelp a year ago but only recently got around to trying it. It's close to our house, but out of the way when we are driving to work, which is a real bummer because I want to grab lattes and breakfast here all the time now! 

11/21/12: Driving by this place, it could be a little hard to miss the turn, but they have an outside patio and a drive thru that becomes visible once you get closer. After debating if I wanted to eat alone outside, I decided to use the drive thru so I could take it home and eat. I ordered the New Mexico Burrito and a medium iced vanilla latte. The latte was crafted quickly and I drove forward to wait for the burrito. One sip and I immediately knew this latte was AMAZING. I am a coffee snob who can't stand bitter coffee/espresso or exceedingly sweet syrups, but this was neither. The vanilla flavor was strong, but not too sweet. The espresso wasn't over powering and mixed well with the milk and vanilla. Overall, one of the best latte's I've had. Within minutes, my burrito was ready and an employee walked it out to my car. Once home, I cut the burrito in half, slathered some of the homemade green chili sauce that was included on top, and dug in. Mmm, it was good. I even took a pic and emailed the husband, just to make him jealous! Thrilled with my drink and delicious burrito, I promised to take him here next time.

12/2/12: My mother-in-law was in town, so we stopped here for some early morning coffee. I ordered an iced vanilla latte, a blueberry muffin, and she ordered a regular coffee. Again my drink was fantastic and super quick service. My mother-in-law enjoyed her coffee and the sip she had from my drink. The muffin was delicious as well!

Overall, this place is truly a gem! It's small but the d√©cor is nice and welcoming.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick. I'm really looking forward to going back!
