This is my second visit to the Rick Mooney's flagship restaurant.  Last year we had the best meal upstairs and this time ended up downstairs after a very patient and understanding staff relocated us from upstairs  to downstairs as we had party members not too keen on the upstairs menu.

Downstairs is more on the relaxed side of things but it is the same kitchen, many of the same items, and a slightly smaller price tag.  We have been eating out a lot lately so I opted for the clam chowder and the appetizer blue crab cake.  The chowder was excellent with large whole clams and an enjoyable flavor slightly less creamy than most chowders.  The crab cake was also excellent in flavor and the right consistency.  I also sampled my wife's  Prawn and lobster special (Surf and Surf) which I thought was the best dish at the table.    The smokey corn flavor added pizzazz to this dish.

Service, excellent!  Thank you to the staff for accomodating picky eaters with lots of questions and the desire to move from upstairs to downstairs without blinking an eye. And keeping my water glass full is always a challenge but I never had an empty glass.

Normally the price knocks a star off but this place delivers downstairs price worthy cuisine.

Bon Appetit.
