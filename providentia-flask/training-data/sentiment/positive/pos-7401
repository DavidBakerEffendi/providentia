I had been hearing about this place for a while and finally decided to check it out. I went for happy hour with some girlfriends and ended up staying well past! The decor is hip and fresh and I just love the old school 80s/90s throwback feel in everything from the wall art to the music (explicit lyrics after 9pm!). I especially loved the TLC mural on the wall- fun fact: Crazy Sexy Cool was the first album I ever purchased! Joe's was formerly a liquor store for many years and the owners want to play homage to it by offering 40 OZ bottles of Bud Light and King Cobra which I think is great. On to the rest of the evening- the whiskey sour shandy was recommended to me and it was to die for! Not too sweet or sour, but perfectly tart and delicious; pretty dangerous if consumed in high quantities I might add! ;) My dining companion ordered the French 75 which was great as well, I'm so happy I have friends that share their liquor with me! For food we got the grilled pulpo- and oh my god it was so delicious! Perfectly seasoned and not too chewy, I seriously could have eaten ten more orders it was that good. We also got to try the bone marrow and it was one of the most flavorful things I've had in a while! Of course I followed it with the infamous marrow luge. For those who don't know the tradition, the marrow luge involves taking a shot of bourbon and using the inside of the bone as a luge to drink the shot. The combination of flavors from the oil, fat, and alcohol makes for one incredible experience! And it's a good conversation starter! On top of the food and drink, the service was also excellent, not like the "hipster service" I have come to expect in the area. Our server was attentive, explained the menu well, and made great recommendations- I can''t wait to be back and bring some more friends!
