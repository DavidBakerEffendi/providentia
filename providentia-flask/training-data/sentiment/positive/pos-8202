I judge tex-mex by how they prepare their veggies and this is where Coyotes excels. They beat everyone else out there on quantity and quality. Get the veggie fajitas and you will be rewarded. The complementary chips are also very crisp and they also hand out cole slaw as a chip dip which is a surprising good match.
