I wanted to update my review because I went in again tonight and I found out they have Boar's Head meat.  I told the owner he has to advertise that because that's a huge deal!  He laughed and said they are working on it.  Boar's Head is the best sliced meat you can get.  

My sandwich was just as good as the other night and everything was consistent.  I hope they don't lose their consistency like the previous shop did because this one is a keeper!
