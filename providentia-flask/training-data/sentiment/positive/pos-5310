This place is awesome! Came here with a girlfriend late afternoon for some margs and Mexican food! 

I've always seen this place since I'm always at the Target right by there, and had no idea it was a Mexican restaurant. The interior is incredible and rustic.

I ordered a chicken tamale and chicken enchilada. They were cooked to perfection and the portion size was unbelievable. I had to take half of it to go since I was so full. Even with the free chips and salsa appetizer, I had no more room. My skinny margaritas were perfect. On the rocks and with a salted rim. It was to die for and priced perfectly.

When the bill came, I was shocked how inexpensive it was! Two margs and a two combo plate for less than 30$. Our service was incredible, and so was the food. Thanks guys for keeping my wallet happy and my stomach full!
