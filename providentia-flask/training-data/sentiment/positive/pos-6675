I'm having a hard time concentrating as the urge to slip into a food nap is overwhelming after the amount of awesome food I ate here.  Visited this place and I must say that it is my absolute new place to get Indian from.  Now I have not yet had one of the regular dishes but the buffet from 11-2 had me captivated from beginning to end.  I'd have to say it's a little hard to locate and definitely not somewhere you'd go unless on a dare, being located between a Big Lots and a Food City.

Now I love putting basmati rice under most dishes as filler but this stuff you could eat by itself, it was that flavorful. They had four chicken dishes, though the Tandoori, Tikka Masala and Vindaloo all had superb flavor that begged me to get seconds even when I didn't need it.  The vegetarian choices were not quite as good as the chicken and there didn't seem to be many choices available, didn't care as it meant more room for dishes that captivated me.  

The naan, this is the clincher.  We ordered the garlic naan and between it being super fresh, the right amount of oil and infused with garlic this multiplied the yum factor of everything sopped up with it by a factor of ten.

The host was super friendly and made you feel right at home, explaining dishes that I was not all that familiar with and letting us know about their online specials and coupons through Facebook.  The waiter had us topped off with water and soda before we got to the bottom of a glass, top notch.

Now I've been around to a few other Indian places in the vicinity, most notably Delhi Palace and if you like that place, you'll love this.
