This was my first time here.  I was referred by two people and they were not wrong.  I got the Al pastor (pork tenderloin) nachos and the rolled tacos.  First the nachos were delicious.  The seasoning on the meat was excellent and there was plenty of meat on them.  They did not skimp!  Now the rolled tacos...for 6 they offered 3 &3.  That was awesome.  You don't have to get all of one kind.  My son had no complaints about them. I tried the rolled tacos and it wasn't just tortilla and a little bit of meat.  It was a filled to just the right amount.

So now the sauces.  The red sauce is not for wimps.  It is spicy, so if your a wimp with hot I would suggest the green sauce.  It was really good.  

I have already referred a friend so I obviously thought it was delicious.  The price is a little higher than what you would pay for at Robertos but the quality of food is 100 times better.  And you can get refills on horchata!!
