Today is like the Nth time I come to this dessert restaurant, and it never disappoints. Not many people know about this place so usually you can always get a seat when you come in. They offer free wifi and parking at the back which is definitely a great plus. Their best dishes for me are the crepes, waffles, and green tea shaved ice cream. The prices are around $10, and if you come in Tues-Fri at noon you can get a crepe+hot drink combo for $10.99. Pastel opens 12-23, and I think they close on Mondays
