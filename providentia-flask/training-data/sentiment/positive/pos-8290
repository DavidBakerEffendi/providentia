This is great to-go Thai food. I've ordered the Jalape√±o curry twice, both times hot. The curry has the perfect amount of spice and includes lots of fresh peppers and veggies. The beef is typical beef you would find in a curry, no surprise there. This is much better than average green curry. The portions are most excellent, you get a big container of curry for only $8.  Although you get a lot of food for your money, don't expect left overs because it's that good.  

Service is good and staff is friendly. I'm extremely happy to have a good to-go Thai restaurant in the neighborhood.
