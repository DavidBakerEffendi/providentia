One of the tastiest waffles in Toronto! I love the shortcake waffle with strawberries, blueberries, and little shortcake pieces. I came here specifically to get a hot chocolate with a hello kitty-sprinkled face on it and it was so worth it! PS you should come here early-ish, as this place tends to get crowded after 8:30/9pm, even on weekdays!
