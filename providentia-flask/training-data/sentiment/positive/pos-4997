YUM! Ordered the veggie dog (soy) and it was deeee-lightful! Since the veggie delight special wasn't completely vegan, I got the Chicago with the veggie dog! Oh my, it was the bomb diggity. It came with all veggies including relish and these super hot peppers (which I'm glad I ordered on the side). The fries... oh my sweet, sweet Lord. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This meal was amazing and I would have never discovered them had they not visited my work! Will be going back for sure.
