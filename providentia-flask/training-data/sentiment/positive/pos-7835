Love, love, love this place!

We finally ate here last night and wow was it amazing.  They offer a really good wine selection and we settled on a delicious bottle of sauvignon blanc. 

For appetizers, we ordered a medley of starters to split between four of us including - crab cakes, calamari, octopus, and shrimp rolls.  Each app was amazing.  They were presented beautifully and everything was cooked to perfection.  

For my entree, I ordered their tuna dish.  It was fantastic.  Everything about it was delicious - I literally cleared by entire plate!

For dessert, my husband and I split the creme brulee and that was spot on as well.

Can't wait to go back and try other items from their menu as everything looked/sounded good and everyone at the table enjoyed their meal thoroughly.
