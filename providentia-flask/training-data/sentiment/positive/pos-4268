Squash poutine heaven! That is the most memorable dish I've ever had! Forget the usual gravy on fries.These are fried squash cubes with (Japenese?) curry sauce on top. We received some complimentary dishes on the house and heck, the food here is pretty darn good! My favourite were the squash poutine, kimchi fried rice (more like sticky rice), and shrimps. This is a great place to share food with two or three friends and have a candle lit, cozy time together. My friends loved the drinks here and I enjoyed my very cheap can of beer! Loud, nice music. Everyone's happy and full by the end of the night. Thank you for the great experience, ya Odd Seoul!
