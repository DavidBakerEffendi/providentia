Urban Beans has a beautiful set up. There is amazing art inside all over the walls, with all different tables and chairs. The wine bar has a very nice set up also. The ouitside is a nice place to sit when the weather is nice and cool. It has a casual atmosphere. All of the people that work there are so nice! They seem to really like their job. The food there is delicious! Their drinks are good as well. I love stopping in to get a bite to eat and a drink. I like bringing my laptop to get some work there. The atmosphere is peaceful and quiet. I'd recommend Urban Beans to anyone who enjoys coffee and fresh food! Yum!
