Seriously delicious!! It reminds me of la street fairs. The food is really fresh and authentic. I got 3 roll tacos, which comes with green and red salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo. Definitely will be coming here often!

-update-

I just came here again to treat my parents! I paid just using my tip money from work, which was all in ones, but the woman at the register was perfectly fine with it and was extremly friendly. Our food came within 10 minutes, and the waitress even got my family water and our utensils! Like a couple of goofballs, we spilled the water, but the waitress was kind enough to clean it for us. No attitude at all!! The food was just delicious, and for now my super b cravings have subsided. I can't find any place that's as good!! Couldn't praise it enough :)
