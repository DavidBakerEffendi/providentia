This hotel/casino is definitely out of its element in comparison to the rest of Las Vegas. Not to say that Las Vegas is a dump or anything, but The Venetian is so classy from inside and out. Outside has a little river around it to simulate Italy. Inside, many floors, walls and counters of granite exist with incredibly designs.
