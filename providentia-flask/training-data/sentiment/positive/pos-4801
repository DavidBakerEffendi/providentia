I've come a couple times with my family & they're generally good with time, there was once where they only had one cook but for the most part I won't return to Denny's if I don't need too and ihop has really never been my favorite. They are very good price wise & the food taste amazing. I've brought my family to eat and they loved it as well. Near where I live currently, and I recommend this place to absolutely anyone.
