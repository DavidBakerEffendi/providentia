I've been coming here since before they moved to the bigger location. Awesome sandwiches, soups and baked goods -- the bread pudding with caramel sauce is amazing.  Most of the time, I get an asparagus panini with ham and follow it with the bread pudding.  Staff is friendly and service is fast.  Always a crowd at lunch, so get there early!
