Stopped in for dinner with my daughter. Once your children are grown, the fact they will ever be seen with you in public is a blessing. So I was in a good mood.  But I digress...

Greeted by friendly staff. Nice open space, tastefully decorated, and while open spaces can be noisy the level was at most moderate with the place half full.

Taylor at the bar was great - friendly, helpful, and just the right amount of checking on us.

Good tap beers were on a $2 special, and tapas were 10% off.  Prices in general were reasonable, and since they had small and large plates you can spend what you want.  I love that.

My daughter had a truly outstanding spinach spaetzle.  It was very light for a pasta dish, and complimented by a mild tomato sauce and fresh vegetables, including English peas. Overall a great summery dish.

I had shredded snow crab over asparagus with hollandaise. While it sounds heavy, shredding the crab made it seem much lighter. Perfect. 

Also had the pork belly, which was moist and very flavorful but not at all greasy.  Outstanding version of a dish that often is not done well.

Look forward to going back.  Excellent food and staff (we did not meet any of the actual four sisters unfortunately, but were told there really are four) and fair prices with a huge range of options. GREAT addition to the Madison/Verona food scene.
