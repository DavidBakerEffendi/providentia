I love this store. I always feel like a queen when I shop here. Today, after purchasing my new FENDI bag, I told the sales lady I was going to the perfume counter next, she asked what I wanted and ran over to get it for me. I jokingly mentioned these were my Christmas gifts to myself, After I paid, she offered me a claim check and told me when I was finished with my shopping to pick up my packages from customer service. When I picked them up, they had been wrapped so beautifully complete with a gorgeous silver NM keychain.  I only wish the cafe were open later as a strawberry popover would have been delicious while shopping...
