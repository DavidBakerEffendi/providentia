Yummy, yummy BBQ! Ate it at a wedding reception. Tried the pulled pork, chicken and brisket with 3 BBQ sauces (Kansas City, Hickory & Habanero), rolls, cole slaw, salad, and cowboy beans. All were scrumptious! Caterers, were a little late, but called to say they were a bit delayed. Very professional and pleasant. Would definitely have them again.
