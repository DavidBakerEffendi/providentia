Because of the reviews on yelp and my friend's recommendation, I decided to come here with my husband and our friend. It's not a large place but decor had a nice modern urban touch. With wooden walls, tables and floors. We got a nice cosy corner table which was pleasant, because the rest of the cafe was quite noisy. They had a large selection of drinks, meals and snacks. 

Things we ordered:

1. Taiwanese Fried Popcorn Chicken. The crisp was really nice and very well seasoned. The chicken nuggets were nice and juicy as well. 

2. Drinks:
Kumquat Lemon Hot Tea.
My tea was quite nice. It came in a large saucer like mug in a cute wooden box coaster. There was an extra packet of sugar, but it was sweet enough to my liking and a perfect tartness for me.

Peach Coconut Jelly with Popping Bubbles.
This was a cold drink and taste was nice peachy flavour. 

Healthy Berry Hot Tea.
Pomegranate flavour and a bit of tartness. It was quite pleasant as well.

3. The Black Wizard Taiwanese Shaved Ice.
To my surprise this was delish. I have tried shaved ice before but it was not as good as this one. First of all it was huge! Good thing there was 3 of us, and we were able to finish it. The wizard content was shaved ice, grass jelly, red bean, tapioca, condensed milk, & some sort of syrup. The shaved ice was shaved so fine that it just melted in your mouth with a burst of flavour. 

They are definitely under staff for this busy holiday week, but the food and drinks came quite quickIy. I would definitely come back here to try other stuff.
