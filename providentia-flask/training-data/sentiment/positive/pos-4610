After going to the gym next door, I decided to stop by Gimme Some Sugar (set back my workout progress but so worth it!) and did not regret that decision.  I ordered the tiramisu cake at $5 for a cup of it.  Most tiramisu that I've tried have a very moist texture similar to tres leches cake, but the tiramisu here was much more light and airy, and it was delicious.

I love the atmosphere of the bakery too.  The furniture and decor look very upscale, and the bakery still feels welcoming at the same time.  Customer service is top notch too.  It was cool to look at the many custom cake displays set out throughout the bakery.  

I came back to Gimme Some Sugar today, and tried the large thin mint macaron, at the recommendation of the lady at the counter.  The macaron was the size of burger buns and reasonably priced at $4.95 for such a huge piece.  This macaron was amazing!  The taste was very similar to thin mint cookies, and there were real thin mint pieces inside with the cream filling.  The texture of the cookies was great and the cookies were not hollow, unlike many other macarons I've tried in the past.
