Nice local juice bar/smoothie bar. They actually tell you all of the ingredients in their smoothies (unlike places like Jamba). They've got everything from super green healthy juices, to sweeter juices, to mango smoothies to date smoothies to acai bowls with granola and fruit on top. You can get drinks to order or choose an already bottles juice from their case. My favorite is their "date nut" smoothies, which is made with homemade vanilla cashew milk, dates and nutmeg. Yum
