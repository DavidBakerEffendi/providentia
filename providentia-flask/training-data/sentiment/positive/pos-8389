This is a really fun place to get some sushi mostly because of the laid back and social atmosphere.  As most everyone notes, the price point is awesome.  It encourages you to sample a lot of things that you likely otherwise wouldn't.  

All in all, The sushi is good, the service is also very good (for those things that are served), and mostly the price is amazing.
