Drove by and mom mentioned that she's always wanted to eat here, ever since she went to high school across the street at the now non-existent West High. With longevity like that, you know they have to be doing something right.

The setup is a bit like Five Guys or Fuddruckers - you walk up to the counter and order your burger and side. You have a choice of bun (white, wheat, onion) and cheese (American, swiss, cheddar, provolone). They call your name and you add your own condiments from the condiment buffet (which doubles as the salad bar). I really like this setup because you get to put as little or as much whatever you want on it. I wish they had some hot cheese like Fuddruckers, though. My burger with fries was $5.99 - they charge extra for cheese and extras like mushrooms or bacon. A soda with unlimited refills (and they have one of those crazy touch screen soda machines) was $1.79. 

The burger was excellent quality and cooked just right - though they didn't ask how I wanted it. I guess they do everyone's medium? The fries were thick cut and really good. This place is definitely recommended.
