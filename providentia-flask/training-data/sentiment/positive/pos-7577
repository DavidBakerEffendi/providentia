I like Juan's a very great place to eat at. Also, a very good place to chill at! They have outside seating available, very comfortable booths. The food is always on point, the portions are huge. The chips & salsa are great as well! This place gets very busy at times, so be careful on when you come. You most likely will have a wait time if you come during prime hours. 

Overall great place! Great customer service! I can't be mad.
