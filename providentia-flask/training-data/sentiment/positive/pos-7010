I was very pleased with my recent visit to Lazy Dog's. Our waiter Joey was very accommodating and professional. He helped me through the menu because I was so undecided. After a few suggestions I decided on the chicken poblano which was out of this world.   I even splurged on the apple cobbler which Joey recommended. It was the best I've had in years. My husband and I will be repeat customers.
