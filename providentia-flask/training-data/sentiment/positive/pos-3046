This is our favorite place to come, whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Their chips and salsa are a great way to start off the meal and their breakfast burritos are to die for. My favorite is the ham and egg burrito. Their tortillas are handmade and delicious as well; we like to bring them home! Oh! And if you like Coke Freestyle machines, they've got one!
