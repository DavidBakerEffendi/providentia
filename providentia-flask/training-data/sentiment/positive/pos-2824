Went there last Friday night with some friends on our way to the Orpheum. The place was packed and there was a line out the door, but thankfully we had reservations so we got right in. The food and drinks were incredible and the staff treated us like royalty. Unfortunately, I didn't get our waiters name but he is one of the best waiters we have ever had. A friend of mine who has traveled the world,said this is her new favorite place. We will definitely be returning.
