I always have a blast when I am here with my friends. 4 square, pool, beer pong (table and bigger version) are a MUST! Good music during weekends, random dodgeball tournaments ! Upbeat environment, great place to meet new people; I suggest pregaming before you go in, as drinks can be pricey. You can find $3 beers in DTLV.
