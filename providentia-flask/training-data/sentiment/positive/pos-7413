Easily. EASILY. The best free attraction we have in Las Vegas.

I absolutely love Time to Say Goodbye / Con te Partir√≤ by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman. You really can't go wrong with any of the songs they have on shuffle, but when this classic starts blaring, I feel like I've won the jackpot! It just gets me every time.

Of course, anything they play by Mr Sinatra sets the mood perfectly, as does anything by Mr Presley. The Fountains of Bellagio are such a simple idea. Yet, they are truly hypnotizing and worthy of coming back again and again. And again.
