Woot Woot!  That's what my belly says when I walk into Lenny's.  My arteries hate me, but my belly and taste buds love me.  If I could dive into a pool of ranch with Lenny's fries I would.  Their burgers are great, and their chicken sandwiches are amazing.  Those are the only things I have tried there, but I've heard good things bout the tuna melt also.  

Its fast, small and slightly frenzied.  I ususally take it to go during lunch hour.  But you can sidle up to the counter like a real old-fashioned burger joint.  They also make yummy shakes and malts.  I swear, this is where you wanna go if you are breaking your diet.  Yum!
