Yet another Montreal gem. 

Hands down the best Portuguese barbecue chicken Montreal has to offer, every other restaurant that is remotely good will still come AFTER Romados. You can smell it from down the street, it is inexpensive, and absolutely delicious. 

Whether you are ordering the perfectly cooked and spiced chicken, fries, salad, or pastries, your taste buds are in for the ride of their lives. 

Do not miss out on this place!
