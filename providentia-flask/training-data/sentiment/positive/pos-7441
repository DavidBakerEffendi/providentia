Lots of wonderful bread and muffins and what is commonly referred to as "vienoisseries". I came upon this gem while taking an exploratory stroll after shopping at the market nearby,wonderful surprise! Bought an orange/hazelnut bread for my breakfasts,can't wait to try it. Another great find and most likely,keeper.
