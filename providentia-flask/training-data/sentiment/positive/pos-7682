I'm finally writing a well deserved review. I've been here many times before and each time I've been completely satisfied with my experience. I've tried the salads, chia parfaits, wraps and fresh lemonades. I really enjoyed each one. So far my favorite salad is the Asian salad. The Cobb salad is also a favorite in my household. 

The service is very fast and the food is always fresh. They have many options to choose from when ordering. The only thing I wish was different was the location. I really want one to be in my backyard, I would probably go everyday if that was the case. 

I'm really happy that they've came up with a fast food chain that serves up fresh healthy meals instead of your typical greasy GMO hormone injected processed crap! I heart salads!!!
