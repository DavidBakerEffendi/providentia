I feel that pizza is very subjective between the major chains.  All very good and everyone has their personal tastes.  Little Caesars is my favourite!  And for $5.49 for a medium, one topping pizza is an awesome deal!

I've been ordering from this location since I moved to Stouffville about 4 years ago and they're always friendly and quick!  Always!  My orders are always ready in less than 15 min and the pizza is always consistently good.

Love the service, love the pizza, and I love the location!
