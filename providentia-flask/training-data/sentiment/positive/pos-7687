I can not think of one thing that I did not like about this experience. Honestly. The welcome from the hostess was kind and friendly. The table setting was warm and comfortable. The server was very attentive and professional, and was also was not uptight. The atmosphere was nice. The place was filled, not one empty seat the entire time we were there. We had to make a reservation because this place is always so busy. The table we sat at was one in a row of maybe 6 tables, but was comfortable like I said.
   We started off with the on special white wine and lemon pepper calamari. The calamari was made very nicely. It was not too crispy, which allowed the flavor to stand out. This was also served with a horseradish sauce. 
  The entr√©es we chose (which was difficult to choose) were the pork tenderloin and the lobster tail gnocchi. The pork was cooked perfectly. It was tender, not dry, with what tasted like a raspberry or sweet glaze/ sauce. It was also served with squash and a mound of mashed potatoes. The lobster and gnocchi was very good as well! The gnocchi was so perfectly cooked and the white sauce was so tasty! The lobster was also cooked very well. When I put the lemon over both the gnocchi and lobster made it gave it a whole new level of taste.
   My husband wouldn't let me try his pistachio cheesecake! But it looked yum! I had the triple threat chocolate cake. I can not express the amount of joy I had received from this cake! It has to be the best chocolate cake I had ever experienced in my life! I will never forget it... *tear*
   When the restaurant dimmed the lights, in the middle of dinner, the people in the restaurant all awed, ohhh'd and gasped. It was cute. I can not. Let me say that again. I can't not wait to come back! Double thumbs up!
