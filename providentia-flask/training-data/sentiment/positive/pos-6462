Great place for drinks with the girls - or even for a date (there seemed to lots of dates happening).  The food was yummy - we tried the ribs, pizza, flatbread, and mussels (which apparently are the crowd favourite).  All were delish.  Served with a side of fruili!  We also tried other fruit beers (but we agree that the fruili was the best).  The desserts were also great - peanut butter cup and banana was yum - and the chocolate cake was good (must try with the recommended beer pairing to get the black forest cake flavour - the beer was heavy on its own).  Still a must visit - the patio was also quite nice!
