Man, I am shocked that me, a South Hills resident of all people, is going to be the first to review this neat little place.

I have been by The New Way countless times over the course of about 15 years. Today, I didn't bring a lunch to work and decided to take a chance. 

Why did it take me so long? 

I was greeted by a jovial man with an accent and moustache. I knew they had gyros since it says so in the window, and I love gyros, so I hadda partake, especially when I saw an actual gyro spit behind the counter. That shouts authenticity, y'know? 

Now, it  doesn't conquer It's Greek To Me's godly gyro, but it certainly tests my neighborhood's own Herculean Greek sandwich, and only barely loses out. 

But comparisons be damned, this is a mighty gyro in its own right. It was tender, filling, the veggies were fresh, the cucumber sauce creamytangy, and that pita bread was amazingly pillowy. Is it fresh baked? It sure tasted like it and felt like it in my hands. Yes, I even liked holding and touching it. lol. 

This place has a huge menu. They serve breakfast, lunch,an array of sandwiches, hoagies, burgers, salads, apps, and even pizza. 

So stop in and give 'em some of yer money ya hipsters. Or else I'll steal yer scarves!
