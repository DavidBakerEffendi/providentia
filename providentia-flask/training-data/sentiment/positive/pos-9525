This place is crazy crowded on a Sunday at noon. The line up is huge! The waitresses are literally running from table to table to make sure everyone is getting a good service. I thought since I'm in Montreal, I'd pick a French breakfast and ordered Crepes. I asked for both strawberries and blueberrie, which was not on the menu but they made it for me. The cream in the crepe is extremely rich. The crepe itself is huge, so you can even share it. Overall, It was a great experience. I got my coffee refilled frequently. The only problem is the noise level!
