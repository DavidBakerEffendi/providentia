Restaurant Review
Off the beaten path in Madison. I had looked up this place before on tripadvisor and was not disappointed. The restaurant itself is super small and the parking in front is rather limited (I had to drive around the block twice and realized that there was no parking in the back). Built as best BBQ in madison I was not disappointed. Fall of the bone tender ribs along with two sides was the meal I had. Get the sugar fried biscuits and you won't be disappointed. This place could be on diner and drives and I am glad I found it one my own! Also prices are super reasonable. No wonder why they won so many awards for there food. Best bbq sauce period.

Pro- Inexpensive, delicious bbq, hidden gem

Con- Small seating area, small parking, closes at 8:30 PM

Hidden deal- Order the combo to get the best bang for your buck
