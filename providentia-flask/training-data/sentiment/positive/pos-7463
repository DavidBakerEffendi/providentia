UPSETTING. After trying this place out, I was clearly upset. I am now a Salad-and-Go addict. I didn't think that salads could turn out to be THIS good. I now have to drive 20 minutes out, from Goodyear to Tolleson for a dang salad. 
I've only been here twice but it doesn't get anymore perfect for me. The pricing is great, salads start at $5.74 but go up depending on if you add proteins or not. I love to add chicken to my salads, so it is a little extra but it isn't bad at all. My favorite salad here is the BBQ Ranch with added chicken. They give you the right amount or salad, dressing toppings everything! They're big salads too! So Fresh! So Scrumptious! 
The second time I came, I got the same exact salad, I couldn't steer away, but today I did get the chance to enjoy a Tropical Green Smoothie, which I believe was 4.74. Option to add protein is available. It definitely tasted healthy, less sweet, very green and earthy green tasting, but still very enjoyable. 
There is seating but only outside seating, so if you're looking for a lunch date out, prepare for weather conditions, we've caught wind once. I'd say this is a downfall for me because I enjoy outings, but then again, it is a grab and go kind of place, so no star deducted there. 
I enjoy that the pricing is very affordable, even for healthy food! My sister and I each got a salad both with added protein and two smoothies. 2 hefty salads + 2 healthy smoothies = $26.51. 
I also enjoy that the staff members here are so quick, and they get you outta there in a jiffy, whether you use the window or the drive through. I mean I guess you grab a "Salad-and-Go"!
