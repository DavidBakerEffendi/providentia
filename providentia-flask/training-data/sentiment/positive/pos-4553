Best Bagel of 2016!  Not even close, this place is #1.

I am obsessed with bagels.  When I am preparing for a trip anywhere, one of the first things I do is try to figure out where I'm going to get my morning bagel fix.  I don't eat bagels everyday, but I need to know where to score if I need a hit.

A toasted Everything bagel with a nice schmear of regular cream cheese and a cafe latte is just about my all time favorite on-the-go breakfast.  No breakfast burritos for me, thank you very much.  

The Everything bagels here are the best I've had all year.  Absolutely delicious and wonderfully chewy, they are as good as it gets.  

While they clearly know how to make bagels here, toasting them is another thing.  The seeds and other toppings on the top of the bagel were burnt.  Under the cream cheese, the inside of the bagel didn't appear to be toasted at all.  Should be the other way around, minus the burnt.

It was still delicious a delicious bagel, so I'm not deducting any stars. But it sure would be nice if they could address the toasting issue.  At home it's just a matter of switching the setting on the toaster oven from Toast to Broil: the insides get toasted and the seeds/nuts/onions don't turn an unappetizing black.  Surely there's got to be a way a restaurant can toast their bagels without burning the toppings.

The cafe latte here was also excellent, even though it was served at about 1,500 degrees F.  Watch out, McDonald's!

Parking is a huge issue here.  There are some 10-15 minute parking places right next to the restaurant, and if you are taking your order to go , that's fine.  If you are planning on sitting down, you're going to have to scramble for a parking place in the medical center's very crowded private parking lot.

This place is totally legit!  I'm definitely looking forward to trying some of the other things on the menu.
