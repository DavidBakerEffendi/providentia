Holy crap! I said to my husband the other day, the more I travel, the more I'm realizing that Calgarians/Canadians are a$$holes when it comes to customer service, not Americans. Then we came here for dinner and my faith was restored. 

We got a couple GCs for here, and figured why not have a date night and go out for dinner. We went the Friday of the long weekend, so we were able to take a nice stroll along the river, it was very peaceful. 

For dinner we did the chef's tasting, I think that is how it is anyways. We started with the amuse bouche, which not going to lie as a little gross, but the point is to "warm your mouth up" so  it works. We had 3 fantastic dishes (goat cheese with orange, duck salami and Parmesan custard and mushroom risotto, they explained everything in great detail, made sure everything was gluten free and knew when to come around. 

After we were done, they took us on a whole tour of the kitchen, got to meet the owners an they even did a dessert sampler for us, which had 4 little desserts. And then to end the evening, they gave us the flower from the table. It was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to use out other GC.
