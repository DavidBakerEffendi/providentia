I used to do a Roberto's breakfast burrito at least a couple of times a week but the service was so bad at the one I went to, I stopped going.  I missed my breakfast burrito and thankfully, I found Fun Tacos (which has a drive thru window).  The burritos are great and the person who works the window is wonderful.  She always greets me with a smile and apparently, a week later after my very first order, remembered me and the sauce I liked, etc.  It's a small thing, but always is nice to see friendly folks - especially in the morning.  I give this place a big thumbs up.
