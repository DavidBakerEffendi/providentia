Yet another great place in Arcadia to get your veggie glow on. 

As part of the October 30 day vegan challenge, I made a point to try as many vegan friendly restaurants as possible and so far this is very high up on my list - especially for being a caf√© with gluten-free, dairy-free, corn-free, and lots of great meat options as well. It's the perfect place to take a date with dietary restrictions. 

The portions were gigantic! Although the price I paid for the vegan tacos was a little high for a lunch break, it is more than enough food for two meals. I can't wait to heat these up for a leftover breakfast tomorrow at the office. 

I also had the buffalo cauliflower. I don't know about you, but this is my current favorite obsession. They're very meaty and fantastically battered! They're very smart to serve the sauces on the side so that they keep their crisp.
