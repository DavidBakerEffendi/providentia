This place is AMAZING, no joke!

I LOVE the cute couple who run this place. This is the real deal, a cute family-run joint with folks who are very real. I always get the veg roti and it is fucking delish with spices and amazing green apple chutney. It's so fun to watch it being made! They also have fresh sorrel juice which is perfect on a hot summer day, definitely not too sweet. Also incredibly reasonably priced, every veg roti totally fills me up and it's five bucks or just over. 

Whenever I go there they are genuinely stoked to see me and give me hugs and kisses! So rad to shoot the shit with these two while the roti is being made. They will also usually give plantain while you wait - and again this is delish, not too greasy or oily, but just right. 

Seriously hoping they stick around for a while, they are a complete and utter joy to have in the neighbourhood and brighten my day whenever I go by!
