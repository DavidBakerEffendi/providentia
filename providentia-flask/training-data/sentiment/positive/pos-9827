What huge portions and very tasty/fresh sushi!  I went here for lunch on a promotion and I was impressed with the large menu.  For $8 a heaping bowl of ramen noodles that should satisfy 2.  Your choices include pork belly or veggie.  I chose veggie and it was brimming with noodles, soup and an assortment of onion, chinese cabbage, mushrooms and corn.  Hot broth and chewy ramen, the way it was meant to be!  It hit the spot and I felt like I was in a real foodie restaurant.  Someone knows real ramen.  I got wide eyed at the HUGE/long rainbow roll.  For $12, it was double the size I'd normally get at another local Japanese restaurant.  I was torn between finishing the sushi or the ramen bowl....because I knew I couldn't walk out of the restaurant without clutching my stomach if I forced myself to finish both so yeah for leftovers.  The service was well attended and the ambience was just right with the flat screens and music.  There is a bar and dining tables all around.  I'd recommend this place as the best bang for your buck and for a unique menu.  It had regular sushi, deep fried sushi, katsu, seaweed salad, tataki and combo plates.  I'll be back to try other menu items!
