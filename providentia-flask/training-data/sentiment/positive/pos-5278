We used to come here when it was BTS, so decided to visit again. Wasn't sure it was open with all the construction around & the empty parking lot, but they were open -- fortunately for us. We were served right away & we all ordered the pastrami melt for old times' sake, which did not disappoint! We'll be back for sure.

Note: If you check in on Yelp, you get a 10% disc. Same if you're retired military.
