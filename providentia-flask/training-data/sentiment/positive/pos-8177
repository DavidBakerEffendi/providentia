Yes, finally found a solid shabu shabu! This is the kind of place we appreciated in San Francisco bay area.

They offer unlimited vegetables, tofu and rice. Protein options include beef, kobe beef, pork, chicken, shrimps and scallops - and we can do 1/2 + 1/2 with any combinations, or 1 + 1/2. Also comes with three dipping sauce, including very spicy one.

It's the shabu shabu done right. Just in time for the cold winter. :)
