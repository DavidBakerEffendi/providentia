This is now my new favorite place for Mexican in the area...sorry Nuevo Acapulco! You've been topped!  The chile rellenos are incredible.  They've spruced up the outside a bit since I went there years ago.  Parking is minimal so you may need to park on the street.  They have some of the strongest margaritas I've ever had.  We frequently drive 45 minutes just to come to this place.  Yum!
