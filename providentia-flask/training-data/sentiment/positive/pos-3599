I might be a little generous because I had a couple cocktails in me before we even sat, but Rick Moonen's was an awesome experience.  The food was great, the service was fantastic, and the decor was simple and clean.

From our server Candice, to the bussers and other staff, everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  They would step to the side if you were walking and ask to take your plate away.

Their crab cakes are awesome!  I usually don't like crab cakes because they taste fishy, but these were just pan fried on the outside so they were crispy but oh so delicious.  Also their chicken entree was great.  Crispy on the skin and juicy on the inside.

Candice had the bartender make a special martini for me because I didn't like the one I had ordered, and without hesitation, she took it away.  Can't remember what was in it, but the bartender even came over to our table to make sure I liked it.  It had vodka, St. Germaine liqueur, and some other ingredients, but it tasted like a sweet and tart lemonade...with booze!

Definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas.
