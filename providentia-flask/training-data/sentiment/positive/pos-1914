Great local ingredients, great owner and staff.  I love their pizza flavors and salads.  I like that you can get a sprouted grain crust - it's delicious.  We've been coming here since they opened and we could bike there.  Now they have another location in Plaza Midwood and we love going there too since it's close to where we live.  Please check this place out - you won't be disappointed!
