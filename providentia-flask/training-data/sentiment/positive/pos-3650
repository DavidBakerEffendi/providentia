Very fast friendly service. My daughter really liked her banana Nutella crepes- which was sweet, light and fluffy-- well, that's her description anyway since she didn't want to share with me :(

I opted for the mango with sticky rice ---  Mangoes were sweet and fresh, and the sticky rice topped with coconut milk and sesame seeds was really good.  I'm so glad I tried it before mango season is over. 

The place is worth going back to; next time I'll try the savory crepes :)
