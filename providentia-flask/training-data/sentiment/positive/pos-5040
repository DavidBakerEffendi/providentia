Whether in Los Angeles or Las Vegas, Eggslut is one of those places that you HAVE to stop at! 

This was actually the first time I had stopped by the Vegas location, but just like LA the line was no joke!  Fortunately it moves rather quickly and they get your food to you pretty fast once you order.  I have tried most of their menu(not too many options) and have never been disappointed. My favorite by far is the "Bacon, Egg & Cheese," with or without avocado it is amazing, and they are super generous with the bacon! 

The one item on the menu that I have yet to try is the "Slut," I have no idea why but based on all these reviews I will have to try it next time around.
