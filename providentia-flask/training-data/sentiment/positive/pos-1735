Chef Deyree makes some incredible Gelato.  Surprisingly, I thought the cucumber ginger was the most unique and flavorful.  The mango, raspberry and passion fruit were also excellent as was the chocolate.  This Gelato contains fresh and pure ingredients and the chef is clearly proud of the product.  We were able to sample the different flavors from pure vanilla to complex coffee favored flavors.  It is a welcome neighbor to Viva Las Arepas and everyone should stop there for desert.
