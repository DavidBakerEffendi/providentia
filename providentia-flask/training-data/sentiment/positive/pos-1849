Great everything for 4pm on a friday in and out in an hour. Only issue... didnt receive a receipt for 78.00 order for the three of us, the drink was very bad.... i have NOT had a good drink here in the last 3 visits.., AND I cant get my reward credit because we paid cash 
That makes me mad in a way but server, she was great!
