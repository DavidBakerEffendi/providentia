I made a long drive up to Desert Ridge to buy a side burner to go in my new outdoor kitchen. My sales consultant was Ramiz. He was very helpful, super friendly and mad sure everything fit into my car perfectly. I wanted to buy the whole store because they have so many realy cool items. I will certainly come back as we continue to work on my new project. Make suure you ask for Ramiz!
