I came in on a Tuesday evening around 6:30pm and the place was starting to fill up.....a good sign indeed.
The vibe here felt great and decor here is simply gorgeous! Rustic wood floors, butcher block tables, candle light, heated patio, stone walls, and dimming lights while you dine, make it the perfect setting for a romantic night out!

Our waitress for the evening was sweet and attentive and informed us of the nightly special. 

Love the fresh rosemary bread & black olives they bring over with the peppers in oil + balsamic & olive oil

To start

Polenta Fries w/ Gorgonzola dip
Golden brown, beautifully stacked, the creamy dip is delicious plus it also came with a side of marinara which I also enjoyed

Plopettine mini meatballs w/tomato sauce
Juicy & plump in a flavorful sauce with cloves of roasted garlic and charred bread on the side is another winner

Main

Pollo Pizza
Stone baked pizza with tomato, mozzarella, grilled chicken, and pancetta
Generous strips of pancetta are coiled on the pizza with slices of tender chicken, perfectly thin and crisp crust and you can definitely taste that wood fire.

Dessert

Chocolate Budino with roasted hazelnuts
Creamy chocolatey hazlenutty ball of mousse coated in milk chocolate topped with roasted hazlenuts and hidden in the center on a delicious crispy flaky oat crust was the perfect finish to an amazing meal

Ambiance, Service, and Food is all around great! Portion sizes are large and food comes out at a great pace, we never once felt rushed or neglected (pizza came after we finished our appetizers and tables were cleared) fresh, hot & delicious. A true reflection of the great options Yorkville has to offer.
