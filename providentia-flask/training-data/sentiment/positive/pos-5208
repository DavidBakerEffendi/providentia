The location is in the old British Open pub. Same layout and bar but they elevated it with nice table settings.
I am not Jamaican. I did however live in the CariCom community in Guyana and there are multiple carryovers from Jamaica. I knew it would be exciting when I saw selfish, ackee, and plantains on the menu.
Ordering online is super easy and then it's ready when you want for pickup.
We ordered the conch fritters. With the delicious curry dipping sauce, the flavor has a nice spring to it. It's a light fritter and comes in 6 pieces, pan fried.
Our entree of saltfish and ackee was delightful. The creamy texture of the ackee and the slight chewy and saltiness of the fish is such a great combo. The side of red beans and rice and steamed cabbage took me back to my village in Guyana. But the Rasta Pasta was just so incredibly top notch. 
The fettuccini was cooked perfectly and the earthy mushrooms with the tart sundried tomatoes just made this dish so delicious.
We took this order to go bit when I arrived to pick up, the lady who brought out the order...maybe she was the owner...was so darn friendly. And the portions are enough for next day lunch and dinner!
I really hope we get to try more of this fantastic establishment.
