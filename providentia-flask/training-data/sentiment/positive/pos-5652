It takes a big person (in this case at least 5'2") to admit they were wrong and boy was I wrong!  I have tried this restaurant two times before with lukewarm results but last night was so good, I am still thinking about it.  I ordered a steak this time.  The filet was so tender, literally you could cut it with a fork.  The meat melted in your mouth.  Probably the best steak I have had in months.  Hubby had rack of ribs with Cheer Wine sauce that had a wonderful kick to it.  But our service was impeccable.  Forgive me, I know his name started with a D and he introduced himself as De-Nice I think.  He offered up a wonderful red blend wine and knew our needs even before we asked.  I understand there have been some staffing changes and it appears all for the good.  New menu items were introduced by the wait staff.  Don't you just love it when a waitperson actually knows the menu, right down to how a dish is prepared.  De-Nice detailed the new items and then offered up suggestions.  I can highly recommend Block and Grinder for a great dining experience.  And ask for De-Nice - because he was the bomb!
