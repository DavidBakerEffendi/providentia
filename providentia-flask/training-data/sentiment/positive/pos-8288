Another delightful dinner at Roy's.  Never do they fail to impress.  All the dishes here are such an incredible blend of flavors and I look forward to what the chef has decided to make his special. Couple that with fantastic cocktails and you have another enjoyable evening.  I saw some friends there that i had recommended to the restaurant and they were raving and thanking me for sending them there.  I never get tired of eating at this great place.
