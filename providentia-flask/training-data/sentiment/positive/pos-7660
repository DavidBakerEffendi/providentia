I came here today after going to china town and getting a bunch of goodies.For a appitizer i got the cream cheese puffs.I've not seen any one menchin that they don thave any green onions like most places,wich makes me happy becuase i dont like it when they do have that.For my mean i got sweet and spicy chicken with no veggies,chicken chow mein with no veggies.It was all very good and very tasty just like usual the only thing i do have  to say is that the chicken in the chow mein tasted kind of funny...not sure why.Other then that ill defently be back :)
