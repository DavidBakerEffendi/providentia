Ok.....Here it is from the girl who is VERY picky and can usually find problems with quality or price of food....

Went to Five Guys for the first time....

I am proud to say I could not find ANYTHING that could have been improved on!

I got what they call a small cheeseburger....it was 1/4 pd juicy and yummy tasting burger and quite ample!

You get to pick any of the toppings you want....impressive.....

They used the perfect amount of condiments giving the burger an evenly tasty bite every time.

The fries were awesome....we also tried cacun fries which added a nice bite.

I felt the price was reasonable and definately worth it!

For me to find this burger near perfect is rare....very rare.... I HIGHLY reccomend you check Five Guys out!
