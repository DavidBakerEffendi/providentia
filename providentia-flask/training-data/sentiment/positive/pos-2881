Happened to be in this shopping center at a different business today and decided to stop in and check this place out. I ordered the Hot Thai Chicken with brown rice and it was DELICIOUS!!! They asked how hot I wanted it from 1-5 so I safely went with 3. Thank goodness I did a 3 cuz it was SPICY!!! I will definitely be back soon to check out more of the menu! Very reasonably priced too!
