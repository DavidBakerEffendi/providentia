What's not to love? Their house margaritas are the best in town, and with happy hour their prices are even better. Their food is classic gourmet Mexican with a twist. I love their Sunday brunch!!  Their Juevos Rancheros was deeelicious (the Bloody Maria, too!) And the hot salsa they serve with their chips is my favorite. The service also gets 5 stars, whether it's their servers or bartenders. Expect a wait on Saturday nights, but that's pretty much with anywhere.
