Vic still continues to amaze me with his innovations!  I absolutely love that he makes all of his sauces himself. This is about as gourmet of a hot dog as you can get while still be totally laid back and casual. 

I don't work Uptown anymore, so unfortunately for me that means less trips to see Vic. When he posted his specials today, I knew that I had to head uptown for lunch.  Special #1: Mac 'n cheese, chili & crumbled bacon. Special #2: peanut butter & his homemade bacon jam.

That homemade bacon jam is truly out of this world --- Vic, pleasssssse start to use this on a more regular basis. It would be a great accompaniment to many of your existing dogs.

Keep innovating the hot-dog world and putting that Vic man 'soul' into each of your ideas!
