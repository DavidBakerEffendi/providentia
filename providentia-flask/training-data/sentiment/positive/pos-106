We came out for Jen's UYE and was extremely impressed with the atmosphere, d√©cor, service and food.  We came during lunch hour and it was such a great time with about a dozen of us.  We ordered the burger with the fried egg and the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and both were wonderfully prepared. Definitely did not skip on the quality of ingredients.  We now plan to visit for dinner
