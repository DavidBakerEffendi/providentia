The girls and I went for lunch and they introduced me to this gem.

The cafe is busy, so make sure you have time to swing by. Although it was busy, they took our order pretty fast and brought it out within minutes! It's tucked away in the back of the shopping plaza and is a bit small inside but it adds to its charm.

The food they offer is a variety of salads, wraps, and sandwiches. I nabbed the cobb wrap and a peanut butter fudge brownie. Let me tell you, that cobb wrap was perfection. It was packed to the brim with egg, lettuce, avocado, bacon and delicious crumbles. It even came with a small cookie on the side. I decided to eat half since it was so huge, I was filling up fast. I wanted to leave some room for the brownie and boy did it not disappoint. It was rich but not overly chocolatey either.

I told my husband about it and now he's begging me to bring some home. Thanks Bertha's, you are now my new addiction!
