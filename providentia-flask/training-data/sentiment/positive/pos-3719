We happened to come across back room burger after a morning at the spa and decided to take a chance.  We are glad that we did. Our waiter Mutlu helped me choose my drink and I got the most wonderful marshmallow shake from the boozer menu. Our burgers were yummy and the service was spot on. Would come back here in a minute. Good job staff.
