Hmmmmm, this place was recommended to me 2 years ago, but I forgot to go.  Then I found them on Yelp... and remembered the previous referral.  I've been several times, and every time it has been amazing.  The inside is very cute!  There are plenty of tables, so they can accommodate a frequent flow of guests for such a small place.  Service has always been excellent.  The price is very reasonable for the quality of food.  I love it.
