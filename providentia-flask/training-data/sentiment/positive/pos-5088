All you need to know is that this is one of the best free attractions in Vegas. The fountain show happens every 15 minutes are so and no matter how many times you watch it, you'll never get tired of it. Almost every time that we have been to Vegas we stop to watch the water show, and we always record it! This attraction is best at night!
