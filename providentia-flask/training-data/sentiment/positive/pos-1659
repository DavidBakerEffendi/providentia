From the modest menu selection one can choose tasty entrees, a delicious main course and a sweet dessert prepared by an accomplished chef for a reasonable price.

They also have the occasional all-you-can-eat buffets. The last one I tried was the Tastes of Italy, featuring a gastronomic tour of traditional Southern Italian cuisine. Definitely a trip to remember.
