Quick, simple, no hassle  Indian food. Menu is pretty impressive for a small shop like this. Friendly service and great prices. 
Was worried about there not being a lot of choices but I was wrong. They have a lunch menu, a dinner menu, catering menu, and not to mention ice cream  can't go wrong with that . Will be back soon!
