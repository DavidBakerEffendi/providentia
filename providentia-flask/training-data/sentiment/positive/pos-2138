This is fast food. 

The price is cheap and you get a lot of food. The register kids and drive thru are friendly and helpful. I always double check my orders and they get it right 90 per cent of the time. This is fast food. 

If you want high end service or food - then go somewhere that charges a lot more. If you want a quick, cheap meal - check out this Wendy's location.

I highly recommend it!
