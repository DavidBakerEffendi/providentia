Hands down one of the best restaurants I've been to in Arizona! 

The food is exceptional. If you order the Linguine and Clams, come hungry. The bowl is literally overflowing with clams. I've never seen this many served in a dish anywhere I've ever been. You will not be disappointed. Presentation is immaculate and flavor cannot be described. We also had the Chicken Picatta which was equally fabulous as well. I have a feeling I will be trying every item on this menu though.  From what I could tell, this is a place where you don't ever leave unhappy!

We ordered the special - which includes a bottle of wine, a salad per person, and entree per person. Best deal out there for $65!! 

On top of the wonderful food and customer service, the owner, George, sees to it that you have an amazing dinner experience. You WILL be treated like family. If you don't believe this level of personal experience exists in Scottsdale, you just haven't been here yet.
