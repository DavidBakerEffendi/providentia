OK this is a work of art restaurant and it is officially my favourite one this year :)
We got the five course tasting menu and each dish was a wow.   
First of all the presentation is amazing and each dish is gorgeous.   They cook with flowers so it adds both to appearance and taste.   The flavours come together to form a sort of poem in food... I can't praise this place enough if you could give them more than five stars I would.
The service was impeccable-  we have special food requirements and they were able to accommodate us while changing the dishes creatively so they still tasted amazing.   Furthermore the wine recommended to us by the sommelier was just perfect.   All in all this is a gem of a restaurant and by the way the price for such a treasure is beyond reasonable.
