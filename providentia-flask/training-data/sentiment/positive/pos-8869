I have only been here for lunch, and go about twice a month. The food is great, I never knew there were so many ways to modify a meatball - sauce, cheese, on appetizers, on salads and everything else!! 

You have to check out their meatball of the month. They had one back in March that was corned beef with sauerkraut! You don't have to wait long for the food and the service at the bar has always been very good.

They have 32 cold beers on tap and are always changing the lineup, never a bad thing!
