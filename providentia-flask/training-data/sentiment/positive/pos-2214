We've been here many times, but I forget to review it.  Food is pretty good,  crowded but steady seating- wait is short. You can do call ahead seating up to an hour ahead.  When you are seated,  it is with warm rolls and honey butter. 

We were here tonight for a birthday dinner,  party of 8, including 3 kids.  Waiter was great. He was attentive,  checked in enough but not so much.  His name was David- definitely one of the nicest we've ever had there. Thanks!
