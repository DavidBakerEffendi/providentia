This is a beer lover's dream come true.  Their draught selection is top notch and each beer gets poured in a glass it was intended to be served in which really highlights the beer's distinct qualities.  I was really surprised at the good prices here as well considering where it is located.  I've paid much more at jack Astors for shittier beer. The bartender was great and really knew his stuff.  Will definitely return when in the area.
