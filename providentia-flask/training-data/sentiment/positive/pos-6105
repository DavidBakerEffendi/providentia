What a gem.  The live jazz, great server, fresh drinks and crepes were to die for here.  The courtyard patio that is mostly covered but still gives you the fresh air experience is one of the best I've ever sat on.  The prices are a bit steep but the entire experience was worth it because when we were eating there was live jazz playing all through the afternoon.  A great spot, one of my favourite places now in Montreal.
