Eye caramba!
  Hidden in a semi deserted strip mall, is a taco place worth discovering. As I made a U turn on Decatur and meadows lane I saw this taco sign by the sidewalk and my car automatically pulled in into the parking lot and there it was! tucked away in the corner of the lonely shopping mall. Tacos Los tarascos..they may be hard to find but very easy to love. The place is clean, service is great and the food is very good as well, I had the classic tacos de asada, they carry all the basic tacos you find in all the other taco establishments but if you feel venturous you can also try tacos of.....ready?.. Head, cheek, tongue, lip, and the most Interesting.....eye tacos! You might want to look into this, they are guaranteed to please your taste buds. ( so I was told )
 I was the only one at the place at the time but one other person that ordered to go, I was not really surprised since the place is kind of hard to see from the street, but I'm sure once people find out about it it should do OK.
                                                                          All it needs is a little yelp from a friend.
