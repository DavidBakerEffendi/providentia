Thanks to the great reviews on yelp I decided to give Pan Asia a try. Walked in and was immediately greeted by David! he helped me understand exactly what I was ordering since it was my first time there. After 10-15 minutes food came right out. Ended up loving everything I ordered. Few days later Took my mom to try it out might I mention she is a very picky eater but I knew she would love this place and she did!
