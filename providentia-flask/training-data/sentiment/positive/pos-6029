Dined here on 3/2/18 and it was a fantastic experience! We ordered a selection of appetizers, entrees and sushi. The sushi here is different that the sushi you will get at a normal sushi place. It's a Peruvian fusion so it has a different feel to it, but still delicious! We also ordered some of their wagyu beef which is expensive but SO worth it! You get to cook it yourself on a hot rock at the table and they bring a selection of sauces and seasonings to make it an adventure. All of the entrees were amazing, we had the sea bass skewers, which came with Peruvian corn that was absolutely delicious! 
For appetizers we had the yellowtail tacos as well as the beef ones, and an appetizer with a scallop that I can't remember the name of. I had a pisco sour to drink which tasted just like the ones I had in Peru. The service was stellar and our drinks, including our hot tea, were always kept full. All in all, I will be back, and soon!
