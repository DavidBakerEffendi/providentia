I come here at least 2 times per month for drinks and wings. I have had fast service each visit and the food is good. They have changed the wings and added some additional flavors, had the chilli lime tonight and they were perfect. Every night the bar has some special .. I especially like Monday nights for 3 olive vodka s only $3.
