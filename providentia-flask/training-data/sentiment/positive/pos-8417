I'm not sure what is new that I can add that hasn't already been said. Vic's street-side hot dog show is one to see (and taste) to believe. While walking down Tryon I saw the line already forming at 11 and knew exactly what was going on. Even though you may have to wait a bit, Vic provides an experience that is worth the wait. On this particular day he was spinning stories about winning big at high stakes bingo on a recent Disney cruise he took with his family (not a huge surprise considering his mickey mouse T-shirt that matched his tattoos), but talking with others around me this is the kind of light hearted funny banter you can expect from Vic. Then there are the hot dogs. His names are none other than creative, and I ended up ordering three hot dogs since I'm never in uptown at this time. The Frito Dog I ordered was definitely my favorite followed closely by his hot dog of the day with bacon and mac-n-cheese. The fact he grills his dogs and buns and has some amazing home sauces creates a unique flavor. In the midst of the Charlotte gourmet hot dog movement, Vic is certainly worth a visit.
