Just went here for the second time this week.  I'm so glad I found another great local restaurant that is semi-close by.  And especially glad to have a great Thai restaurant nearby.  The food is soooooo fresh and hot when it gets to the table, the flavors are fabulous, and David gives wonderful service.  I love the soups and every dish I've tried.  My favorite is the pad thai (with tofu).  Best pad thai I have had.  I will still go to Panna Thai once in a while because I like that style of Tom Yum soup, but I will be going here more often for everything else.  I haven't had room for dessert yet, but hopefully next time I'll have room for the tempura cheesecake.  My friends that I've gone with really enjoyed this place, as well, and they will be switching from their old go-to Thai places to this one.
