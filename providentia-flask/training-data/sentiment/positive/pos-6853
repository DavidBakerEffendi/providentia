The fountains at the Bellagio are still one of the best free attractions on the strip -- jets of water choreographed to opera, classical or pop songs. It runs throughout the day every 15-30 minutes. The streets are always busy with tourists waiting in line to see it. Many of the Bellagio restaurants have balconies or windows overlooking the show, so if you're dining in one of them request a seat with a view. If you're on the street and want to watch, my favorite place to view it is actually closer to the hotel lobby and porte-coch√®re, which has an overlook and tends to be less busy than the area right off the strip.
