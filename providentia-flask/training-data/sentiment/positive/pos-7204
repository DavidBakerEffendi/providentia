Soooo worth the wait in line!! Been to Shake Shack in NYC and in Miami, this place is just unreal. Burgers are perfect and melt in your mouth. Fries are ok, not competing with Five Guys, but if you add cheese and bacon...we'll now it's a different story! Shakes and concretes are nice adds and if you donate 2$ when you visit to feeding children you're given a free shake on you next visit which is really cool. Come prepared to wait in line but trust that it's worth the wait!!
