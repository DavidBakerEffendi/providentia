Always a good place for Italian. We had a mushroom, black olive, and meatball pizza and we each got a pasta plate. I had the Linguine Alla bolognese and my husband had the Linguine and Sausage. 

The food was terrific, served piping hot, the linguine just al dente, the bolognese with meat ragu was thick and filled with pieces of meat. Every bite was stuffed with it. My husbands came with four big pieces of sausage and was excellent as well. 

The pizza was crusted bottom, with a little sweetness to it. A great pizza now and the other half tomorrow will be just as good!
