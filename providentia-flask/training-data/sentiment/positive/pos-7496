Super casual, super good food for a quick bite.  I was in the area and Yelp came to the rescue.  This place was small but clean in a strip mall that I would have never gone to without the great reviews.  Glad I did, they made me a sandwich without the bread since I am trying to limit my gluten and it came out fantastic.  Wish I could remember what it was called but I am sure everything here is great with the pride they put into their products and service.
