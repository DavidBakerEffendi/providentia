Stopped by at the best Taiwanese restaurant in the valley hands down!! Everything is good here...started with one of the best pig ear appetizer anywhere...followed by beef pie (number 100 on menu), and then little dragon dumplings!! Their Taiwanese beef noodle is pretty good as well!! All perfectly made!!
