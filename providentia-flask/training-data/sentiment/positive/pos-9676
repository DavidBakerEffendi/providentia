This food is GOOD. When my boyfriend suggested we pop into this little hole in the wall restaurant I was a bit skeptical but the bold flavors in the meat and salsas were amazing.

I ordered the cardne asada burrito and my boyfriend ordered the chicken burrito. It came with 2 different salsas on the side. One had chunks of onion, tomato, bell peppers in it and you could almost eat it as a salad. Good amounts of meat. mmmm meat. 

The only thing I suggest is ordering ahead of time. It took a good 15 minutes for our order to come out. Considering i'm on a punch-in, punch-out timeclock at work may have made the wait seem a bit much. Next time I want to know what the guac and tacos are all about.
