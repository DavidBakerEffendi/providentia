I had their beef kabob platter tonight for dinner. I must say I was very pleasantly surprised!  It rivaled food you get in most Persian restaurants. My wife had the lamb and beef combo and it was very good. It's an unassuming place where a lot of people get take out although you could also eat there if you wanted to. Friendly staff. Will definitely eat here again.
