We've lived here for over 2 years and recently discovered this quaint place when C4 shut down.  We've been here in the AM and late at night and we love it!  The breakfast food is delish.  You have to try the poptart or their cinnamon bun.  Their hot chocolate is also tasty, and not too sweet.  The prices are very reasonable.  I prefer this place to Starbucks.  In the PM the live music is awesome.  The ambiance is relaxing no matter what time of day you come.
