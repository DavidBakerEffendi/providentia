Went to Canyon Creek last night for our long overdue anniversary dinner. Choose this particular restaurant because the hubby is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. The service was stellar, Anthony was our server, he was very attentive and had a great table manner. Had the calamari to start, very good, loved the garlic aioli.  We both ordered steaks, I had the steak and lobster mashed potatoes accompanied by asparagus, all very tasty and cooked perfectly. My husband had the New York 12 oz with a loaded baked potato. He declared it the best steak he's had in years. Dessert and specialty coffee followed to complete an overall great meal. Loved the lighting and ambiance, our booth was quite cozy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a really great steak dinner. Top notch!
