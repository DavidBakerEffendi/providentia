Ever since Daily Kitchen opened I have wanted to try it. Being a fan of "au naturale" eateries, DK is as good as I'd hoped. Upon entering it suggests that trendy modern meets organic kitchen feel that has been become more popular. Dark green booths and black utilitarian chairs paired with wooden planked walls definitely holds that back to the earthy basics vibe. 
We ordered a DK Relief shot (Apple, ginger, lemon, turmeric) which was super fresh and yummy tasting. I also ordered a turkey burger that is was delicious! Probably the best turkey burger I have had in awhile. Generous amounts of avocado, tomato and sprouts stacked one on top of the other, was quite satisfying. Sweet potato fries are also included. My friend ordered the DK acai bowl and said it was really good, better than the Jamba Juice version across the road. 
My bill for DK juice shot, turkey burger and a bottle of aloe water was $17 and change. 
I'll definitely return to DK, next I'd like to try the Pitaya bowl, chicken tinga tacos, ahi tuna tacos, soba noodle bowl or turkey chili with quinoa. The smoothies and other juices look pretty yummy, too. 
They have long tables with plug-ins for your laptops or cell phone chargers, it is a casual atmosphere that is nice for lunch with friends or for doing work on your laptop and grabbing a bite. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner options. 
Nice bonus; kids eat for free on Sundays!
