Found out about this buffet here on Yelp. Read a lot of really good reviews so we came to see for ourselves.  Had no idea from the outside that this delicious restaurant was in here. The windows are dark and hide all the yummy food from view.... But I highly recommend you go inside . It was fabulous. Lots of different foods - including a really fresh sushi bar. There is many types of Chinese foods as well as a lot of salads and desserts.  Don't miss this place on your eating out list . You won't regret it
