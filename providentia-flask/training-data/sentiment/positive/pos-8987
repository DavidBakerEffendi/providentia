Best Indian restaurant I've been to in the Charlotte area.

What they may lack in ambiance (it is relatively spartan, although they do decorate for Christmas by hanging ornaments from the ceiling), they make up with their huge menu options that are prepared quickly and deliciously. 

I appreciate that they serve the classics (palak paneer, malai kofta, etc), but also uthappam (think a pancakey pizza) and even some of the less seen southern Indian items, such as dosa (those comically EMORMOUS crepe-looking things you sometimes see, but never know what it is called so you never order. Yah, those). 

The food is consistently tasty, well-spiced, and decently priced. And vegetarians rejoice--you can't go wrong as it is all meatless!

Plus, they have fantastic gulab jamoon for dessert--deep fried doughy cheese balls in rose water. Nom nom nom!!!!
