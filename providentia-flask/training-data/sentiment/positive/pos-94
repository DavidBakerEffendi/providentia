This is my favourite place for Pho. I just love the flavour of their broth.  Very few places can even close to matching it. I like the fact that the pho comes out steaming hot. I like putting in the raw sprouts when it's steaming hot and by the time I'm half done my bowl, the sprouts are just perfectly blanched in the soup.

I agree that the decor leaves a lot to be desired.. but really, I'd rather go to a place that has phenomenal food and so-so decor than a place with phenomenal decor and so-so food. If I wanted phenomenal decor, I'd go for fine dining.

Pho Pasteur is very consistent. I'm most impressed that their broth tastes the same time after time. In the summer time, I tend to stay away from pho because the weather is warm outside. So instead, I ordered their charbroil pork and spring rolls with vermicelli. Again, time after time, the pork is perfectly seasoned and grilled. I'm always so impressed at how flavourful and tender their charbroiled pork is. The spring rolls there are also my favourite. The wrapper they use is different than most places. They actually use the soaked rice paper instead of traditional egg roll wrappers. This gives the spring rolls a little bit of chewiness while being crisp.

This place is always busy during lunch, lined up out the door. However, I'm most impressed at how quick their service is. Once seated and the order put it, the food is usually out in less than 10 mins. I'm usually done lunch in half hour there.
