It had been too long. I almost wanted to slap myself for going without such impeccable food for so long. When we decided to stick to brown rice and no noodles, we stopped visiting because when we would call, they would say, "No brown rice," but after months, we decided to call again yesterday, and heard, "Yes, we have brown rice."

Oh happy day.

I was smart to give Pan Asian 5 stars the first two times. Massaman is definitely the dish to devour. What really struck me yesterday, the quality of ingredients. Everything is fresh and top notch, even their tofu tastes better. I hope they keep up the brown rice because I need this in my life.
