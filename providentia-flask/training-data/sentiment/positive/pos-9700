This place is great! The sauce isn't watery and the owner prides themselves in consistency. We ordered 2 lb of shrimp, 1 lb king crab, chicken wing basket, and fried calamari. Best sauce was the urban mix. The owner was friendly and chatted with us for a bit. This is probably now my fav place for cajun style seafood!
