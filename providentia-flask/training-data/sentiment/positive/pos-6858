This is my favorite delivery Chinese restaurant of all time!! They are quick, consistent, and Good! Seriously, I'm picky about Chinese food. I know it's pretty much all the same, but does it have to be bad? King Fong says No! It does not. You will not find the exotic, but you will find all the standards, done well. Delivery is quick-- they say 45 minutes, but it usually is less. So, remember to tip your driver.
