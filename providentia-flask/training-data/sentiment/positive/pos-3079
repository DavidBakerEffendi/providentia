This place is a must try. The Hibachi Shrimp Fried Rice is to die for. I have never had fried rice this good. The service for great. I am the type of person who is nervous to try new foods.

I had the fried alligator and it was good.

There was not one thing that was ordered that was not delicious. We even ordered food to go home with, even though we didn't finish our food. The potions were great as well.
