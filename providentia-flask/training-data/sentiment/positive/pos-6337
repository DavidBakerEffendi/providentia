Friendly!

Loving the Chunk Strawberry Topper!!! It has fresh cut bananas on top, strawberries, peanut butter, non fat yogurt, soymilk, pumpkin flax seed granola...sounds delicious right? Well it is. I would like to venture out and try the others like this but they sound kinda tart. There is a berry, mango, and acai topper...maybe next time.

On occasion I get the wheat grass shot for fun. It's nasty tasting but it is supposed to be good for ya.

Oh and fun seat dancing music while you wait.
