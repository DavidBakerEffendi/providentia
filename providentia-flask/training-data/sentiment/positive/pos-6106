My family ate here for the first time tonight and loved it. Large (free) parking lot and a really cute and nice establishment. Food was great, nice beer selection and cocktails. Our two-year-old even ate everything we put in front of her! The candy is a nice touch. We ended our visit with drinks and games on the patio. 

We are looking forward to returning with friends and family.
