Had my first Hudson's experience today. Absolutely loved it!!! I ordered the PB&J burger and something just didn't taste right after a few bites. I'm sure it was my own taste buds. Anyway, they went above and beyond to correct it. Was sooo impressed by their customer service. I'll definitely be back!!
