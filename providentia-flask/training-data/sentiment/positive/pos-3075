Had a great lunch there this week.  Crispy scallops were delicious my dinning companions had the pad Thai and it was also excellent. we are anxious to return.   Service was also very good and they had a busy lunch crowd.  All in all a home run...and after our awful experience at Jade Palace we needed to to find a good, local oriental restaurant...hallelujah!
