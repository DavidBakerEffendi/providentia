Love the new venue.   Such an upgrade from the East Blvd location.

The cocktails are a 10!   They make some of the best drinks in town.  

The menu is nice and varied and I have tried many items from Soft Tacos, to Fajitas, to pork tenderloin.  I'm never disappointed.   The last time I went, I asked for NO Tomatos....my food arrived with tomato all over it.  The waitress realized that happened within 30 seconds from when the food was dropped at the table.... she took it away and a fresh plate was delivered within 3 minutes....it was quite impressive.

Love their Chips and Salsa and Guac.

A visit to Cantina is always a treat and NEVER disappointing.
