Kelly's is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh.  It's the best place to go for reasonably priced (and still very good) cocktails, hipster watching, and chill conversation with friends.  

They always have a good number of drafts on hand.  The sweet potato fries are my favorite, followed closely by the tofu tacos.  

The booths fill up fast.  Also, the bar doesn't open until 5PM, so don't show up at 4:30PM for happy hour.
