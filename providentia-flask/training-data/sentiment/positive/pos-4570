Consistently great service, food, and timely delivery! :)

We have been ordering from King Wok for nearly a year now. So far we are quite pleased!

We also order from other spots, but this mum and pop shop have been the most consistent with the quality of food, delivery, and customer service.

We have recommended this place to our mates, work colleagues, and lived ones. For the most part, they are happy with the service King Wok has provided.
