Went in here the other day in search of a coffee and muffin but was pleasantly surprised when I found out they served sit down meals as well. Brunch time yas!

First off- This place is so aesthetically pleasing. From the menus to the art on the wall- it's all just so pretty! I ended up getting the breakfast wrap and " brunchifying" my meal. Pretty much you're just adding salad and home fries to your breakfast sammy but it's totally worth it if you're hungry. 

I can for sure see my self coming here a lot , especially in the summer. Must go back to try their lunch menu out!
