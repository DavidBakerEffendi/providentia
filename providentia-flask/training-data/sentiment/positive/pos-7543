While checking out the new 7th Street Market, we decided to have lunch there. Pure Pizza it is! The setup is nice; you order & pay at the same place & everything is made right there in plain view. 

And the choices...you have plenty! They offer several tasty options for specialty pizzas, but you can make your own as well.  They also offer options for salads, but you can make your own, too.

We decided to go with the 10" Pepperoni Supreme with the original crust (you can also choose whole wheat crust), which gave us four pieces total - & nice sized four pieces at that. I love that they use local ingredients.

The employees are friendly & attentive...& quick. We didn't have to wait long to get out pizza.  It was hot & fresh & ooooh....they give you a small container of honey for the crust! It's the little things! The pizza was delicious. The crust wasn't extremely
"dough-y", which is good.

Seating is plentiful, but you're sharing that common area with the other vendors - so beware, it may get busy.

They have a cooler full of drinks...soft drinks, wine, the yummy Dr. Brown sodas, & water, among other choices.

I'm really pleased with Pure Pizza & will definitely be back!
