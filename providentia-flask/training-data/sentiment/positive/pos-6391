All Panda Expresses I've been to are pretty much the same. The difference between this one and other ones is the staff. 

They have these 3 Filipiniana girls (didn't catch their names) that had the best customer service. Very friendly, welcoming and over all made my dinning experience great.  The restaurant was clean and very organized. 

My top favorite things to order:
-Tofu Eggplant 
-Mushroom Chicken 
-Chicken Breast & green beans 
-Orange Chicken 
-Walnut Shrimp 
-Potstickers (don't forget the sauce)

**Check inn on Yelp when you get there and you get 1 free entree :)
