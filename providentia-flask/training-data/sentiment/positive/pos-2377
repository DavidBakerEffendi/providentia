Our favorite pizza in Madison, (for the kids, along with Bellitalia: different, but both very authentic with delicious red sauces). We are SO happy EatStreet delivers Salvatore's now, we will now be weekly customers! All the specialty pizzas are amazing, we try a new one every visit. The plain tomato pie satisfies our NYC cravings! And don't hesitate to put figs on your pizza, you think you don't like them, here at our house the one with figs went fastest!
