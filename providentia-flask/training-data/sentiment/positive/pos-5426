This is our go-to pizza delivery/take-out place. We love the original crust pizza and will either get the all meat or half extra cheese/pepperoni option. They are always willing to help me make the pizza my own. I really love their boneless wings, but my family enjoys the bone-in better. I like to pick-up my pizza so I can make my own salad from the salad bar. Dining in is also fun. The pizza tastes great. Everything Is fresh and delicious. If we dine in, I always get my own thin crust veggie. Employees are nice. Go enjoy!
