I'm hardly in the area but when I do for a short period of time (between 3pm to 5pm *ahem says a lot*) I always hit 'The Wicket' because Nigel (owner) is AWESOME! There's plenty of bar that I could be in (because there's a lot) but I always come back because of the environment and amostphere. Just like Nigel his staff and regulars are personable and friendly. If you want a good vibe, this is the place!
