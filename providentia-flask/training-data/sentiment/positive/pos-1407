If you haven't heard, Snakes & Lattes is Toronto's first board-game cafe with the simple premise of offering good coffee, sweets and sandwiches in a friendly, social environment galvanized by the fun, competitive and strategic play of board games. 

Snakes and Latte's opened all of six days ago. I visited today (Sunday) for the first time and was met with standing-room only floor space and a 10 minute wait for a table. I spent brief wait sipping on a delicious coffee and browsing the ridiculously comprehensive selection of games lining a 40 foot section of wall from floor to ceiling - and yes they have (insert board game name here) that game too.

Face-to-screen video games like Rock Band and Mario Party are so 2000 - in 2010 the face-to-face, hands-on interaction of board games, combined with the nostalgia many associate with certain titles from their youth is fueling their comeback in a big way. Based on the smiling faces and room-wide chatter of friends and strangers interacting seamlessly in this brand new space, I'd say the time is ripe for this sort of a business.

If you have even a moderate interest in games you should check this place out, if you are a gamer at heart, beware as you will find yourself pleasantly overwhelmed by the possibilities of whiling away hours gaming and making new friends. First date? Make it Snakes and Lattes for the original, fun and interactive possibilities and your date will surely be impressed.

Oh by the way, the Liquor License Application in the from window means that this place is only going to get better - drinking Catan anyone?
