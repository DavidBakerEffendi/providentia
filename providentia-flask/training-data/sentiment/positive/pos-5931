Best breakfast spot in the west end! Food is spectacular, service is excellent and they have Caesars that are to die for. They are busy but if there is a wait, you can take a walk about and they'll text you when your table is ready. It's never more that 15 minutes. I recommend the Gordy, but there's something for everyone!
