Most favorite place for shawarma and donairs... writing this review because I am craving it lol. Solid food and service that is attentive and efficient. So many other food items along the line that you can purchase as well. Great value! Visit here if you haven't. All is delish. Only recommendation would be for them to fix the setup a little as the way it is organized causes a bit of a wait where if you order more than one item, then there's a good chance there will be an additional wait time for each item. The orders are not linked to each other and not worked on at the same time. So what ends up happening is some people after you may get their orders before you. Can't be mad though, still worth it haha!
