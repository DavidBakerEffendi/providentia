The fact that this franchise is expanding so much makes me so happy!!! Perfect for anyone needing their healthy fix or just simply like the taste of fruits and veggies! Decor is light and airy, perfect location in the Biltmore area, it's around so many other stores/shops! 

They have plenty of juice/smoothie options for any tastebud, and they have recently added new menu items like the skoop nice cream (wooooo!!) and the "blended juices" (meh). I've tried everything under the sun basically but my favorite juices are "The Buzz" and "Toxin Flush", favorite smoothie is "Tropical Cooler", and favorite bowl is the "Pitaya Bowl"! Can't go wrong with any menu item but those are my staples. They also have pre-made juice cleanses and snacks in the cooler? (Don't know what to call it). They even have an app, which I find very useful because you get a free menu item when you scan the app after 10 purchases, they're always sending updates on deals and whatnot, and they even now have ordering delivery, whaaaat?! 

All in all, quality quality place, so glad it's in my life! Only thing is that I noticed the prices are slowly starting to go up, maybe because of such the drastic growth? Still worth it to me! :)
