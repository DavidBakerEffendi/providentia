I cannot believe how utterly indescribable the food and overall experience was at Avenue B. My boyfriend brought me and his parents here while they were visiting for Easter. We haven't stopped talking about this restaurant since. I would go into lengthy detail about the food we ate, which we shared with each other, but I will just list out what we ate and include some pictures. Our server was very kind and attentive, even though we were kind of a pain to start out with because of the 3 bottles of wine at our table. And lastly, Avenue B may be quite pricey, but it is worth every cent. Please, go here, at least once in your life.

Appetizers: PEI mussels (for the whole table, they were in a smoky, rich tomato sauce...we practically licked the bowl clean), salad (for the parents, I'm not sure what it was), soup (for us, smoked cheddar & onion bisque, bacon jam, broccoli tempura - this was my absolute favorite thing)
