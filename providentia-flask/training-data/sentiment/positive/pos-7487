Oh Panera, you've made your way to Canada.. Welcome! Ok I'll be honest, I've never heard of this place before about a week ago when my sissy mentioned it to me in passing.  Well if you know me, you'll know my name is synonymous with bread, so at the earliest time, I went.  

This place is packed to the max, the lines were the longest I've ever seen for a bread bakery place. Crazy! it's ironically in the same location as where Krispy Kremes used to be... I hope Panera isn't just a fade that faded faster than Krispy Kreme could bring out a fresh batch of glazed donuts.  

They have so many different types of artisan bread, it was carb heaven! They also make sandwiches, which were a little pricey. Everything was pretty pricey, but the quality is pretty worth it. I got the Asiago Demi loaf, as well as a chocolate chip muffin cap.  The demi loaf (a smaller loaf) was $3.29 which I guess isn't too bad. Bagels were priced at $1.39 each or a dozen for $11.99! That's a little too much, especially since you can go to other bakeries and get a dozen for like $5.  

Anyway, I like this place. It's not a place I would go to regularly, but if/when I'm in the area, I'll for sure make a stop through...
