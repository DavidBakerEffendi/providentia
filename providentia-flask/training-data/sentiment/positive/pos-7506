Wow!

Very impressive new pub with a great beer selection, excellent food, a very nice (upscale) ambience, and incredible service from  a bevy of attractive and attentive servers. Think Earl's. I had the pizza and it was just excellent, a small pizza was too much for me, I took half of it home. They have some upscale beers that include free glasses to take home, wing nights (no take out), nice booths and lots of TV's.
