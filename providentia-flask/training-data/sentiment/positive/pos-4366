Love this place. Food is always amazing and I get the hummus which everyone should get if you ever go here because it is so good! All of the portions are huge which leave you very full and you definitely get your money's worth here. The place can be pretty loud though because of the super high ceilings and the concrete floors but that's fine with me and you can always sit outside where they have a bunch of fans and umbrellas for hot days. Employees are always nice smiling and asking if everything is good or if you need anything else.
