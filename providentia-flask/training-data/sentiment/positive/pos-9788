Just ordered food for staff of 15 and they were awesome!! The cashier Kaitlin took my order and got everything down and even triple checked my order. Then Alicia from back got my paper I had and offered to write each order separately (which anyone who order food for staff know this is awesome) saves so much time and hassle from people saying they didn't get something. 

Food came out fast and everything was perfect!! Thanks guys for making this easy. 

Food is always awesome here and they always make my life easy.
