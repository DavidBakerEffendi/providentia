5 stars ALL THE WAY!!! first off, when you walk in it's SOOOO CLEAN! and bright. I mean, you can see everything in the kitchen. We are starting off well! The roti is by far, THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. 5 stars for that alone. I seriously can not say enough good things about it. We tried several items and we've been back a few times. The shrimp mango salad is delicious. It has some kick so you might want to mention if you like more or less spicy. I read some reviews that the food is too spicy. I know they read them too because every items we ordered, they double checked the spice level. The service has been great. I think both owners are very friendly. I tried the "fried flat noodle" (sorry, that is NOT the name!) but it was delicious. and OMG, humongous portions!!! I look forward to going back again and trying new things. Everything I've tried so far has been excellent!!!
