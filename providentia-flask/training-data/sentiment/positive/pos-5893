This is a new congee/Chinese restaurant in Mississauga. If you want huge portions for good prices, this is the place to be. 
You will get your usual Chinese restaurant service, but the food and the speed for service is definitely an upside. 
We came for congee and some deep fried doughs. In my opinion no need to super bowl it. The regular/small size is enough for 2-3 to share with other sides. 
Will come back 100% for other parts of the menu.
