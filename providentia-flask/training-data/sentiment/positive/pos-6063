Truly a fantastic dining experience! A genuine fusion between the newly popular genre of "fast casual" and "fine dining". Generous portions, quality food, and impressive ambiance without compromising your wallet. I have yet to find a restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area that ticks all the boxes a restaurant should (good portions, quality food, service, ambiance) while being extremely affordable the way AZ Kabob House does. I love all the entrees, and make sure to save room for dessert, as both the baklava and saffron ice cream are to die for!
