Ninety's was first brought to my attention v√≠a numerous Instagram tags of the most delectable-looking treats. It eventually became too much to handle and I finally gave in to my girlfriends persistence. Boy am I glad I did. 

Tucked in along the Boardwalk in University Area this place is producing ice cream and desserts that both look and taste amazing. I had been wanting to try this place for a while and I intend to return again soon. They have an iPad to help you select what you want, and they can make anything you may have seen on Instagram, even if it is no longer on the menu. 

The decision process was trying, but ultimately we decided to go with some form of a chocolate milkshake with an edible outer rim. It was both unique and delicious. The staff here were very helpful and patient as we explored the endless possibilities. I have to be back.
