All I can say is GREAT!!!
I haven't had a really good meal in a while & thus place really won my heart. I got to pick my own lobster & it was so good, I didn't need to use butter or cut into pieces. I ate the lobster in 4 bites. 2×claw & 2×body meat.
I ordered my filet medium but came out medium rare. I was glad I didn't send it back.
An awesome experience!!!
