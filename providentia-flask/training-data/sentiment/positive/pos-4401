I wish I could give 10 stars. This was probably the best dining experience I've had in years. My best friend brought Andy and I here for my birthday a few weeks ago. The setting is gorgeous. We were immediately greeted with glasses of champagne. Our server Jeremy was truly the best. He was so informative, attentive, and not to mention hysterical. 
We started out with the carpaccio and pepper seared bigeye tuna. The Carpaccio was amazing. Thin sliced beef wrapped around fresh micro greens. And the Tuna was packed with flavor, accompanied with sesame crackers.
For entrees we all got something different. Our friend Brian had the pine nut crusted Lamb, Andy had the grass fed NY Strip, and I had the Surf N Turf. 7oz mouth watering filet with 2 lobster tails in a white truffle and red wine sauce. 
We also had the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and Brussels Sprouts. I'm still craving the mashed potatoes. White truffle sauce with large chunks of fresh main lobster and Yukon potatoes. 
Jeremy brought us over a round of spark plug shots (as if we needed more liquor lol) thanks Jeremy! 
For dessert we were surprised with the house made s'mores. Oh my god. Pumpkin Spice, Orange, and chocolate marshmallows, white and dark chocolate ganache, ghram crackers and vanilla gelato. I added a photo because it was too pretty not to take a million photos. 

All in all this was an amazing experience. I will be telling everyone I meet that's in town to come here. Thanks so much N9NE for making my birthday so memorable!!
