What's not to like!? The best place to kick off a great night out or end one! Fun music, fun people, good atmosphere and vibe! Never been to a Whiskey row that wasn't a blast but the Old Town location is so much fun. It's always a good go to for Drinks with friends or a bite to eat. The servers here are always friendly  and service is quick and quality. What more could you want? If you're a whiskey drinker then you're sleeping if you haven't visited!!
