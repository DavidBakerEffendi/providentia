This place was perfect...cute place, in a great location. Loved the inside and the patio area. Service here was great all around, servers were friendly and took good care of us on our visit.

I had the wingless buffalo dip and I would order that dish a million times and not get tired of it, perfect munchie food too. For my entree I had the Bleu Inside Out Burger and it was amazing, dripping with juicy goodness from the burger and the cheese. I also tried some of my daughter's Salmon BLT, and it was superb. 

I can't wait to come back here and try some of their other dishes. Happy hour specials are great, I had $3 house wine and most of the appetizers are $5, get over there and try it out.
