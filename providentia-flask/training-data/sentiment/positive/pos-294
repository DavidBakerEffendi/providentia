my new local fav, a quaint old home style restaurant. home cooked fresh food. came in on Sunday at 10am no wait but saw people wait a few minutes as food is served quick so tables turn quick. servers are happy nice and positive. very friendly. I ordered a strawberry crepe it was fresh and the whipped cream was fresh an amazing. my friend ordered a large breakfast with sausage and bacon eggs sliced tomatoes and dry wheat toast. it was all fresh and cooked to perfection as ordered. this is the best breakfast place I've been to in scottsdale. youre coffee and water will not go empty
