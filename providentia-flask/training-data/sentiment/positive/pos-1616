I adore this place. Adore. I'll definitely be back.

The decor was so beautiful. It felt like you were in a barn. But nicer than that. You'll have to go see what I mean. 

I ordered the 1/4 chicken (breast and wing) with the peach barbeque sauce, whipped potatoes with chipotle sour cream, cheese and chives, and a biscuit. (Duh, just so I could give a complete review!)

The chicken was the moistest, most flavorful, most succulent chicken I've had in my whole life. The biscuit, which I lightly buttered, was warm and the perfect combination of flaky outside with soft inside. The potatoes were whipped to perfection and didn't need any salt or pepper or anything--just a fork in my mouth. I liked the barbeque sauce too. My fianc√© got a creamy garlic sauce and a jerk sauce. They were both ok but I'll stick with my barbeque. 

Did I mention how moist the chicken was?

So you'll know I'm not completely biased, we also tried the cream corn, and didn't care for it. I think we were both thrown by the mint. 

And for the dessert (again, so I could provide you with this thoughtful review) I had the grand marnier-flavored cinnamon roll. Amazing. I don't typically like nuts in my food, but the texture and flavor of this bun was so perfect, I got over it quickly. And it's so rare to see a cinnamon bun on a restaurant dessert menu!!

In short, we will be back. Delicious.
