Nothing to complain! Absolutely delicious! And the service was just excellent !! I have been here a few times, for lunch and for dinner and never disappointed! For lunch I had a salmon and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned ... just great! For dinner we had a fixed 5 course dinner on valentines and everything was perfect! I love this place and I would go there again and again! Recommended 100%!
