This place is awesome. Reminds me of my favorite joint in Rocky Point. The chicken is juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. The simple menu is done just how it should be. The only thing missing to make it perfect is some shredded cabbage. I personally also like a larger, thinner tortilla but the street tortillas they serve are good. 

Do not be put off by the slightly sketchy looking strip mall, this place is clean inside and the staff is friendly. 

The meals are a good value and you should try the pineapple drink.
