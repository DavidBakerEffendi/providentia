Arrived early to see a movie at Pollak Cinema and decided to check out this unassuming ice cream shop. Warm and inviting, clean, and comfortable.  Casandra welcomed us with a cheerful heart, explained the flavors, and invited us to sample those we were interested in.  I ordered Kaju Draksh and Lightly Gingered.  My girlfriend ordered Pineapple Coconut and Banana Nut. We also shared a Coconut Vanilla cupcake. 10s across the board. Will be back!
