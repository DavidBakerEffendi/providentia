First time in was Halloween Night.
Started off at the bar & had a few drinks.
Ended up golfing in a bay on the third floor.
You purchase member cards/ scan to set up each member. Drivers available to use, monitor keeps track of scores. $45 an hour in the evenings. $35 in the afternoon and mornings are $25.
I don't recommended to bring children in the evenings , save that for the daytime with the whole family- you'll have a Blast. Different atmosphere here at night..Night Life/ Date Night- Perfect.*Music was a little louder than my liking.
Super, super fun experience, really cool concept. 
Service was great, attentive employees in an environment you can clearly see they like to be!
Heard only great things about the food here. Wings, Burgers & Chicken sliders are on the top of the list. Great menu with plenty of options!
Can't wait to go back!!
