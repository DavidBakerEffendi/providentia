I was personally very pleased with my experience at Apna. While the store is small, it is jam packed with a ton of spices, produce, mixes, desserts, teas, and a good sized frozen section. 

They are open Monday btw when most Indian markets are not. 

The gentleman working the day I went was very friendly and very helpful. If I asked for an item he helped me find it, and if they were out he offered a suitable alternative to try and made other recommendations. After ringing me up he took my purchases out to the car for me without me even asking which I really appreciated being 7 months pregnant. He was also very polite and engaged me in conversation; genuinely excited for me and my experimenting with Indian cooking for the first time. 

The quality and taste of all the ingredients was spot on and I am super excited to continue on this culinary route, especially knowing I have support from this locally owned business.
