My wife treated me to dinner tonight here at Archie's. My first time here and it was delicious. We were seated immediately. Service was great. Food was delicious. They removed our dishes in a timely manner so there was no clutter on the table. We got our check when asked and to go boxes. Everything was great. Definitely recommend for awesome Thai food.
