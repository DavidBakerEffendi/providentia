I was in the area with my son and had a craving for a burrito and noticed this one near by. With good reviews, we gave it a try.
I have to say that this was one of the best burritos I have had. The ingredients were fresh, the sauces were excellent, they grill it while you wait. I highly recommend. I personally had the chicken mango burrito on whole wheat.
