Beautiful golden pan fried dumplings - have brought me back four times this summer. 

A classic pairing for four sangjibaos ($7) and their dry peanut oil noodles ($8) will set you back a big buck but boy is it worth it. 

Baos: Bite hole/drink sweet soup/pour some vinegar/ and do as needed to get through to the perfect pork filling. 

Noodles: dump some chilli oil inside to add kick and juice to the simplicity that the gods have given us. 

Very rare does one visit multiple times, and this tiny little storefront has done more for me than many other on this mainland stretch of cuisine. It even impressed my papa so much he brought my mom!
