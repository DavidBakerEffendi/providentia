My husband and I were craving gyros so we stopped by for lunch with our son, it was quiet and empty when we first stepped in, there were only two mean having lunch as well so we were a bit worried, we ordered the lamb and beef gyros, loved their Tzatziki, compared to most places, it was the best! Next time we're in the neighborhood we'll give some of their other plates a try!
