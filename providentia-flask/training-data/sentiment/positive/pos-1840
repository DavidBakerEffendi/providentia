This restaurant was nice and quiet, not loud like a typical Denny's.  Emily was our server and she was great--friendly, accommodating and on top of her game.  My husband ordered the Bourbon Burger, and it was really gross.  It was overly sweet and the sauce just didn't mesh well with the burger.  Emily didn't bat an eyelash when we asked if he could switch it out for something else.  We have never, ever asked to switch a dish out at a restaurant, ever, but it was just inedible.  Anyway, she quickly brought out his mushroom swiss burger and it was much different--super awesome!  Oh, and we went on a Tuesday, so our kids at free.  That was a huge plus!  All in all we had an excellent experience.
