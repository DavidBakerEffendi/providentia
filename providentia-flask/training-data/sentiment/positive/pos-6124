Wow. I made the special trip to Scottsdale to try out this pizza place. It is a small quaint little place. There was no available seating inside so we had to eat outside. If I were to come again, I would wait until Winter, because eating outside when it is over 100 degrees is really not enjoyable at all. I can see where eating outside during the nice time of year would be really fun though. I ordered the pizza with goat cheese, fig, arugula, citrus and Parmesan. It was so amazing. I loved the way my taste buds danced as I learned the different flavors in each bite. The pizza was a little pricey for what you get $15. But I loved it. I would definitely come back.
