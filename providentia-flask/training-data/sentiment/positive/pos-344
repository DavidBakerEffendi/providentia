As authentic as you can get! This restaurant is so small, but it gets pretty crackin! Once you enter, you are welcomed with great servers who will accommodate  you and your party or even if its just a party of one! The restaurant is decorated with a mural of people from Mexico and great art that just resembles its amazing culture.

The restaurant seating options are booths and tables. Once you are seated, you are given complimentary chips and salsa! The chips are fresh and right out of the fryer! They give you a lot of chips and plenty of their homemade salsa! I cannot get enough of these! When I first came here, I was hooked! I probably go here at least once every two weeks. It is just THAT good. I have ordered plenty of things and I will just list some of the food that I can remember.

Sizzling fajitas- I usually get the shrimp and chicken combo. It comes with the sides such as the guacamole, rice, beans, and pico de gallo with some sour cream on the plate and tortillas-- your choice of flour or corn! Then, you are served with a sizzling plate that will catch another persons eyes! It makes them want to order one, too!

Shrimp in Butter Garlic- I love shrimp and these shrimps are huge and covered in butter garlic sauce with rice on the side. All I can say is.... damn. SO DELICIOUS!

Appetizer Combo- This combo comes with chicken flautas, chicken fingers, guacamole, cheese quesadilla and plenty more all for less than $10! It will fill you up and plenty for people to share.

Burritos- Man... their burritos are HUGE! Get any style burrito.. you won't regret it! It is something you have to see AND taste for yourself.

This was an accidental find, but i'm glad I decided to go check it out! Great place and great staff!
