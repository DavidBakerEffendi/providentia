WOOOO MINT CAFE!

This place is sooo good! Definitely affordable if you're looking to be satisfied every time you go. The presentation is fantastic and I've never had a problem here. The service is great and you'll never go without water! 
I'll admit, I like trying new things, but I canNOT stop getting the Pineapple Chicken here! It's just so good! I can't resist warm pineapple! 
Other good stuff: Mango anything, spring rolls, soft shell crab, limeade, and pad thai...pretty much anything I've eaten here.
