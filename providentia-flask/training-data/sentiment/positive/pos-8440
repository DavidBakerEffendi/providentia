Warning! Do not come here if you are on a diet! You will not be able to pass up the best cookies on the planet! We were told that Page Dairy Mart uses her cookies, so there you have it- the best ice cream joint uses the best cookies, coincidence? No, the best of the best uses the best! Nancy B's is amazing. She charges $1.25 for her gourmet cookies but these cookies are no ordinary cookies, they are huge and delicious! The price is inexpensive for the product quality and size she offers! The cookies are about 3.5-4 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick at least. The cookies melt in your mouth. Their soft and decadent taste will leave you wanting more! You don't even need to try it before you buy it! Trust the ratings, Nancy B's cookies are the real deal!
