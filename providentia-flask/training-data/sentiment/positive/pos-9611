This aint the gold spike of yesteryear. It used to be an old dingy casino/hotel but then Zappos brought it and its now a trendy lounge with great vibes, a huge outdoor area with oversized games, and cheap drink prices. They have bands performing sometimes in the evening and a DJ most nights. One of our favorite places to hang out downtown.
