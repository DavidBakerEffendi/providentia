Me & a buddy ate here on Mon/23 Sep about 4:30 pm.  We each had the $12 combo plate.
- My buddy would rate them 4 stars.  I'm giving them 5 stars for great value.
- Dining in they gave us 6 Korean side dishes (cabbage kimchi, turnip kimchi, fish cake, bean sprouts, and 2 others) and even offered free refills.  Also left us a pitcher of water to go with our glasses of ice water (I prefer to have a pitcher at the table).
- Combo plate was large with 3 types of meat, rice and mac salad.
- Also gave us some Asian style (steamed) peanuts.
- It was a lot of food for what we were paying.
- Also, you're allowed to bring your own beers (we didn't but the waiter explained that the 2 other patrons with the beers brought them in themselves).  Island Style doesn't serve alcohol.
- Will definitely be back.
