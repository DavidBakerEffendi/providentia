My favorite place to eat ramen in AZ! (Thanks Alex!) Their soup base is very creamy, perfect and not too salty. The pork was very yummy and melted in my mouth. There's nothing that could have been better! They give you the best portions and they're not pricy in my opinion. Definitely check this place out if you're craving good ramen!
