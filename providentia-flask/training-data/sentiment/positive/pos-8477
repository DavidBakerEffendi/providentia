Very beautiful grounds, sitting out on patio for evening dining will make you not want to leave. They are known for suggesting you don't leave without tasting the famous sticky buns. Yet honestly, I have very much enjoyed every item I've tried on this menu. You must go during the seasons they are open, as it's not open year round from my understanding.
