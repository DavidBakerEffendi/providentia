We entered through the rear entrance which allowed us observe the kitchen in full swing.  The preparation in the kitchen got me really excited for lunch and the prices on the menu made me want to order everything. Their are certainly prettier restaurants from the outside, but for the $ this is probably as good as Greek food can get.
