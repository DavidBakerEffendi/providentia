This has to be my favorite sushi restaurant! All sushi is very fresh and huge portions.

The one thing is does lack is great servers- they seem to always forget something . But, management does pick up the slack ! Which you can not say for a lot of places. The manager always seem to be very helpful, hopefully she can teach her staff :)

Get there early, restaurant is not very big and fills up quick! 

Highly suggest this place to everyone I know- the quality is top notch !
