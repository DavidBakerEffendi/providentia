Great ambience, I like the traditional style of the restaurant and simplicity of the whole place.

Service - 5. The hostess, Lisette, greeted us with a warm welcome immediately upon entrance. Felicia is wonderful, very friendly and constantly checked up on us. The orders came out in a timely manner, very fresh and everything was perfect!

Food - 4. I ordered the Big Jack's Skillet (seasoned potatoes topped with ham, sausage, bell peppers, mixed onions, cheese and country gravy; I added bacon) and it was absolutely AMAZING! Definitely a homemade taste to the dish, it was extremely filling. I barely had room for my toast. My brother ordered a half stack of flapjacks (half was a wise choice, each flapjack was about 5-6 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick) and he had zero complaints.

Overall: 4.5
The prices were good for the portion sizes and it was an enjoyable experience.
The only thing I saw wrong with this restaurant is that there are no flavored creamers, only half and half :(

I will definitely return sooner than later!
