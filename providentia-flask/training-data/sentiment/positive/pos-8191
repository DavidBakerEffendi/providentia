I went to eat today with my husband and we sat in the bar area. Cassi was our server. She was outstanding, Very on top of things, and kept our table clean throughout the meal. She is a great server and has a great personality. She takes time to talk to each guest, yet stays on top of things. She also  makes us feel very welcome and remembered who we where from the last time we came We have gone to eat at this location  several time and usually eat in the restaurant area. But since the past 2 times we have decided to eat in the bar, and Cassi has waited on us both times. Now she will become our regular server. :) 
Thank you for making our vist on to remember. 
Oh and the food was outstanding, hot, fresh, and very fast for a 3 day weekend.
