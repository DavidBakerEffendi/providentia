Basil Box is great, and I'm really pleased they are opening so many locations. 

The food is fresh, tasty, flavourful, and quite filling. 

Their menu is a select your own type of style so you can choose the base, veggies, protein, and toppings. 

Most recently I got the chilled noodles with peppers, sweet potato, lime shrimp, and with cilantro, peanuts, peanut sauce and a bit of spicy Penang curry. It was absolutely delicious!! So filling and great flavours. 

It came to about $12 with tax which is perfect for lunch. 

This spot is bright and spacious and has plenty of comfortable seating. 

What really made this a five star experience was the service. The server was incredibly friendly and took the time to welcome me, and offered suggestions. He even said bye on my way out. 

I'll definitely be back to Basil Box soon!
