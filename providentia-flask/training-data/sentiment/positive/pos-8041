Ive been here a hundred and one times and I still don't think ive ever had their pizza??? I ALWAYS get "The Lady is a Scampi", it's amazing and the shrimp are more than few and freakin' Chernobyl sized! Can't beat the pzookie either..Be warned though.. you will expand on site, thighs will fuse together etc... it's not healthy (not even the salads) is what im trying to say but oh so good.
