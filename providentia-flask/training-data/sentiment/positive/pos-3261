My review is based on both times I had the pleasure of experiencing Bloom.
The first was for Happy Hour...the service and the atmosphere were divine.  The wine list is phenomenal and well as the prices. The bartender was very thorough with the descriptions of all the wine until I picked a very sweet white wine that I probably would never had tried any other time.  (Very sweet, but good!)  I loved it that there was a group of probably 20-30 of us and the bartender had no problem giving up individual checks.  (I also had the tomato and mozzarella salad, which was good...but I saw the lobster salad...and well....)

The second time was last night...and I had the lobster salad.  This was probably the most amazing salad I ever had!  Warm Alaskan Lobster with asparagus and a white vinaigrette dressing.  I even asked for tomatoes and the server was very accommodating (and didn't even charge me extra.)  My sweet dear friend Lisa was going to get the Ahi Tuna, but changed her mind to the lobster salad as well when she was able to substitute the asparagus for broccoli.  She also agreed that the salad was amazing and even put her in an amazing mood!  What good food can do to us :)

I would so love to go there again and try more of their menu...(even though it will be so hard to stay away from the salad)  But I will definitely be back.
