I love this place. We went for breakfast today. Actually got there around noon. We sat right away. Took a little while to decide what to eat because everything sounds delicious.

I ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. Amazing! Best French Toast I've ever had. I chose that over the Eggs Benedict so I will have to try that next time. Can't wait to go back. 

The service was also wonderful.
I HIGHLY recommend this place.
