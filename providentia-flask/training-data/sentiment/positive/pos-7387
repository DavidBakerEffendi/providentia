I loved this little diner!

I came for breakfast with my cousin on a Sunday around 11am. There's about 10-15 tables and only two or three were left! It was reassuring.

I didn't see a veggie omelette on the menu but they've made note to ask if I didn't see what I wanted. They had no problem accommodating me. Their bacon is real bacon, not thin or short. It was legit homemade bacon, thick cut. The breakfast potatoes were delish - good flavour to them.

My cousin ordered the three eggs, toast and peameal bacon. She enjoyed it very much! 

Be sure to ask for the home made jam. I sampled the raspberry one; my cousin and I agreed how yummy it was. It reminded me of the kind my grandmother would make when I was younger. I think I'll buy a jar next time I'm there. 

I adore this little family business and I will continue to give them my support when I can.

EDIT: changing my rating from a 4 star to a 5 star. I visited again today and was thoroughly impressed with the service. The chef came around to each table to ensure everyone was happy and satisfied. That warm gesture is what makes a 5 star in my books.
