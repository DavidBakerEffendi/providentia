you know a restaurant is good when there is an hour and a half wait when its 9:30pm on a wednesday night! so i ended up going to the danforth location after being told the long wait at the ossington location. so the thing you should know about me is that i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee naan. and the pizza crusts at pizzeria libretto resembles naan therefore their pizzas are BOMB. end of story
