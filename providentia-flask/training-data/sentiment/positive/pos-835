This is my go-to Chinese restaurant whether it's for dim sum, dinner or super late night munchies. I always make sure to order chicken and salted fish fried rice and/or fried squid tentacles if I'm having dim sum. I can go on forever listing all of my favourites here but that would be almost the whole menu! Gotta give this place a try, if you haven't already
