Stayed here on 1/1 to 1/3 because my mom had two free nights along with two free shows, $100 slot credit, and $50 food credit. What a deal! We even went over the food credit limit and they still comped it. I've stayed here many times with friends, but this is the first time with family. It's a great place to stay and if you've seen Vegas many times you don't need to leave the hotel at all. Everything is in there.,.shopping...fine dining..casual dining.....a food court....and Tao. What more do you need?!
