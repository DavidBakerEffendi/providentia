I eat here regularly with my co-workers for lunch.  We go for one of two reasons.  Reason number 1: we are in the mood for Indian food.  It is the best Indian restaurant near the office.  Reason number 2: we can't think of any other places to eat and we haven't been to the Taj Mahal in three days.  The food is always great.   The lunch special is a good deal.  There is a rotation with three options.  You select your preferred spiciness level, one through ten, and naan or garlic naan.  Lunch also comes with lentil soup and yogurt sauce.
