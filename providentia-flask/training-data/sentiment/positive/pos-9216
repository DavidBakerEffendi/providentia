Definitely lives up to all the great reviews.  I wish all gas stations and truck stops could provide this kind of delicious regional cuisine, a comfortable and attractive space and a few tempting doo dads to peruse while waiting for food. 

I really thought I had perfected breakfast to the point where eating out was superfluous. Tom' s Thumb has renewed my faith in extra fluffy pancakes, super delicious breakfast tacos and other dishes.  You get the sense that the chefs really care about the food- the look
 and flavors.  

I can't wait to come back.
