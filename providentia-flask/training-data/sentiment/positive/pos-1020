Goblets upon goblets upon goblets of goodness - I was dying to try one! 

I was so psyched up, but disappointed when I could only finish half because I had already had more than my fill of liquor for the day. How lame!

We tried the white gummy goblet. Oh so large, and oh so sweet and delicious. Ours didn't look as colorful as the picture (it was only pink on the bottom) but I was still happy!

And bonus! They let you keep the goblet! I can't think of a better Vegas souvenir! Sure beats those cheap plastic yardsticks they give you everywhere else. I'm going to make my own imitation goblet drinks at home now, yay!
