Just a nice cream joint. I think not! 
Desyree was friendly and let us sample a ton of flavors. I was a little bummed there were none of the odd flavored in the display freezer to sample, and we weren't going home so we couldn't get a to go container... just another reason to go again. Everything was delicious. We got a  Cup with a scoop of Creme Brûlée and scoop of Mixed Berry...awesome combo!  Hubby got a Lombardo Panini...recommended by Chef. OMG...yum. We imagined all the different Gelato Paninis we could make. We are in love. Can't wait til summer....great place to hang out. My husband was trying to figure out how he could get over here for lunch while he's at work! LOL. We can't wait to go back and we will certainly recommend this place to everyone!
