My husband and I have been wanting to try Burgerfi for a while now and finally indulged on Saturday. It was a beautiful day so we had the pleasure of sitting at the tables out on the patio/sidewalk. When we entered, I noticed how clean and organized everything was. 

We went to the front counter to look at the menu board which has a lot of options and never having been to Burgerfi before, I was a little overwhelmed but quickly decided on the Burgerfi cheeseburger. Hubby got the same thing with no tomato and we shared a cry fry (fries + 3 onion rings). When you order, they give you a little tracking device to put on your table so they can bring you the correct food order when it's ready. 

We used the coke remix machines to get fancy pops, that was fun. They also sell beer and wine which is unique. 

When our food arrived, we were both kinda like wow, this is a big burger! It was very greasy but tasty. The fries were good, no big woo. The onion rings were the best I've ever had! Very delicious! 

Overall, good quality food. A little pricey for what you get. Our meal was $26. I feel like I could get the same quality at 5 Guys and pay a tad less.
