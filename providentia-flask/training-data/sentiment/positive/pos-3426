I've been to Basil Box many times at the Queen and Spadina location but it was my first time at this one. It's definitely bigger with a lot more seating that's for sure. I got what I always get--salad base; bell peppers and sweet potato for my veggies; tofu as my protein; tambourine sauce; and pumpkin and sesame seeds, cilantro, and carrots as my toppers. To drink I got the pineapple rose soda which was so delicious. 

Overall I enjoyed my meal and I love how the staff are always friendly no matter the location you visit. Basil Box is definitely under good management and knows how to train the perfect employees.

I'm glad I spotted this location as I'm downtown all the time. I'll definitely be visiting this location again in the future.
