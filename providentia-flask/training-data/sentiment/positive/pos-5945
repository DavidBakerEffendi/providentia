Molly's Pizza is consistently very good. We've been ordering from them for years and have never had a bad item. I love their white specialty pizzas like spinach and feta. Other favorites are the Italian hoagie, sausage sandwich, chicken salad, fried zucchini and wings. My only complaint is that more often than not, the wait for delivery is over an hour. It's worth waiting for and we just plan ahead to not be starving by the time it gets delivered.
