Finally remembered to try this place this past Saturday at the last min ...GLAD I did ....Let me start by saying I have lived in bethel park my entire life pretty much I had been to the old place that was once here for breakfast many times and it was just a "greasy Spoon" to me. Now the food I had was AMAZING ....

My wife and I shared an extra large pizza and an order of fries ....The fries were nice and golden and cruncy with just the rite amount of salt and Mm mm tasty 

the pizza which I honestly was on the fence about was DELICIOUS ....We got a simple extra large pizza with pepperoni and let me say there was NO lack of pepperoni, the crust was nice and crispy it has just the rite amount of sauce and was just delicious I will definitely be getting this again in the near future.
