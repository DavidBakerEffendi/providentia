Hands down the best Ethiopian in Charlotte! I've been to several Ethiopian restaurants in town, and this one is without a doubt the best! The restaurant is light, open, warm, and inviting! The service is friendly and attentive! You cannot eat here and not feel welcomed and happy. The injera is the freshest I've ever had. The kitfo is my favorite and was seasoned perfectly with just the right level of spiciness. The portions are very generous for the price and you will not leave hungry. If you've never had Ethiopian, step out of your comfort zone and head to Abugida Cafe.
