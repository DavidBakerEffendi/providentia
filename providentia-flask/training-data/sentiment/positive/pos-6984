We came here on a whim, after being told about this by a coworker. That was a good tip. The menu is small but has nice variety. 

We had the reuben tater tots- very tasty and very worth trying. We decided to share an entree, and selected the smoked meatloaf. There was plenty for both of us, and DAMN it was tasty. 

If you're in the mood for beer, ask for recommendations. You won't regret it.
