On my ongoing search for the best local bakeries in town, I came across the many positive reviews for Lil Brown Sugar's. Seeing that they were running a Yelp special of $7 for $10, I snatched up a voucher and proceeded to East Henderson at my first opportunity. The shop itself is nothing special, but the service was very friendly, and I loved that the owners (I think) 2 kids were there - 1 working the register and 1 doing his homework.  The cupcake selection was pretty good, with about 7-8 flavors available. They offered some of the standards: red velvet, cake batter, coconut, and a few more interesting flavors: cherry limeade, smores, drumstick, and a couple others I didn't ask about. I sampled the smores, cherry limeade, and strawberry shortcake, and they were all excellent. The flavors were spot-on for the names, the cake stayed moist until the next day, and the frosting was creamy. I loved the marshmallow frosting of the smore cupcake, but I did think the strawberry/limeade frostings were just a tad too sweet for my liking. No worry, I just scraped off a little of the extra.
I also tried a couple of their other items - a gooey bar and a peanut butter bar. The gooey bar is kind of like a gooey cheesecake with a crust on top and bottom. It is extremely rich, and it took me 3 servings to finish it, but it's definitely good. The peanut butter bar was a chocolate chip cookie bar with peanut butter icing. I didn't realize the icing was peanut butter until they'd already bagged it for me (pb is not my fave), but the bar was still really good, even with the icing.
On top of all that, they have an additional yelp deal - free cake pop with cupcake purchase. I've never been a huge fan of cake pops, so that item wasn't my favorite, but you pop lovers should like it.
Bonus for reasonable prices - $2.60 for cupcakes and most items.
