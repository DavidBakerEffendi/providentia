Wow! As someone who doesn't eat sushi at all, I had very low expectations for Harumi Sushi, even though I had heard lots of good things. From the first bite to the last bite, I was in sushi heaven! Cannot wait to go back for more!!

We arrived earlier in the evening on a Friday and snagged a parking spot across the street. It was actually pretty busy considering how early it was, but we were greeted immediately & seated towards the back. I would ask for a table closer to the front next time (the restaurant is very small but there seemed to be a lot of staff traffic in the back). Considering how good the sushi was, I'm sure it gets super busy, so I recommend going during off-hours.

Anyways, the sushi itself was amazing! I ordered the Las Vegas Roll and my fianc√© got the Mini Roll Combo with three different rolls. I can't remember all the ones we picked for the combo but I do remember the Super Crunch Shrimp! It wasn't a traditional sushi roll, but I liked it because I'm a fan of shrimp! My favorite thing we got was the Las Vegas Roll but I was glad that we got to try four different items in one visit. Each option we had was unique and everything seemed really fresh.

The service was also good; all the waitresses were helping all tables, so if we needed anything, we just grabbed someone who was walking by. We will definitely be back & would recommend this restaurants to others.
