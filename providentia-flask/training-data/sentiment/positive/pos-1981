We happily live right next to this place and were lucky enough to find a delicious and cheap location to eat take-out. Just the other day I had an accident in the kitchen which ultimately led to burning myself and I could not finish my dish however, I had to be at work in the next 30 minutes. (Night shift) I was able to order and get my food within 10 minutes and be on my merry way! It was also nice when I got sick and still wanted food food, but the Wonton soup hit the spot and was light enough for my tummy to keep down. I do need to ask on certain dishes to have light amounts of sauce cause it can be overwhelming sometimes, but they are more than happy to put less sauce in if need be. My family and I are big fans of the orange chicken, salt&pepper crispy chicken, and the crispy noodle dish.
