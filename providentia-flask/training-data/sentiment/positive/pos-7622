Dazzo's is not located in the ghetto !  Its located at 63rd Ave & Glendale right across the street from Glendale High School you know the school that has been there for nearly a 100 years ?

Dazzo's alone has been there nearly if not more than 30 years so folks that should give you an idea of the area where this place is located.  Its an older part of Glendale and nothing less and its completely safe.

Nonetheless, this place has the best food in town when it comes to hot dogs, hamburgers and anything else you crave Chicago style.  My favorite meal is the polish sausage with cheese, ketchup and onion served with fries for less than four bucks !  

Over the years I have tried their hot dogs, chili dogs, burritos, hamburgers except for the Italian Sausage / Beef but I will eventually do so one day.

The Italian Ice is the best and the soda's are always fresh.  You get one refill of your soda for like 50 cents.  Only cash is accepted.  Its a very small successful family restaurant so you can see why they would only accept cash.  They clearly post outside before you enter that they only accept cash as well.

If your in the area for business, work, family, friends or driving through the part of Glendale for a ballgame Dazzo's is a must.

They are open Mon-Sat 1030AM to 8PM and closed on Sunday.
