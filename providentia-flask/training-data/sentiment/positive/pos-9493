There is a line to get in, so go early. Upon entrance you walk through the antique collectibles and there are lots of them. Soon you enter into the dining rooms, set up in the middle of shop. The tables are set with antique dishes. The menu is a small card on the table. You order an an entree and the vegetarian buffet is included. The flavors are absolutely amazing. This is a hidden gem. Assorted bundt cakes for dessert, at least 15 to choose from....help yourself to deliciousness.....
