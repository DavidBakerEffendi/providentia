Delicious Breakfast I had a Smoked Trout with a citrus spinach salad, house made granola parfait and a fresh oj mimosa, everything was really awesome. The Farm alone is really pretty and feels like we were far far from home. Last week they had Maya's Farm open with some good selection of organic veg. They also had a small farmers market where I bought probably one of the best organic tea from Wisdom Nectar Tea local Phoenix they had some samples and I choose the bedtime relax with ginger lavender yarrow and chamomile all organic for $15 for a 1.75 oz bag ( Not Bad ) taste better than what it sounds. Going back tomorrow Can't Wait
