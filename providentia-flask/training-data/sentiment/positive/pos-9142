Best Red Lobster we've been to.  Okay, okay, chill out, we're not massively huge Lobster Rojo junkies, but for (affordable) sea food in Arizona, there's slim pickings.

Our waitress, Casey, really did a fantastic job.  We were in quick, got our food much faster than expected, and everything ran smoothly, like the common well-oiled machine metaphor.

The food was actually really good, and I enjoyed my Peach Bourbon BBQ Chicken and Shrimp a lot.  Of course, the biscuits are amazing.  I would take off 1/2 a star for the pathetic salads they serve before the entrees, but that's a minor complaint.

The location is older, and, being next to a ton of retirement neighborhoods, you're likely to encounter more aged folk than highschool or college riff raff.  The old-fashioned tubed televisions hanging from the ceiling need an update, and a lot of the wood needs a little resurfacing, but other than that, no complaints.
