I really enjoy this place. I've come for dinner a couple times, I get sushi. It's been delicious every time. I am very happy with the quality of fish. Haven't had any issues with freshness, even the uni is delicious. Plus they have ranger ipa and santan devil's ale on tap. I had uni, salmon , and salmon roe on my last visit. Plus something callled a ryu roll. It was too awesome that I inhaled it before I could take a picture it was a fried roll topped with chucks of salmon, tuna, avocado, and other delicious stuff.
