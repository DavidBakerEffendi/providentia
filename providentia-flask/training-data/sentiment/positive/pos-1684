This place has been here for many years. They have recently remodeled, nicely might I add. I like how this place is so original looking. You will not find any other restaurant with this type of decor. The food is very good and they have recently re-added their sushi menu. The quality of the fish are always fresh each time I go and I also enjoy coming here not only because of the food but also because of the service. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Korean BBQ and/or sushi! :)
