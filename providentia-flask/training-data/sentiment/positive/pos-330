One of our favorite Mariscos (Mexican seafood) places in the valley. Fish was all very fresh and delicious. We tried many things on the menu and everything has turned out very good. Prices are very reasonable. If you're ever questioning whether you should go in- stop your car and go and you won't regret it!
