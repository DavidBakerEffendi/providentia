I had lunch there on 03/15/16 with three friends and we all left as raving fans. Except for one friend who is on a fast (poor guy!). I am currently on a diet but I broke the hell out of it and yes it was worth it. Two of the guys had the number 2 Tamago egg burgers with jazz fries and I had the Mogo that is a burger, egg on a bed of rice. The burger was well cooked, with great favor. The seasoning and sauce made the rice to die for. I confess I also had the jazz fries which were equally flavorful. We all walked away very happy campers. We will be back I just have to exercise reasonable restraint as I am making great progress with my diet. It is very casual dining and pretty busy for lunch. The service was great and a reasonable wait this for our order. Everything served hot and tasty.. The reserved parking is great next to the location and prices are reasonable.
