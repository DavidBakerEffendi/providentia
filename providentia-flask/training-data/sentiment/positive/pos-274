My all time favorite restaurant. I love the fact that all seafood served here is sustainable and follows the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch Guide. Chef Moonen has been named MBA's Chef of the Year for the 10th Annual Cooking for Solutions event in May 2011. 
Anything you order here will be golden. The four of us each ordered something different and it was all amazing. I had the special seasonal drink- Backwoods Fiddler. The Moon Doggies are to die for! 
You absolutely HAVE to eat here!
