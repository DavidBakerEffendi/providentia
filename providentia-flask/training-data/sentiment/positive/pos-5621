Rey Azteca gets zero points for ambiance and location, but I don't mind eating my chips and salsa at a random place in a strip mall. We were quite pleased with our meal here. The menu offers pretty typical Mexican fare that you'd expect to find at a place like this (you know, Combinations # 1 through 579 that are all some mix of burritos, tostadas, quesadillas, enchiladas, beans, rice, etc.) 

Food in this vein can sometimes be bland and all taste the same, but both my husband and I thought the food was very tasty. I got the Vegetarian Combo #10 (bean burrito, cheese enchilada, cheese quesadilla). The beans in the burrito had a lot of flavor and the enchilada sauce was very well-spiced. Decent portion sizes too! My husband had the carne asada, and he reported that his steak was tender and well-seasoned. He enjoyed the rice and beans that came along with his meal as well. 

You get a free basket of chips and salsa to start with, although they charge for refills, which kinda bugs me for some reason (not that we really ever get chip refills, but I feel like it's my right as an American to have the *option* of completely stuffing my face full of unlimited complimentary chips should I choose to do so). The salsa was decent, although could definitely have used more cilantro. As for the service, it was fast and friendly. Overall, if you're craving Mexican food, this is a good choice!
