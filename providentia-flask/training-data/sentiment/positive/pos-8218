This has definitely become one of my favorite spots for an evening of wine! 

I've been here a few times and have loved it ever since the first day. There are so many great things about this place. I love the atmosphere and the way the place is set up. When you walk in you can grab a table or sit by the cozy little fireplace that they have. I love their outdoor patio. It's big and they have two fire pits outside to sit by. Another plus is they also have live music there every night I believe. 

As far as the food and drinks. I love me some Pinot Noir so I always order the Ramsay which is delicious. For food I've tried a majority of their bruschetta which is really good and have also had their Italian flatbread. They also have a happy hour everyday from 3-6  which I haven't been able to take advantage of yet. Their staff is also really great. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and they really take care of you. 

All in all, it's such a great place to hang out with some friends for some amazing wine or also the perfect date spot. Take your ladies here fellas! They won't be disappointed. =P
