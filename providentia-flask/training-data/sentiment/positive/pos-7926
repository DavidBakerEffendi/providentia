It is such a delight to discover yet another really good Vietnamese restaurant in the city, and I wish I had known about this one earlier. The food is excellent and inexpensive, the service is friendly, the dining space is huge, and the restaurant offers a great variety of dishes. It is conveniently located within the large commercial area on the northeast corner of 35th Av. and Bethany Home Rd., so parking is never a problem. And they have WiFi connection for their customers - that's always a plus.
