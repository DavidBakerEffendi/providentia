This my friends is more than a Bakery...Its a mini restaurant!

I was getting a hair cut in the same plaza and I saw the sign. I went in and on the right they had all the bakery stuff like Italian bread & buns, croissant and custard tarts. Where as they also have a food area where they had pizzas, meatball and the list goes on...

You walk in a little more they have a seating area where you can enjoy the goodies and they have a Tv too. look on the left and Vola a deli section as well.

I bought some of they awesome buns, Croissant and custard tarts. The buns were nice as I enjoyed it with by making me a steak sandwich. The croissants were very good, they weren't full of air and you actually had some bread inside. The croissant was soft and tasted great! the custard tart were nice and fluffy on the out side and soft and sweet in the middle. Pricing wasnt bad either as I left with 6 Buns, 3 Croissants (I wanted more but all that was left!) and 3 custard tarts for $12!

The cashier was nice and friendly... I would surely come again!
