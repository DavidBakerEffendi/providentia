I love this place allot when I do get that Hawaiian food crave I just go to house of aloha the food is good and they are very ohana once you walk thru the door. Always happy to help you and small kine talk while the food is being made everything there is made fresh too. Also you meet other people from different island so hot this place up they have good and the best thing we dont need to drive across town for Hawaiian food. So dont take my word for it go check this guy's out.
