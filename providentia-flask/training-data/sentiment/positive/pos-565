We met a friend at Fat Ox for dinner this week to celebrate the holidays and try somewhere new...Fat Ox certainly did not disappoint!  The restaurant has a lively, fun atmosphere although noisy, the decor is simple, but comfortable, the service was professional and efficient and the food was incredible.  We started with the tableside caesar salad (fantastic!), we followed it up with 2 pastas - the garganelli (simply divine) and the strozzapreti (simple, but tasty) - my absolute favorite part of the meal, continued our entrees with the skirt steak, scallops and salmon and ended the meal sharing a beautiful lemon tart.  The dessert took a while to come out, but the server proactively came over and said it was on the house for the delay - what a nice touch!  Fat Ox is a must visit for a great dining experience!
