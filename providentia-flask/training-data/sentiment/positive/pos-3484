Great little dessert place! Crepes are light, and a good portion size and not too expensive. They even make their own ice cream! I recommend the green tea shaved ice. It looks nothing like what you get at other places, which are just fancy snow cones. It's more like shaved ice cream that comes out in waves. 
Service was also very good, the ladies who work there are nice and polite.  
Place was also very clean.
