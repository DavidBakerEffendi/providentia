A year later and this place has only gotten better. You can now sit anywhere and get great service, food is awesome, the bar is still the best place to sit. The wings here is awesome, but I have never had anything that wasn't great. Only complaint, wish they had one more tv at the end of the bar and all the smokers make the patio unusable, but that's a problem every bar has. At least they're not inside. 

Cindy and Dara are awesome and the clientele is ideal, not to many twenty something's looking to get hammered and no snooty Scottsdale types. I love this place. 

My wife loves the Bingo on Fridays and trivia thurs and sat is fun as well.
