I enjoy the make your pizza concept and have been to some others, but Fired Pie has the edge here.  I dont know if it's the dough, the sauce, or the ingredients, but the pizza here is 10/10. Wrap all that up with a friendly staff that doesn't just throw your pizza together like a subway clone, and you have a delicious expirience for right around $10.  The manger, Bruce, is great and calls customers by name when they come in.  One of my favorite spots to eat, for sure!
