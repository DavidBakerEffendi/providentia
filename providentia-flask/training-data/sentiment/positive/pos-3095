I love to go to Gold Spike for a more chill yet still unique night... the last time I went, there was an art display going on with people painting and displaying canvases and bodies lol. The coolest thing to me about goldspike is the atmosphere. Inside, there is a bar surrounded by tables with outlets and couches on the periphery. There is an outside area with plenty of standing room, fire pits surrounded by grass couches two lounge and enjoy a beer, human sized beer pong, giant Jenga, and a large Life is Beautiful sign. There is also an outside bar and a stage for live music, which is usually bumping. The drinks are good as well, and on the night I went, they had free champagne for ladies. Gold Spike is one of my favorite places to visit in Vegas!
