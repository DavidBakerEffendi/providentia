The dinner buffet at the Bellagio is one of the best buffets in Vegas, hands down. I've been to Vegas every year since turning 21 and each time I look forward to this buffet.

They have such a variety and high quality of food which separates it from the pack. They have Alaskan king crab, snow crab, shrimp, ribs, beef tenderloin, rack of lamb, kebobs, salad, sushi, sashimi, Asian favorites, pasta station, mussels, squid, and not to mention 20 types of desserts! I know the list above was not in any sort of order, but you get the idea.

This is a place you don't want to miss out on. Being a foodie, ive sat here for 2 hours before. 

Tips:
- come in between lunch and dinner (read between the lines)
- the guy at the pasta station will steam your snow crabs if you like them warm. 
- there will always be a long line so come before the huge crowds for lunch and dinner
