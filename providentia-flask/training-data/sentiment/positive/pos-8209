The staff here is so incredibly friendly, making everyone's wait more pleasant inside the tiny restaurant just off market square.They have all the standard options plus delicious (and filling) lunch specials. I wouldn't recommend here for a sit down sushi dinner, but to grab and go for lunch, it's perfect. And as of a few weeks ago, they added seaweed salad as a lunch special side option! Yay! Fresh ingredients, handmade right in front of you. Convenient, speedy, quality, reasonably priced and very welcoming. I'm a fan.
