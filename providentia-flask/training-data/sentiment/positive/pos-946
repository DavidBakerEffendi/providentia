THESE PEOPLE ARE A$$HOLES! and that's why I'm giving them their 5-stars they deserve! They live up to the name "Dick's". Only a mature audience with a great sense of humor should attend this location. I would not recommend for anyone to bring their kids here, even tho kids are allowed to come inside.

Everyone was degraded and it was hilarious! Food is alright, but they make the "Dick's" experience very fun and great! While or after you eat, you are given these hand made paper hats that have a message that "degrades you" with a sense of humor. I'd definitely recommend this place to everyone else, but of course not to the ones who are weak!

I got their "Big ass Breakfast Burrito" which is called what I just wrote. Along with that, we were recommended to try the "Dos-rita" which is basically those popular Corona Margarita drinks that have a beer in the margarita but these carry a Dos X instead. This "Dos-Rita" drink is definitely good and well worth every penny!

Man the hell up and come on over to Dick's!
