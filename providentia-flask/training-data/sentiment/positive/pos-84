On Wednesday nights after work, my husband and I trek to the east side for evenings with friends. One night we decided to check out a place we had seen while driving around the Beachwood area-Choolaah. Let me tell you, this was the beginning of what has become a weekly love affair with this place! When you first pull up and get out of the car, you can already smell the delicious food that's being cooked inside. The place is fast casual, and you build your meal from various components in their menu. They have a wide variety of ingredients and dishes that suit nearly all diets. They have four tandoors, large ovens with holes in the top through which you place skewers of delicious food to cook. It's fun watching them prepare and place the skewers into the tandoors and watch the cooking process go down. Even though the place is fast casual, the food is actually very authentic! I spent a lot of my college years eating at friends' houses whose parents were from India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh; and the food at Choolaah brings to mind the food my friends' moms would serve us. It always brings a smile to my face!Also-you MUST try the naan, it is absolutely fantastic here! 
I like to order the bbq bowl with white rice, naan, chicken OR paneer (a type of cheese that looks like tofu), and the chickpea masala. My husband likes to order the same, except with yellow daal (a lentil dish) rather than the chickpeas. 
Going to Choolaah on Wednesday's has become our weekly ritual, and we always look forward to it! The place is also very clean, and the staff has always been extremely friendly and on top of their game, even on super busy nights.
