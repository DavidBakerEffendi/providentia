By far the coolest dining experience ever! Totally bizarre at first not being able to see, but fishing around in the dark to eat your food was so much fun and your other senses are definitely heightened without your sight. I'm the type of person who always has to see what I'm eating (& take photos) but this experience allows you to experience food and reconnect with company in an intimate way, which I believe is something we lack nowadays. Wonderful concept. Wonderful experience. Also Chelsea, our server, was amazing. Thanks Black Out for a dinner I'll never forget.
