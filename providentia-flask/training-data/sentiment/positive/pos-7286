I'm a fan of Wedge. The atmosphere is trendy and their tacos are actually awesome. All of them. My personal favorite is the camaron, but I also loved the lomo (ribeye), pastor, and chori pollo. Great margaritas too. Nice patio when weather permits. It's also right across the downtown parking lot, which is very convenient.
