perfect for hit and run munchies!
some of my favorites include:

-pre-packaged sandwiches with delicious deli-meats and
freshly baked bread with ( i think boars head meat, yummy )

-pre-packaged focaccia bread with the white spread cheese 
 
-fantastic cookies and cupcakes 

Dangerously good.

oh and the shy little emo kids working there are adorable and 
friendly :)
