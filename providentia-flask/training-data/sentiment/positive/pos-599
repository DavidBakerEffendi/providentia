Great breakfast options and the help yourself coffee keeps you wide awake as you wait for your food.  This is not a quick Panera or Corner Bakery stop.  The food is very good, but it takes a while to make.  My standard benedict was pretty good and my daughter loved the HUGE fluffy choc chip pancakes.
My only issue is the lack of free parking and for that matter available parking on busy mornings.  Aside from those issues, the food is excellent and worth a visit!
