Really enjoyed my experience at TIABI today! I came on a Wednesday and it was very slow... (Roberto's next door has $1 tacos on Wednesday which steals some of the business) which was good for me because I was entirely indecisive about what I wanted to order and didn't have to feel rushed. The girl at the counter was awesome and seemed happy to answer all of my questions about the menu items. Even I was annoyed at myself, but she didn't seem to be bothered.

They have a nice selection when it comes to vegan options, and I finally decided on the Thai basil wafflewich with a guru patty instead of chicken and the Honey I'm Home churro dessert waffle with vegan ice cream, and both of them were delicious! That paired with yummy iced latte with almond milk was just heavenly. 

The shop is small and I can see how during busy hours it can be hard to find a place to sit (not very many places to sit). I was happy to come during a less congested time because I got really great service and delicious food! I will definitely be coming back to try the other things.
