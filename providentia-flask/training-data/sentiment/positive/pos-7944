Absolutely fabulous meal!!!  Great service from Sue.  Sam owner is a super nice guy and stopped by to introduce himself; how often does that happen!

We ordered the tuna sandwich.  One was grilled, one was blackened.  We agreed that it was the best fish sandwich we've had in years, yum!!  As good as any in the 'Burgh!

Sides were veggies (very fresh), and I got fries (crispy & delicious)!

Definitely will be back often!
