Stopped by for some breakfast at this place at poolside across from the buffet!! One of the best chicken and waffles in the country!! Great spot for breakfast but if you come after 1030 there is an hour wait at times...started with their immunity booster green juice which was fantastic!! Also got their terrace point juice which was also really good!! Then got the chicken waffle that comes with spicy and regular syrup!! Taste great after a long night at XS!! Always will come back here!!
