Taste explosion in my mouth!  

I was looking for a cupcake joint in Henderson.  I have been to a few and haven't been terribly impressed.  I have purchased cupcakes for bday parties and such.  I like to make cupcakes at home.  My son thinks I should be on the Cupcake Wars, but I am not that serious with my cooking abilities.

I was impressed by all the positive yelps and decided to treat my kids.  The small shop is in a strip mall with a yummy chinese food place.  So, I knew the area, but not gone into the store.

When we arrived, the gentleman behind the counter was nice and knowledgeable.  There was approximately ten different options of cupcakes.  When I checked in on yelp, I got a free cake pop!  

My daughter got the hot chocolate cupcake.  It had a couple of small marshmallows on top.  My son got the cake batter.  I got the caramel delight, which also had coconut.  WE also got two chocolate cake pops.  The total was less than $10.  Please note that there is a $.50 charge to use a credit card or debit card.  

I let the kids eat the cake pops there and we saved the cupcakes for after dinner.  I don't know what I was expecting, but wow!~

The frosting had a great consistency.  It wasn't too sweet, but perfect amount to compliment the rest of the toppings.  The cake part was so light and moist.  I didn't get to try my kids because they inhaled them.  

Husband commented that the price of the cupcake was cheaper than going out for ice cream.  If they enjoy it as much, we will be back!
