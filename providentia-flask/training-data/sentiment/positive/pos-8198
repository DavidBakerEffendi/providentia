One of the best restaurants in Toronto. I loved everything we ordered. The restuarant was a little difficult to find at night, it's a small place and the sign outside is hardly visible. Very dark inside, which I think was a little uncomforable, I want to be able to see my food. 
We had the tempura prawns, bulgogi cheese steak and beef short ribs platter. Everything was delicious. The prawns were my favourite. Perfectly cooked and coated in a spicy declicious sauce, this is a must try item. The short ribs platter was big enough for two to share. The cheese steak was really cheesey and excellent.

They wouldn't let us wait at the bar. It was -20 outside and we were told to go out until our table was ready. Had I not been so excited to try this place, I would have just left. But I'm glad I waited. Definitely worth waiting!
