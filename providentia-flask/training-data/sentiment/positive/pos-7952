Super cute ambiance. Been in twice so far, the first time I didn't eat though. Today I had the Smoke Tomato Bisque with the Grilled Cheese. The soup was beautiful! I didn't take a photo because one was already posted as well as I was very excited to taste. Interesting smoky flavor. The bartender told me they cold smoke the raw ingredients (tomatoes) for an hour. Great flavor and texture. The grilled cheese was yummy with it too. Perfect for today's rainy day! I love the music they play, very lounge-y.  Great date spot or cool happy hour spot! 

Also, don't forget the try their cocktails. Small menu, but versatile and advanced for a wine-centric bar/restaurant I love that they are using an organic tequila in their margarita with fresh basil and lime.
