Our server was so attentive. I believe his name was Russel? 
We came in a group of about 10 and we had the check split up a few different ways so I really aprreciate him doing that without being at all bothered. 
I had the lobster mac&cheese and I enjoyed it! 

The restaurant has a lot of differnet options so the group was all satisfied. 
Will be back for sure!
