Sammys is on the ball again! Did my 30th birthday here, Erin took care of me again last minute and arranged a reservation for me and my friends. The food servers were attentive and prompt, the food was incredible. I had the chicken lettuce cups and babaganoush. So scrumptious. The messy birthday sundae looked amazing, I couldn't really eat it cause of my diet but my friends loved it! I couldn't have asked for a better birthday thank you so much Erin and the sammys staff!!!!
