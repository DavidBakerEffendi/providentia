Cute name: 喜羊羊肉串 (xi yang yang rou chuan- xiyangyang is a cartoon goat, yangrouchuan is a lamb kebab)

Good Shanghai-style crispy crepes are difficult to find here. Has a crispy dough filling with lettuce, green onion and a light spicy sauce. 

Lamb kebabs are tasty and the right size. Cute name: Xi Yang Yang Rou Chuan. No fat which is less authentic but probably prefer for most Westerners.
