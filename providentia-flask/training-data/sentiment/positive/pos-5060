Went here with a group of five.  We called ahead to reserve a table outside just because the weather was so nice, I assumed it would be packed.  It was packed, but our table was waiting.  We had beer, wine, bruschetta, and a few paninis to split.  The food was great, but the ambiance is really what this place is all about.  There were adults, children (but no screaming), dogs, and just happy people involved in their own conversations.  The setup of the place is great, from the lighting, to the layout of the tables, to the friendly service.  I can see that this will quickly become my new "hangout".
