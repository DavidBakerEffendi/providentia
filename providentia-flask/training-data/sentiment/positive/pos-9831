Heard a lot about this place and finally decided to give in and check it out.  It's located inside the Blue Diamond Saloon which is a great spot.  We came and got the suicide wings and the suicide fries.  Both were great and very tasty assuming you can handle heat.  The wings are probably the best in Vegas.  We will be back to try the pizza as the people next to us we're raving on about it...
