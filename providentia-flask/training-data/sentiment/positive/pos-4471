If you go to the Strip, this is a must see, -several times-.

We caught the 3:30 pm show on a cold, rainy afternoon at the end of November. I can remember the song, and still see the choreography in my head. The water danced as if it were waves from one end of the pool to the next. 

It changes through the day, so you want to make sure that you catch it a few times. Each one lasts the duration of a long song, so you never know just which one you're going to get.  And when the city grows dark, the water is lit and it becomes -that much- better!
