Immediately when you walk in, the wonderful smells hit you in the face and even if you're not hungry, you want something.... Something sweet! This place is beyond dangerous if you're on a diet!  I'm like a kid in  a candy store every time I go there. Mostly everything is ala cart and inexpensive. I always want to try everything! So far, I highly recommend the cannolis, eclairs, carrot cake cupcakes, ordering cakes for special occasions and the cheese Danishes! Yum! You won't be disappointed!
