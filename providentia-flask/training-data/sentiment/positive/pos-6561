Went here for my wife's birthday. Having been to the Roy's in Waikiki, I wanted to see if this Roy's was anything different. The ambience is quite cozy with the low lighting. We started with the Canoe Appetizer for Two which had the following: Thai Peanut Chicken Satay, Vegetable Spring Rolls, Szechuan Ribs, Spicy Tuna Roll, Kim Chee & Lobster Potstickers. Everything was DELICIOUS! Come with an empty stomach and this will be demolished i tell you. I like how each item came with a different sauce so you get a good variety of flavors and taste. My wife had the Roasted macadamia Nut crusted mahi mahi and I had the Asian fried chicken with sweet potato mash and asparagus for our entrees. I had the prie fixed menu which also included the tuna sashimi as my appetizer. The food was great of which we had still had a lot left over for breakfast tomorrow. We had the molten chocolate cake for our dessert. My wife is a chocoholic and she loved it. There were 2 things I remember that made this experience memorable for us. 1) Roy's made a special menu with my wife's name and 2) they gave a complimentary dessert with a candle. So overall, our night went great and eating at Roy's brought me back to dining at home in Hawaii.
