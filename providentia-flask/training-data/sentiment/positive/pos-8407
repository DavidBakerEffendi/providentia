Best authentic souther Cali tacos in the south. Randy, the owner/operator, is the perfect side dish to compliment the freshness in the pork, chicken and beef tacos. He warned me that one taco was a nice snack and two would be pushing and 3 would knock me out. I should have listened but I'll suffer happily with a full belly of yummy tacos.
