We were a party of 7 and had no issues with making a reservation.
Tried one of the daily specials, lemon fennel sausage pizza. It was great, the fennel sausage really shines. It should be added to the regular menu!

Also gave the duck confit pizza another shot; we had tried it at the Ossington location last time and wasn't impressed. The confit was plesantly moist this time around and was better on the Danforth.

The cremini mushroom pizza was creamy with an (un)healthy layer of cheese... Mmm. I would say it's my favourite of the four we had that night.

This location is great for groups.
