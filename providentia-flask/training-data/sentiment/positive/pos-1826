This is a wonderful ice cream gem! The cookie dough pops are fantastic (I had the Twix) and the peanut butter ice cream sandwich was also super yummy! The staff was super helpful and nice and were really quick with our order. I would definitely check this place out if you like ice cream and fun deserts!
