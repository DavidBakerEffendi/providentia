I don't say this often, but believe the hype. 
I had seen all the 5 star reviews but never felt the need to come here until after the taco trek and if I had on a pair of socks they would've been blown off. 
The staff was extremely nice and courteous despite how many of us were there. They let everybody sample and described everything as much as was needed
The gelato itself was amazing. Good consistency and a multitude of Flavors. I originally started off with a double scoop of mango and strawberry. It wasn't bad, but after consulting with my fellow yelpers I had to sneak back for round 2. That ended up being the extremely strange sounding but super delicious combo of pistachio and blue cheese. Didn't expect to love it as much as I did but I have no complaints. 
Overall it was a great experience and I'm sure I'll be checking them out when the weather gets really warm
