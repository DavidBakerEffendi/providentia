Wow! Thanks (again) to all my Yelp "friends"....  This place is fantastic! Considering how much I miss Hawaii & poke this really hits the spot!

Really, really good poke. We got the spicy combo, shoyu and ocean salad. It was so good we went back to get more to have for dinner later. Along with some huli huli chicken....  a special for today - lucky for us we showed up when they have this delicious dish available because from what the owner said it's not often. Also, I'm usually not a big fan of most versions of macaroni salad but be sure to try the mac salad here. It's some of the best I've ever had  

Great friendly service and we got a couple of malasadas to go.  I'm in heaven!
