Quaint house turned restaurant is the perfect place for a casual, intimate meal with friends. Even non-vegan/vegetarians love it.  Fried cauliflower tacos?  Yes please!!!  Breakfast scramble burrito with tofu?  Mmmmmm.  Flavors you'll remember!  You'll be hard pressed to find a friendlier staff anywhere.
