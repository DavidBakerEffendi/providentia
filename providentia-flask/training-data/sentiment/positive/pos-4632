I came here to celebrate a close friend's birthday in a party of four. We ate, we drank, we spent 3.5 hours at Earth having a fantastic time. No one rushed us, we were well taken care of by our waiter, and the manager came by to make sure we were having a great experience. 

The food was fabulous in two ways; the taste was amazing, and the presentation was gorgeous. The guest of honour was vegan, and the chef had no problem creating a beautiful vegan meal for her (off the menu) that she said tasted amazing. 

The furniture is modern, the ambiance is relaxed, and if you choose to spend your evening here, I believe you will not be disappointed.
