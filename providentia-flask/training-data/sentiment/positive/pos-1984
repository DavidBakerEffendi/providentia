When we decided to buy a house, my husband's main concern was where his new go-to bar was going to be. He insisted we were now too far from any good ones. He was pleasantly surprised when I insisted that we try Stoke's. 

Don't be discouraged by the the bars location in a strip mall (I know we initially were). The bar is a nice size with high tops along the window. The restaurant section is a little sterile so we prefer to sit in the bar. 

The main selling point is the beer selection! They have multiple coolers filled with beers to choose from and the bartender is more than knowledgable to make suggestions if they are out of a fave. 

So far everything we've tried food wise has been delicious. My mom is obsessed with their chicken philly and my husband liked "the dank". I've heard good things about their soup but it's been to hot outside for me to try any. 

We will definitely make this a go to place!
