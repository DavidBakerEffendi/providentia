This little deli type restaurant is hidden off 74, I was sort of optimistic when I first walked in because I saw the bar of veggies spread out like subway; but much to my surprise it was delish! The gyro was great and the broccoli soup tastes homemade! The two teens that were working were super nice and answered all of our questions. Price was average, our bill was $20 for two combo meals and one kids meal! Would definitely recommend!
