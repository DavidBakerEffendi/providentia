I'm not sure why this was ever given 2 stars as a rating. It is so not! The food is amazing....to the point where if you weren't sitting in a public place, you would pick that plate up and just lick the sauce off of it, savoring every last taste. Try the mango curry with pork (or your preferred meat).
