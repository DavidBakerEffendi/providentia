Ridiculously amazing food that isn't overpriced. Lunch is an incredible meal deal, along with quick friendly service. Dinner is more intimate to me with servings enough to share family style. Start off with the pakora and naan breads. Currently they are offering all-you-can-eat Thali platters!!!! This is great because you get to sample many of their great selections, especially the lamb masala and lamb vindaloo. Lamb Biriyani is another classic fave of mine. Vegan choices are also available but you know I couldn't speak on that. I discovered the mango lassi and can drink a pitcher of it; refreshing and the perfect accompaniment to the spicy dishes. The small wine selection offers plenty to pair with your dish choices. I love to finish off with the dessert and suggest asking for the ras malai. It's not on the menu but you'll love it! Take out is available and you can sit at the bar to check out the wonderful patrons that flock here.

I keep pretty great company when it comes to food. Check out the other reviewers, most of them are my friends. To give credit where it is due, I followed a dear friend and fellow Yelper Jonathan L.'s suggestion and embarked on a deeper appreciation for Indian food. You will find no better place to explore that than here. You know you can't venture too wrong if you bring a vegan Indian friend and they gush about the food right?!!
