RM (downstairs restaurant) is one of the best kept lunch secrets on the Strip.  It is also a great place to go for simple, very fresh and well prepared seafood and drinks.

This is another of those restaurants that I have visited over 20 times in the past six months.  It is very consistent.  I never have any complaints about this place.

The restaurant is typical of the Mandalay Bay properties;  trendy and comfortable.

Service is very good.  Bar tenders are very friendly and knowledgeable and are more than willing to share experiences with a diner sitting alone.  

Now the food.  This place makes an incredible fish sandwich.  For $15, it's the best value in a fish sandwich you will get anywhere on the Strip.  Beer battered halibut topped with slaw and an incredible tartar sauce in a lightly toasted bun.  I'm making myself hungry just writing about it.

Sushi is also a good choice.  Try any of their signature rolls.  The rolls are anything but typical combining ingredients that you would never expect such as veal sweetbreads or jalape√±o peppers.  If you are having lunch, one roll is sufficient.  The price may seem high ($15-$20 / roll) but it is wholly justified when you  see the amount of fish and effort that goes into the various sauces served to complement your lunch.

If you want simple and fun, try the oyster tasting.  They give you a sheet with a description of the flavor of each oyster.  Yes, you can really taste the difference.  Perhaps have a glass of dry sherry or extra dry Hendricks gin martini to go with it.

Finally, the king crab is to die for.  So it's expensive. It is also fresh and perfectly cooked.  Do not pass this up.

I have tried the "fancier fare" at RM and its all good BUT, simple is where this sustainable seafood eatery really shines.  Why adultery a good thing right?

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
