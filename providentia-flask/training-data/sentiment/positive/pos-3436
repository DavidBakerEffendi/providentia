Wow!  That's the word I would use to describe my foodie experience at this wonderful resto located on st-viateur.  This resto definately deserves 5 stars. All of the dishes I tried were beautifully plated and the combination of different ingredients created wonderful flavors that would please any palate. It is definately worth trying out. The resto itself is small and perfect for a date night,  special occasions or friends get together. The service was super friendly which created a warm cozy environment . The chef is a true artist and does an excellent job at taking simple ingredients such as broccoli to create wonderful mouth-watering dishes! Will definately go back!
