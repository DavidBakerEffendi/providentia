My absolute favourite brunch place. There is quite a bit of a wait on the weekends. I usually get the Toronnah but have tried and loved the pulled pork eggs benny as well. My boyfriend usually gets the regular breakfast. The crispy home fries are probably the best part though. The coffee isn't that great though, but if it comes free with your meal then why not.
