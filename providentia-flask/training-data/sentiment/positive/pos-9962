Kyklos has THE best Greek food anywhere. We have been patrons of this Restaraunt for many years now, and were invited back by Sophocles after our last visit a week or so ago. 

The food here is always fresh and delightful. The customer service is unbeatable and the brothers really do treat you like family when you are here. I'm pretty sure we even met mama Kyklos last time, which is awesome. 

You will never hear me say a bad word about this place - the food, service, or the people. If you want great Greek food, don't look anywhere else.
