This place is fantastic.  5$ hot dog - beef or veggie with unlimited toppings.  I got banh mi slaw, fried egg, mushrooms, onions, yum yum sauce.  I stopped at one but was so delicious I could have eaten 3.  The tater tots are excellent and unlimited dipping sauces provides entertainment.  They have pinball machines and arcades.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.

Theres free parking after 6pm in a designated lot across the street!
