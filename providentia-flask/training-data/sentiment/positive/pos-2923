If you're looking for a good sandwich, it's tough to beat Geno's. Not a lot of decent places around Gilbert other than TGIF, Applebees, etc...so Geno's stands out. The classic and the provolone are done just right. If you're going to go with take out, get it home fast. As with most cheessteaks, it doesn't take long to get a soggy sandwich. Wings are solid as well.
