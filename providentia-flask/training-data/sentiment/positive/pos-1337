We were having a staycation at the sls, the bf was on an anything with truffle oil mood (I know it's all chemicals but I didn't have the heart to tell him).  We ordered the Tartufo pizza which had truffle oil,  roasted garlic, mozzarella, mushrooms and arugula. The pizza is made Subway style with the guy putting the toppings in front.  It really did only a few minutes to cook.  The pizza crust was crispy and a little soggy in the middle which is ok since Napolitano pizza is not that bready.  The overall toppings blended well. Definitely a winner.  :p
