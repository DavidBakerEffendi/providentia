Checked on Yelp to see ratings. It was a 4 star.  Checked front door and they have an A  rating from health department. Have living near this business for a number if years, but, never stopped. What a surprise.  I had the sweet and sour shrimp. There were 9-10 nice sized shrimp and the fried rice was very good. The wife had the Orange Chicken and fried rice. She was impressed with her meal just as I was with mine. They are local owned and not a chain.  Each meal is cooked to order and not sitting on a hot table. Staff was efficient and friendly. Overall this was a great stop for a great meal. Will be back.
