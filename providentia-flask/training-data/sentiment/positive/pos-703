Oh, Armadillo Grill...you are something special.

The first time I came here it was late at night and I wasn't expecting much at all. From the outside this bar didn't really look like my style, but the moment I stepped inside, I was confused. It's had a semi-dive feel and there were a couple of really good DJs that night. I began to think that this place was going to be an alright spot to eat late at night. Then I had the food...

Two words: Fried Pickles. I've had them before at other places but Armadillo serves the best I've ever had. They were mind-boggling good! Not only were they like delicious sin in my mouth, they were also on a happy hour menu! $3.50 for an order of six! After the pickle came the chicken and I can say with confidence that it's the best chicken I've had at a bar. It doesn't matter if you get the strips or the buffalo chicken sandwich, they are both mouthwatering (writing about it right now is making me hungry). That night I left really content and sure that I would be back, and not just late at night!

Once I returned I knew I should try a few other things but I'm always compelled to get the chicken. I did manage to taste the mac and cheese (with buffalo chicken!), their wings and the chicken parm. Everything was spectacular (especially as far as pubs go)!

The staff at Armadillo Grill has always been great and I'm sure they will continue to be as I wiggle my way into becoming a regular here! Great happy hour, great food and friendly service in a really chill bar equals two huge thumbs up from me (I jammed them so they're both swollen)!
