I love it!  It's a perfect fir for the area.  We really needed a nice, casual tavern, which is neither a sterile restaurant nor a grimy bar.  The name suits it...social house.  The food amzingly complements the atmosphere, and the decor with the open air feel bring it all together.  Great job guys, I'll see you there regularly.
