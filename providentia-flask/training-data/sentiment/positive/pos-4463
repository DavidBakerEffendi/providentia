I am in love and it's with a restaurant. I came here after a difficult week to treat myself to a fancy lunch. I ordered the soup and sandwich combo-on the weekend you can't get the deal price though FYI. It was of course delicious. If it's your first time here try the pizza though, BBQ chicken is my favorite.

They have a nice wine selection, I really likes the house chard. You can order a regular or large sized glass. 

I say at the bar and talked to the bar tender who was super sweet and didn't make me feel like a big loser for sitting alone.

This is a great location for a wonderful restaurant, I will go again for sure!
