i don't know if it was a slow night, but when we came here last in 2011, you had to wait to be seated, the place would be packed. not so much anymore. i guess that's the life of a scottsdale restaurant. 
some things don't change and the nutella banana calzone is just as delicious as ever. service was excellent, and from what i remember, the pizza's are divine!
