I love Swan. It's not a greasy diner, but a place that does brunch, dinner and lunch  in a very unique way without ignoring the comfort food standard that a Diner should provide. Yes, the lineups can get annoying, but I try to come at off peak hours to avoid.

Their Bloody Caesar with fresh horseradish is my favourite in the city. They do Americanos (my go to caffeinated beverage) instead of brewed coffee. Oysters are freshly shucked and delicious. Hangtown Fry is a delicious scramble of oysters, eggs and spices. Speaking of eggs--- the eggs here are the freshest most delicious I've had in Toronto. Omelette secials are enourmous and bursting with ingredients. The multigrain bread from Sliversteins that they use for their toast is so nutty!

About this bacon absence. I actually kind of like it. *ducking and peering suspiciously for fear of being shot*. If forces you to have something different. The pancetta is crispy and salty-- just like bacon, but not nearly as greasy.

I'm not usually a salad girl, but they have this great one on the regular menu as well as the brunch menu. It's greens with Smoked Arctic Char, baby potatoes, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced onions, avocado and a slightly creamy dressing. It's the perfect balance of flavour and texture. I've actually passed up eggs for this salad.

In m experience, service has always been keen here. I've visited at least once every six months over the last 10 years. I love the kitchy charm here and will be back again and again.

Happy Happy!
