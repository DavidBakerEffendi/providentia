I have loved this place for years! They are so delicious and the service is great. I try to make it to the galleria every month just to go there. I love how its a family business and that the owners work there. One of the brothers is the type that remembers your face and always personally acknowledges you, great customer service! The chicken gyro plate is to die for. I travel almost 20-30 minutes just to have my Kyklos fix!!
