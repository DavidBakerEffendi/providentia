Quality of ambience and food for this price point??!!! A win-win for the Southwest part of LV! Phenomenal! I had a few appetizers- all incredible, and happy hour beverages. Prices are super reasonable, service was excellent, and the atmosphere/vibe in this restaurant are exquisite! I'll definitely be back!
