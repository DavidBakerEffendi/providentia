Flat out loved this neighborhood wine and beer spot. Quaint cozy and inviting. It felt like we walked into a friends party. The bartenders had a smile and shared some of their favorite brews. We missed the live music but heard it was amazing. We had several types of beers like the Schilling Ascender ginger, Maui coconut porter and the Ginger lemon  rattler. Not sure if I spelled them right but neither disappointed. Cool music selection. Looking forward to making this our spot a few times a month. Loving the Rotty pics since we had one named Apollo (RIP). Haven't tried the light bites yet but I'm sure they won't disappoint. So you there!
