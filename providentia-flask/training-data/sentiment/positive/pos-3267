Tried this place for the first time the other day and had a great experience!  Right off the bat, I loved the decor! The menu is written in scrabble tiles and the space itself seems like a cross between an industrial space and a home library. Very cute! 

Our barista was the owner. I forget her name, but she was very sweet and definitely knew how to make some delicious coffee!

I also appreciated that there were board games. Sometimes the best part of a day can be cozying up with friends to enjoy a mocha and some Trivial Pursuit! 

My only complaint is that the restroom is around the corner--still indoors but part of a wide open room used for conferences. Wouldn't have been an issue, except I had to walk through a live conference to use the restroom, and I'm sure everyone in the audience heard me flush! Wah!

Otherwise, great visit! I'd love to go back!
