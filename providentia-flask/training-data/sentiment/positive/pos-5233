First time here , I highly recommend it , worth the drive for us , friends flew in from out of town saying let's go here , drinks amazing , staff super friendly Really clean ,enough space to sit around ..1/2 price appetizer always a hit , we had enough food to share ..the waiter recommended drinks and they were awesome
