Finally me a pizza that I really love! Cross between fast food and casual dinning.  I am eating the BBQ pizza and it is so yummy. The bbq sauce is crammelized.

I love the fact freon order to eating only took 9 ninutes and the staff were very friendly and understood me.

This one is a winner and I will be back for sure!
