The Peppermill is a Vegas "must-do" attraction.  Not only is it far enough north on the Strip to give you that old Vegas feel, it still has the look and feel of the old school, flashy for the sake of being flashy, design to it.

The real reason make the Peppermill a stop on your Vegas Vacation is for the food.  Not just pancakes and eggs and toast kind of place.  They serve breakfast all day and the portions are truly ridiculous.  The staff here is super friendly and they are always willing to work with you on the menu if you want to be a little bit creative.

On my last visit, I couldn't decide between breakfast or lunch.  I asked the server if I could combine the two and build a lamb gyro omelet.  The end result was a massive 10 egg omelet filled with lamb meat and feta cheese all smothered in  dill tzatziki sauce.  If you like Greek dishes, then give it a try.  

Incidentally, in the parking lot there was a brand new Lamborghini being delivered by West Coast Customs.  This place is hysterical, in the "we're laughing with you" kind of way.
