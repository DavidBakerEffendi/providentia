Was driving down 82 with pooch and spied this out of the corner of my eye. I think the fact that it said "restaurant AND lounge" intrigued me. I've never really partied in a Chinese lounge. The nondescript face of the building has echoes of the VTR. You're not sure if there really even is a restaurant inside. This place...man...it was like a kind of pulp magazine fever dream. While the dining room was pretty standard fare, the lounge is probably one of the weirdest places I've ever been. Smaller than my basement bar(about three stools and a couple booths), it is surrounded on three sides by said dining room. Dude had Chinese tv on and was stocking the bar with ice. This was at 11 am. If this place was in Tremont or Detroit Shoreway, it would be one of the kitschy treasures of our ever more ironic scene. Think Tina's niteclub meets a vintage bar set for sale at Suite Lorain. Yet, here it sits, nestled away in sleepy North Royalton. I can only imagine how freaky this place gets at night. Magnificent.

Anyhow, had to rustle up some lunch vittles for me and the dog. Ordered spring rolls, ten steamed dumplings and a lunch portion of chicken subgum. Fourteen bucks total. The subgum had to be a dinner portion. Huge. The dumplings were fantastic. Tasted very fresh(we ate a few on the road). A very awesome surprise to find in my travels around the burbs.
