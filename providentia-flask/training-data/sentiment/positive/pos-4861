I work down the street and run here for food when I don't bring food, I've gone thru the drive thru several times and never had a problem with waiting. My order is always correct, they've even ran after my car when I forgot my soda, the staff is always friendly. You guys make it an easy decision for a quick meal. 2 thumbs up ! Keep it up!
