Went out to Vegas for work with only X amount of cash on hand to skate by so I got groceries from here on the cheap to have on hand in my hotel room to a) get work done and b) save money. They have a bakery section, small deli for prepackaged goodies and aisle upon aisle of every beloved Asian snack or beverage imaginable. Got a big bottle of Thai tea (36 oz) for $3.50 - major score.
