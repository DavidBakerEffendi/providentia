Loved the food, tons of vegetables, and happy friendly people who love their product and enjoy helping us. We will be back for brunch or dinner.  

Meatball cone- good taste, but felt like for $9 he should of gotten a side. 
Mild sausage and sauce- small plater -my 6 year old enjoyed the meal and it was nice tasty spicy sausage and "I like it with the spicy sauce" bolognese sauce(the restaurant employee was super nice to allow her try some sauces) 
Mac and cheese- small side- always a hit and big enough that she could not finish it. 4year old 
Power bowl- build your own with everything, chicken, and arribiata ? Sauce. It was loaded with vegetables!!!! Yummy  
Side of vegetables- lots of fresh garlic, delicious
