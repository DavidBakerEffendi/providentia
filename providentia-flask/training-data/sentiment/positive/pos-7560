Ok so. I grew up in Phoenix and I have been to this place a total of 4 times including this visit. Each time I have never had a bad experience with the service or food. So this visit:
Went in got seated immediately greeted nicely. Was given our drinks. We ordered our food and it was delivered to our table pretty quickly. 

The food: 
I ordered the Enchilada Dinner - great dinner
Hubs: Chimichanga - spicy but good ate it all
Pops: Red Chili plate- great! Ate it all.
The chips and salsa of course spicy salsa but continued to eat it. 

No bad experience or review. Will be coming back. 

The food is SPICY! So don't ask for Mild they Don't Got it!
