I LOVE Quiznos, a lot better than some other fast food sandwich places. I think the bread quality is better here and the ingredients are fresher. It just seems so much more convenient to me to order the sandwich from the menu and they prepare it for me. Then I add the extra jalapeno peppers and peppercinis. Also I'm a big fan of their honey mustard sauce.
