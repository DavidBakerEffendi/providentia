The main event, the eggs, are scrumptious! They are super fluffy and evenly cooked (does Eggslut use a sous vide? because it seems like they do). 

I had the Fairfax sandwich- caramelized onion, chives, cheddar cheese, and siracha mayo on scrambled eggs in a brioche bun- and loved every bit of it. As I said earlier, the scrambled eggs were super fluffy! The brioche bun is freaking delicious, and all the flavors of this sandwich melded well together. Loved the value and experience of this meal. Well worth the $10. 

My friend had the Slut, of course. This egg came in a really cute jar with a creamy pureed mashed potato cushion. Flavors were much subtler. I enjoyed the texture of all components but prefered my sandwich for the flavor and size. Cost was approximately the same between our two dishes. 

Overall really liked this space and the food. There's a big bunny who might remind you of a woman's anatomy and cute cracked-egg chairs! Loved the colors and the vibes. Also appreciated that I could get breakfast for  $10. Vegas food is notoriously expensive so I enjoyed this option whole-heartedly!
