Update: decided to give BLD a chance for dinner,  it was really really good,  I had the roasted beet salad and my boyfriend had the "goat"burger.  The food blew us away, and our server Caroline was wonderful,  we had our drinks asap and our food was hot and delicious.  We will come back sooner than every few months!
