The Venetian is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas.  It blends the perfect amount of wonder and amusement with very affordable suites.

The accommodations are very comfortable and quite large.  I prefer the suites here to those at Palazzo.  There are TVs in the bathroom.  There's also a large tub.  The beds are comfortable.  There is additional seating in the room that's quite roomy.

Newer casinos in Vegas are, perhaps, more chic.  However, I will take comfortable and roomy over hip any day.

MUST SEE SOON: The Winter in Venice parade is awesome.  My daughter had a blast dancing with the performers.
