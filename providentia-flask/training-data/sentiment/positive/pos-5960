Amazing Food!!! This has to be my favourite Hakka places!  Scarborough knows how to do hakka.  My favourite items are the chilli chicken (dry version), fish pakora, crispy beef, Manchurian noodles and Singapore rice noodles. The staff are always very friendly and give great portions !  Used to go to Federicks / Lin Garden but now this is my go to place! They also have really good lunch specials!
