This place deserves 6 stars. I was seriously blown away by the food here while visiting Toronto for the first time. 

A friend suggested we check this spot out, and I'm so glad we did. I wasn't really wowed by the menu, so let my boyfriend order whatever he wanted for us to share. 

I had one bite of the sashimi.. and was slapped across the face with its freshness and knew I had underestimated this place. It was probably some of the best fish I've had. Another memorable dish were the chicken wings, and also the beef short ribs. I wish I could even describe how good they were, but there are no words. You must experience it for yourself. 

Love the atmosphere here. It's super chill and relaxed. I loved the memorabilia on the wall, and thought it was cool to see people's coats hanging on the wall. It's like an ever-rotating art gallery of the clothes and expressions of the guests eating here. 

It's a small and intimate place, so I'd recommend making a reservation if you don't want to wait.
