I'd like to start off By saying that if licking your plate clean was socially acceptable I would have done it. 50 times over. 

My wife had been here twice prior to us going on a date. Once with a gf of hers and once with my mother and hers. I was really excited to go tonight, and so glad I did.

I'm very very fond of patios in Toronto. There are quite a few patios I like but this place has my favourite patio now. It's not something you'd expect, my romantic, spacious but small, modern and clean. Perfect. The inside of the restaurant is quite small too but also clean, modern and romantic. 

The service was great. We were attended to by a few different people, all of which were naturally friendly and attentive. We did not have to wait long to be seated, to get our drinks, and to get our dinner.

The food was really really good. I mean, I would have licked my plate, as I've said before. I had the gnocchi with bacon and chicken, my wife had the home made tomatoe soup and mushroom bruschetta (although oddly it didn't made together - the mushroom and lettuce was separate from the bread with cheese on it). Our meals were still great.

I think for 2 drinks, two appetizers paired as a meal and my gnocchi entree - paying $54 and change was a fair price. 

I loved it here. Can't wait to come back.
