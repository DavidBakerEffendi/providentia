What an amazing experience!!! I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant, tried so many different dishes and loved all of them! 

Each tapa we tried was a new discovery of amazingly well put together flavours and fresh ingredients prepared with thought and expertise. 

The service was as incredible as the food. Congratulations to the owners and his team for an incredible dining establishment!
