Ok... plain and simple it's great pizza made by good people.

There are numerous places throughout Vegas and Henderson to get pizza. But getting good pizza for a great price is very rare. Jesse's has pretty damn good pizza for pretty damn good prices.

Tonight I went with the large (16") pepperoni pizza. If you're not a fan of thin crust pizza then this place might not be for you but if you love a good NY style thin crust pizza then this one is on point.

Crust is tasty, crispy on the edge and not overly soggy. The sauce has a good taste. Not overly acidic and has a good zest to it. They aren't stingy with the toppings. Cheese is fresh, stringy, tasty, and melted to perfection. Pepperoni is cooked perfectly every time. Wish it had more of that crispy burnt texture to it but with the pizza so thin it would probably burn the crust.

Overall I gave the pepperoni a firm 5/5 and for the prize of under $13 you can't eat it. Be warned though, if you're hungry you'll be able to finish off a whole pizza like I did! It's that addicting.

We also got the veggie pizza. Got the small (12") and it didn't disappoint. Olives, mushrooms, onion, green peppers... yeah all that good stuff! The crust seemed slightly thicker in the small. Good thing it was.

Like all veggie pizzas, with all those veggies the crust seems to absorb all the moisture. If the crust had been as thin as the other pizza it would have been a soggy mess. I love the richer more savory style pizza so I would have had to add sausage or something to this one to truly enjoy it but if you're a vegetarian then this won't disappoint. Another 5/5!
