so, maybe a little expensive...but outstanding preparation and quality.  Beyond that, I have to give special mention to our waiter, Clifton(?), the most knowledgable waiter I've come across in a long time.  He really knew and understood the menu, and provided information and sugggestions without being overbearing or patronizing.  An excellent expreince.
