This place was excellent. I was craving tempura vegetables and my boyfriend ordered teriyaki chicken. We both got combos. The tempura was nice and light. The teriyaki was subtle and not overly sweet. They were not stingy with the rice. The combos came with miso soup and a gyoza. I thought the miso was fine. It was a nice addition to the meal. It was filling and a nice salty treat after a workout. I could take or leave gyoza in general because it's fried, but I thought it was pretty good as gyoza go. I might order miso soup a la carte next time simply because that's my preference and I never got particularly excited for lunch combo deals. 

When it's a small family owned restaurant, it seems like you are pressured to eat the whatever they put with the lunch combo so as not to offend the chef. I would not want to offend the chef here because the food was really good and the people running the place seemed really nice. We read the reviews before going and the man at the front is not "grumpy". If anything he is rather quiet, but we got very good customer service.
