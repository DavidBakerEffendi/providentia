If you look up gourmet pizza in the dictionary, Pizzeria Bianco's pizza choices would be staring back at you.  This was some of the tastiest pizza of it's kind that I've had in some time.  As a native of Chicago, I am an open minded pizza lover (I mean I, of course, am a bit biased when it comes to deep dish pizza) but I LOVE pizza and especially love trying different types of toppings, crusts and sausage.  Pizzeria Bianco was all it was cracked up to be (however, I would NOT wait hours to be seated as I've heard is how things go at the downtown location...it's not THAT awesome, lol!)  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is really casual and nice- especially on the patio on a nice 80 degree evening :-)  Will be visiting again and again!
