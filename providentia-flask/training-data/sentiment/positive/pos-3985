I absolutely love this place!! I honestly can't believe this is my first time reviewing or checking in at this place because it's right down the street from my house and I come here a lot! So I definitely recommend all the food here! 

Their reuben is very good and popular. I just had one this week and the corned beef was nice and hot!!! Just Amazing! And the fries!! If you remember Burger Kings old fries that's what they taste like! Double fried crispy goodness!!! 

I also recommend their chicken salad sandwich, any salad - huge portions, they've got great chili and they top it off with onions and cheese. They also have hot dishes like their crab stuffed flounder or ranchero chicken - and if you like mixed veggies their side of veggies is a large portion and so good.
