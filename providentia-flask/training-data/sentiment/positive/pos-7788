I have officially found a great (and now my favorite) Mexican place in Cleveland.  Salsa is fresh, guacamole is made to order, and the food is downright awesome.  Small little place with a few seats at the bar and a TV.  Lots of pictures of folks wearing sombreros, celebrating a birthday.  Don't let the outside of the building fool you.  It looks decrepit and like it could blow over in a stiff breeze.  Park in the back and walk in.  The cheese enchiladas are the best I have ever had.  And the wet burrito with chicken (real, shredded chicken) is killer.  Their mole is every bit as good as what I had when I lived in California.  Portions are super generous, too.  Lady who works there adds to the charm and authenticity of the place and she has a warm, welcoming smile.  Clean bathrooms to boot.  5 stars all the way--no wonder it's been in business for 39 years.
