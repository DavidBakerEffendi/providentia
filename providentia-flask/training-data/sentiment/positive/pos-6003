I have been waiting to go here and I finally got the chance to go tonight!  And oh my it was an amazing decision. My fianc√© got a macaroon ice cream sandwich. They only had a couple flavors available but she got a birthday cake macaroon. The ice cream had chunks of cake in it. I got the doughnut sandwich. I can't member the exact name but it was amazing.  They have a menu you can chose from but you can also create your own.  I ordered a cookie dough ice cream with strawberry syrup and strawberry short cake crumbs. They make it right in front of you and then warm up the doughnut. It was very good. Will definitely be going back to this place many to try their many creations.
