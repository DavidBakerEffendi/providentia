I first heard about this place through my friend who visited it not too long ago and said it was really good to try so i figured why not go ahead and try it ? Im actually going to review the two times i visited in one post so here we go...

The first time i went , it was pretty early on in the day so it was not so busy until we eventually had to leave , anyways our server was exceptional !!! I wish i had her name to give her props on her service but nonetheless everyone who was working there was pretty good with their customer service 

I was indecisive at first on what to order since i had to choose between the almond chicken tenders or the chicken sandwich special they had that week which was the chicken tandoori !! I eventually opted for the chicken tenders with a side of truffle fries and boy was i happy that i made that choice !!! The chicken was so moist and tender with a crispy outside from the almonds and what made me love them even more was the fact that they were not oily at all because one of my biggest pet peeves is eating oily fried chicken !!! 

The second time i went i went ahead and ordered the UFO burger with all the trimmings this too was a good choice. The patty was thick and juicy and not chewy at all !! The bun was the cherry on top , with it being soft and fluffy it did not sog up the juices of the burger which could have made it soggy

On both visits i ordered truffle fries and honestly .... it was the best thing i had there !!! My love for truffle is endless so this really topped it for me especially with the shaved parm on top !! yum !!!

What i loved most about union social eatery is the fact that there are many choices available so the place could feed many different taste buds !!
