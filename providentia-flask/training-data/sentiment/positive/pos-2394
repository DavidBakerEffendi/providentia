I've been here twice since moving to Arizona. The location is easy to find and the outward appearance has great curb appeal. The architecture alone beckoned me to come. Once inside, the décor was magnificent. The two times I had went, the restaurant was empty. The first visit, I had their lunch buffet. I absolutely loved it. Before this I had never had Indian food. I couldn't tell you what I had other than there was green food, yellow and red. For the price, I felt it was a great deal. I think my favorite was their toasted flatbread brushed with butter and garnished with cilantro. My second time in I had brought a date. We had wonderful entrée's. The service was great, very attentive and kind. I love this place, and would gladly return, anytime. Indian is the new Chinese for me. Love, love, love. for this great establishment.
