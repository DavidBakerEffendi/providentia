This place absolutely rocks, I really like to come here and order a fully loaded Margherita pizza

extra red sauce, extra fresh mozzarella, grilled onions, prosciutto, spinach, and then when they put it in the oven I asked him to make it a little longer so the blisters grow and our little extra dark this makes the pie so crispy and delicious.

 The staff here is amazing they are very well trained the food comes out extremely fast you will not be disappointed by the quality of this amazing artisan pizza...


Pro Tip: Try the Meatballs with caramelized onions,, they are mind blowing.
