This cafe recently opened up and is on the top level of the Wami Ootaya restaurant! 

It has a really peaceful atmosphere with quiet music and lots of comfortable seating. I really like all the windows that bring in sunlight and cute cat cushions that surround the cafe! 

The cafe has shaved ice treats and crepes along with bubble tea. You can also order food from the regular menu and eat it upstairs at the cafe. 

The bubble tea is really good - I like the earl grey milk tea and the original milk tea. There aren't as many bubble tea options here compared to chatime across the street though. Amongst the shaved ice options - I like the matcha snow with red beans and mochi. The mango shaved snow was too dry and the mangoes were not ripe so I would not recommend it. 

Overall I really love this place to chill and get some work done and the servers are super friendly. There's a stamp card that gets you a free bubble tea with 10 drinks so get one if you are like me and come here too often haha
