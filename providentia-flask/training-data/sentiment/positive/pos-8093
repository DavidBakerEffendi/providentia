Simply amazing! My husband and I always pass by this Oregano's on Camelback and never tried it until recently. We arrived on a Friday night and it was crazy. There was. 45 minute wait but we got lucky and found a spot at the bar. The inside is very eclectic and warm, and we were greeted multiple times from everyone there. We perused the menu and decided to try their deep dish pizza (which they warned us ahead of time would take 40-50 minutes to make) so in the meantime we got the deep fried ravioli with jalape√±o cheese and it was very good! We also got 2 almost 24oz beers to go with it and the price was decent for those. We finally got our pizza and it was delicious! We were a little wary of the price but since it's deep dish, you pretty much take the rest home and have leftovers for the next 2 days so it's worth it! We will definitely be back and bring friends because you could easily get a meal for 4 people out of their servings.
