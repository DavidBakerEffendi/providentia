YUM! I was so pleasantly surprised by this place. I am weary of Mexican food that is smack right in the middle of old town. In many cases they are only places to get drunk or they are super gimmicky. 

Cien Agaves had perfect food and drinks while staying reasonably priced. 

We were there for happy hour and sat up at the bar. The bartender was completely cool. 

I had the tostadas which was an enormous serving and a potato cheese taco. Tostadas were loaded with beans, cheese, lettuce, cabbage and I topped it off with their delicious salsa. When I had their potato taco I thought I had died and went to heaven. My husband had the ceviche and tinga tacos, which he said was excellent.

Their house margarita was on special for happy hour... I'm usually weary of house margaritas. They are either too sweet or not strong enough. But these were great!

We will definitely be back! I want to try their veggie tacos....
