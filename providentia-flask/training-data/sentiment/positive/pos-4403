It's so hard to find good asian cuisine in Ajax when you're only there once a week and there's not as much heavy Yelp action, but this place came with some great reviews, and we gave it a shot.

We ordered a pho soup noodles with rare beef and beef balls. They actually missed the meat and ended up cooking some extra for my boyfriend which was very kind of her :) I ordered the bun. I like the grilled/ bbq meat with the vermicelli swimming in veggies and sauce. It was a great balance of flavours and generous portions at a decent price. 

Usually, I grab an avocado milk shake along with my meal, but we decided to try their lemon soda. I'm not sure what she puts in it for sweetener, but this is absolutely the most delicious lemon soda I've had. I let her know how much I loved it and she proudly let me know that it's a customer favourite. :) Don't forget to try it out if you get a chance to swing by. 

This place is rather small, seating just a few tables at a time, but service is quick and the over all dining experience is pleasant. In and out within 30-45 minutes. It's a solid vietnamese location that I'll definitely be swinging by again soon!
