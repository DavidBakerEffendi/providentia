Probably the best pizza place in town.  Not a take-the-entire-little-league-team kind of place, but more pizza for grownups.  Great location, wonderful ambiance, extensive (and affordable) wine list, good salads, and excellent pizza.  And the tira mi su is awesome.   The napoli pizza reminds me of the pizza I devoured while in Italy, but I think Grazie's is better.  

And if you are trying to impress a date, but don't want to break the bank, Grazie should be your choice.
