We wanted classic Italian cuisine without it getting crazy fancy on us like almost all the other Italian restaurants in Vegas.  Onda is delicious!!!!!!!!

Onda offers classic Italian cuisine.  My boyfriend and I started with a caprese salad which we shared- perfect.  Breadsticks - perfect.  Both my boyfriend and I ordered the Lasagna.......fantastic!  Cheese melted perfectly, and just the right amount of tasty sauce.  

We went on a Tues.- On Several days of the week the restaurant is closed, but they keep the wine eatery section open with a limited menu.  It actually wound up to be perfect because we had the whole back section to ourselves.  It was private and romantic.
