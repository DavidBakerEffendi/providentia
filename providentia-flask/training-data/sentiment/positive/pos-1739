Marigold Maison's food and service are wonderful, and the atmosphere is very welcoming.  We've been here several times and we never have had a bad meal or experience.  The chicken and lamb tikka marsala are my favorites, and they pair nicely with the garlic naan.  The prices are very reasonable, too.
