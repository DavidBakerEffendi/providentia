What a great spot! Conveniently located in downtown Phoenix, close to the light rail and freeway, friendly owners and staff, GREAT coffee and tea, cozy ambiance... what more could you ask for?

I had a cold brew iced coffee with vanilla syrup and soy milk. The coffee quality was perfect to me and the drink was well made. One of the owners, Erin, was personable and engaged with us casually while making our drinks.

This local, small business gets five stars and two thumbs up from me!
