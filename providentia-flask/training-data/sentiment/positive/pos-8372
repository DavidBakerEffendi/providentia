Pear Bistro is close to my hotel so I gave them a try. Their tea is delicious and rarely are appetizers better than meals but the Spinach dip is delicious! The Rigatoni was 4 stars but was still good but not the star of the show. Prices vary but are reasonable and they have some unique beers too. Service is fast and friendly! I recommend Perfect Pear Bistro!
