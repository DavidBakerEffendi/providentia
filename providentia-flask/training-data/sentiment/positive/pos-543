There comes a time in a Yelper's life where one wonders, 'Why on earth haven't I reviewed this place yet?' and I have that thought now about Chinos Locos. 

These 'Crazy Chinese' owners have stolen my heart through their delicious AZN take on the burrito. Seriously, Chow-freaking-Mein instead of rice and hunger-pang inducing grilled basa fish. I vehemently stand-by ordering 15 minutes in advance, because no one wants to watch them tauntingly grill, sizzle and fry in your presence. It's a cruel tease. 

Also, suck it, Chipotle. These guys also offer tortillas in whole wheat and include guacamole. You don't. 

My burrito of choice? Da Finest, $6.99. (From website: Sauteed white basa fish, guacamole, tomatoes, edamame beans, red onions, black beans, green peppers, cilantro, cheese, sour cream, chipotle sauce)
