WOW! $10 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch or $17 for dinner, what a deal.  Sure the menu is limited for the all-you-can-eat but the selections are great.  The staff is fairly friendly, not top-notch service but good enough.  The decor is modern and the place is clean.  I've been here a handful of times and never had a bad experience.

Skip the tempura tofu but definitely get the tempura veggies.
