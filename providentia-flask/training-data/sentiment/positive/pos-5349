I absolutely love this place. I eat here all the time. The food is so good it doesn't feel like fast food. It is so healthy and actually I feel better knowing I'm eating well. I get the BBQ bowl with the added grilled veggies and they are awesome. Don't skip the naan bread which I always buy extra. The mint yogurt sauce is so good I could drink it!
