We live in Las Vegas. About once a month we stop by the Fountains of the Bellagio. Always wonderful! We are in awe of the music choices! Beautiful!
We take our visitors to see the fountains, every single one of them. No doubt, living in Las Vegas brings our family a lot of visitors! All our friends and family from around the world come see us in this exciting city! We love it - and we would never want to miss the dancing Fountains of the Bellagio!

If you have a chance, go see the Fountains from top of the Eiffeltour! Amazing!
