The first time I went to N9NE, years ago, I was already 3 martinis deep... so I didn't think it'd be fair to review it based on that...

After my recent visit, sober, I think I can legitimately say it was nothing short of OUTSTANDING!

1. It was a Monday night. We were seated right as we walked in.
2. They were playing top 40, hip-hop at bar sound levels (which I would expect of the Palms & who their target audience is). The space is sleek, modern and spacious. Definitely not a traditional steakhouse-- like Smith & Wollensky's on the strip.
3. Yet, our server was professional, knowledgable and friendly.
4. My 24 oz. bone-in ribeye steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked just as I desired.
5. My lobster mashed potatoes were tasty, but not as rich as my girlfriend's creamed corn... mmmm.

If I could change anything about N9NE, it would be to remove the shoulder pads from their servers' white sportcoat/jacket uniforms and shorten their length. 

It was kind of disorienting to see all these Don Johnson/Miami Vice jackets walking around serving us...
