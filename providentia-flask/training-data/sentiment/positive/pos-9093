Our dinner last night was perfection!!!  Welcoming us the moment we set foot in the restaurant. Our waiter and his crew were totally in charge and anticipated all our needs. The food, well what can I say....  Super delicious and great presentation. What impressed me was before they brought our bill, we were asked if we were military or AARP members for senior discounts.   We didn't even ask. We were brought complimentary espresso and dessert!!!  THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FOOD. THANK YOU
