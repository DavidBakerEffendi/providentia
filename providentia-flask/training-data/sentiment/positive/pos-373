After reading the good reviews on Yelp, I decided to give Pan Asian a try.  Wow!  Fantastic!  They have DUCK.  I had the duck curry.  It was a very large portion with crispy duck skin on the outside and juicy duck meat beneath that crispy skin.  Look at the photo I posted to see the size of the meal.  Fantastic!

It's a red curry with pineapple chunks, red and green bell pepper, some white grapes, some tomato chucks, and mint leaves.  I asked for a spiciness of 7 and I ended up putting some more spices on to give it the kind of kick I like.

I so wanted to try the fried cheesecake for dessert but since I finished all the duck, I just didn't have room for dessert.

As stated by Ken, the husband and wife operate the restaurant with him being the server and her the cook.  They are delightful people who are very friendly.

I'll be back often because they have DUCK along with a lot of other good things, I'm sure.  Next time--dessert!
