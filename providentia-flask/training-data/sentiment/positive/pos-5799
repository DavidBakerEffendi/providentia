I call this place classy. Service was spot on from start to finish and each plate was detailed and complex.

Tapas were of decent size and we shared between us two. Food ordered:

Pork belly baos
-the pickled pineapple was the surprise ingredient here. Pork belly wasn't overdone and had the right amount of fat. Buns needed to be a little more fluffy and it would've been perfect

Singapore chili crab
-the chili sauce at the bottom has real crab meat mixed into it already so you needn't worry about shelling a lot of crab like the actual dish. Egg is fried with sunny side up (rather than incorporated in the sauce) so you can mix it in the sauce to get a creamer texture. It wasn't overly sweet or Spicy! You can dip the shishito peppers in it. Came with Asian crackers

Braised chicken and mash
- chicken is off the bone and super tender! No need to use your hands! The flavor was amazing, I can't explain it. You can definitely taste the red wine. The bacon was fried very crispy, it was good! The pearl onions will give you bad breath but it's worth it lol the mashed potatoes were wonderfully seasoned and flavored.

Brigadeiro Beast aka brazilian chocolate condensed milk dessert.
-garnished with chocolate balls that gave it a crunch, strawberries, blueberries and plum. Very rich and creamy

I loved the presentation of each dish along with how it was presented. I think it is reasonably priced for the quality of food you're getting. They are memorable but these recipes would be hard for anyone to mimick. you can't get them elsewhere and that's what this place gas it going for them.

Our server jeremy was engaging, friendly and helpful, easy to converse with. Checked up on us frequently. Upon his recommendation we will be back for the weekend brunch sometime!
