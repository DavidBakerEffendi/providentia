Very nice place. I love the cute little accents pieces at the front of the restaurant. Great for photos!! Tuesdays are $1 oysters. You can't beat this deal! You can order them regular or as a shooter. 
The braised short rib is really good. The meat is tender and flavorful joined by the spinach ricotta dumpling. It's very nice light meal. The roasted beet salad is very refreshing with the hazelnuts, bleu cheese and honey. The food is very good. Chef really seems to know how to mix things together to bring out the flavor. I've been very impressed both times I've eaten here. So far I've only ever sat at the bar but the service is always very good. The chairs at the bar are also really comfortable. Highly recommend.
