I will keep this one pretty simple. 

Always delicious, great atmosphere. Consistent excellence both in front and at back of house. Never fail items on the menu?  The white shrimp are always, and I mean for years now, always excellent.  sweet, large, never overcooked. The butchers platter (meat & cheese board) and half a dozen shrimp (and a bottle of wine) seem to get the trick done most times for my wife and I.  However, we've had everything on the menu, and oddly, the New York Strip (one of the easiest things on a menu to get right) has been the one item that hasn't wowed us.

But why order something that can easily (and less expensively) be done at home?  The scallops are always good.  Short ribs are to die for.  Prime rib is excellent. Rainbow trout is good with nice presentation. Enjoy.
