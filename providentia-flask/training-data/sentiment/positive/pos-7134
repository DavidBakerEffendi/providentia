The salsa and hot chips are flavorful, especially the hot salsa, which my wife calls, "so painfully good!"

The chorizo pollo was fantastic - I wrapped it up in a tortilla with beans, rice, and some of the salsa, and I was in spicy heaven.

I reluctantly put down my rapid tortilla assembly machine (fork) when my wife suggested I save the rest for lunch tomorrow.  Future me will thank me, but Present me hates him just a little right now.

Good prices, good atmosphere, attentive and very friendly waiter... couldn't be better.
