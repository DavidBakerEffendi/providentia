We loved the ambience, we love the staff, they LOVE our kids.  The banh xeo are so crispy and fast, they rival my mom's (big compliment).  We didn't like the banh cuon so much, a little dry. The lemongrass curry chicken was great!  We always get the kids the com tam, but we're going to try to Branch out.  Cozy hole in the wall.  Great cookies with the bill
