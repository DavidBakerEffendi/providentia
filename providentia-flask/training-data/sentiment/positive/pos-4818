There is one menu item that mozza does better than a lot of Italian restaurants, and that's the ruccola pizza. Thin white crust, fresh mozzarella, plenty of thinly sliced prosciutto, and a mountain of arugula salad. I've had a few other pizzas at mozza and none of them live up to this combination. I'd agree with a lot of other posters in saying that this place serves pretty average Italian pizzas, however, this particular pizza is a gem and keeps me coming back. This pizza is five stars sitting in a 3.5 star restaurant.
