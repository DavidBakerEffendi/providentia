I have picked this place solely based on Yelp reviews and pictures. As we are not very familiar with the city of Las Vegas it took us a while to locate it.  It turned out to be a good idea to explore small local restaurants outside of the Strip. The price was good and the food was excellent. We had ordered a vegetarian plate and kunaffe to go. It was plenty for two of us. My husband went to get the order and he said that the lady who helped him was really friendly and welcoming.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone who likes Middle Eastern food or just wants to try it for the first time.
