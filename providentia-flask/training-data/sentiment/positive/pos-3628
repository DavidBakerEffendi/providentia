For those looking for a good date spot, this might be one of them.

The atmosphere is perfect. The food is excellent (I had the gnocci which is a dish I rarely choose off an Italian restaurant's menu but here we are). The price? Very friendly to the wallet given the area, so much so, I treated myself to a crème brûlée afterwards which was like going down on silk. 

Speaking of service, it was so attentive and they didn't miss a beat, masterfully doing so as to not interrupt the conversation or be pushy -- this, I can say, is a true skill of a good server.
