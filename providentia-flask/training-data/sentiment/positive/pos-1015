One of my reoccurring weekend treats. My
Boyfriend and I love going on Sunday's for a smoothie and he always gets a salad and I get a wrap. Nothing ever disappoints. The portion sizes are not huge so if you are going for something filling order a smoothie and food item. We recommend the Strawberry Extreme. But I've tried others and all of the fruit smoothies have been delicious. I prefer them to include yogurt so the sherbet taste isn't too overpowering.
