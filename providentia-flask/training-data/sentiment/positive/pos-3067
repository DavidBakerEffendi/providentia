Loved the atmosphere here on an early Sunday morning. My mom and I were in the area for a doctor's apptmt and finally decided to give this place a try. Went around 8am on a Sunday so it wasn't crowded at all, but I can imagine the lines forming as it gets later. 

I got the build your own skillet with over medium eggs, bacon, mushrooms & spinach. It came with either toast or a coffee cake. The serving size was pretty big and I thought the skillet itself was delicious! The coffee cake also came out super warm! Mmmm yummy in my tummy.

My mom got the South Shore scrambled eggs with diced chicken, Swiss cheese & avocado with a side of hash browns and your choice of toast or coffee cake. This combo was perfect and avocado tasted SO good with everything else!!

This was a great experience & I'd definitely come back. Customer service was on point & our food came out within 10-15 mins tops tasting amazing!
