I have lived in the area for a long time and have never heard of this restaurant.  I went for the first time and what a fun place!  Not only is the ambience super romantic, but it's so different from anything else you see in Arizona. I felt like I was entering a Disneyland ride when I walked into the restaurant, and when we got to our table felt like I was actually at the ocean.  That is hard to do in the desert!  

Not only was the atmosphere so cool and out of the ordinary, but the food was wonderful. We started with calamari which was pretty average, but the crab cakes were out of this world. And I cannot even begin to talk about how great my stuffed lobster tail was (and how huge!!) I ate more than I should have but I couldn't bear to leave anything on the plate.  We went at about 8 o'clock on a Friday night, our service was great and I think that was in part to it being peers empty,  we almost had the entire room to ourselves, but we did still make reservations. 

I would definitely go back here, it's a bit pricey but worth every penny for that kind of seafood in this kind of desert!
