FanTASTIC little diner right in the heart of Uptown.  The owner is the sweet little lady running the register from open to close...I've never been in here when she wasn't working.  She's helpful, friendly, and fast with the service!  A previous reviewer mentioned that the "interior is nothing really to write home about".  He's correct; and that is EXACTLY how I want my diners to look!

The coffee selection is great...always have several different blends to choose from at any time of the day...from light to dark roasts.  I try a different varietal everytime I'm in this place, which is easily 3 times a week.  A far cry from Starbucks commercialized dirty dishwater.

Don't be afraid to stray off the menu and try specials!  the board by the register is full of them, different every day.  Get there early though...they have been known to run out of their specials on occassion (God Bless the days they run the chicken burrito special).  Although I'm disappointed when I get there after the last special has been sold, this does not bug me...it simply lets me know that they don't keep anything around longer than a day!  Everything is very fresh in here.

If you feel like taking the path more traveled (God knows, its a well-worn path by yours truely), try the Loaded/Stuffed Hashbrown breakfast....you know how, when you get a loaded baked potato, all the sour cream, cheese, and bacon are gone in the first few bites and you still have 70% of a dry baked potato left on your plate, screaming for more accoutrement?  This dish has solved that riddle.  I would be perfectly happy paying the asking price for just the stuffed hashbrowns, but the icing on the hashbrown cake is two eggs "your way" and your choice of toast.  

Can't beat it.
