DJT is the only restaurant at trump. Went there for breakfast in the morning. They had two options, either the normal breakfast menu or the express buffet for $21. I chose the normal breakfast menu, I got the French omelette with 4 sides. Delicious. I would highly recommended  for anyone. Beat omelette ever
