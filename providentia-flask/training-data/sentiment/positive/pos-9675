Two words: It's PUUUUURDY!

Definitely one of my favorite hotels to stay at when I'm running around wreaking havoc in vegas. Definitely a big bonus when they upgrade me when I'm checking in!

Totally love the big comfy beds and the huge tubs big enough for two! 

The casino area has a great ventilation system; I don't end up smelling like an ashtray and my boogers don't turn gray when I'm hanging out here. 

The poker room is kick ass. Even when I'm just sitting around chilling, the cocktail waitresses hook me up with Fiji water and Grey Goose shots. 

And the shopping. I snagged a 350 dollar Burberry Bikini and wrap for 80 bucks. BOOYAH!

Oh yeah... Tao's pretty awesome too.... They're just missing a kick ass Cirque du Soleil show to top it off...
