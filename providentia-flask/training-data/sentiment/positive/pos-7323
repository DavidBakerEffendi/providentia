Wow!  I can't believe that this tiny little place can hold so much food and fresh items!  

We ordered the Falafel, the Beef Donair and the Chicken Shawarma pita sandwiches.  They were all Mediums and they were huge!  One pita sandwich with tons of stuff on them. I liked the Falafel one the best - loads of flavour!  

We also ordered a couple of the Stuffed Grape Leaves and the Tabouli Salad - quite good!  The Tabouli salad was very fresh and lemony.

Paid almost $35 for 3 people - pretty good price. 

Other food items to note - olives, samosas, caribbean patties, empanadas, cheese (like feta, halloum), sweet Mediterranean desserts.

FYI - cash and debit only.
