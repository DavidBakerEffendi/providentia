Always delicious. 

The Caesar was perfect, from dressing to portion. 

Everything was fresh, you can tell. 

We bought a plant to help raise funds to put gardens in kindergartens! So wonderful to see the community coming together. 

I would also like to note that the owner was running the host stand soon arrival, which I think is wonderful. When management cares that much it shines through the whole restaurant. I can't stress how important that is.
