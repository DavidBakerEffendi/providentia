Great experience! 
Delicious burgers & onion rings!! mmmm
I love (and hope it's true) that their animals are fed well - with no antibiotics, or pumped with steroids. 
Staff was extremely friendly bringing us our trays of food. And it was a cute experience dining in, with their big A&W glass mugs of root beer and other soft drinks.
