Ive lived in the area for 13 years and I myself have never eaten at CPK. Ive always thought of them being known for Pizza...and my favorite type of pizza is cheesy and greesy so I never bothered. One day a client brought me an amazing huge salad that impressed me...and inspired me to go alone for lunch on another day. I stopped in in work clothes (workout gear & a bun). They were so polite at the front. They asked if I had been there before and I answered no. Well they welcomed me like they had been expecting me! My salad was filling and just as good as the first I had. With many other options to choose from. I was impressed by the menu. Why have I deprived myself for so long? 
As I am eating, a man I presume to be a manager comes over to say "hi" and that he had heard I had never eaten there before, greeted me, asked what I thought of the place and food and wished me well. Did they think I was an inspector maybe? LOL. I felt like a celebrity! It made me wish I had dressed a little nicer for my lunch date with myself.
Anyway...Ill be a regular.
