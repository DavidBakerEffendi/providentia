Was craving a gyro but didn't want to go too far out of my way. I was skeptical about gyros from a Brazilian place but I was pleasantly surprised. The meat wasn't the typical shaved off the spit kind. It was more like elongated thin meat patties that tasted like regular gyro meat but they were juicer and less salty. I would definitely get them again.
