We have been on an unofficial quest to try all of the BBQ places that Arizona has to offer.  I have been to haps several times and think it is one of the best in the state.  This trip I brought my father, sister and niece to try it.  Their consensus was that this place kicked ass and they are looking forward to coming back again.  I had the pulled pork and coleslaw.  I ordered three ribs too.  My dad tried one of the ribs and loved them.  This place is good and the real deal.  Just remember not all BBQ is the same.  We have Texas, Kansas City, Tennessee and other styles of BBQ here now.  They are all different and have their own signature.
