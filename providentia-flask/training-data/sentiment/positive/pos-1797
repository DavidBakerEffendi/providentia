If you want the closest thing to authentic French pastries and light fare, it doesn't get better than Bonjour Bakery. The Chef/Owner is one of the best French chefs in Vegas. He is sticking to his guns on authenticity of his menu as opposed to adapting for American preferences. Try the baguette sandwiches, they are to die for.
