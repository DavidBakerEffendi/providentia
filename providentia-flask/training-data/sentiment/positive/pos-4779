I'm doing an update because annoying people saying things like don't eat sushi in AZ because you wouldn't eat Mexican in Osaka ... are idiots. I've had Mexican all over the world from London to Osaka to Iowa, and it was all good. As is sushi all over the world. Um, fish gets flown around the world to these places. It doesn't matter where you live, you probably aren't getting it out of your backyard ... in some cases, even if the Ocean is your backyard. So relax. 

Sakana is good sushi. Especially, if you appreciate the taste of raw fish by itself. It also is reasonably priced. Sure, there are more prestigious sushi joints, but this is good fish at a good price. Since I'd rather not spend $50 on myself for dinner every time I go to sushi, it's a nice option. 

And rant over.
