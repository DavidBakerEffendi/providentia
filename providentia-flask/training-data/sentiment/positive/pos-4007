This place is simply divine and near perfection. I came here with a friend on a night out before going to a Duran Duran concert at the Rio. I had asparagus soup with a turkey burger and my friend had the lamb with potatoes and a garden salad which we paired with some white wine. 

The service was accurate, friendly, inviting and our waiter was very attentive to our dining needs. Everything about this dining experience was perfect. I will admit it was a bit loud, but other than that it was amazing. Our total bill came to 174.00 and was well worth it. I highly recommend this steak house and I would definitely come here again when the occasion arises. 

Good Job Nine!
