I was flitting between 4 and 5 stars for a very long time. On one hand, this place has been around for awhile and I've never had a huge urge to write about it. On the other hand, I just realized that in the last week, I've been 3 times. Welp. 

Gal's is becoming, if not already, an establishment in Markham. It's a place for quality Japanese and Korean food rolled into a fast-paced, efficient, friendly package. In the many, many times I've come since its opening, I've never had an issue with either the food or service. I have no doubt anything you order will be delicious but here are some of my time-tested favourites.

Any of the "Best Choice" trays: Seriously, it says "best choice" in its name. And they mean it. This is the premium plate with uni, hamachi, o-toro, salmon belly, etc. Pricey, but not as pricey as you'd think for the kinda stuff you're getting. 

Chirashi: Gal's has the best Chirashi of any place I've ordered it from. It's simple, really. Good selection of satisfying, meaty pieces of fresh sashimi, all on top a bed of SEASONED rice. The seasoning really kicks this up a notch for me.   

Gamjatang: It's a sweater for your soul. After the first bite, you think that the menu misled you by saying this isn't a spicy dish. It has quite a kick. But by the third bite, the fire becomes cozy liquid warmth that fills your mouth with flavour and tender pork. There's no better dish for the winter and Gal's version is so satisfying, it's the reason I went back more than once a week. 

On top of these, I can say their bento boxes are A-OK, especially for lunch, and their rolls are well crafted. This place is always bustling at dinner time but the little bell at your table helps to grab the server's attention. What can I say? I'll probably be back next week. Maybe the one after that too.
