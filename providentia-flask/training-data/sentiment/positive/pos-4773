5 stars for the service itself! Joey was a phenomenal waiter. We had a party of 18 and he was able to take our order & serve us in a timely manner! I ordered the crab spinach dip & chicken wings as appetizers then the chicken Marsala for the main dish. I wasn't blown away by the food, however being that it was happy hour definitely made up for it. Cute decor, dim lighting. Good for date nights! I'd definitely come back again for brunch!
