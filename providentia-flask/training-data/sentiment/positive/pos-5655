Situated in downtown Montreal, on Rene-Levesque street, this is a staple steakhouse. If you live in Montreal, you probably have heard of the Keg.

The ambiance is always chill but fancy. 
I ordered their filet mignon with bacon wrapped around. Their steak is always good quality steak. I usually have my steak rare or sometimes medium rare and they cooked it to perfection; tender and juicy. It's never dry or chewy. You can have it with fries or baked potatoes. They have their twice baked potatoes which is very popular among customs; I personally prefer the fries.
They have a few choices of wines to select from to go with your steak. 
It is obviously on the pricy side of things but it's totally worth it; from service down to food; everything is top notch. 

To paraphrase Gordon Ramsay's words: "Whatever quality of steak it is, it's well past any form of good taste when you ask for it to be cooked well done."
