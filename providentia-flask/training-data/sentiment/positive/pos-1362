Was able to try 4 different tacos between my order and my girlfriend's and all were outstanding. Favorites were Turkey Carnitas and chicken fried steak. Charro beans on the side were great and the cole slaw was surprisingly good too. I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for good Tex-Mex in Charlotte.
