First off i i want to wish Island Style a happy 19th birthday and congratulate them on their years of success!

This one is special.. I can always count on this place to make me feel at home with it's welcoming enviorment and super ono food.  Feels cozy just how i would imagine Hawaii to be.

Lately ive been getting the teriyaki salmon w/ brown rice, but my all time favorite and go to spot would be for their bibim naengmyeon. i haven't had it there for a while because i've waiting for the weather to get warmer, so i can enjoy it more.  But Imagine a cold spicy noodle dish on a hot summer day.   Mmmm, broke da mouth, cuz.  I can't wait to go back and get my fat on there as well as getting my spirit lifted by Russel.  You can tell he just enjoys life and it'll rub off on you too.  Mahalo!

*sidenote* My first review off my cell phone.
