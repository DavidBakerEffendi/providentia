Breakfast review...I'm not sure if the other reviewers are just super picky or just dumb but this place is FANTASTIC!...I can usually put up with sub-par service if the food is great but this was not the case here...service was exceptional...we had Jeff as our server and he was very professional and on point...I travel all over the US for a living and know good good and service...this place is great...we will be back for dinner to try it as well...as for breakfast:

My wife had the southern belly Benedict and it was awesome...it had pork belly and collard greens and was super flavorful...she loved it!

I had the Nevada huevos rancheros...it had short ribs, salsa and black beans and was prepared very well...very delicious...can't wait to try the other stuff!!

We will be back!...thanks for a great experience DJT...
