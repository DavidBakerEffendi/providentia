I've been stopping by Rito's Bakery in Parma for years.  The bakery is awesome.  I love their Sicilian sheet pizza and lemon biscottis especially.  Recently, I went to Rito's to have them cater a lunch for work.  I choose the Italian deli tray with all the special Italian meats and cheeses and the American deli tray.  This has to be the most freshest meat, cheeses and breads I ever had from deli trays.  In fact, the morning I came to pick up the order, the bread & rolls were still warm.  Not only did we have plenty of fixin's to make sandwiches but the trays each included salads and their amazing Sicilian sheet pizza.   I received exceptional quality and quantity for the value.  Very affordable and uber delicious.
