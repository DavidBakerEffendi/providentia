I live in Henderson and was going to the location on sunset. After two terrible visits there we came to this location. What a difference! The customer service here is 5 starts compared to the other ones. Always greeted and welcomed with the door held open on the way in and on the way out. Francisco the GM is such a good person and really knows how to WOW his guests. On both visits we have had a server named sky who is awesome and takes great care of us. I now drive past the closest location to my home just to come to this one.
