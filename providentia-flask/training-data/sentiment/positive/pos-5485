We have ordered pizza, sandwiches, and dinners for take out and delivery and always delicious. Last time we ordered the Chicago style pizza and loved it. The staff at the counter and delivery guys are always friendly. Our favorite sandwich is The Cheef, favorite dinner is Lasagna and favorite pizza is the Super Supreme.
