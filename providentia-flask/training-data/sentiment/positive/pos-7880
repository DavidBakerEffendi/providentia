Food is ALWAYS delicious and fast. I've been countless times. Lots of organic and vegan options. They're always willing to assist you on choices and suggestions too. My favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte food wise, tho all the booth seats need to be replaced or repaired as the springs have broken and uncomfortable.
