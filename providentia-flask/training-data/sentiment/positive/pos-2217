The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant. Some may find it odd that I rarely even get cheesecake here. Their food is very high quality. A huge menu which I've had the pleasure of trying out most of their options. A meal can range anywhere from $12 (for a burger) to $30 (for the filet). $20-25 per person is the usual on how much I spend. What makes it so great is the food is worth the price but portions are usually double or even triple size.

My favorite appetizer is the fried macaroni and cheese. My favorite entree is the ribeye. And the best entree for the money, is the Cajun Chicken Littles. About 10-12 normal sized, delicious, hand breaded, crispy, chicken tenders, a scoop of awesome mashed potatoes, and some very good corn succotash; just a $15.99 price tag.

Highly recommend TCF.
