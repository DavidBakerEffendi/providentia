On a Monday evening, I brought my family to buldogis this time and we pretty much ordered the whole menu. haha. I can't remember everything, but here's what was new that i liked...

- Angry kimchi fries: great taste. kim chi not too hot. sweet potato fries were crispy. i love eggs made over-easy :)
- Euro special fries: i think taste better than the angry kimchi fries. the mayo gives it a nice zest. french fries stay warmer longer than the sweet potato fries. bacon with fries are always delicious.
- bulgogi buger: very flavorful. highly recommended! 
- budogi burger: from what i could remember, i prefer the bulgogi burger better. 
- angry kimichi hot dog: not too spicy. pretty much the same toppings as the fries but with bulgogi on top too. 

- We forgot to check-in to get the 10% off, but she allowed us to get something off of the menu for free. very friendly :)! definite +
