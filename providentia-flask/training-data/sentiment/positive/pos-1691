Amazing dinner tonight at Jewel's Cafe in Phoenix!  They will now be serving dinner, this was their soft opening.   I had the Trout and it was awesome! The dessert was a Lemon Meringue dessert.  The best part is EVERYTHING is Gluten Free! Oh and they will be serving Cruz strawberry jalape√±o margaritas! Yum!
