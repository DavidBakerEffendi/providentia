Their pide is delicious and Halal (for those of you wondering)! I stopped by here with a friend during the evening and I definitely recommend this place! The prices are awesome for the portion you get (prices range from $6.99-$10.99)! I ordered #20 (Ispanakli Kiymali; spinach and ground beef pide) while my friend ordered #3 (Kiymali Acik; ground beef mixed with tomatoes, peppers, onions, and spices). The waiter was alone, so it took a bit of time to wait for our orders, but it was understandable and totally worth it! I will definitely come back here and try the other pides.
