Time for a major rave. We shared the baba, and it was great. They garnished with pomegranate seeds, which is a terrific addition. The mixed grill was superb. Especially noteworthy was the lamb chop , excellent meat from Colorado and cooked perfectly. Special note: the garlic sauce served with the meat is potent and delishious. The desserts looked yummy. The espresso was quite acceptable. The ambiance is moderately fancy; not a redshirt place. The music is not too loud but somewhat lacking in definition. The staff are hardworking and polite. This place makes it into our must return list.
