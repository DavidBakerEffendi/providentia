I came here because it is just down the street from the new house and my husband and I were craving breakfast, and we were debating whether to try this or go to one of the "egg" restaurants that my husband likes, but I am not really crazy about because of the disgusting, harsh seasoning they put on everything.

We were extremely pleased to find someplace that we didn't have to wait forever, but we weren't expecting much as far as both service and food.  I ordered a chicken apple sausage scramble, and they were insanely accommodating when I asked if they could substitute egg whites and add lots of spinach.  They were more than happy to.  I also had an iced tea, tropical flavor, and I wasn't sure if I was going to like it so they brought me a free sample without charging me.  Husband had a blueberry banana smoothie (it was excellent and low fat to boot, and I absolutely hate smoothies), and a big island scramble which essentially had tons of breakfast meat and cheese.

The dishes came out quickly, and they had probably the best home fries I have ever had.  They were huge chunks of red potato, that were crisp on the outside and soft and velvety on the inside, just like I love potatoes.  And perfectly seasoned.  This is how potatoes should be folks, not that petrified over seasoned crap from the egg works, egg and I, and that other crap.  I'd eat these every day, seriously. 

Everything else was delicious, and both my husband and I decided at that moment that this was the best breakfast we've had in town, and lucky us, it was just down the street.  And they DELIVER.   If you've seriously thought this place wasn't great before, give it another try.  I'd give this place a million stars if I could.

I love you Beach Cafe, and if I wasn't married I'd have lots of your babies!
