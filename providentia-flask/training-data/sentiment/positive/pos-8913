Let me begin by saying that if you come here, you should not allow anyone but Nikky (Nicolette) to serve you. Not because others aren't excellent, but just because Nikky is extraordinary. 

We visited with a group of 4 - 2 of my colleagues, and a senior level client. We were exceptionally obnoxious, and Nikki was brilliant, walking a tightrope of give and take good humor and unrivaled customer service. 

We all had an absolute blast and the food was wonderful. We had the seafood tower for 4, and two of us had the petit fillet medium rare and a lobster tail. 

The fillet was cooked perfectly - slightly charred on the outside and pink, warm and tender in the center without being chewy. 

The seasoning was right on, adding the right amount of savory while allowing you to taste the perfection of the quality cut of meat. 

The lobster was cooked well - with a hearty substance while maintaining its tenderness. 

The Mac n Cheese was some of the best I've had at a steakhouse. 

The wine list was extensive and even impressed out super-wine-connoisseur client. 

We will definitely be coming back, and Nikky will be serving us.
