Every time, my wife and I planned to visit this place, something had happened.  

Finally, we were there last Thursday.  The restaurant is very clean and quite not crowded.  

Following its name, we ordered TAPAS plates and had beers the bartender recommended.  This was our first time to try TAPAS since we watched Spanish TAPAS tv show program a few months ago.  The food was beautifully plated and delicious...

Since we were there at happy hour, we had sea food sampler first, and then mussels...  and Risotto...  Why Risotto?  My wife wanted Risotto.  No further explanation necessary

My wife grew up in sea shore so very picky on Seafood freshness, but those we had were absolutely great.

Finally Risotto was good too.

Will visit again shortly.

PS: Service was great too
