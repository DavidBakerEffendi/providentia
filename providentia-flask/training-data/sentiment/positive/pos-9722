I go visit Cleveland about once a month. Every time I visit I must go eat there! Totally love this place. I have visited Thailand before, the curries are very similar to what you can find in Thailand here in Mint Cafe.

LOVE EVERYTHING in there :) The Thai ice tea is good. The fried rice is pretty awesome. Try the curries too! Green Curry!

The place is small but neat and quiet. And you can choose your own spice level. In my opinion things aren't all that spicy if you can handle jalapeno.Waiting to go back again!
