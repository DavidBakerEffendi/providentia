Early morning breakfasts spot with great food and you can wear your pajamas to the restaurant?!??!  Yes, here at Rise and Shine you can wear your pajamas and have delicious food.  I stopped into rise and shine while completing  an early pick up and and this place is absolutely amazing. During my visit I ordered the parfait which was really good, I had the clover honey, strawberry and granola parfait.   It comes in a milkshake size glass with the granola on the bottom of the glass, then the next layer is fruit and then the next layer is the vanilla yogurt with the clover honey on top of the yogurt.    

I also ordered the chicken and waffle.  The waffle came out hot, fresh and flakey.   You could cut the waffle with a fork.  The chicken (one breast) that came with the waffle had a little kick of heat to it.  The chicken was cooked chicken fried steak style, because it did not have the bone in.  Overall, this is a great brunch spot.
