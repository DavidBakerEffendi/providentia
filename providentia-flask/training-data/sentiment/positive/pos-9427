The food was solid, pork chops and scallops were flavorful but not over bearing and cooked to perfection. You get the full simple flavor of the protein. But overall the service was amazing! Erik our server and Sherlene the hostess were incredible, we didn't order anything from preference. Literally they ordered everything for us and it was all great! The cocktails were refreshing and balanced. Usually employees up sell you on everything the restaurant wants them to sell but they made this experience great. We will be back for sure just to experience service like that again! Usually small talk with the server could get a bit intrusive, but Erik was awesome to chat with, at times we felt bad holding him in conversation, but enjoyable nonetheless. Thank you!
