What can I say about the Bellagio Fountains that has not already been said?  What a fantastic idea and a lovely execution.  The music and the fountains and the lights come together to make quite a spectacle, day or night.  

I've seen the fountains dance to many songs over the years and recently had the luxury of watching from the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  It's always awesome and fun and on this visit I had a new experience once again... i watched the fountains from the backside after exiting the main entrance of the Bellagio.  I loved getting a "new view" and reminds me that there is always something different to see when you're in Vegas, even when it's just a new view of an old favorite.

If there is anyone out there who hasn't oooh'd and aaaah'd over the Bellagion Fountains, I hope you get the opportunity soon!
