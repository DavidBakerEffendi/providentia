If you're vegan or vegetarian, this is your heaven. I am neither of these things, but I am still a big fan. There's really nothing else like Living Kitchen here in Charlotte. 

My absolute favorite thing here: the volcano juice (orange, lemon, grapefruit, maple syrup, cayenne). Food-wise, I usually get the Fire & Brimstone burger (gluten free quinoa veggie burger spiced with sunflower hummus, onion, cucumber, guac, homemade hot sauce). You can get it on bread or wrapped in a collard leaf. 

The inside is beautiful. Cozy tables along with a long community one. Stools along the bar-like counter. Nice patio if you want to be outside. 

I noticed a few people comment about both the price and the fact the food is all cold. Come on people, it's raw. And this isn't McDonald's.
