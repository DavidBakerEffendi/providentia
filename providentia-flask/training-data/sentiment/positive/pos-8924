LOVE the desserts here! Heard about Bertha's when they had a table at a food festival. They were serving homemade pop tarts and I was so impressed I had to go to their actual location. The brownies, bar and pies were all excellent. I even had a salad there because I went during lunch time and mentally I knew I couldn't just eat sweets for lunch. 
One of, if not the best, place to go for desserts in the Phoenix area.
