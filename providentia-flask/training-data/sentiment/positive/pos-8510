What's really funny about this place is it makes me feel really good walking inside, but maybe its because every time I walk into a west indian restaurant I feel good because of the smells coming from the kitchen... Doubles are a must when you come. I usually get 3 or 4 and curry goat dhalpuri if I'm in the mood. Everything was cooked to perfection and I really enjoy it!
