Another one of my top 5 casinos.  This place literally smells like roses!  Like freaking roses, people!

Sorry, I had to get that out of my system.  

A very large casino with plenty of touristy, sight-seeing things here.  A Sistine-ish ceiling, opera singers, a giant mall, tons of restaurants, gondoliers.  What more could you possibly want?

Now that I'm a local, I come here more for the people-watching aspect.  I realize now I can't afford the shops at the mall, or the restaurants, or the ride in a gondola.... But it's still fun to just hang out.  And smell the roses.

In all, an architecturally beautiful building that you can wander in for hours.  Minimal smoke smell.  A couple permanent shows and a venue for rotating singers and comedians.  You can find a few restaurants that are moderately priced (about $15 per entree, Grand Lux for example) and there is a food court in the mall near the parking garage.

Located on the north side of the strip, connected to the Palazzo and near Mirage, Treasure Island, Wynn/Encore, and Harrah's.  A bit of a walk to the other casinos.  It can get really crowded on the weekends.

I had stayed in a room about 5 years ago and they were large and beautiful.  Very romantic if that's what you are going for.  All their rooms are suites.
