This place is tucked away on eastern, heading to Anthem Highlands. I am sooo happy I found this place. Things to say.....
The dining area is cozy. I dont know the exact seating but Its probably less then 40. I tend to find something I like and stick to it, but so far I have not found anything on the menu I dont enjoy. The Curries are terrific, and their yellow curry is unique to dishes of the same type,(cant put my finger on it) but its my favorite. The Pad Thai is great, and You cant go wrong with an order of fried banana or sweet sticky rice with thai custard on top. The cost is also modest. The Pad See Ew is cooked in a lighter sauce them Im used to, but is still tasty. This now is one of my top Thai Restaurants to frequent.
