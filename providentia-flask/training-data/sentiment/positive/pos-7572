So, I love it when we decide to just go some place new because it's just that; new:)

Such was the case with Joey's. We happened upon this Italian-themed bistro-bar on a visit to Lee Road in Cleveland Heights. We don't do Italian often, and we thought it would be a nice change.

We arrived on a cool evening and there wasn't a large crowd; the service was immediate and excellent. 

The place has a warm, Tuscan-decor with a full bar, lots of seating, indoor and out. We got a nice table in the back and got started with their garlic...well, it wasn't bread, it was, as the waiter mentioned, "garlic balls". It was a pull-apart bread, nicely crispy and drenched in a garlic sauce that made both of us want more. We also got a nice bottle of wine and just sat back and enjoyed,
 (did I mention they have special nights, like Wednesday being half-off bottles of house wines?) 

We got a chance to meet the owner, who told us about the food selections and the waiter was very helpful. We both ended up getting the chicken picatta, which was flavorful and I have to say, I've never had Italian food with brussel sprouts, but they were GREAT. 

The food was nice too because it was flavorful and not overwhelming, and not, well, run of the mill. We really enjoyed the experience. The prices are about mid-range and overall, we were really impressed. Speaking of which, I can see many a young couple coming here for a romantic evening over drinks, and even desserts. 

I was also told that,for the local crowds like the students, they're planning on special College Nights, as well as things like Happy Hour and Ladies Nights, which you wouldn't expect from a place this classy, but I admire any place that diversifies:) 

All in all, we rate Joey's Bistro Bar very high on the "Mambo Italiano" scale, so stop in an enjoy!
