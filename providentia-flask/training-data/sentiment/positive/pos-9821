Today in the 30 degree beautious weather I thought why not venture out to grab a bite from a food truck and check out the lunch concert in the Ameritrust Rotunda. After scanning the trucks, the mac n cheese sounded perfect...on second look got the Mesquite Chicken Chili mixed with the Mac & Cheese with an avocado sauce on top. OH MY I think I found a new favorite! Portion was enough to save some for tomorrow and I'm surprised I could even stop. The guys were great-helpful-friendly and funny. I'll be back again soon! Keep truckin'!!!
