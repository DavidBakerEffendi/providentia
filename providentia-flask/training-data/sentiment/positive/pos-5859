Ate here for restaurant week and lived it! The food was great, service was great, and they had live music that night. People were dancing and having a great time. I definitely recommend this place to anyone look for a great meal and a great time. I had the lamb cops with mashed potatoes and finished it off with carrot cake. It was epic!
