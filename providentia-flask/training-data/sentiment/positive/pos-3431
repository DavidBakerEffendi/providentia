The food is amazing, the service is great and the price is right on point!  I had a wonderful dish with salmon perfectly cooked and yummy rice,eggplant and wonderfully cooked vegetables. The portion of this dish would easily feed 3 people.  Everyone at my table had a delicious entire. I will definitely return for more!
