Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned. 

Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed. 

If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad. Staff is friendly and efficient.
