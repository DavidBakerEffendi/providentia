I chose to stop here on my birthday for some drinks and dips, because honestly, who can go a full birthday without some salsa and a marg? Anyway, I just wanted to confirm that this place still has such great service and good food. Our server was attentive, knowledgable and not at all irritated that we really were just there for a drink and some snacks. Would highly recommend
