Yummy! We were sad that the Gilbert location closed because it was close to home. Drove about 30min to this location and it was worth the trip. Located in mall with tons of restaurants and shops. Decor is gorgeous and tons of seating. The place was packed on a Friday night. We'll plan better next time we make the drive, dinner and crepes to top the night off.
