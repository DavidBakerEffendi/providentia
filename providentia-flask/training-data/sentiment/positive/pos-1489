Buldogi's, my dude!  It combines things that I love and turns it into something I love more!   

I got the Angry Dog and my wife got the Puppy Dog plain(how cute)  seriously, it was like the size of my thumb.  

Enter, Angry Dog!  Imagine:  a hot dog topped with pork(?!) bulgogi, jalapenos, slaw, and sriracha mayo drizzled over the top and nestled !  I've never had pork bulgogi until I had an Angry Dog, it reminds me of Tocino, the awesome Filipino breakfast meat.  So all these flavors come together like Voltron and kick hunger's ass!   It was spicy enough what with the jalapeno and the sriracha, but it wasn't so crazy that I couldn't eat it.  Came here with 3 other people, incl. my wife, and we all got something different, but we all left the same way, distended, full, what have you.  Well, except for my wife.  She was just happy with her portion size.  I dunno.  

Good stuff, Buldogi's!
