I wish I would have eaten here every single day I was in Vegas. This buffet is amazing! It is rare to find a buffet where everything is good. I came here for breakfast one day and brunch another day so I can only speak on those. We arrived each time before 9am so we did not have to wait at all but a line starts to form after 10am. 

All the good hotel buffets have omelette stations but this one was the best! I highly recommend trying it. There is really nothing that stands out about the buffet menu wise. They have the same foods that most buffets have...breakfast, brunch, chicken, prime rib, pizza, seafood, salad and dessert station...the usual. The taste is what sets this place apart. The have a bar and a good drink menu that includes bottomless mimosas. They are STRONG. Why? Because instead of bringing you glass after glass of pre made mimosas, they give you a separate glass of orange juice and they come to the table periodically with a bottle of champagne and just fill up your glass with it. It's safe to say my mimosas were probably 70% champagne. Awesome! No matter what hotel I'm staying at, I will make it a priority to come to this buffet.
