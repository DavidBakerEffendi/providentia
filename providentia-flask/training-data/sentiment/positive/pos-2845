Amazing food. Just a bit pricey just like everything else you find in Wynn. I ordered the cuban pressed sandwich and that was perfectly crusty on the outside and toasty warm on the inside with just enough mustard. SO ordered the oriental wrap and that was done superbly. I loved the house made chips that came along with my sandwich along with the fried plantains coated with sugar and cinnamon. My friend H ordered the pasta with shrimp. Sauce was a bit on the bland side and they were a little stingy with shrimp. A ordered a burger and it was a great burger. Overall, this was an awesome 24 hour cafe, the only set back is the high price tag. Great food and presentation. :)
