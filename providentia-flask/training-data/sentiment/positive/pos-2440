We've taken two swings at this great spot. 
The first visit was for dinner. We were offered menu options from happy hour and really enjoyed adding those options. It was a busy night and we ended up eating several spicy rolls to curb our appetite. Dinner and service were top notch!
Our second visit was for brunch. The patio was a great offering. Brunch offerings were freshly prepared and had a wonderful twist on favorites!
