Gosh I love the root. It just has such a relaxing non judgmental or pretentious vibe to it. I am by no means vegan or vegetarian, but I love that I can come here and experience wholesome and delicious vegan food. Everything I've had has been delicious including pour overs, chai lattes, pizzas, scones, and the taco salad. I just love how different this place is. If you need an hour or so to sit and reevaluate your life I'd probably come here  

Service is kind of a mixed bag. I've had less-than-enthused-borderline-rude people take my order and I've had fantastic servers that brightened up my entire day. Prices can seem high but they're still reasonable. I would probably expect to pay $9-13 on food and $2-6 on coffee per person. 

Love that they have local artwork and hand made mugs for sale as well as a large collection of books to browse.
