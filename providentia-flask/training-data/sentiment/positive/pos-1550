This is such a GREAT, NEW place!!! 

SERVICE: Got to meet Henry, the owner of the company. He was the one who served us and chatted with us! He is very passionate about the food and the restaurant! We weren't in a rush, so it didn't feel like we were rushed or in a hurry. It was nice and chill! 

FOOD: the food was AMAZING! So delicious!! Henry told us that all the food is fresh, never frozen. And you can tell it is fresh!! We tried a bunch of stuff. The caviar was seasoned nicely. Chicken skin on a skewer was delicious. We also tried the soft shell crab. You wrap it in lettuce, put some seaweed, put a little onion, add the crab and dip it in the sauce. The lettuce and seaweed make it taste fresh with the fried crab! The lamb chops were WOW!!! So. Good! You will just have to try it out for yourself! SO GOOD! 

ENVIORNMENT: This place is just the cutest!!!! It has a center area with lounging chairs and a projector for music and videos. Henry built all the furniture in the restaurant, which makes the place even more unique! 

A MUST TRY place!! :)
