I came here after a feature on @blogto. I was not disappointed! This place was SO good. Firstly, the place is pretty small, can hold about 30 people at once and table are fairly close. But the insides are RIDICULOUSLY asthetic. I'm talking White Walls, high ceilings, minimalistic decorations. 

The people working are very friendly and super nice. They were able to rearrange a bunch of our orders. 

Lastly the food was absolutely yummy. The toppoki was super chewy but yet very flavourful. Basically it's like thick noodles that soak up flavours really nicely. I customized it so I got white sauce and veggies with some ramen noodles at the bottom.

All our dishes was super filling and worth the cost. They used very unique flavourful that makes my mouth just want more! I definitely recommend getting the whole package, with the ramen and sides.
