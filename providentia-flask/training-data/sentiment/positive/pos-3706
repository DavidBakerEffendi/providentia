Seriously whoever didn't give this five stars must be an idiot. This is the coolest, most impressive fountain show you can see. As a local, I will literally drive down and watch the shows any chance I get. The song choice is dramatic. The entire feeling you get is grand and impressive and you will be artistically moved. It's a must see.
