This place is a hidden treasure - don't let the name fool you! I've walked by this place every morning on my way to work and have thought it's a pub-style type of place due to the name. Boy, was I wrong!

It is a quaint restaurant, simply but tastefully decorated with a small patio (maybe 5 tables), right on the sidewalk (great for people watching!) they have a pretty big menu and different types food to choose from - soups, salads, pastas, pizzas, mains and some burgers, not to mention a decent size wine list. The food was absolutely delicious (see photo). Everything was flavorful and the presentation was done well! We had the white mushroom pizza, the mushroom agnolotti with mushroom truffle butter sauce and the baked lobster and crab soup, along with two glasses of rose and a martini. The total bill was $80 which is not bad for the amount of food and drinks we had!  

Service was great, our waiter was fantastic, very friendly and helpful - was a pleasant experience :) I rarely tip 25%, but the overall experience was just great!

We definitely will be back as there are a few other menu items that caught our eye - unfortunately our eyes are bigger than our stomache!
