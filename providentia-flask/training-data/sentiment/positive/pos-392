As far as Sushi goes, this is probably one of my favorite places.
One of my best friends introduced me to Koi, and at first I was skeptical, because she used to refuse to eat sushi. This was one of the first places she'd ever tried sushi and she ended up loving it, so she showed me! 
I am so glad that she did, because it is really good.

The servers are always so friendly and they make sure that your drink is never empty, which is nice.

I love almost every roll on their menu. Their drink selection is nice, and to top it off the place is so quaint and cute.
