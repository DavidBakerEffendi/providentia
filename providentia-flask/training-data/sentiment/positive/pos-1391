This is a fun, cozy, welcoming bar/restaurant with good food, good service and good people. It is often
a regular quick stop in our way to anywhere. The soups are outstanding, the specials creative and delicious. The Grille burger was my husband's birthday dinner of choice!  
Sam, the jovial owner, is almost always around-greeting customers, helping tend bar, supervising the kitchen. Making sure everyone feels welcome and treating the staff and customers like family. Go before 5 and say hi to Alana- the most competent, charming, and knowledgeable bartender I have ever met!
