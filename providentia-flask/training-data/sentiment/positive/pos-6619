Ah-ma-ZING! For a Friday ladies night Melissa D. and I wanted to try something new and headed to Dimmi in Yorkville. It's a very short walk from Bay subway station AND we were able to make reservations (seems to be a rarity these days).

I can't say enough good things - the food was delicious, the service was prompt and friendly and the atmosphere was great. It had that mix of relaxed and swank all rolled into one, with great music bumpin in the background. 

The food was (like I said), really tasty AND reasonably priced. The pizzas ranged from $10 (for a basic margherita) to around $16 for some fancier toppings. Our table ordered the rustica - thin crust, prosciutto, arugula and shaved parmesan. We also had an insalata mista with a raspberry vinaigrette ($7 and to die for, so fresh and light), a 'parm prosciutto' dish with fresh fig and goat cheese ($15), AND a gnocchi in a light rose sauce w/ asiago cheese ($15ish I think). Yum, yum, YUM. 

The bottled beer was only $6, and glasses of wine ranged from $8-$11. They also have a fabulous cocktail menu, generally 3oz drinks for $10-$12.
The desserts are also reasonable priced (around $6), and looked fantastic!

SO many extra touches - including the fancy double-stemmed glasse Melissa D.'s candy apple martini came in, and the complementary cotton candy brought to our table at the end of the evening. And the service really was great, not too fussy, but quick and attentive.

They immediately put us all on one bill (which I'm not a fan of, I like them to ask), so I would ask at the beginning of the meal to see if it's possible. They did allow us to split the one bill with three credit cards though.
