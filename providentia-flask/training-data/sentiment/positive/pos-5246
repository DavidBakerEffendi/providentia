I've had some horrific experiences lately trying "new things" but I figured why not.... I ordered stuff I never had such as the basil fried rice and pad see ew which OMG.... where has this been all my life. I literally could not believe it was that good! The basil fried rice had just the right amount of spice and heat for my liking where the pad see ew was so tasty! Everything was great including the chow mein chicken! 

Service was great! Very attentive and for the prices, you will have left overs for days! Happy customer here
