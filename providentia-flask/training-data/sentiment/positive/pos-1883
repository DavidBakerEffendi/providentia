This is such an awesome place that's locally owned.I like to drink coffee and I love the smooth taste of their's. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. They have a nice variety of foods and drinks on their menu. It's very quiet and very clean as well.  There also is a punch card that entitles you to a free drink after a 10 drink purchase.
