Well it didn't work out when getting into omnia so we went here instead and I loved it. It's so much fun and has something to do for everyone. The whole crew can dance, eat, play arcade games or play beer pong, Corn-hole, or even life sized beer pong. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas and am hoping for something like this to pop up in San Diego
