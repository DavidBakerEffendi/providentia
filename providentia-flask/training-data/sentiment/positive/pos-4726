Great new restaurant in Downtown Phoenix.  I've stopped here a couple times before a D-backs game and I've never left disappointed!  The homemade Sea Salt Chips are tasty!  The Turkey Pastrami is delicious on a pretzel roll.  I recommend the Turkey Sloppy Joe.  With a slice of green chili, this sandwich has a kick!  This is a great place for a quick bit with friends.
