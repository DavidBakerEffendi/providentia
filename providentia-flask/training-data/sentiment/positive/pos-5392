It is extremely rare (I think it may have only happened once) for me to give 5 stars on a first visit.  I think 5 stars should be reserved for places that are excellent on a consistent basis.  I was here with my daughter who has been here many times and she and her friends all confirmed that Happy Dog is consistently excellent every time so it just didn't seem fair not to give it the 5 stars it deserved on my visit.
What is Happy Dog?  It's a neighborhood bar that serves hot dogs and fries.  It puts pretty much anything on the dogs that you could think of.  A variety of cheeses and veggies, goofy items like lucky charms, blue cheese coleslaw, pickles, chili, kraut, condiments...
You sit at the bar (or a table if that's your style) and they give you a checklist like in a sushi place.  You pick out how you want your dog and give the server the slip.  Now enjoy a beer while you wait for your food.
Oh, you only gave them one slip?  What's wrong with you!!!!! Get off your butt and fill out another slip!  You can't just try one crazy dog!  Expand your horizons and your waistline and get no less than two awesome happy dogs!!!
Next time I return I'm ordering 3 happy dogs.  I'm staying here for a couple hours and I'm drinking at least 4 beers.  There's almost no reason to leave a place like Happy Dog and certinly no excuse for being in the area and not giving it a try!
