Went here with my husband today for the first time. We decided to eat before going to the movies. The food is so good and it's made to order. I had the Hawaiian dog and he had the Chicago dog. We shared fries and we each had a drink. All together it came to $16.00.
We will be coming back.

(They have nice bathrooms too. They are single toilets but very clean and decorated.)
