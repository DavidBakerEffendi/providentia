So apparently if you're reincarnated as a cow you want to be one of the Kobe sort, which is a special breed of Japanese cattle that is given beer daily and a massage so the meat is more tender (thanks Wikipedia!).  All of Burger Stop's meat is Kobe - nice. 

After reading Joseph A's review of this place my red meat alarm went off and I decided to check it out for myself, and they do a fantastic burger.  Everything is made fresh daily.  So for $12 I got a double patty, fresh cut thin fries, and a soda.  The bun was toasted and slightly crunchy.  Perky avocado and onions.  It was lovely.  

I forgot my camera but I'll post a pic next time.  And yeah, the owner/cook does look like George Carlin and although I did not overhear him say any of the 7 words you can't say on television, he'd probably make a good Vegas impersonator.  

The one complaint is it takes a little longer than say Fatburger to get your order, a good 15 to 20 mins, but there were a couple of orders in ahead of mine.  And it's worth it when you know its gonna be good.

Just a simple easy place to get a nice solid piece of red meat.  Corner of Trop and Eastern.
