It's my first time trying this golf thing. My husband told me how to stand and hit the ball, but that didn't work so well. I got the hang of it towards the end and even had the high score at the end. This place is fun with night golf as well, we did the afternoon and it was really fun with service and lunch from the top golf team. Definitely will be coming back here.
