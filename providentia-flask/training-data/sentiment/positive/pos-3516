I come here all the time because the foot is amazing. I always order the Tom Kah and my boyfriend orders the Pad Thai. Fransisco and Tristen always wait on us! Today we found that the serving size was unusually small so we said something to the restaurant and they brought us a whole new Pad Thai! They totally went out of their way for us. It was so nice. We come here about once a week and spend about $20 which is very worth it for the food we get!
