I got the kimchi and beef bowl which contained lettuce, onion, carrot, kimchi(!!!), kidney bean, avocado, and asparagus on brown rice. They used spicy sesame sauce and I was happy that the sauce (unlike most poke places) didn't mask the taste of the other ingredients. The beef was still warm and I think they prepared it the same way as bugolgi because it was sweet tasting and delicious. Service was solid too, you order at the end of the store and you pay after they finish preparing it. Clean and spacious tables and space. Would totally return and visit their other locations!
