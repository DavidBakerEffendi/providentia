This is my second time here.  It is a low key coffee house in the day and a wine bar in the night.  They have original artwork hanging up and funky chairs that look like you might impale yourself on (see picture) if you were inclined to throw yourself upon one of them -- you know, if you are having one of those depressing, "i can't take it anymore" days.  Anyhow, today I am trying the french toast (see picture).  They serve you home-made bread, 2 large slices and it is not overly sweet.  They also belong to the Belly Bites reward program -- nice touch.  The atmosphere is good to work in while enjoying a nice cup of coffee, latte, etc.  Good music too -- now playing "Sweet Jane" by Lou Reed -  RIP.  Oh, most importantly I forgot to mention the blazing fast internet they have here!
