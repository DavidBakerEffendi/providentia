I absolutely love this place.  Fast friendly service all around!  My husband and I sat at the sushi bar and after ordering, got into a lovely conversation with the sushi chef.  The ingredients were wonderful and extremely fresh, even for our late 9pm dinner.  I never had to ask for drink refills!  The family at the hibachi behind us seemed very happy and their chef had the kids giggling!

The restrooms were clean and neat.  The place itself was perfectly decorated.  Tastes food and great conversation.  I could not have asked for more!

Yes I'll come back here for sure!
