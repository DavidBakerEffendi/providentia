Best margaritas in town and obviously the best fajitas(just look at the name). Impeccable service. The moment you sit down, chips, salsa and water are served. Food is super fresh..... the table side guac is TOTALLY worth it. I HIGHLY recommend getting the warm churro WOTH vanilla ice cream. Not kidding, LIFE CHANGING! Thank me later!!
