Awesome! Do not hesitate to come here. Great beer and great food. This place really makes the dining options in Verrado more well-rounded now...I would like to see more vegan options on the menu here, but for now I will stick to the Black Bean Burger as it is delicious. Staff was very courteous and professional, atmosphere is great. Thank you Ground Control for giving us somewhere great to spend our weekend nights without it involving a 45 minute car ride. We will be back again, and again!
