UPDATE: 23/5/11

Have been back a few times to see if things are still going strong. They seemed to even gotten better, with even more attention to detail on the tables as well. The food is just as good as the day it opened, and they have gotten us interested with every item on the menu. This place is a fantastic cure for places like "Taste of Japan" or other all-you-can-eat sushi places that serve mass-produced food. Only critique was that the Sake promo they had since they opened is now  gone, which allowed you to try different Sake for $1-4/glass. That was actually a lot of fun. I hope they consider bringing that back.

If I could give this place 6 stars out of 5, I would.
