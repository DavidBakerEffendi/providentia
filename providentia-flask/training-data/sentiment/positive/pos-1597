What's wrong with me!? I haven't update this review when it has so clearly earned it's way up to a five star establishment, without a doubt!

All my previous complaints... GONE!  

It's bigger.  And I don't just mean the burrito!  They've put two outdoor tents up so there's plenty of additional seating outside.  Hopefully they'll get some heat lamps in for the colder months, it'd be a shame to lose all that seating!  

The burrito... BIGGER! I inhaled a large burrito last night and was STUFFED. Could barely eat one Jamaican Jerk Wing. Jamaican Jerk Wing you say? Yep, they've added new items to their menu! And guess what? My burrito was shrimp! Exactly what I had wanted all along. They now offer a shrimp diablo and shrimp curry option.  My shrimp diablo was HOT, maybe not to the spicy food lover, but hot for the "I like spicy food but it's hard to take" spicy food fan. Plus, I could tell it was fresh shrimp and a good size.

And that salsa verde they serve? I could eat gallons! Still not so hot on the red salsa, but the salsa verde, a winner!

We walked in on a random Wednesday night at 7:30 and there was a line! That makes me really excited for them. They deserve the business because they serve up awesome food! Now that I live in the hood, you can bet I'll be stopping in once a week. Okay, maybe twice... who knows! All I know is that it rocks my world!
