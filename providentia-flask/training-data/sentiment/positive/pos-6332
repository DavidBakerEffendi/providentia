Ate here again.  Got the catfish sloppy joe, which was exactly like it was the first time.  Still fantastic.

Our table got the Rhode Island style calamari, which was also excellent.  Lots of heat, but not too much.  The calamari was crispy and not greasy, and it was quite a lot for the price, given it's location in a huge strip hotel.  RM Seafood is a definite return.

Iced tea was $4.50, which is high to me, even on the strip.  But, that doesn't take away from the sloppy joe, which is still a steal to me.
