Talk about a hidden mini mall gem... 
I always have to concentrate every time I come here since all of the mini malls look the same on this side of town.

The menu is a happy eclectic mix of Korean, Hawaiian Korean and most recently Chinese. I personally have never ventured to the Chinese part of the menu so you are on your own with that. I come here for the Hawaiian-Korean food and nothing else! 

First off they hook you up with a tray of boiled peanuts as soon as you sit down. I'd come here just for the boiled peanuts during football season. 
They also provide you with 3-4 plate of ban chan that also have a Hawaii flavor to them as well. One of the non-traditional ban chan that is one of my favorites is the chopped hot dog and onions. I remember eating this all the time when I was a kid.. It  strikes a chord with 8 year old Pat. The rest of the ban chan is your typical Korean fare consisting of kim chee variations and other pickled goodies.
 
My default order:
Pan fried mandoo a custom mixed plate: 
Kalbi, Meat Jun and Chicken Katsu .
The rock star of the combo is the Mean Jun! Great meat to egg ratio and killer sauce!
I can say that their Meat Jun is my favorite in the valley!
On occasion the lady gets the Jajangmyeon (hope that's the right spelling) which is  

This place has become our default Hawaiian-Korean spot.

Go see Uncle Russell and fam to satisfy your K-808 cravings
