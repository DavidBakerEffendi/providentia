Great experience tonight at Sky. We tried the Bang Bang Shrimp and Calamari as appetizers, which were both very good. They calamari wasn't all breading and very flavorful, something other sushi places have trouble with. Our dinner companions ordered the Pad Thai and Kung Pao Chicken, which they were both immensely pleased with. My husband and I split two sushi rolls, the sky roll and the dynamite roll. Both were amazing and very flavorful with fresh ingredients. Even the small side of fried rice we ordered was memorable. I hope more people get turned on to this spot because it was relatively empty on a Sunday night. The ambiance and service was also very inviting and above average. Definitely check out this great new spot!
