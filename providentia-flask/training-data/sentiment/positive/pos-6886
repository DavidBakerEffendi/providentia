Just ordered food for 4 tonight. Excellent. The last time we ordered, the white rice was not up to our expectations. Tonight it was the way we like it. We had hesitated ordering from them again. We will definitely do this again. The Generals Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork, Beef and Broccoli,  Cashew Chicken and Chicken Chow Mien were great.
