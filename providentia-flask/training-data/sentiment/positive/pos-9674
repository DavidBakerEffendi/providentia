This was my second real donut experience in Vegas. The first was, well, Real Donuts. So that's what I'm comparing everything to.

I actually went to Donut Hut twice this weekend. First, I rolled in here when I had to abort my first choice of breakfast. Considering that it probably would have been a load of sugar, dough, and fat anyway, I don't think my stomach missed out on much. Owner was nice and discounted me a few cents to make my purchase an even dollar amount.

Second time was a late-night visit close to 1am, and I was surprised yet not surprised to find out that they buzz you in when you ring the bell. I guess their run-ins with crime that I read about in an article have led them to be cautious, which is fine by me. They hadn't replenished all their donuts yet, but some of the options were definitely not in the display the last time.

I didn't feel up to ordering an entire dozen on either occasion, so I just went a la carte:

- Blueberry cake donut ($0.90): really moist inside, with absolutely delicious blueberry dough and dried blueberries. Bit of a crisp on the outside. I somehow had never tried blueberry donuts until I tried this and the blueberry fritter of Real Donuts, and both of them really impress me.
- Chocolate cruller ($1.20): a weekend-only treat. It definitely resembles a cream puff, and the inside is very airy with moist batter. Not enough to make me wait for the weekend, but better than how I remembered my Real Donuts cruller.
- Cinnamon roll ($1.75): semi-monstrous. I expected it to be dry for some reason, but it just wasn't. Solid cinnamon flavor, nice crumble topping, and restrained glazing.
- Raspberry jelly-filled donut ($1.20): very good as well, but it's only a reasonable portion of jelly compared to the huge treasure inside the Real Donuts version. Little bit larger than normal donuts.
- Old-fashioned ($0.90): chocolate was fantastic. It was like the cake donut, but with more crunch. Plain glazed was pretty good too.
- Maple raised donut ($0.90): surprisingly, also cake-y, instead of the typical "normal" donut texture that you might find in an offering from a chain or a grocery store.
- Apple fritter ($1.75): another monster. Good apple and cinnamon flavor, but not as much of a crispy exterior as I would have liked. To be fair, I waited a couple of days on this one, and I'm sure the fresh fritters are better.

Hours are a little odd, currently 8pm through 11:15am. Also, they won't be open on Mondays until October 13th. However, I will definitely be back when I can, and I really appreciate how it's a closer drive for me than the other purveyor of blueberry goodness that I've come across so far.
