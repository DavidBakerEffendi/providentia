We might have been here years prior before with my mom's friend. Grandma really enjoyed this place. We had pigeon, eel, chicken, seafood noodle, fish and a few other things. So delish, the pigeon was really good, I do not remember trying it before. The seafood noodle was alright a bit mushier and underseasoned for me but not bad. The service was so nice very warm and open recommending the best. Felt very welcome here.  It was quite busy.
