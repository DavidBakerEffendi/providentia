Closest to New York Bagels you will find in the Vegas area. Great place for breakfast and lunch. Corned beef and ham are my favorites. Overstuffed sandwiches. Huge cake slices! Good chicken noodle soup. Dinner entrees with early bird specials start at 4pm. Delicious desserts. Everything clearly fresh and homemade. Received excellent service, drinks constantly refilled. Expensive but worth it. Expect to wait during peak times. Wish they would open a restaurant in Anthem/Henderson, they'd make even more $$$$...hint hint!!
