My prior review was a 1-star for dinner. And, tbh, haven't been back for lunch / dinner since. But I go here for breakfast at least once a week now that my other casual neighborhood spot closed, and I love it. The omelettes are plain fantastic, service is always fast and super friendly, the staff is great, and all that adds up to one of the best breakfast spots in the Valley. 

Plus I just love the atmosphere - straight out of another, more comfortable, casual era. 

Worth the visit.
