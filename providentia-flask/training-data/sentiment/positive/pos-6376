The best COOKIES EVER.

I mean that. I am shocked this place only has five other reviews.

Everyone should go here and get themselves some cookies.  The chocolate covered chocolate chip a re delicious.  

The building is tiny and oddly located but once you go you'll understand why they are still there after such a long time.
