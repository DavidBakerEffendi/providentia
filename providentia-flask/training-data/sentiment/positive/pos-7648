Our new favorite spot for Mexican food!!! A a refreshing change from the normal greasy and cheesy refried beans and rice entrees found most elsewhere. Chicken tacos were delicious!!!!  Salsa is served warm.  Really nice atmosphere and decor with live music some nights!! It's nice to have glass of wine! Very good prices and presentation! Somewhere I definitely recommend!!!
