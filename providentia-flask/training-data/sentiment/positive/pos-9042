I was really worried when I moved to Charlotte that I wouldn't be able to get my South Indian fix. Luckily with a Woodlands here, I know I'll be taken care of. Pretty much all your basic south indian fare. Dosa, uttapam, idly, sambar, rasam, etc. Delicious all all veg. 

Don't let the all veg scare you, I love meat and eat lots of it, but what woodlands helps you realize that a meatless meal if done as well as they do is just as satisfying.
