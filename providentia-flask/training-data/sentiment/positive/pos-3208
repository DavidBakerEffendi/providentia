Delhi Palace is my favorite Indian food restaurant... ever!  Do not be deterred by the exterior.  Just trust me on this one.  What awaits you inside will make you forget everything you have ever known and loved... you will want to sit there and eat until you can eat no more.  The buffet is a great value and the food is consistently fresh and delicious.  I have been going here since I was a young teenager and have always loved it.  But, the ultimate proof of their quality and authenticity came when I took my two friends who grew up in India and were visiting Phoenix for the weekend.  They thought it was excellent.  If you go to the buffet try everything.  If you go there for dinner, I highly recommend the Chicken Makhani.  Do not miss out on this gem.
