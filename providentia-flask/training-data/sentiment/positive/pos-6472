What a memorable meal! So happy I opted to come here despite the mixed reviews. 

You can park behind the restaurant on Scollard (@ 2.25 an hour), but the entrance is beside the Four Seasons Residences off Yorkville Ave. We didn't find it difficult to find at all! 

Now on to the food...

The noteworthy: The burrata pizza is phenomenal. The crust is so thin and the sauce is just tart and salty enough to keep you interested. We also thought the Insalata Di Pomodoro was sooooo good. The tomatoes were impossibly sweet, and the stracciatella  really cuts through the vinegar. Lovely. The Gran Fritto Misto was a large assortment of fried seafood and it was absolutely delicious. Oh and that branzino! Wowowowowow. Cut table side, the prosecco and lemon were absolutely magical together. I would order every one of these dishes again in a heartbeat. 

The good: We loved the Bigoli and the braised octopus, but they were far too rich to eat alone. The first bite of both dishes were to die for, but the following bites left us craving for that salad we had to start. I suggest ordering this with maybe one of the side veggies to cut through the richness. 

The not so good: the nidoni bread rolls were nothing special and the suckling pig was underwhelming. Skip these, for sure. 

We also ordered the tiramisu and the roasted almond gelato to finish our meal. Both were pretty good. Overall, we had such a great time! Can't wait to come back. 

Top tip: come on a Sunday or a Monday and they might just be able to top your burrata pizza with some incredible hand picked truffles (extra $15)
