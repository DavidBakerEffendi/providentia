I had the chicken larb and loved it! I like mine spicy and our server brought several hot sauces to try. There wasn't a bad one in the bunch! I enjoyed the the purple sticky rice with green tea ice cream on top and it was awesome! My kids shared the chicken noodle soup (best chicken EVER). 
We'll be back for sure!!!
