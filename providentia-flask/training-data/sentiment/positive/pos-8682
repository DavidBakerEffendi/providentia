Korean food & Hawaiian food all in one! Small place but love the atmosphere! This place is 5 STAR dining for a 1 star price! They gave us apetizers to start with right away, boiled peanuts, kimchi, sausage....etc.... The food took a while to cook, but its ok coz I was busy stuffing myself with the free appetizers....I am going to warn you ahead of time though...do not gorge on the appetizers or you will be too full for the main dish! Everything on the menu looked good, I wanted to order everything! Drinks were only $1! I definitely will come back to this place just so I can try out their other dishes. And yes they have ox tail soup! Definitely a good find! I love these mom & pop establishments especially when the owners are super friendly and they really do care about their customers! Gotta try this place you won't regret it.
