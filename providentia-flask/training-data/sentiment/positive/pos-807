The Fountains at Bellagio truly lived up to my expectations.  The lighting, music, and synchronized water show absolutely blew me away.  The same can be said for the rest of the crowd gathered on the street watching, too.  There were audible *gasps* when the water cannons shot high into the night sky.

The Fountains have been featured in countless movies (Most notably to me: Ocean's 11 and 13! We stood where they stood.  It was fun!) and are an iconic part of Las Vegas history.

The shows run every 15 minutes after 6 pm, which makes them easy to see while wandering the Strip with your camera and your people-watching goggles.  There are different songs and different "choreographs" of the water dancing, so it's an all-night entertainment spectacle.  (Photos Above)

It's Must-See.
