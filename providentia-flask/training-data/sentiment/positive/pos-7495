A hands down must see attraction. The first time I saw it in 2006 they played My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. It was so beautiful I almost cried! The strip side offers the best views in my opinion. 

The fountains are set in a 9 acre manmade lake.  They incorporate a network of pipes with more than 1,200 nozzles that make it possible to stage fountain displays coordinated with more than 4,500 lights. It is estimated that the fountains cost $75 million to build. The fountains were created by WET, a design firm specializing in inventive fountains and architectural water features.
