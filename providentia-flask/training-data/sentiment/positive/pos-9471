I'm impressed!  This was some pretty good Thai food.  And my favorite part is that they have a spicy level that goes from 1-10.  I like my food on fire so of course, I ordered my food at a 10.  She told me it will be "very spicy."  After I did that, I was nervous for a minute. Then, I got my food.  I got a Tom Yum Seafood soup at spice level 10.  Okay, it was hot and you could just smell the spice.  But for me, I think it was just right. In fact, I think I could've handled it spicier.  And from reading the reviews below, it appears that the spice level may even go higher - to a 30?!?!?!  Perhaps I'll have to try a higher level next time.  But in any event... the food was good.  The only thing that I didn't like was the summer rolls, but that's only because I think in my head I was thinking of the Vietnamese summer rolls.  These particular rolls were actually wrapped in a flour tortilla and on the inside, it had Chinese sausage, veggies, and other stuff.  It was different. It was good.  But it was just not what I expected.
