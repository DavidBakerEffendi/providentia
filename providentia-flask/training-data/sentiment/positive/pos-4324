After reading an article in Charlotte Agenda about Ninety's Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches I had to have one! I live very close to Ninety's and never knew that they offered so much here. But I stayed on my mission to get a macaroon ice cream sandwich. There was so many flavors it was hard to choose from (even though Ive heard the Birthday cake is the best) but since I am all about pumpkin right now I chose the Pumpkin flavor. Not to be mistaken with the Pumpkin Bread, there is a difference smh! The Macaroon sandwich is huge! They offer to cut it in half but I decided to take mine to go. 

This ice cream sandwich was amazing!! and everything I hoped it to be! The macaroon is totally a macaroon and is flaky per usual. The ice cream was great as well! It taste exactly like pumpkin. It was a little bit too much for me, I definitely could not finish the whole sandwich but it would be perfect to possibly share.
I cant wait to come back and try the Birthday cake!
