AWESOME happy hour! It goes until 7pm every day and they have a huge selection of food and drinks. I always fill up on the chips, salsa, veggies and beans they serve as soon as you walk in and end up taking most of what I ordered home. Their margs are pretty decent, especially considering the happy hour price. The staff is friendly and attentive.
