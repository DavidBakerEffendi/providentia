LOBSTER, SUSHI & CRAB OH MY!!!

I was surprised by how many people who go to Las Vegas don't know about the Seafood Buffet at the Rio Casino Hotel!  I've been to all the buffets in Vegas but the Rio has to be the BEST when it comes to SEAFOOD!

Their sushi is fresh and delicious, the lobster tails & Alaskan King Crab legs are steaming and HOT just drenched in butter, they have prime rib & rack of lamb that's tender & yummy!  They also have a Mexican & Chinese station for people who don't like seafood.  OOh and the Dessert Station is awesome!  They have all kinds of pies, eclairs, tarts, brownies, rice crispy treats, cream puffs, chocolate & custard fruit cups (my fav) & ice cream *drool* soooo good!

The price is $35 and the line is ridiculously long so get there early!
