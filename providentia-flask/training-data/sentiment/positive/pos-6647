Yes!  I like this place.

I happened to arrive just a few minutes before 5:30, and there was already a line of people waiting for them to unlock the door!

They have their sushi specials presented on a plate near the entrance so you can see what the daily goodness is right away.

I liked the service, atmosphere, and most of all, the sushi.

Fresh and yummy.

I think there's a special if you buy one of the big japanese beers, you can get an app for 99 cents.

Nice!
