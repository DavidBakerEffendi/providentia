WOW!  How did we not find this place sooner?  This little out of the way cafe in Old Chandler is worth driving to from anywhere!  Their signature breakfast dish, 'The Morning Monte' is to die for.  This French Toast masterpiece is made with Hawaiian bread, egg whites, grilled turkey, havarti cheese,and bacon, served with a spicy chili marmalade.  The meal stands on its own, but the marmalade or syrup is great too!  There was no wait when we arrived, and the service was excellent.  There is a patio that resembles a small forest, and while we ate indoors, it was still quite 'cozy'.  This is our new favorite breakfast place!  We'll be back again very soon!
