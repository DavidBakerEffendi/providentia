day 16 

it's one of my favorite and in my opinion the prettiest of all the casino and hotels. its like i entered venice. seriously. from the gondala rides to indoor skies and scenery to gelato. the place is gigantic and some place you don't have to gamble, you can just get lose here and walk around, great place for photo ops with your honey buns if you got one.
