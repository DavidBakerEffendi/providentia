Have been hearing of this place for the longest time. Finally decided to make the drive into chinatown for it. Well worth it! GREAT burgers. Not sure what seasoning they use on the patties but the flavor is great! The buns were great and supported the burger til the end. The crack sauce for the fries was great. 
Just. Great. Burgers.
