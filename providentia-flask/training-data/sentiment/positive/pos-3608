I have been to Krispy Kreme and had one of their hot donuts...Krispy Kreme doesn't do it for me. If you must know I can't stand donuts. Here I am all hormonal and I want, no NEED a donut. I know Winchells is open 24 hrs.  So I drive there at like a quarter past midnight Friday night/Saturday morning expecting there to be hardly any selection. Color me surprised. Full case of every donut variety. Are you for serious?? I always opt for a basic donut, sour cream.  That was good. I also get a filled donut when I get a craving for a donut because a plain old glazed ring just sucks. Who eats those?  I don't care what kind of frosting you slap on those or where you get them or what kind of cute name you give them, they blow chunks. I got a jelly filled.  It was just barely warm and the jelly was warm inside.  It was truly a transcendent donut experience. I have never had a donut above room temperature that was filled before. My life is changed now. I don't know if I can go back to room temperature sitting in a display case for hours donuts ever again. Your life can be changed too. 12:30-12:45 am is the magic hour. And the donuts are full sized donuts...not midgets like KK's.
