The building is an ancient Taco Bell (for those too young to know fast food history), but inside is the legendary Fuku burger in a non foodtruck form. I always get the #2 combo with the tamago burger (fried egg). A little messy when the egg yolk gets crushed, but overall a great burger! Always consistent flavor and the crack sauce for the fries is special. Cool peeps behind the counter and they yell out something when you leave them a tip. #2 combo is a monthly "must have".
Solid burger stop A++++!
