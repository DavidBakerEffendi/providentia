This is a cozy place that, from my experience planning to go there and passing it by on the street, fills up quickly.  This, of course, is for very good reason as the food is quite splendid.   

The portions are ample, but not obscene, which is great for me since it makes it easy to justify having an appetizer and a main course in the same meal.  Both are reasonably priced.  I think the most expensive thing on the menu was about 22 dollars.  Not pricey at all for the ambience and quality of food, its taste and presentation.

I had beef cheeks with paparadelle.  The pasta was perfectly cooked; the beef cheeks were tender and the sauce was some bit of creamy heaven.  Before that I had a mixed green salad with grilled shrimp and squid.  I liked it so much that I silently hated my 2 year old daughter for a minute when she accidentally dropped one of my precious shrimps on the floor.  grrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Vegetarians have more than enough to choose from here too.  My wife had a fantastic veggie pasta with goat cheese and veggies;  thankfully her appetite was not large enough to finish it.  That forced me to care for it deeply the next day for lunch....IN MY STOMACH.

This strip of Gerrard is the perfect spot for this fantastic place.  I wrote this review with the sole intention of helping their success as they deserve it wholeheartedly.

Bravo.
