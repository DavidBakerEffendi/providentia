Decided to check this place out based on the reviews with a girlfriend after work. Love this place. Our waitress Wendy was so adorable and kept the conversation going as the night and wine progressed. Thought the sushi was fantastic. The pot stickers were great too. Wine is only 5 bucks a glass too!
