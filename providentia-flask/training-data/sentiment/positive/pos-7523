I just went here for the first time and wow I can't believe I have overlooked it for so many years!  We tried all the hot items, the beef brisket, pork shoulder, and the ribs. I'd highly recommend all of them. Even if you are eating alone-you deserve it. This is America-Treat yo' self!

As a man who loves attending the local barbecues I can say this place is BBQ to the core. If you are serious about barbecue you best get over here. After one visit, I already plan to stop in or get takeout whenever I drive by the airport.



Side note: I love Famous Dave's Barbecue, but saying Smoky Jon's is inferior in anyway is laughable. The only reason I will ever again choose Famous Dave's over Smoky Jon's is because I am not in Madison.

Secondary note: you can pick up their sauce at Woodman's to put on everything.
