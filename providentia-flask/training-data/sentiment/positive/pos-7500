I really love this place; it's one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Not only do they have a really great steak, but they also have amazing appetizers (Oysters Rockefeller in particular), but they were amazingly accommodating to my vegan friend as well, who gave them a list of restrictions and they concocted a meal for that wasn't simply a pile of sauteed vegetables. 

 This is the sort of place that you really hope to find in a Las Vegas dinning experience. It's elegant and fashionable and has really amazing food. In my opinion,  Las Vegas has a lot of restaurants that really rest on their location, but this place earns it's keep. 

The service is exceptional and the food is as well, making this one of my favorite places to east when I was a local and someplace that I really look forward to retuning to whenever I'm back in town.
