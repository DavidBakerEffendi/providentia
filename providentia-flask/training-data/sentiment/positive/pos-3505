Our before-game favorite!  We first came here with a coupon because it's a block from the light rail and half that to the SUNS game. Now we come for the great HH menu prices, the tasty food, and the excellent service (Hi, Matt!).  Since we can't take food into the arena, the smaller appetizer portions of sliders are perfect.  Whole family loves it: 6-year-old granddaughter (quesadilla), vegan husband (salad with added beans and rice), mother-in-law (sliders or salad), and me (HH-priced draft Dos Equis Amber and pernil or Cubano dishes).
