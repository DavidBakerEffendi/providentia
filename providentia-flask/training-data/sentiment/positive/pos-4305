Just go.  Amazing array of fresh and elegant cuisine.  Chef trained at Daniel in NYC.  Also owns Madre-one of the best weekend brunch places in the city.  Arepa soup was amazing.  Everything else elegant, and delicious.  Very reasonable for high cuisine.  I had a great Cremenera from Chile as a wine.  Good wines, and I think it's now a BYO place-even better.
