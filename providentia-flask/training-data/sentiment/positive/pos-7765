The 21 year old girl behind the counter deserves her own franchise today!!! I have eaten here many times over a two year period and she is nothing but smiles and very pro subway..She can make anybody's day happy whether the food is good or not...she is a good example of how a restaurant should treat its clients or customers upon arrival of their own restaurant...Subway executives please give her that location she is unbelievably the best customer service I've had other than running my own business...
