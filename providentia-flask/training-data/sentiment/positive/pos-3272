Let me start by saying if I had to choose my perfect meal BBQ would be last on my list, but if I had to choose a favorite lunch spot Tom's Thumb would be at the top.  

Usually when I go to places that have been on diners drive ins and dives I am disappointed but that is not the case here. I had the catfish on my first visit, which was great, but on my second trip I had the pigs and grits and that was phenomenal. I never thought I would like grits with pulled pork but when you get that creamy texture with the tangy-ness of the BBQ sauce, it's unlike anything I have ever tasted.  

There is always a long line when you go around lunch time so that's a bit of a bummer, but also means they are probably doing something right!! Definitely a great place to take visitors from out of town, or just for a casual local breakfast or lunch.
