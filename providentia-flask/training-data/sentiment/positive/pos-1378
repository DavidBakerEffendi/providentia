I visit the Buffet at Bellagio every time I'm in Vegas. My favorite meal is Brunch, but their weekend dinners are great too (just more expensive).  The food here is always spectacular - from variety to quality - they have it all.  My favorites are the prime rib, the fresh sushi and handrolls, and caviar.  My only complaint about the Buffet is that it's very crowded and dark - it makes me feel like I'm eating at an Old Country Buffet.  They really need a good remodel to compete with the atmosphere at Caesar's or Wynn (but the food is better at Bellagio).
