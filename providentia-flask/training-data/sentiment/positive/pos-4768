Thank you to Food Fight for putting a reasonably priced OUTSTANDING restaurant on The Square. 
Guac is great, although maybe just a little bland. 
Street corn is amazing. 
Barbacoa tacos are awesome. 
Homemade chips. 
Great house margaritas. 
Friendly and excellent service at bar and at tables. 
Well done!!!
Oh, and to nail it when just opening is pretty impressive too!
