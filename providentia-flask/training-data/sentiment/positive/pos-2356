Maybe my favorite restaurant in the city. Great brunch and great dinners. By far the best eggs Benny in the city. Small menu but the specials are always outstanding. I had a phylo wrapped halibut once that pretty much blew my mind. They always play great tunes; Wilco, American Analog Set, Sea and Cake, etc. and the staff are great. Caesars at brunch are outstanding. Coffee is amazing. I could go on. But I wont. I've already said too much.
