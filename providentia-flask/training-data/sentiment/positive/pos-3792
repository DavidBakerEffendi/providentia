Amazing! This is true Indian cuisine! The naan was fresh and was incredible. Crispy on the edges, soft in the middle. The curries were all delectable. I personally thought the butter chicken was the best (but it's my fave food) and was perfect on the spice level. The mango drinks were also perfect. Creamy and smooth and very light. It was the perfect addition to our meal. The tika masala was also very well prepared and was very creamy in texture. The chicken kormas were also good. Everything was warm and very good sized portions. The staff and service were great! Waters were constantly filled and overall very impressed with this restaurant. Since it was a Saturday the belly dancer was there! Super cool and will be back!
