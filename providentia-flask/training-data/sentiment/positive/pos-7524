The food is very very good, very tasty, highly recommend going.

We went as a group for the buffet lunch and all the dishes were well made.  

The Tandoori chicken - moist, which is a surprise from other buffets I've been to where it's been dry throughout.  

Goat curry - money dish! - was well spiced, fall-off-the-bones type of dish.  If you have ever wanted to try goat curry, this is the place.  

Nan - fresh and good.  

Butter chicken - one of the better ones I've tasted.  Not so much of a buttery cream texture to the sauce, more of a kick to it, very nice.

Lentils - burns so good to the belly.

For desert - rice pudding (KIR, sorry if I have the spelling wrong). - Another MONEY DISH.  Not so sweet you feel your teeth falling out at other places I've been to, nicely sweet, everyone at our table cleaned off their dishes. 

Other items:

Decor - very upscale, very classy.  Nice chairs / tables / wrap-around seating at the front.

Service - excellent service, eager and pleasant staff.

Music - a little bit loud, should turn it down a bit.

I will derfinitely return or oder to go, great restaurant!
