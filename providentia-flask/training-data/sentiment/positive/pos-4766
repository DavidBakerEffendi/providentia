YES! We finally found an excellent Chinese restaurant nearby! This place is large, clean and bright, with very good and really fast service. Prices are the lowest we've seen for this kind of place. Now, the food... wonderful! Wife had sesame chicken (filled one of those large oval plates) and each piece was large, juicy and tender, and there wasn't even one of those little bits of mostly fried breading on the plate. My combination fried rice was also excellent (again, filled the plate), and the sweet and sour sauce was nice and thick and really tasty. Had a good Chinese beer for $3.50, and water as well as pop comes in a 16 oz glass - huge! As you would expect about a good Chinese restaurant, we stuffed ourselves and still brought much of the food home. Turned out in the end that the two of us each had 3 nice meals out of our order, meaning that the cost per meal was $3.80! And it was delicious reheated in a microwave. Hey, if you live in Gilbert or east Chandler and you're going anywhere else, you're going to the wrong place. This is it.
