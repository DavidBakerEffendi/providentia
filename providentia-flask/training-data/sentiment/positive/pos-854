I have been here twice now and it has been so much fun. It's always pretty busy but they have plenty for you to do while you are waiting. The food is delicious so if you are going to wait awhile defiantly eat. It is pricey I wish they charged per game instead of time limits, especially if you are going with guys who like to take practice swings.
