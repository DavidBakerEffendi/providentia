As I sit here full and still inhaling the scent of fajitas I am very thankful to the person who recommended this place! 

The chips came out warm accompanied with salsa that had just the right amount of spice and a bean dip that reminded me of my long lost favorite Margaritas Cantina (at the old frontier casino), so of course that alone will bring me back! 

We ordered the fajitas for two people for $25 (a steal in my book) and there was more than enough meat and veggies! The meat is so tender and flavorful that I didn't really even need all the fixings. But I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the guacamole tasted and used my chips to truly enjoy the taste instead. The rice and beans were also quite good. 

This place is about 20-25 minutes away from our house but we are already planning who we want to bring! 

P. S. Service was great!
