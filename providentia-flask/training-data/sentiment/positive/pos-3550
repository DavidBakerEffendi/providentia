I'm a big fan of TIABI's other location on Maryland. 

I've recently moved closer to this side of town, and while I was out with my mom on Sunday, I decided to pop in for a coffee.

This location is much smaller than the other, but its cozy and clean. 
Service was great.  The guy who took my order was very nice, and service was quick!

Loved the Twilight Lavender coffee iced!  So delicious.  

I will definitely be coming back soon to have some waffles!
