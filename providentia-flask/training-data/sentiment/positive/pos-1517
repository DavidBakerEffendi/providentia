(This is the same location where Garbanzo used to be)
I used an Uber credit to get lunch from this place, and oh my, we were truly impressed. The greek fries (potatoes with feta cheese) were perfect, golden, crispy, delicious.
We also had a side of pita chips (which seemed freshly cooked) and they were the best.
Hubby had a gyro pita and it had a very generous portion of meat.

Everything was great, the only misshap is that the gyro did not have sauce, and I had ordered extra.... so we got one little containter which seems to be the regular portion, but not the extra portion I had ordered and paid for.

We liked the food so much we went to look for this place a few days after and found out they are where Garbanzo used to be. Hubby had a gyro and I had a greek salad. Both were very good. Michelle took our order, brought our food and checked on us a couple of times. She was very patient. We also interacted with Rober and he was very kind to us, letting us sample chips and pita.

It is worth to mention that both hubby and me thought this is an example of a business really making an effort to connect with their customers. Overall a great experience.
