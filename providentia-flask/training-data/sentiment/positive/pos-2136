The Truck: The idea of tea on wheels is pure genius.  I saw this food truck parked outside on a cold day, and had had a craving milk tea for days - it was like someone answered my prayers!  Bright pin, this food truck has a wonderful look and feel to it, with an adorable handwritten sign that showcases the owners' enthusiasm for their tea as well as what they're playing for the day. Today's soundtrack was 'hip hop,' so naturally, I was sold!

The Tea: So many flavours and varieties with catchy names, from Peach Oolong to Cheesy Melon. I got the Signature Milk Tea, and it was delicious.  Aromatic, a smooth, creamy milk, and a satisfying finish. Lovers of bubble tea and milk tea will be really pleased with this place. It also comes with an adorable cup. Instead of the Starbucks green tea stirrer, this comes with a red little heart-shaped thing that was made to cover the sipping part of the cup lid. It makes it perfect to carry across campus and was probably designed with tea walks in mind.   

What a little gem parked right outside of Robarts! I'll definitely be back to try everything else, but highly recommend. So glad to see our food trucks stepping it up with some creativity and diversity!
