I just love Monty's for breakfast. I've taken the parental units there twice, and they agree. The ambiance is great (if a wee bit noisy): a throwback to a classic, 50s-era diner, with the requisite neon lighting, "lunch counter", and bar stools. The portions are huge, so this is truly "brunch"! So far I've tried the chilaquiles and the breakfast burrito (yes, I like my Mexican/Southwestern fare!). Both were fantastic, especially when paired with a Mimosa. The menu is extensive: from  humble "bacon & eggs" selections to omelets and elaborate ethnic creations. 

If weekend brunch is what you have in mind, I'd suggest arriving early--as in, no later than 8:30 a.m. After that, you'll likely have a long wait. (In the meantime, you can ogle the impressive bakery case.) The staff are friendly, and the service is fast. Despite its location in the busy Atwood neighborhood, I've never had issues finding parking at Monty's. The only slightly negative comment I'd make is that the booths, although they can accommodate 6 people as far as width is concerned, are a bit on the tight sight with regard to the distance from seat back to table. I'm a thin person, so I can imagine that this might be uncomfortable for those with a stockier build. 

Monty's is my new go-to breakfast joint. I highly recommend it.
