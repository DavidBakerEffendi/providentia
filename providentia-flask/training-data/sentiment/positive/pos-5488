Holy Cheese Curds, Batman, the best poutine I've ever had. A long block down and a couple of short blocks over from Pie IX metro, and a great option if you're in the neighborhood for the touristy stuff, as we were.

The classic has just the right combination of gravy and fries were  fresh and not overcooked at all. The menu has a great set of unusual combinations - the veggie poutine with mushrooms was rich and delicious, as was the smoked meat bowl - and they have sriracha on the table! Good but small selection of mostly local beers available. 

The portions are gigantic in the large - if you're really hungry, I suggest ordering two small bowls of different types, and/or sharing to get a great variety. I heroically finished my large but then I had to sleep off the meal for three days.

Now, the decor is a fabulous industrial design, with repurposed wood railroad ties for seats and laser-cut metal for tables, and it is very attractive. But it's also hideously uncomfortable. Maybe younger people can tolerate it more, but even my kids were complaining about how much it hurt to sit there. I honestly am tempted to shave off a star for my sore butt, but the food was so good I can't bring myself to do it.

Service as prompt and very friendly; you order at the counter and they bring it out, possibly the best of all possible worlds.

Update: an earlier version of this review opined the potatoes might not have been cut fresh even though they tasted that way, but the owner wrote to me and corrected that. Fresh cut! Should have known! Fantastique!
