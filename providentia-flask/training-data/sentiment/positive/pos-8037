Best viet sub in the city. I have tried many subs and this one is the best. Super soft and toasty bun and awesome value for what you get. Since its a long drive for me to get a sub I usually order 2 and take one home. It's cash only so make sure you have some when you go there. The BBQ pork is my favourite and totally recommend it!
