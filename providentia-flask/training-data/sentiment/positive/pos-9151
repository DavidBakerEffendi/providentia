THE MOST POPULAR TOURIST ATTRACTION IN LAS VEGAS. An amazing spectacle of dancing water shooting dozens of feet in the air all choreographed to songs we know and love.

The fountain show goes off about every 15 minutes and the soundtrack changes with each performance.   Shows last less than 5 minutes but it's worth every moment. Day or night you will be mesmerized by the dancing water and the thunderous boom when the streams of water soar into the sky. 

One of the best things about the show is that it's complimentary to all visitors and locals of Las Vegas. 

Enjoy!
