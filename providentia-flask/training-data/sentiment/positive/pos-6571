My new favorite restaurant in Cleveland by miles and perhaps up there overall.  The food here is all outstanding.  I was there for the first time of Wednesday of this week and enjoyed the sashimi and nigiri combination platter that blew me away.  Every piece of fish was extremely tender and fresh and the eel which I am often not all that fond of was outstanding.  On my second visit I had the Thai seafood stew.  I was a little skeptical considering the focus is more sushi and seafood and wasn't sure how the thai flavors would come out but it was also outstanding.  Great flavor, fresh taste that just makes your taste buds very happy.  I also was able to sample the Blue Cod and the Hangar steak and those too were outstanding.  The only thing that was less than great was the desserts which at that time I was probably way too stuffed to enjoy anything else.  I have yet to have a dish that I was any less than impressed with so if you enjoy seafood and sushi I'd say this is a must stop when in Cleveland.  Way underrated.
