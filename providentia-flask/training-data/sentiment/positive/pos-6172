What a Crepe! Should be the real name of this place. It has been a long time I had such a great tasting Crepe. Since I was in France even. Or even Chicago. Here the pastry is made fresh from batter. They have their own system going here. And I love it. It might not be a cozy little place. But I come for the food, and price. And Taste! And this had all 3. I met the owner there too, who is more then welcoming to speak with you. They have ideas in Crepe's you would think Whole Foods sells them. From Avocado, to Fruits. To Nutella, and more. And fruits that are fresh, and even organic if you want. And that counts. The size of the crepe, is like eating dinner in a desert. It is huge! It looks like a football sized Crepe. And the fruit is so filled, it bulges out all over the plate at times, and never soggy, like some do. So far. I have been to a few places here in Vegas. Even on the strip. And Vegas is known for lousy foods off the strip. But this place breaks that rule. In 2015 YAHOO's article on Celebrating Food in America "The 18 Best  Ice Cream Shops in America", Tasty Crepes was number 17. 4.5 Stars out of 120 Reviews. And they should be proud of an honor to even make the list. As over 200 had lost this top position. Heck forget the Ice Cream. I want the Crepe's!!! I will back next week again and again! I think you should try it too! And find out for yourself this hidden Gem off the strip. Thank You!
