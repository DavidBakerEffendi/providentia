We came here for an informal inexpensive meal with another couple. Normally I get the Cuvee salad when I come to Winchells . But tonight they had a Tuesday night special for chicken fajitas for just $12. I couldn't resist. They brought out a huge portion of chicken, stir fried vegetables that are typical for fajita. They also had a very large portion of guacamole, sour cream, beans with melted cheese, and slices chili peppers. The portion was huge. I wasn't able to finish even half despite the fact that I came in hungary. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. The combination, in the tortilla (still warm), was excellent. As good as anything I've had in a Mexican restaurant. All of this for just $12 on Tuesdays. A great deal. I certainly will come back.
