Well Hello Goodness!  Stopped in twice this week.  And I loved both visits!  Sat down with Jake at lunch with my Husband.  He had the Oyster PoBoy, and I had a pound of shrimp.  Both were Perfect!  Loved the feel of the place! The decor with all of the shells everywhere, and the dark wood gave it a very comfy cozy feel!  We loved it so much we went back for late dinner, and sat with Billy who was outstanding!  You really feel like home here!  My husband tried the Catfish PoBoy, love it!  And I had the shrimp again!  Yes I Loved It!  For sure we will be back!  Thank you Smokin' Crafwfish!
