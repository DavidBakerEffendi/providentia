We live right down the street from this restaurant and have been going there regularly for about 7 years now. The owner is so nice, and the staff is always efficient and friendly. Now the food....the food is just... outstanding! It is freshly made every time, spicy and never fails to satisfy. The pork rolls are enormous and a meal themselves, but the dragon noodles are my absolute favorite. The soups are great, the salad is fresh, what else is there to say? I have never had a bad meal there and have been there dozens of times. I will be sad if they ever go away, because no one does it like this.
