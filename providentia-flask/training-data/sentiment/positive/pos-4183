Yet again.  Same order (Arizona Burrito and three Rolled Tacos with Guacamole), same deliciousness.  How can you do this to me for $6.31?  It's just not right!  I'm going to get fat.  Delicious food shouldn't be this cheap and come from a drive through window.  I don't even have to pull the toddler out of his car seat.  10 minutes round trip and I'm on the couch, beer in one hand, burrito in the other Real Housewives of New Jersey on TV.  It doesn't get any better than this.
