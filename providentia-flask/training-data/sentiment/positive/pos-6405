Went for restaurant week, and it was the best restaurant week experience we have ever had. Every single bite of the meal was delicious and Victor was an awesome server! Sometimes the service isn't great during restaurant week, but Victor was phenomenal. Never once treated us like we weren't his most important guests. 

The ambiance is amazing. Smaller than I expected, but all of the decor is beautiful and we really enjoyed the environment and getting to soak it in for a couple of hours. 

We started with the truffle fries before our 3 course dinner because...carbs. They were so good! It was a huge portion and we ate every single one. The winter salad was amazing and the steaks were perfectly cooked. We ended the meal with an able crisp and chocolate cake with French press coffee. 

The entire menu looked wonderful and I will definitely be back to try more.
