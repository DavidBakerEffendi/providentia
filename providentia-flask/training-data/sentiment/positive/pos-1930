Wow, quale buon piatto di pasta!

It's really an hidden gem. It's so cheap while being so good. Where is the catch?

I was a bit reluctant to go out to eat pasta, I mean, it's what you eat when you don,t have the time to cook anything else right? But that's not it. These are real fresh handmade pasta. It's a completely different thing. A completely great different thing.

The portion aren't really big, but it's to be expected with handmade pasta and such low prices.

There is nothing much else to say. Good pasta, good service and good prices.
