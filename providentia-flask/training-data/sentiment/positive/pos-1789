Maybe the new management has had to take time to transition but as a foodie that travels everywhere I would say this place is amazing. 

I have only been here for breakfast but it is one of the best and breaks the mold on just eggs, bacon and toast. The breakfast torta is a Mexican version of a breakfast sandwich  but the smoky chipotle sauce and thick cut ham was scrumptious. 

The pancakes were cooked on a hot grill so that they were crisp on the outside and cakey thick. They really were so tasty that you could eat them without syrup. Absolutely the best pancakes I have ever eaten. 

Waiting staff were quick and attentive. Prices were a little high but the quality of the food made it worth it. 

Clarendon Hotel where this restaurant  is located is an eclectic gem and is enhanced by this unordinary eatery.
