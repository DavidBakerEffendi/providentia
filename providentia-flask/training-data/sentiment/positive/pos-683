This is my neighborhood Capriotti's. I've been coming here a couple of times each month since it opened and never been disappointed by quality of food or service. Several of the employee's know my name and they know that I rotate between a couple of sandwiches and try to guess which one I'm going to order that day. (Usually the capastrami or the cole turkey. But sometimes I throw them off with a philly or even a salad.)
One time, the line was really long and my order got lost within some other much larger orders. So, they made me a medium instead of a small sandwich, apologized profusely, and gave me my whole lunch for free.
Yesterday, I took a good friend there. Somehow, despite living in town for years, he had never been to a Capriotti's anywhere. He said - and I quote - "This is the best meatball sub I have ever had!"
