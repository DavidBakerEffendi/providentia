Yes, definitely a great pizza place. Forget that the pizza is only 8 cuts and that the price is up there. about $16 to $24 a pie. to me it's well worth it to spend money on a decent pizza as opposed to commercial places with their never ending deals. Me and my fiance love there kalamata olive pizza with pancetta or prosciutto, BOMB!! The pizza crust is labeled as well done meaning the bottom is black but don't be fooled that doesn't mean that it is burnt...It's simply cooked so that it's nice and crispy because they cook it over a coal fired and not a  gas or electric oven.

Plus they have this meatball appetizer that has such tender meatballs and is served with soft and creamy ricotta cheese as well as two pita slices. It's a must have every time we go. The salads are made family style so i suggest bringing 4 people if you plan on eating it all. Try some of their beers too. they have a cooler full of bottles as well as a few drafts but nothing too exquisite. 

That's the first place I tried white lighting which is now one of my favorite brews. they have happy hour with discounts on brews so check it out when you get a chance. I haven't been there in months so i think its time for a check-in!!
