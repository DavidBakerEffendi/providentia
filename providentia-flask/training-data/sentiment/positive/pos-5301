I found an online coupon for BOGO bagel sandwiches....they make it so easy to just pull  up the coupon on your phone...and boom  you get the credit for it. 

I arrived at about 7am and was greeted with kindness by the young lady at the counter...I asked her questions about the sandwiches since I've never been there before...she knew the menu! It's not so uncommon now for people to have no idea about what's on the items listed....she knew it all!  My sandwiches were made quickly and exactly as requested!  

Fast and friendly service....at a super cheap price!  

Okay it's a chain and not a bakery so the bagels aren't going to make you salivate but hey it's way better than any sandwich at a fast food joint.
