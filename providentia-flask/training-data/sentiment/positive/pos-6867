WOW! After a mishap with my order from a previous visit, the director (Dominick) personally reached out to apologize by meeting with me and giving a complementary meal. I greatly appreciate and am impressed with the costumer service. Dominick made sure he corrected this by going out of his way to correct a previous mistake for a costumer. Aside from the great service, I look forward to trying more items on the menu. Delicious, healthy, and affordable! Thank you Dominick, I will be back soon!
