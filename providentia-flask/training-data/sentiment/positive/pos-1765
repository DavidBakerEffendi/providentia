Q Bistro was such a good joint for a birthday dinner: their service is on point and their food is delicious and affordable! 

Q Bistro is connected to the karaoke joint next door. They have appetizers, small plates, and a lot of shareable food items. They have a lot of traditional Korean food like kimbap and bibimpap, but some creative stuff like a bulgogi pizza and their awesome Korean fried chicken wings.

They have a lot of fun drinks like yogurt soju and they have buttons on their table when you need the staff.

I tried their onion rings, calamari, kimbap, their bulgogi pizza, potato pizza, and their fried chicken.

Everything was really good and I would definitely order the items again. The pizzas were about $15 each.

If you get fried chicken I'd say all their flavors are delicious but the buffalo wasn't my favorite. The wings were 20 for about $20.

The bulgogi kimbap was my favorite item and they were only $6.

I would definitely go back for a Korean spin on pizza and wings!
