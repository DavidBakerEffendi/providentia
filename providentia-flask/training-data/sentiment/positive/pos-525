New Seoul completely blew me away these past few weeks. I've been coming here for lunch with some people from work, and each experience has been so great.

Servers and staff are always accommodating and so sweet. Our server our past few visits is a kind Korean man who checked up on us frequently and was quick to get our orders, checks, and refills of water. Absolute turnaround from my first experience.

Dining area is pretty empty during lunch, which surprises me because the food is absolutely delicious. I've tried new dishes since my last review, such as the pork bokum, kimcheejiggae, jjambong, and fried dumplings. Pork bokum is delightfully spicy and flavorful, and it's been a favorite for my coworkers who are less familiar with Korean food. Kimcheejigae is a broth made from rice cakes, pork, and kimchee, and it's absolutely delicious. This one is more sour, spicy, and definitely more flavorful (so if you don't like the taste of kimchee, that is not for you). Jjambong is a noodle soup with seafood and another spicy broth. It's very tasty, but my favorite dish will forever be the ddukmanduguk. 

New Seoul has become my new favorite lunch location. Service is attentive and quick, and food has been just amazing. I noticed that I miss my mother's home cooking when I dine here, which just shows me how delicious and authentic this Korean food is.
