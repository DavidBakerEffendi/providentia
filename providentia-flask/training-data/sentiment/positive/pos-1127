Oh Red Velvet how I love your silky and fluffy self!!! So delightful and tasty!! 
Tammie Coe's cakes is one of my top favorite, from their Ooey Gooey cup cakes to my all-time favorite red velvet cake slice!! The cake is fully rich and splendid!! Ahhhh It's like heaven in a slice!! 
The Red velvet is a must try if you go!!
