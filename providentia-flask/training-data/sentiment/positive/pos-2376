What a cute little cafe !

We stopped there for breakfast.   I got a croissant and it was very flaky, light, delicious !

My BF got two eggs with house potatoes and home made bread.   All delicious.   The potatoes had nice olive oil and basil on them.

The lady behind the counter was nice, friendly and helpful.

Excellent eclectic neighborhood bakery / cafe.
