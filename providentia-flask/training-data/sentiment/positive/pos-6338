Similar to the Poke Express on Craig, this Eastern location just off the 215 freeway shares its home with Island Sushi Grill.....a small mom & pop style Hawaiian local joint that's a hit with Las Vegas locals and Hawaiian/Hawaiian food addicts alike. Poke comes as fresh as it gets for Vegas and then some. Ahi and Salmon are rich in flavor and texture that gives the first chewy feeling but melts like butter in your mouth. Friendly customer service all around. A plus side is food variety and malasadas at this location if you want other stuff other than poke... but that's another review.
