A little slice of Mexico and the best tacos in 'The 6'!

I've been on the hunt for a taco better than the fried pescado taco at Playa Cabana's Hacienda on Dupont St. and after trying about a dozen restaurants around the city, I have FINALLY found it!

This jem was recommended to me by a colleague and it doesn't disappoint. The dim lighting, traditional music and beautiful murals brought me back to Mexico and made me forget about the frigid cold.
The menu is simple with a little over half a dozen tacos and although the fish taco beats out all other fish tacos in Toronto, the shrimp taco takes the cake for best taco EVER! It's spicy shrimp meets sweet pineapple at a party in your mouth.
Honorable mentions also go to the sangria and the guacamole and chips (which are noticeably made fresh-in-house everyday).

Overall, the service, atmosphere and food were on point and I will definitely be going back to try a few more tacos and the ceviche. I don't know how I could have expected anything but Mexican perfection when the chefs were speaking Spanish in the kitchen!!!
