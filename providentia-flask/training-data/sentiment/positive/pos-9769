Honest opinion: I had a wonderful experience! So much so that I had to review this from our dinner here last night.

Food - I am a big fan of charcuterie plates! The mister and I went for the Chef's special that included two types of meat and two types of cheese for $19. I expressed to the waiter, Jeff, that I love hard salami (and that's what we got!). There were two diff kinds of spread - one was mustard (which my husband and I did not care for) and the other looked like seeds of some sort that was part sour, part pickled, part something that was complemented the crostini and cured meat.
- We asked for their short braised beef with pickled veggies (banh-mi style) and were blown away by the flavor. The meat was succulent, juicy, and tender off the fat (starting to salivate)... It's a bit on the small scale for $10. I would order two of these next time!!
- Entree - I ordered the scallop on top of a bed of hominies in miso broth. Loved it! I can see people may be turned off by eating the hominy, but I grew up eating them. 
- Dessert - Jeff recommended the souffl√© that was dee-lish. It had a wonderful presentation and a great finishing touch to end dinner.

Service - Ask for Jeff B! He is attentive, will listen to you and get you what you want. Considerate about the timing of each food brought to out to us. We were super pleased with his excellent service. 

Place - I honestly love the place. Outside it looks a bit meh (church reno to a restaurant). Inside, was large, high ceiling, and had a comfy decor. 

Price - This restaurant is pricy! A dinner for two, depending on what you order, will be around $100 or more. Portions are a bit small for the entree, but perfect that it gives you enough room for dessert and feel satisfied. For great service, great food, and nice ambiance - the money we paid was worth it. 

All in all, I was left satisfied and full.  We were not overly full where you cannot move, feel bloated, and in pain. My husband and I would totally come back here again!
