Some of the best food in town, period. The tartare is to die for - literally. For 2 or 3 people who enjoy raw food, I would suggest taking "La Totale", which is a platter of each tartare they make. For those who prefer their meals cooked, the changing menu (plats de r√©sistance) which appear on the chalkboard have yet to deceive - I've had about 5 different plates and each one was tasty, surprising and just as excellent as the last. The desserts are also amazing, especially the "fondant au chocolat, caramel et fleur de sel" served with ice cream - perfect mix of sweet & salty.

The downside to me is that the service is occasionally a little cold, and it can take a while before the waiter makes his way to your table. It has not happened regularly but good service is a must and should be constant. Also, I must admit that it is pricey for the portions (especially the tartars), but the quality makes it worth it. If it was a little less expensive, I'd be there at least once a week! One of my top food experiences in Montreal.
