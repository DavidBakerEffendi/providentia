The grand opening is July 9th, but my coworkers and I wanted to grab beignets after our lunch. We came and we didn't know they had croissants and a lunch menu. Nonetheless, we got an order of beignets, some macaroons, and one of the coworkers got gelato. I got an iced coffee that was made exactly how they made it in NOLA. It was wonderful. The beignets were delicious. Everything was reasonable priced. I can't wait until they have their full lunch and dinner menu. Will definitely come back :)
