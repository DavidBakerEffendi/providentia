So happy to have have found Union Grill & Tap! Having been disappointed with the closest bar & grill to our home, Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers (mainly disappointed with high price and warm beer temp) we searched Yelp to find something new to try. 

Happy to report our first visit to UG&T was a huge success. We were sat quickly, our waitress Kylie was very attentive- despite juggling a number of tables. The food was great, the beer selection solid and the beer was nice an cold. Best part is, the price is very reasonable. 

The only negative was the menu was a little limited. Not a huge selection, but I'm guessing they focus on a smaller selection and really give each dish some extra attention. The burger & Cubano we had were excellent.

Also, try the fries! Thin and crispy steak fries...have never seen fries prepared this 

Looking forward to our next trip.
