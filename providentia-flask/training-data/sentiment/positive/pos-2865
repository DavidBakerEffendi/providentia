The Buffet at the Mirage known as CRAVINGS was excellent as I had dinner there prior to the LOVE show (I talk about below.)  EVERY PERSON that worked at that buffet THANKED us for our BUSINESS and not one other buffet went out of their way to smile and make sure we knew were appreciated.  This blew my mind!  Even the garbage taker outers all the way to the CHEF made sure they thanked us when we THANK THEM!!!  The food was great and I rank the Mirage Buffet top 3 Buffets in Vegas.  Aria being #2 and Wynn being #1

But I will stay at Mirage next time I go to Vegas...because also the lobby was breathtaking and it all was entering a beautiful "story like" atmosphere.  Very calming and aquariums and plants everywhere and very tastefully designed.  Thank you Mirage!

Las Vegas: The Beatles - Love - Cirque du Soleil

This was so beautiful I wish it went on forever!  Do make sure you go to the bathroom first because you totally are not going to want to leave to take a break at all!!

I HAD to go BUT realized it would be too high profile for me to walk out during the show.  The show makes use of EVERY part of the theater they can, including drawing the audience in and making them feel a "part of it" which is genius in and of itself.  

Without being a spoiler let me just say the Beatles wrote MORE than you probably even knew or recall!  A total treasure a must do while in Vegas!
