I love this place. I have never been a fan of sitting in coffee shops, sucking on coffee and WiFi, but I feel so comfortable here that I can spend hours just hanging around. The coffee is amazing and the prices have no comparison. I normally get the 24oz E.M.T. (an Irish Creme Latte) w/ soy. But also love the Bentley's Brew Americano. Always a smile when you walk in the door and you are always treated like a human.
