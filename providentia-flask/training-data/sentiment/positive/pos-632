I had to visit again. Again, a great experience. A friend and I shared the spicy salmon roll which was fresh and delicious; my friend thoroughly enjoyed her tempura don; and I ordered the blue mackerel which came grilled, the skin was crispy and salty and amazing while the flesh was juicy and tender. It came with steamed veg. Most of it was just straight up steamed, except the carrots which were boiled in something flavourful.

Service was kind and discreet. The restaurant was busy but food came out quickly.
