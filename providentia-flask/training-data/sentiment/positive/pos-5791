I was very impressed with this sugar hole. More of a boutique frozen yogurt shop. Less of a selection, however, each yogurt I sampled had its flavor PERFECTED. The selection of toppings were excellent, they offered many things I hadn't seen elsewhere. I topped my pomegranate sorbet with chocolate dipped sunflower seeds coated in a candy-coated shell, strawberries, blackberries, and a dark chocolate coated candy. It was FABULOUS.. A perfect treat after my dentist appointment next door, I'll be going back for sure. Service was also excellent, and 5stars for cleanliness as well. Nice job Mix N' Lix!
