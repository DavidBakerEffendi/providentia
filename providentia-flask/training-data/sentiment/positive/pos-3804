There seems to be three types of pizza.  Chicago style, New York style, and the pizza that we actually buy and eat.  These days you go to a pizza joint and ask for thin crust and they say, "Sure, we've got non-existent crust."  And you say, "Yeah, I'll get the non-existent crust." Maybe I'm watching my weight; maybe I just don't like that much bread underneath my cheese; maybe it's none of your business.  And they say, "Yeah, that's good because our crust sucks." So it's great that there's actually a pizza joint where I can get some crust with character - crust with taste.  And the fact that I can get a slightly healthier pizza for my daughter is a plus that is hard to pass up as she could live off of pizza if one could actually live off of eating only mushroom pizza.  How a five-year old ever convinced herself to like mushrooms I'll never know.  My wife loves the skinny pizza with pineapple, feta cheese, hold the mozzarella, jalapenos, and onions.  Yeah, I know, that pizza makes even less sense than a five year old eating mushrooms.  Personally, I'm settling on a peperoni and basil combo with full crust.
