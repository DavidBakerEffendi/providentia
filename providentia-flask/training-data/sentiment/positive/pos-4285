Phenomenal! What a great addition to the city of Strongsville. The decor is trendy, yet very welcoming. Lighting/ambiance is perfect. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. My party ordered the following menu items: fried calamari, short ribs, special filet mignon, standard menu filet mignon, chicken schnitzel, chocolate mousse cake, french toast n ice cream, 2 mixed drinks, 1 mocktail and a glass of red. Not a morsel or drop was left. Absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to dine here again!
