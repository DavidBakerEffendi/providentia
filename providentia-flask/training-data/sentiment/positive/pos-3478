Never had it and finally got the chance to try it. It was to die for! And they have this cool plan if you add their app you get continuous food discounts and specials. Just scan your receipt, really cool. 
So let's talk food. You get more than enough and oh boy so yummy. I ordered the Bacon Boy combo and substituted fries for their Chili Cheese with Onion. One word: DELICIOUS 
They have a huge menu to choose from so you can't go wrong. Can't wait to go back and try breakfast as I have heard nothing but good things.
