I enjoyed every moment of being here! The wait staff was super friendly and gave great suggestions on what they liked the best for food. The garlic bread kept flowing and so did the unlimited wine. The white wine was my favorite and our party of 3 ended up going through 3 "bottles" and they would have brought us more if we weren't done eating. 

I got the chicken Parmesan and my boyfriend had the STEAK CARUSO. Everything was delicious and HUGE portions. I absolutely want to come back! It was a little on the pricey side, but you get huge portions of food, a salad or soup, unlimited garlic bread and unlimited wine. I definitely think it is worth the price and would recommend this for a nice date or if you want some damn good Italian food!
