Super cool spot. A little hard to find because it sits at the back of the strip center behind the gas station but it is well worth the search. 

Great food, awesome service and an incredible vibe. I overheard one of the regulars a lively 75 year old talking to a 30 something about this place is cheers without the alcohol. LOL. 

We love the food we have been here 3 times and each time we order something different and not once have we not loved what we had to eat.
