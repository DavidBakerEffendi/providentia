Salt Cellar is aaa-mazing. Couldn't get better seafood in the desert. Apps are great...fish tacos, NE Chowder, Oysters (to die for), Shrimp San Remo (garlic explosion) = Perfection! The Sea Scallop entree is my favorite for all you scallop lovers out there. The owners know their wine as well....fabulous wine list! Great service, fun atmosphere and very friendly!
