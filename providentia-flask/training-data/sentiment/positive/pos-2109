My best friend had her 21st Birthday here at Bottiglia, and it was AMAZZZZING!!!! Received the most attentive service from every department in the restaurant especially our server, Raul. Chef Josh is the best! The food was beyond wonderful, with a great twist from any other Italian restaurant around town! Fun and friendly atmosphere with beautiful decor. Must visit for sure!!
