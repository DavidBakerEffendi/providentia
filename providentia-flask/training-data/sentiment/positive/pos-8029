We hosted a private party here for 25 guests to celebrate my mom's birthday.  The restaurant is closed on Saturday afternoons, yet available for private parties.  I loved that we had the entire restaurant to ourselves.  It is an intimate and down to earth space but has all the right touches to make a special event feel pretty spectacular.

Chris, the chef/owner is extremely mellow and easy to communicate with.  He sent us a suggested menu and it was perfect.  No negotiating, no revisions needed.  The day of the event was very smoothly run.  The waitstaff was fantastic.  They were attentive yet felt invisible at the same time.  The food was very good and presentation excellent.  It is also great that they are BYOB, which of course makes for a less expensive tab.  The cost of the entire event was extremely reasonable. 

I think a Saturday afternoon event here would be perfect for anyone looking to host a bridal or baby shower in the East End area, or who wants a smaller afternoon luncheon wedding reception.
