Love everything I've had here.  Marisa is a fan too.  Kafta and gyros are great, fresh-cut fries also terrific.  Table service instead of queuing at the counter.  I'll be trying the baklava after I'm down a few pounds.  Today I had the chicken shawarma and ask Tamer to put a little hummus it too. It was really outstanding and Panini press as well which was nice surprise perfect crisp crunchy texture on the outside everything inside terrific, it even has slivers of pickled radishes in it that are great.  And as an extra bonus they have stupid fast free Wi-Fi here 38Mbs.  The brother owners Tamer & Mohammed are doing a great job.

btw, my chicken shawarma looked so yummy that I would have taken a picture for yelp.  But I devoured it instead :-(

update 1/3/12, joy of joys, they have beef shawarma today!  It too was terrific.  Wi-Fi is still stupid fast at 29Mbs down / 39Mbs up unlike the Starbucks that I just came from.
