Came here with a couple of co-workers for a Japanese lunch (one of them has never been).  I was in the mood for a bento box and the other guys wanted sushi rolls.  I ordered the shrimp tempura bento box and the guys each picked three different styles of sushi to eat and share.

The meal started with the typical soup and salad course.  Although I've had these items at many other restaurants, I really enjoyed their version of a salad dressing that was much thicker (and tangier) than other places.  The soup was warm and comforting on this rainy day.

The tempura shrimp bento box came with a few other tempura battered veggies, a couple of dumplings, rice and four pieces of a California roll.  It was great to have such a variety of items to eat, dip, mix.  The guys sushi plates looked lovely and they gobbled them up in no time.

Efficient service, made-to-order sushi and a large menu of additional choices / options made for a great lunch outing.
