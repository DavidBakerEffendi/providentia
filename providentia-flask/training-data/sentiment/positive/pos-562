I can never get tired of this place.
I have NEVER had a bad experience. Eat what you want, as much or as little as you want. Or order something fresh off the menu.
It is not the "best" sushi I have ever had....but it is surprisingly good and the price can't be beat!
Love the sizzling salmon or order the spicy hand roll...
The service is always good, fast and friendly.
Its clean and usually seated quickly (they can get really busy--a clue to the quality--so peak hours can cause a small wait). 
If I get bored, I simply order from the menu.
You CANNOT go wrong here.
