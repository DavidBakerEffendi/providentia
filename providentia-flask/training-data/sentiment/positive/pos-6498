I finally made it to upstream! It was delish, just as I had imagined! We had to sit outside since they were fully booked inside but I couldn't have been happier. It was a nice night with passing showers.we order a shrimp appetizer which was perfectly made, followed by some calamari (which wasn't fried) -I have never had it that way. I also had the salmon dish which couldn't have been anymore perfectly cooked. I will definitely be back!
