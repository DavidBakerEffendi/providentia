I loved Nolen Kitchen! I went for a weekday lunch. The weather was perfect and the outdoor patio is a great atmosphere. They have cushioned benches in addition to chairs to make it cozy. I got lemonade to drink and it was actually really good! It tasted homemade. The lemon chicken souvlaki wrap was really tasty as were the fries. My friend got the chicken club and thought it was great! I want to come back soon and try out the dinner options.
