Omg! I'm so happy I came across this hidden gem. This pita has everything a girl could ask for! It had so much flavor and every bite it got better and better! I also got the pao queijo... which is obviously the cheese balls from Brazilian gods! I could eat a million of them! I'll 100% be back, I have to try so much more on the menu!
