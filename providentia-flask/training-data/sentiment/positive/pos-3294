You have got to try the bubble tea! This place is literally the only place I've been to where the bubble tea is not just a concoction of sugar and milk. I've never realized that bubble tea would taste like tea! Another great thing is that they don't load up the drinks with ice! I hate that because it makes me disappointed in the quality of the restaurant.

The owners are also super nice and I'll be definitely back for more!
