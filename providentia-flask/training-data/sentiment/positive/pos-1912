What a great place. Why did we take so long to try out a place so close to home. Everything is made on site and it tastes perfect. We only started with the pizza, salad and dessert but will be back to try their home made pasta and sandwiches. The food was great my spicy pizza was delicious (but not very spicy). The Salmon pizza was very nice and both came with fresh off the branch basil...what a perfect touch. The desserts were amazing, but too big and rich to finish. We had the brownie and lemon square - both so very tasty. The dessert setup was also a simple detail that made the experience amazing. It seems like they really thought through all the details, from the bar, counter display dessert table and stools. All making for a perfect stop on Saint Viateur.
