Love the atmosphere here.  There's a cool patio area with an herb garden (no, not that type of herb, you goofs), big comfy pillow-couches, and a few outlets.  Both times we've come here, we've been around near closing time, and both times the staff were super chill about it.  The first time, we were told that we were fine finishing our drinks outside while they cleaned up the inside of the place and started to close up (we ended up chatting with them about local bars); the second time, we hung out outside while they closed, cleaned, and reopened again for a band later that night.  It's a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, and the people who work here feel like genuinely good people.  No pretentiousness at all.

As for the coffee, I know it's probably super unhealthy, but I love the Dark Chocolate Mocha Smash.  With whipped cream.  Lots of whipped cream.  Try it, but don't sue me when you get diabetes later in life.  It's worth it.
