Ok, I came here alone for lunch to get my fish fix in!  All i had was shrimp and Salmon.  Of what I had it was fantastic.  They had a huge selection and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it if I had gone for other items but when I eat fish, I eat fish alone.  I'm the lone one in my family who likes fish.
