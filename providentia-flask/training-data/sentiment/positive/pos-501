My parents and I came here for breakfast and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Had coffee, earl gray tea and some breakfast. 

The coffee was not the greatest which was surprising, but I and my parents loved the flavor of the earl gray tea they served. 

For breakfast Dad ordered the three eggs breakfast with bacon and mother and I ordered the pancake & Eggs breakfast she got hers with bacon and I got mine with Portuguese sausage. All meals were tasty and we loved every bite of it 

As for the staff, I really liked how there were different people for different things, people who bring the food, people who bring the drinks and the server of course. This ensures that the server has all the help they need and can focus on the guest needs. Within that, we had to ask for hot sauce and remind the server a second time. Which he brought. But in general the food was great and service and the host staff were phenomenal.
