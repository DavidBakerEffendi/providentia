Every single thing is perfect. The menu is much more exciting than a lot of veg places I've gone to before. I had 4 cocktails there and every single one was perfectly balanced. The food is creative and cooked well. You can really taste each ingredient, and can find layers of surprises throughout your meal. Everything was fun to eat. The staff is very casual, funny, and they act like real people instead of trying to dramatically smile and be over the top. I want to come back here and order every single thing they have to offer... and I will.
