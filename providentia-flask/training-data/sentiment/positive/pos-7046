What a perfect place for a lunch on the terrace. And in the evening the perfect place to eat and have a nice glass of wine. Everything on the menu is very well done. Explore a new dish and trust them to do it well. The rolls are a must as an entr√©e and the soup is great. Really I trust them so much the last time I was there I ordered a fried rice dish that could be boring or too commercial and it was amazing. Last point the service is usually exceptional. That is all.
