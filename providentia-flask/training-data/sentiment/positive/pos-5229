Visited spin for the first time on a Friday night around 8:30 the place wasn't too busy but it wasn't empty.  They played current pop music and had friendly staff. I thought the menu had a nice selection something for those who like to keep it simple and something for those who like to try something different. 

I got the sugar sugar crêpe. A crêpe filed with chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream with brownies and cookie dough bits on the side and chocolate sauce. My mother got the California dream. A crêpe filed with pina colada ice cream white chocolate coconut and white chocolate sauce. Both selections can be served in a crêpe or on a waffle.

We both enjoyed our desserts they were delicious and the  crepes were perfect not too sweet or saugy.  They serve the sauces on the side so you can decide how much you want,  which is nice.
