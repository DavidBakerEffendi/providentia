PH completely renovated this space and it is a great change! Open 24 hours with super chefy, quick diner-esque eats. The menu was totally revamped and SO improved. We went there for late night eats as well as breakfast and we were not disappointed. We had poke nachos and texas tostados. Both were heavenly and I wished there more on the plate. Def a great location and great food. They really raised the standards. They also have crazy sugar factory looking shakes now too.
