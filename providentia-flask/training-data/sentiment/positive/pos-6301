Ahhh, Union. The food here might be kinda greasy, but it tastes great!
I came here for my birthday and the service was steady, it wasn't super fast, not slow, just a good consistent pace. The place wasn't too packed when we got there, but I'm glad we made reservations because it started filling up during dinner time. 
I eat a lot of ketchup, but they don't have ketchup bottles, so I think we might've annoyed the waitress by constantly asking for more ketchup. She would bring four of the little bowls but like I said, I eat a LOT of ketchup. Anyways, she didn't seem annoyed, she seemed more entertained by my constant need for ketchup.
Overall, I liked the service & I liked the environment. I also liked how there was wifi xD
The place was clean & I had a good birthday (:
