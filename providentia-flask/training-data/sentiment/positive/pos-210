If you're near Central & Thomas you MUST try this place!  I'm in love with their menu.  They have everything from burgers to delicious hot dogs.  

You can even get burritos in the morning. Yes... So good.

Service is always fast and quality if food is always up to par.  I'm loving the Mexican burger!  It had green chile and grilled onions... Man I'm hungry just writing about it.  Try everything!!!! Won't disappoint. ;)
