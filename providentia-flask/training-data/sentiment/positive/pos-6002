There are no menus here. Just a big chalkboard that dangles over you before you step into a short line and order your burger. The first thing you may notice is the "Retirement Burger," with a price tag of a cool million bucks, and it includes the burger, a drink, and the restaurant. A cheap joke, or kinda funny? You be the judge, but I've caught myself chuckling at it before. 

On top of that, the burgers here are rad. Yeah rad. They cook them right in front of you while you wait and they have an entire table with condiments like fresh lettuce,  tomatoes, sweet relish and a few other goodies to complete your masterpiece according to your preferences. It's like a waaayyy less corporate Fuddrucker's. While you wait for your burger to cook up, I recommend an order of the 50/50 zucchini and mushroom appetizer to get you through. 

I bought a Powerball ticket this week. If things go well, maybe I'll get the Retirement Burger.
