We came here on a whim Saturday night before seeing Baz. We were hoping to arrive to the Palazzo sooner but ended up not walking into the casino until 7pm, for an 8pm show. While their tables were fully committed, we were able to easily find 2 seats at the bar. The bartender was lovey; she took our order quickly and even made a recommendation so we could get the sushi we love the most cost effective way possible. Our drinks were served almost immediately and the sashimi arrived shortly thereafter (almost like magic). We ended up ordering the assortment of 4 sashimi tiradito which was absolutely wonderful. It came with 3 pieces each of their yellowtail, kanpachi, salmon and tuna; each one prepared its own delicious, special way. 
We had such a lovely time that, after the show, we decided to make a second visit. This time the bar was packed but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar immediately. We ordered a couple of rolls which were very well priced (especially for the strip) and again they were served promptly. Our waitress was just as excellent and attentive as the bartender too.
If you find yourself at the Palazzo, definitely check this place out...whether you have a small amount of time or want to have a leisurely dinner, it's fantastic!
