I've been here a number of times, but tonight really inspired me to write a review.

A-MAZ-ING.

A friend and I visited, pretty late at night, and on a whim, decided to share one of the "family style" meals on the back flap of the menu.  We got the fish/seafood combination, which was three courses of seafood... the first was fried appetizers of shrimp, whitefish, zucchini, and calamari with delicious dipping sauces.  The second course was a paella with mussels, scallops, fish and shrimp, and dessert was a delicious tres leches cake.

WOW.

Everything was superb.  I love they offer local microbrews and the traditional Mexican favorites.  (Let's be honest, is there anything better than Negra Modelo or Dos Equis???)

I've been many times before, but can't wait to go back!
