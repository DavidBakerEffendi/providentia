Decently unique, Empress Taytu offers a very interesting cuisine that is not increasingly available in Cleveland. Ethiopian food is something special that is homemade. I decided to try this restaurant after wanting to have Ethiopian food for awhile. The meal I had started with an appetizer which was sambusa filled with ground meet and for my entree I had beef tibs/ chicken dorowat which was simply amazing. The flavors of the spices were amazing and the injera bread was very good. To compliment this meal they have a lengthy list of Ethiopian beer which was a nice touch.
