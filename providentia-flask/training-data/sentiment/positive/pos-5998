Small place big Taste!

Place is small and I think someone might be a UNC fan! Parking is a little tricky but well worth it. Portions are big and great, I had a chopped pork plate and you could taste the smoke in the meat. 

My wife said the slaw was great on her sandwich also, hush puppies some of the best I have had. 

The onion rings was great also and get a ton with the order. Everyone was friendly but remember cash only!
