Stars and taste are personal. I've liked places others rated low and disliked some that others rated highly.
When we walked in, every table was filled.
This place was clean, the tile floors were clean (not sticky nor slippery), we were served immediately and to food was tasty, hot and fresh. 
The Szechuan beans had just the right spice and crunch. The fish and baby bok Choy had just the right amount of salt and the veggies were perfectly al dente. The ginger and onion  lobster was fresh and had the perfect spring back in each bite. And the Peking ribs were cooked well with plenty of yummy sauce. 
At the end, my mother told the waitress to tell the cook that the food was delicious.
This place gets 5 stars because the food and service were both very good, prices were decent and it's a place we would come back to, recommend, and even bring out of town friends
