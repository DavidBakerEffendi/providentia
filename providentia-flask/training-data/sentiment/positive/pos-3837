This is the closest in n out burger near my home and the one I'm most likely to be visiting. I've been coming here for months now and I have to say I've never had a negative experience with the staff members and their customer service is good. 

This particular visit was through the drive thru. It seems like the drive thru box was broken so a staff member was taking orders. Luckily it wasn't too hot so the staff member seemed fine but I do hope they were rotating members. If you go through the drive thru you can actually see the kitchen through the glass. Glass was pretty clean and everyone working had on a hair net and was wearing gloves. The staff members were organized and it seemed like they were having fun due to the laughter within their face.

I got my meal quickly and efficiently. When I want to get a fast food burger I come here and skip every other fast food chain.
