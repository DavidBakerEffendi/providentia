I was looking forward to the great fish & chips here as well as one of their better than average turkey burgers when I returned to live in Boulder City. Saw immediately that they've even renovated the place and it looks better for sure. We would literally have a meal here at least once a week before, it was that good and the friendly service was top notch. We brought many friends who live in Henderson & Vegas here and they too loved it.  So, why the 3 star review you ask? Two glaring reasons which my family, friends and I can't tolerate. Service is now just mediocre, all the friendly faces like the two Amanda's are gone and they keep the TV on FOX News all the time. I'm not even a sports fan but would prefer that over your current choice. In the past they played old school vintage rock & roll but now they have country music. Oh well, whoever's in charge now has lost our dine in business and we won't be bringing friends any longer. Not that they care.   

We heard from friends who ate here recently that they dined in and saw the TV's were tuned to ESPN (natural choice for being named Pit Stop) and they were playing vintage R&R.  We went in today and the place was back to it's old self, ESPN on TV and as we ate we listened to Santana & the Beatles. Our waitress was pretty little Fannie who always delivers excellent service. They were all working hard and the place was spotless and felt cohesive which is probably why our fish, turkey & beef burgers as well as French fries were spot on good. Took burgers home for the rest of the family too. So happy to have back the old vibe we always loved.
