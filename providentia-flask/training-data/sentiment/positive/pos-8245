My family was very happy with the quality and the variety offered at the Mirage Buffet. We went for early dinner on  Monday and it was quite vacant; however, from what I could see the Mirage did not hold back on their offerings. I pricked up discount tickets from tix2night that worked very smoothly. Had sushi, prime rib, BBQ ribs, pork tamale, prepared to order pasta that was excellent,  wine was so-so, but that was not my reason for going. Their deserts were excellent as well. The Creme Brulee and the Mirage Bread Pudding with vanilla sauce were delicious. 

We did return again in a few days latter as the Mirage offered us dome 2 for 1 tickets during our first dinner. This time it was for Lunch and was equally fabulous. The food is very fresh and the staff is very prompt and professional.
