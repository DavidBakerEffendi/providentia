I adore this place. The people are wonderful and so is the food. We always get yellow chicken  curry and lately we have been getting the shrimp/squid tom yum soup. It's without a doubt our favorite thing there now. Your body will love it. Tastes great and good for you! We try to g at least once a week, but sometimes that turns into 5 or 6 times a week.
