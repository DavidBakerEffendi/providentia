Every time I go here I order hot food and they always serve it cold. I think the food looks nice there but actually it tastes like dirt and bad service.   I'm amazed these guys can pass FDA standards with serving food partly frozen and a staff that is supposed to follow federal regulations but how they do this is not my business.
