Delicious place~ The food here looks beautiful! And they are delicious. I had walnut French toast. It was  soft and sweet. But the vanilla latte was just mediocre. The sofia crepe was also really good. The egg was tender and they added spicy sauce on the side.  But the place is really small. Come early! We had a tight schedule so we had to sit at the side bar. But overall, it was a delightful meal!
