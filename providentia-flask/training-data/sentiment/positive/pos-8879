Charlotte has a ton of sushi options, from cheap and bad, to fancy and overpriced. But RuSans is the perfect blend of affordable and tasting amazing. They get very creative with their signature rolls and rotating specials. Those guys behind the counter are magic, and always super friendly. 

And to make this place even better, their weekday "all-you-can-eat" lunch special is second to none. And it's not a secret either, so if you want to try it out get there early because there will be a line.
