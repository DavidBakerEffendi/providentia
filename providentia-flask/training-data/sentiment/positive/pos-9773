This place is one of my favorite taco shops, luckily it's a 3-minute drive from my place. My fiance and I have brought friends here and they absolutely love their food. When coming we usually order the tripas, asada, and pastor tacos. All of them are so good, but our favorite is tripas. I have never been a fan of tripas until I walked into this place. If you do not know what tripas is, it's the small intestine of an animal I know it sounds gross. The tripas here are do crispy and flavorful. 

If you are in the area defiantly give this place a try. I guarantee you will be back for me.
