Great decor, bright and open.  Wood fire pizza oven is right in front of you.  Ingredients are high quality and the owner Bill is a really great guy.  The prosciutto, fig and goat cheese pizza was amazing.  Also, the housemade burrata was incredible.  They just installed a herb garden out on the patio.  

I used to frequent this place when it was a previous business and owner.  It is completely flipped the mood of the environment and is a great new addition to the neighborhood.  We plan to frequent and often.  

Don't ask if they are going to be open to the wee hours as in the past businesses.  It's not gonna happen.  Nice.
