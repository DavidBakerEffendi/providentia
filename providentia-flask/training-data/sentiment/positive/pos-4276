I have been here numerous times since being shown it about 8 or 9 years ago, maybe around 40 times give or take? It's been always a great breakfast spot. They are known for their coffee cake, which changes flavors often but never a bad choice. I also will note a fondness for their seasoned potatoes. It's small cubes of potatoes that are deep fried, then sprinkled with their seasoning mix. My best guess is that the mix includes salt, pepper, garlic and paprika. Always crispy and hot.
During the busy times, there can be a wait to get a seat. And boy, does this place get busy! I often visit around opening, early in the morning, to avoid the big crowds. The place itself has a very casual and laid-back appearance. Prices are very reasonable. Friendly and attentive staff. Service has never been a problem yet.
They are open for breakfast & lunch but I'm a fan of 'breakfast anytime' so I can't vouch for their lunch items. I've only had breakfast items here and only once came during lunch hour(ordered an omelet). I've brought alot of friends from out of town here when needing some early morning eats fresh from the airport. Great place for breakfast, I will keep coming here long as things don't change!
