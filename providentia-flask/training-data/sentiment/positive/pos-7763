This may be one of the best culinary ideas I've ever seen. It's just so simple! Take an all-American dish and throw a bunch of junk on it for a reasonable price. It's brilliant and delicious.

First of all, I love a "seat yourself" establishment. For some reason we always get stuck next to the rowdy party on date night and spend half the meal staring at each other since it's too loud to talk. So we were able to nab a quite table near the kitchen and thus began our jaw dropping experience. There's just so much to choose from! A whole list of toppings with a dietary chart to boot. We honestly had no idea where to start. 

Second, the waitress brought us extra napkins right when we sat down which is awesome when dining on messy foods.

Lastly, I can't believe the amount of food I received for such a little price. I topped my hot dog with saut√©ed onions, bacon-balsamic marmalade, feta cheese, chorizo chili, and a fried egg. It was absolutely delicious! I mean, who knew?! All that stuff piled on a hot dog being that good. Oh and did I mention all that was $5? That's right, $5. We also got a side of tater tots with 3 dipping sauces for $3. Crazy! Usually, the bill we ended up with is what we would pay for one meal, not two.

This is definitely a place I would recommend for an "out of towner". Very fun and a Cleveland gem.
