Another day another dish or two to try. Today I went with Indian Pizza and a small order of Aloo Tika chaat. 

As usual I had no idea what to expect when we placed the order. 

The Aloo Tika Chaat 2.99 arrived first. I was instantly the star of the table, this cardboard boat contained an immense flavor punch and some great textures. There were garbanzo beans, two large potato like dumplings and a great curry sauce. If you want flavor this is the dish for you and at 2.99 how can you go wrong? 

A coworker and I split a large paneer pizza $8.99. This was basically a veggie pizza with some seasoned paneer topping and a good spice note from the tomato sauce. The crust is thick and crunchy. As a pizza it was decent, however I was expected it to be a bit more exotic.

Stay turned for my next random items on the menu adventure at New India bazaar where every meal is a new adventure.
