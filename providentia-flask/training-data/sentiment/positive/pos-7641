I've been really wanting to explore the places for sushi. Also I know people can get sick from sushi but I took a shot and this is a gem! The service is fast. They have a wide variety of rolls and nigiri. They also have other entrees if you're not into sushi. I ordered the California roll, salmon roll and spicy crab roll. All of them were very good! The spicy crab roll wasn't very spicy which was perfect for me. Their wasabi that they served wasn't as strong as I was expecting it to be. I put quite a bit of it in my soy sauce. It's not necessarily a bad thing just different. Overall the place is a great place to start if you want to get into sushi. They even have picture menus!
