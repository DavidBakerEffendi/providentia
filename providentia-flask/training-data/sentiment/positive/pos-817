Looooove this place! It is where I come when I'm feeling terribly nostalgic because it reminds me of all my favorite places in my favorite city. Intimate, modern, romantic, quiet, great service, delicious food and a convenient location. My boo and I usually share an appetizer and an entree which is perfect and they always have vegetarian options. Pittsburgh needs more places like this.
