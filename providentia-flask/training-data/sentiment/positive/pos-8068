This place is my favorite cold noodle place :)
I've been going this place for over 5 years..I know the owner and her family.
foods are really good and prices are awesome!
It is best to have cold noodle in  mostly summer but it is still good to have cold noodle in Winter too!
I love their cold noodle and gal-bi.
My other friends who wants to eat something else..they always get combination dishes..it is delicious too.
Another thing about this place is the service is really great! Owner's husband is working at the Sahara location and owner is working at the Greenland location..they both are very friendly and try to give you the best service :)
I love this place so much!!
I really really love cold noodle so I tried everywhere in LasVegas but this place is the best!
