Being a kauai boy growing up then relocating to oahu for a good 7 years and now in vegas, i saw this in the kama'aina magazine and was like no sh*t lol i had to try this place. So i drove cross town to eat here. Totally worth it. Home cooked food. The staff here were very friendly and the prices were fair. There is choke parking so no worries on that. Not hard to find either. If you from kauai or just hawaii in general and want some home cooked food, hit this place up you wont be dissapointed.
