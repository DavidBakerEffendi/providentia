This corner deli has anything you could ever want, including semi-famous pizza rolls. They have affordable family meals for take-out too. 

I have had them cater a professional event that we held outside. They sent 2 men in a Suburban and within minutes they were set up, grilling chicken and ribs. The team was super nice, fun, and eager to help.
