This is the Wynn so you expect everything to be of a high standard and Terrace Pointe Cafe doesn't disappoint.  For starters I strongly recommend the $20/glass bottomless mimosas that are refilled frequently.  This isn't a huge menu but it has all you need for a great lunch or brunch with variety for half sandwiches and soups or salads.  I had the tuna sandwich that was just the right size and a generous bowl of fresh fruit.  As an appetizer we shared the chips with guacamole and salsa along with the tuna poke all were more than satisfying.  One thing I love about all Wynn properties are the vegan options that my brunch mates enjoyed and I did as well for a vegan banana split.  

I would recommend waiting for outdoor seating on a nice day and the service is great as expected without anyone trying to rush you off as you enjoy your food and the weather/view.
