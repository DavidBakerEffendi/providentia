I bookmarked this place to try, but Kris said one of his co-workers said this place was great. Okay, so I gave in despite the list of other restaurants I was dying to try...

As you step inside, there is a winding staircase in front of you that will lead you to the hostess stand. I thought maybe we went in the wrong door(?), but no, we did not. It's a pretty small place, especially this one corner where we got sat. I almost felt like the building was not in code (my interior design side steppn' out), because it was not handi-cap friendly (all stairs) and it was pretty tight spaced. Eh.

I had the stuffed trout (Idaho) with rice pilaf and veggies. Kris had the grilled trout, 7 oz. steak, and veggies. Apparantly we agreed that my stuffed trout was better. Be warned, girly drinks here are $14, YES, $14 a piece. I ordered the Creamsicle and Fuzzy Navel- $28 out the door. Ouch. Bill was $106+Tax. The steepist bill I've ever paid for seafood, but the quality was all there. Service was definitely top-notch.

Bravo, Salt Cellar, another great seafood place in Arizona... I will no longer listen to rumors about how Arizona doesn't have any good seafood.
