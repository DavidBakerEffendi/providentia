I thought I reviewed it long time ago.  This is our "canteen", especially in Fall and Winter. We've been there more than 50 times? Lamb and beef dishes are their specialties. Also the bbq skewers (lamb skewers so far are the best I ever had outside China and you can ask for less spices/chilly powder), fried stuffed pies, dumplings, noodle soup, sesame/bbq/fried lamb chops. Some cold appetizers are good too. Service is nice and prompt. 

I'd stay away from chicken and seafood dishes.
