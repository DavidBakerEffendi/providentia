For a restaurant that has only been open a very short time this one seems to have gained quite a following.  At 6 PM on Tuesday the place was absolutely packed-not a seat available.

Three friends and I had dinner here tonight and have to say this is a winner with one exception. Friend number one had halibut and it was very dry and overdone. Halibut is a delicate fish and there's a fine line between perfect and overdone this one definitely crossed the line.
The rest of us had Veal Marsala which we all really liked.  Oddly enough they used enoki mushrooms instead of button or cremini mushrooms but the veal  was tender and the sauce was excellent. We ordered pasta side dishes, I ordered pappardelle with Bolognese sauce expecting to get a very small side order since everything is a la carte but side order was very generous. Sadly the Bolognese was not true Bolognese sauce which is made with the addition of milk-this one wasn't but was still a very good sauce.  Caesar salads  were very fresh and the dressing was excellent.
Olive bread and sourdough bread basket could have been heated but was served cold although it was very fresh. The addition  of lemon flavored butter was a real taste treat.

I wish I could remember the name of our server - he was a young black man who really knew his way around serving. Very personable, brought our orders out immediately and checked on us to make sure everything was OK. We're going to look for him again the next time we return.

The Decor is white and pastels-very pretty but the patio is a real knockout. If it weren't so hot we would have eaten out there for sure. Definitely next time because we will be back
Oh one more thing: the red sangria is out of this world but a little too pricey.
