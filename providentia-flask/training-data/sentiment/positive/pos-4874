I always get the Strawberry Shortcake dessert. Its amazing! You can only chose what kind of ice cream you want. (No charge) originally theres strawberry ice cream there but I don't really like it. I'm more of a chocolate or vanilla kind of person. It's a huge order. We usually share it. The price is $11.99 plus tax. They also have decent cakes and crepes
