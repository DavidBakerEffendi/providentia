We were looking at a house in the area & wasn't expecting to eat here. We pulled in for gas at Chevron & I checked it out on yelp while the boyfriend pumped gas. It's 9.50 for a combination plate I thought it was reasonable for everything that comes on the plate. 

*clean * friendly *cheap chinese place. I had a combination plate with orange Chicken, Egg Drop soup & a fountain drink Mr. Pib. The portions were a good size, I couldn't finish what I had so I boxed it. Really REALLY love Crab Rangon & one came with the plate. I was floored at the bad reviews when I truly thought it was delicious.

We dined in figuring it would taste better fresh vs. Driving home smelling the food & it getting cold & soggy. It was quick service even though the kitchen had lots of slips. They use the same chicken in both Orange & Sweet and Sour but it was quality meats. No stringy chicken like some places that cut corners. 

I'd go again no problem!
