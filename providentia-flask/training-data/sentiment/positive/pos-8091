I would give this Afghan place a 4.5 stars on an overall bases.

First impression when getting in... small place with nice seating arrangements. Take a menu and once decided you will have to order and wait a bit for the food as its cooked fresh.

Food wise the price looked decent and I went with Double Kabob meals : Kabuli Kabob comes with Chicken & Chaplee. So you get 2 types of kabab with rice, and salad. The kababs were very nice and taste, and the food was fresh and hot. 

The service was good, there were enough seating and Parking.

For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat.

P.S. - There owner was nice enough to run out after us in the car as my friend had forgotten the phone on the table. We were literally driving by and he yelled to us. Good thing we didn't have to come back.
