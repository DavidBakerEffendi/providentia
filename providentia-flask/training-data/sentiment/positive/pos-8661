First time here this evening with a friend who moved into the building Centurion is located in.
Loved everything about it. Greeted by the chef/owner when we walked in the door, nice  
looking place, very charming and neighborhood feel.
Had the brie in a puff pastry for an app, pizza and the risotto of the day, everything was excellent! Service was perfect.
Will def be going back again soon.
