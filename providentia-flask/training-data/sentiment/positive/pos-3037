Texas road house has never failed for my cravings of steak!! Awesome service as always every time we go, the delicious steak cooked perfectly medium the way I wanted and always a pleasure seeing the manager greet himself! They were super busy the day before Valentine's Day and my husband and I still had a very pleasant experience and was very happy with the food portions price and quality!! You guys rock!!
