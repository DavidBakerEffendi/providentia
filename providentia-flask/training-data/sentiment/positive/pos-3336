A couple of my friends and I were at Old port on Canada's day and were looking for a place to eat for dinner before the fireworks. As we were outside reading the menu, a local came up to us and told us that of all the places around here, this is the place to go, and prices are reasonable. So we went in and were pleasantly surprised :)

In the garden area, is a wonderful terrace with large flower-like umbrellas, lots of beautiful flowers and brick walls. There's also a live jazz band. 

Lots of great choices on the menu, but I decided to go safe and choose a salad, because it was hot out and i haven't had fruits in a couple of days. I chose la salade estivale, which came to about $18 after tax. It has a variety of fruits, cubes of feta, pork filet and two sauces. I didn't like the sauces. But i must say, the pork is extremely TENDER, and packed with flavour! I was surprised it's even pork.

Nachos were huge, i think they were soggy by the time you get half way. The goat cheese pastry appetizer is comfort food.

If you are getting dessert, you must get the biscuit g√©ant/the giant cookie! Served on a cast iron skillet, it's a soft dough with ice cream on top. The crunch from the pecans gives it a great contrast. It's a treat worth eating the whole thing to yourself.

With the bill, comes with a rate-us-on-how-we-did card, which i appreciated. I like places who care about their service, food and how to make the customer's experience better. You know a business cares about improving when they are open to suggestions.

The environment is absolutely relaxing and entertaining and I'd like to try their french onion soup next time!
