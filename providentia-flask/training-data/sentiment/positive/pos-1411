Love this location.  It was a beautiful night so we sat outside.  We were in a large group- 10 total, and the patio was very comfortable for this large of a group. 

 Service was excellent as well- which I think can be tricky with this many people -so Kudo's to our server!  We all had drinks and appetizers and the food was served quickly.  I had the wings which were delicious and shared some chips and queso which was also good.  

Fun night was had by all!  Service was quick and friendly...we will definitely go back and Blue 32 will be added to my favorite neighborhood places!
