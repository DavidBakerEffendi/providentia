Well folks, I think I have officially converted to the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (CBTL) from Starbucks which I was confirmed to their goldcard status in 2008. I don't know, I guess I grew up and figured out what I want my beliefs to be and that path has lead me to CBTL. Well, really it was the path from my house, which is nearby, making this my most convenient coffee shop, but I was just trying to be dramatic...

Anyhoo, I am a sucker for americanos and the espresso that they pour here is not bitter at all compared to what I am used to. I would agree with a previous review that it is sweeter than Sbucks, but I think anything would be, they are just bitter. When I really want a treat I get some of their no sugar added vanilla powder which really makes it taste sweet. I love their wide assortment of teas and while I have not tried any, I know I will and appreciate all the options I have ahead of me. The staff is always pleasant, the drinks come out pretty quick, and the condiment bar is always clean. There are about 6 tables inside and several outside, which on the weekends turns into a dog friendly patio, love it! 

I can't wait for Fall and Winter to take advantage of their patio while enjoying my coffee!
