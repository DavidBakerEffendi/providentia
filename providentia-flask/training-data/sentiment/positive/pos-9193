Finally, an authentic great Mexican style restaurant and it's in my neighborhood!   Don't expect your average greasy burrito or refried beans here - you won't find it.  Rosa Blanca is the newest restaurant in Gilbert - and it's amazing!  

We sat at the bar - and the owner explained that his specialty is Mexico City Street style street food.  He buys only local veggies and meats and everything on the menu is prepared from scratch in the restaurant.  We ordered the carne asade tacos, tacos al pastor, chicken green chili tamales, guacamole, fried cheese and a unique fried tamale appetizer.   To drink we had fresh strawberry lemon water and  hibiscus tea.  For desert we split the (French?) creme brule.  Everything tasted fresh, homemade and made to order - even the drinks!  Next time we'll go for one of the dinner specials.  

I've had a lot of Mexican food, but after Blanca Rosa Cafe I have new respect for the cuisine.
