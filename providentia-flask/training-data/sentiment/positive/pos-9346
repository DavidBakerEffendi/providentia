after deciding on Hula, we drove past Maizie's and decided to give a new spot a try. the perfect weather lends for sitting outside. the patio is nice and spacious, and there are a few tables inside, complete with a full bar. our server was very prompt and efficient. the menu serves brunch until 2pm and the options are quite extensive for brunch items. 
i ordered a house bloody mary...only 3 bucks and it was perfect! peppery, tomato-ey, and spicy. i sucked it down quick. then the portobello mushroom sandwich was oozing with goodness...the mushroom was cooked to perfection and the goat cheese spread was an excellent touch. my wife ordered the caprese panini and although it was tasty, i for once ordered something i liked better than my wife's. the side of sweet potato fries were delicious...crispy, yet thicker than most places. 
there are many, many other options, including pizza's and entrees as well as a dessert menu. 
very nice find for us and the prices are extremely reasonable.
