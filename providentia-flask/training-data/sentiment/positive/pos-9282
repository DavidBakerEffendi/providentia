My only regret is not trying it sooner. We had several main dishes. The eggplant fry was a real highlight with great textures and flavor from the peanuts. Prices are great and the staff is very nice. They have both classic ice cream flavors and more exciting Indian flavors. 

I could go on and on about the food, but just go try it.
