The buffet at Bellagio was my first experience at a Vegas buffet, and it set the bar very high! We waited forever and a day to get into the restaurant, even though it was close to closing time, so we knew the food would be good! I was very impressed by the all you can eat crab legs that are already cracked for you, tortellini, salad bar, and warm dishes. The dessert table was insane as well! There was creme brulee for dayssss :) They had a variety of diet sodas available, which I appreciated. The waitress was super nice and offered to get us food off of the buffet. Everything about this experience was the bomb and I'll be sure to come back next time I'm in Vegas!
