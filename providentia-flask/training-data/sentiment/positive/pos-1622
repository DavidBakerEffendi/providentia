I love sweet crepes over the savory ones, so I ordered their top 3 favorites. All 3 seen in this video were delicious. Not a big fan of the paper plates, but Matt, the manager, assured me that once they move over to their new location, also inside the Biltmore, they would have real plates. This is only their temporary location. That is fantastic news. Although the crepes tasted fantastic, the presentation leave something to be desired. Matt assured me that once they move to the new location, there will be a lot of changes with how the food will be plated. Overall, I love that the staff were passionate about their products. I'm convinced that once this establishment move over to their permanent location with bigger kitchen, and more dinning area for their customers that no one will leave unhappy. Keep it up guys. Stay amazing.
