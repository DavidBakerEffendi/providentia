PS: Wrote this review whilst i was still digesting this breakfast ! 

Visiting Laval we decided to start our day at this breakfast/diner spot, having to wait 15-20 minute before getting a spot was definately worth the wait

The service is amazing everyone is really nice fast and precise ! The waiter is the type of person ud love to hear and laugh with to start off your day ! 

Monteregie section is where you have to go for your order eggs and waffle ! Make sure you call an ambulance for after your meal ! 

I had a special berry with nutella and eggs and my better half had this oreo storm with eggs ! 

I really recommend the potatoes with cheese and sauce 
Make sure u dont go for dinner that day
