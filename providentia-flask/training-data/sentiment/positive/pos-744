My new favorite neighbor in downtown Phoenix. A small but well edited beer and wine shop, with particular focus on beer and a growing focus on ciders. They offer many of their selections by both the bottle and pack, and they have an eight-handle growler fill station.

A fantastic addition the neighborhood and one who will be getting a good chunk of the money I would be giving to the big box chain stores.
