I resisted the bagel. Bagel, shmagel I thought, until Bagel Cafe.  A toasted fresh honey wheat bagel has twisted me around, and wow, now I get it. Put a little cinnamon raisin shmear on it, and yeah. YUM. 

Their quiche is really really good. Matzoh Ball soup was good. Comes with bagel. The pastry case looks incredibly impressive. Most of the items are HUGE, and a bit pricey, but just keep in mind that they are more a treat for your eyes than your taste buds. Yes, they look better than they taste.
