This is hands down the best taco shop in Las Vegas! We lived in San Diego for four years and got used to amazing taco shops on every corner, so coming back to Vegas where all the taco shops are garbage sucked. We had pretty much given up on taco shops until we came here! We knew we were in for something really good or really bad when we saw it was inside the gas station but the second we walked in, it smelled like home. The guy at the register was super nice, and let us know up front it would take awhile since they had a lot ahead of us (you can order online which is magical, we will definitely do that next time). We probably waited about 30 minutes at 7pm on a Friday, which was fine. The second we took our first bite, we knew it was worth every second of the wait. The food is made fresh, and with quality ingredients. Everything was cooked to perfection! We had a carne asada burrito, a pollo asado burrito, and beef rolled tacos. Seriously the best burritos we've had in Vegas. We felt like we were right back home in San Diego!! Highly recommend and we cannot wait to come back!! 

Tips - order online first, and have some patience. The food takes time because they're cooking everything fresh!!!
