Happy Dog makes me a happy lady!

Okay, I'm sorry for the bad pun, but it's the truth!

Like all the other reviewers mentioned, you can get a regular hot dog or a veggie dog with a large variety of toppings, all for $5. You can't get more bang for your buck! You can go for something light or heavy, traditional or wacky (hot fries or fruit loops, what?), whatever suits your mood. I have tried many different combinations here. I would recommend the dog Michael Symon mentioned on the Food Network show, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate:" regular hot dog with alien relish, sriracha, peanut butter (it sounds seriously weird, but it is fantastic)! Last time I was here, I tried the veggie dog for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it! It has a "meaty" texture and a spicy flavor, and I think I may even like it more than the normal hot dog (gasp!).

Happy Dog also offers fries or tater tots as sides. Both are average, and I consider them as more of a vessel to sample all their tasty dipping sauces (chimichurri and special fry sauce, oo la la!). When my friends and I get the fries, we usually get sloppy joe meat and melted cheese to make chili cheese fries.

Monday nights, Happy Dog has trivia. My team and I always fail miserably, but we keep coming out to try! Make sure you come early enough to find a place to sit, because space fills up pretty quickly.

On most other nights, the Happy Dog has live music. And even though some bands are definitely better than others, hanging out and listening to the music is always a fun way to spend the night, and a great way to find out about new bands.

Happy Dog is a Cleveland gem that's for sure worth checking out!
