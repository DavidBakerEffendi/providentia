Love this cute little crepe spot!
Went last night for dessert with my cousin and husband. Not busy at all for a Saturday night at 7pm. 
Decor and ambiance is fun and trendy. Staff was friendly. 
And yes, the crepes were yummy! A little pricey but it's the Biltmore. So it's a perfect spot for a dessert stop. 
The breakfast sounds delicious so we might have to try it for breakfast. It's a nice addition to the neighborhood and who doesn't love crepes!
The sweet cherry on top that pushed me to the 5th star? We shut the place down, and the staff gave us the left over croissants! Yum! 
Will be back for sure.
