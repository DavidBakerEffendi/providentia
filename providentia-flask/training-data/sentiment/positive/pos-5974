Joes is a good spot for a bite and a drink. The concept is really cool being that it's in the old liquor store. Food is good but the menu is a bit limited. I recommend coming in for brunch and trying the mimosa flight. Great for patio events, as I have been to a few gatherings here. I would definitely go back.
