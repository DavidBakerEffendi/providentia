Mighty good, big portions, and freshly made.
Just get take out, not much to look at. Simple operation in the kitchen, wait times could be problematic. Don't be in a rush, and call it in ahead.
After going here a few times, I wanted to add how amazing their rotis are! I love the sag peneer roti and mali kafka roti. Enjoy!
