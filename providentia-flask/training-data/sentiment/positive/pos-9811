Went here once and it was nice. I have never been to a soup kitchen, but this one reminds me of what I think one would look like. From what I can tell they have a large array of soups.

I had the corn chowder and it was yumm. Got it in their special  with a wrap, the lamb one and it was delicious! A little on the expensive side for lunch though, $13 after tax. I am usually a bit wary of salty soups, but the chowder was not salty at all!

But, the tiny patio on the back is pretty cool with neat orange sun mural. Definitely one of the cooler places in Toronto.
