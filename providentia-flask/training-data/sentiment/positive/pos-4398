I'm pretty sure this was the best burger I've ever had. My husband thought so too.
I ordered the signature burger with fried egg, green chilies, bacon, onion, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup (no bun). He ordered the slaw burger.
Husband says it was the best slaw he's ever had too. 
Excellent service, even on a busy day! 
Will definitely make it a habit to stop in each time we are in boulder city.
