First time here. Nice atmosphere and very comfortable. My food was amazing - had the eggs Benedict! My fianc√© ordered the steak
And eggs medium but steak came out medium rare. These guys rectified the situation with the under cooked meat amazingly. Gave us a free mimosa and took the meal off the bill. Val was a great server, friendly fast and attentive. Thank you also Daniel for the help. We will all be coming back soon, highly recommend!
