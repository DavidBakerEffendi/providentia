Saw that this new ramen place opened up in the area so my friends and I decided to try it out. It was a very pleasant experience! The workers were very friendly and courteous. The chef even took the time to explain to us how their broth is made and how the ingredients are fresh.
The atmosphere of the place is very home-y. Unfortunately, there aren't many seatings available, just a single row of chairs at a bar-like long table. Hopefully they add more seating in the future! The ramen was definitely different from what I've had at other ramen places. I had gotten the Shoyu ramen which is a soy sauce base. The broth was light, but still FULL of flavor. The chashu was torched which added even more flavor. The ramen also comes with half a boiled egg, bamboo shoots and green onions. Total came out to be about $9, which is the average for most ramen places. Other ramen restaurants better watch out cause I think I just found my new favorite place! :P
