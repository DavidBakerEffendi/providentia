Excellent alternative to Mandarin prices a little lower quality of food was excellent paired with good service. Only let down for me was the dessert section really bot much variety. Mandarin wins hands down in that area, However a plus considering Wok of Fame includes softdrinks and water in the price of buffet.
Will be back!!
