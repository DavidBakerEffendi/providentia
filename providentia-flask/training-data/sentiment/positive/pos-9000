I have been here numerous times and I always thoroughly enjoy my food.   Delicious healthy food that is not to expensive... you can't really ask for more.  I have been to the Pita Jungle in Tempe before and in no way does it compare to this one in ambiance.  I wish they had this exact restaurant in central phoenix right near my house... I swear I would want to come eat here everyday.  Anyway until that happens I will have to settle for driving a little out of my way to enjoy their food.  On Sunday I stopped in here to pick up some takeout... I had their hummus and taboule pita... I had them put the red pepper hummus instead of the regular and it was sooo delicious and the perfect amount of food.  I cannot wait to come back!
