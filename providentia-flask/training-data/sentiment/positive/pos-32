I have been  going to Rusans for 6 years and have tried about every other sushi bar in town. Rusans is my favorite. I go for dinner with my wife on Friday nights around 9 pm. we can get a spot at the sushi bar and know all the chiefs. my favorite are spicy scallop hand rolls, torro hand rolls. all thte different special rolls and nigiri. they also have good Korean Kimchee, it goes well with sliced tuna or octopus. The prices are good the suhi chiefs are great and the owners are wonderful

Thank you Hata and Kim!!
