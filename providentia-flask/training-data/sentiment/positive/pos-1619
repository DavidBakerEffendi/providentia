I don't think I ever seen a place with 5 stars on yelp until this amazing gelato place. 
So I had to try and I love gelato. 

Desyree (I hope I got the spelling right) helped us. She quickly asked if we were lactose intolerant or any other preference. We've got none thank goodness. She was a sweet lady and she let me try like 5 different flavors. I really wanted to eat every gelato flavors she had. I ended up picking Fio de latte, rice pudding and black sesame. Which were all excellent. My kiddos had cookies and cream & chocolate. All their gelato were very light and didn't have too much sugar. Otherwise, I would have walk out of there with a light headache.  

Desyree checked on us make sure we were enjoying our gelato. No one does that at an ice cream parlor. This is why they have 5 stars! So impressive!
