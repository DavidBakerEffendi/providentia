Went here yesterday on a whim, around 3 pm the lady who was working was friendly and the place was clean.  I was originally thinking of getting a french fries but then I asked her about the frenzy fries , they are a fries and a sort of coleslaw with various sauces wrapped in a pita. 
It was tasty! Only thing I personally think it could have used is some veggies however it waas very filling and only $4.
I will definitely go back!
