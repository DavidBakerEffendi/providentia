I came here with my boyfriend a few years ago and we keep coming back. I was kind of hesitant about it at first. It looks like a typical bar with mediocre food. So imagine to my surprise when we had the house wings and they were this super awesome garlic flavor, the waitress recommended them to be double dipped (extra crispy we found out). We also had the pizza and it wasn't all soft and greasy. The pizza crust was crisp and buttery and the toppings didn't grease it out. I haven't had them yet, but says the tacos are pretty good too. They have a happy hour special every day from 3 to 7pm. It's a great place to grab and beer and wings.
