All Happines depends on a fullest belly and most satisfied palette
Mary S. Dallas-


Corks would be best described as a new wine-focused restaurant located in the heart of old historic  downtown Amherst.  Once an occupied Hardware store now took on the life of an upsclae restaruant with an appealing wine list  serving "pristine product, simply prepared," an approach Lorain County has longed for.  

The front patio is featuring two old cast-iron pillars inside from the property's historic residence which were discovered during renovation. Classic Old World bar backed by a wooden frame harbroing wine bottles, tall ceilings, charming lighting fixtures made of vintage wine bottles and a cozy fire place located  in the back.  Strong architectural lines dominate the space, which is comforting, airy and exciting

The entrees were simple and straight forward yet eclectic in presentation.  I was oh so impressed.   The staff synchronized well together like musicians and instruments .....like conductors of fine orchestras.  hands-on with personal attention.   

Crawfish pierogies, Mac and Cheese paired  with Ohio City Pasta!  Hello taste of Cleveland with out the longsum drive back and fourth from Amherst.

Please inform the Chef his pan seared chicken was out of this World, I had a similar dish at the "Mansion on Turtle Creek"  a restaruant that George and Laura Bush frequent-  Corks blew them out of the park!  My Gosh those truffle infused grits "Baby Come Back"
