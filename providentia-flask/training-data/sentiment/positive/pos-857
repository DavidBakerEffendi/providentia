We recently moved to Las Vegas and this is our third visit to a Vietnamese restaurant in Spring Mountain Rd. This place is lively on a Monday, perhaps made so by a very welcoming, smiling and attentive Hedy. 

The Bun Riu Oc and the Bun Riu were very good compared to the restaurants in Little Saigon, Westminster, CA. Next time I will ask if they can add the tasty blood cubes.

Check out their buy two drinks and get one free, so we got all three flavors: Jenny green Jelly, Thai iced tea and Bob milk tea.

Altogether a wonderful lunch meal, albeit too much good food and we had to take home the delectable soup for later!

We will surely come back with friends next time!
