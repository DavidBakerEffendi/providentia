My partner and I have been coming to this Indian food store since we moved to AZ about a year ago. They always have what we want and need. They may not be totally consistent with what they have in stock, but I have no issue with trying new things! Plus, whenever I ask for suggestions for things to try and make, the owner ( I'm assuming ) is always willing to offer advice with a friendly smile! We love being able to walk around the store and see the different sorts of goods. We will continue to support this business happily! 

It's nestled in a random plaza with not much else around it. There's hardly ever anyone else in the shop - makes it easier to find what I want and need.

We used to live in Boulder. We shopped at one of the few Indian stores in town. We thought that we were getting a good deal - until we realized that the owner of that store charged us different prices for the same things each time we went there. We have not had any issue (and hope it stays that way) of that sort at Apna! 

I definitely recommend this store!
