If you don't feel comfortable wearing a hat with an obscene message on it and calling your waiter an ass hole and  telling him to bring your damn coke right now, then don't go here. The whole point is that everyone here is a dick... at Dick's Last Resort. 

This place is a blast if you realize its all in good fun. My friend picked a fight with the waiter before she knew he was a waiter. As the night went on he gave us all personalized paper hats with obscene comments... my group's hats read as follows: 
"Blah blah blah, just put it in my butt." (mine, because I didn't say much)
"I haven't seen my penis since fifth grade." (for my larger bf)
"Ask me about my DSL's" (my smart ass friend)
"Puberty sucks" (for my 22 year old asian friend who looks 14)
"I masturbate to Justin Timberlake videos" (my metrosexual looking friend)
and the ladies next to me had one that was great too... 
"Dr. Phil makes me moist" and "Ask for my number, I'm easy."
You have to wear the hat the whole time or they give you hell. 

The bartender put on a show behind the bar that was both hilarious, poetic, and obscene, including water and opera singing. 

The group behind us had a birthday, and a fat guy with an afro gave the birthday girl a lap dance. He was so over the top. He even had a thong sticking out of his shorts (whale tail on a guy is funny!)

The food was good. There were big portions and it was fairly cheap for food on the strip (about $15 a person plus drinks). They served buckets of beer which I thought was cool. 

I went in thinking this was going to be an obnoxious experience, but came out laughing.
