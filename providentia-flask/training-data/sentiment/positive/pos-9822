I had the pleasure of being invited back back the RH team to dine with a guest and wow- what an experience it was. Not only are the staff and waiters extremely attentive, but everybody was just so nice! Our waitress was extremely personable and even went the extra mile to continually clear our table as we finished our food and drinks. 

The appetizer (we got the triple creme cheese) came out extremely promptly and was a nice segway to our entree which took a little longer to prepare. I ordered the Ribeye French dip sandwich and it was just amazing. It comes with a little hot pepper on the side (be warned- I thought it was a regular bell pepper!!) that really compliments the salty savouriness of the sandwich. My sister got a side of fries which tasted delicious and I got a very fresh salad on the side. We ended our meal off with the in house made chocolate chip cookies. I kid you not. These are the best freaking cookies I've ever had in my life and I will make it a habit to always come back and grab some to go whenever I come to Yorkdale!! 

Overall, I had an amazing second experience at RH. The ambience is beautiful but its the staff and food that really make it stand out from the other restaurants at Yorkdale.
