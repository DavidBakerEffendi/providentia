Oh my, oh my, oh my!  What's not to love about Sticky Iggys?  Hired Iggy to come to LVA, surprise my daughter for her birthday and feed the cast of the show she's rehearsing. 30 hungry teenagers!  Everyone raved about the food!  The burgers, waffle dipped chicken, fries...delicious, quick and big servings!  

Find this truck and eat up!!
