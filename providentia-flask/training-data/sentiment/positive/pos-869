Cute and creative little place in one of my favourite Toronto locations. 

Huge selection of board games for only $5! Friendly staff who even helped us choose a game, and then taught us how to play it. 

Came here with some friends as we were wandering the area, and we will definitely be back! :)

I wish they would add more to their menu, because a quiche just doesn't satisfy the hunger. 

And in terms of wait time, my suggestion: go early, and give them your name and number, and just hang out in the area until they call you. So many things to do around here, the wait won't be so bad! :)
