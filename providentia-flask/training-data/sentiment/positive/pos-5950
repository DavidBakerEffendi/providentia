1 word....AMAZING.  It was my birthday and my husband surprised me with reservations.  I had the aged bone-in ribeye and my hubby had the bone-in fillet.  We shared the cheesy potatoes and corn.  We are still talking about how wonderful the corn is.  It is a must!  Sounds crazy, but believe me....get the scalloped corn.  Caesar salad was good....nothing to write about as the Steak is the "Star" of the night.  This is not a place we could eat at on a regular basis, even though we would like to due to the price.  But I must say, between the food and the great service, it was worth every penny.  Love!
