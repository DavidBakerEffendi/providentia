Wow, this place is great! I ordered the heirloom tomato salad and the vegetarian pizza. My uncle who dined with me ordered stuffed mushrooms and tilipia. Everything was extremely tasty and the service was great. It is a very small little place, so I had made reservations. The menu has interesting salads, apps, main dishes, and the wine was delicious as well, although I'm not sure what it was.  The chef actually comes to speak to each customer about the wine and dishes. I love this place, and it helps that it's in my apartment building!

My second visit included the white bean appetizer, which is apparently new. I wouldn't say I loved it, but it was unique. There were warm greens, with onion and white beans, bread with hummus, and cold white beans with green beans and red peppers. It's totally vegetarian but just OK.  I tried the margherita pizza this time, and of course the crust is satisfying again (tasty heated up again in the toaster oven). The vinegar on the pizza was a delicious touch. I only had one piece of pizza, since we also shared the tilapia that comes with shrimp risotto. The risotto was much better than I expected with a coconut flavor and the shrimp were cooked correctly with a lot of spice. The tilapia was as flavorful and properly cooked as before. The web site LocalDines provides gift cards for the Centurion - pay $25 for a $50 card - nice!

Do note that since it is a tiny restaurant, you will smell like restaurant and food and cooking upon leaving, unless you choose to sit outside.  It's not a bad thing if it doesn't bother you, but it's something that is hard for me to ignore!
