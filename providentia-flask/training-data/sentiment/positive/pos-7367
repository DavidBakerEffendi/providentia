I am SO impressed with The Farm!  We've visited a few times and decided to stop in for lunch.  The Farm Kitchen is a quick, walk up to order lunch spot with a large amount of outdoor seating.  We ordered sandwiches which were delicious along with a few pastries for later which did not disappoint.  The ingredients they use are extremely fresh and the quality is top notch.  This is definitely a new favorite spot and cannot wait to return!
