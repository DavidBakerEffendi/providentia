Even Stevens is an instant hit!  I feel that the owner Michael did everything right.  He seemed to be very excited and extremely friendly to everyone that attended.  I took a picture of the menu, and I love how it is not overwhelming with items to a point where it's hard to choose the right meal.  In my case, I chose the pot roast dip sandwich and omg!! It was very delicious.  Usually when I eat toasted bread it slices my gums up. But this bread was baked to perfection for people like me!  It crumbled perfectly and was very flakey and easy to eat.  I read that it had jalapeño jelly but didn't expect it to pair so well.  It was amazing and I want another one just thinking about it!  They also had, probably the best cookie I've ever eaten, jelly in the center and a peanut butter cookie - so amazing!

They had a vendor/partner there that actually made the jalapeño jelly for the pot roast dip sandwich.  Her name was Amanda and they have been making jellies and jams in her family for years, actually a secret recipe that her grandma came up with (Cotton Country Jams) - amazing.  The honey jalapeño was very tasty as well. 

Lastly, another vendor explained how special their batch of coffee was because it came from her own family's farm in Brazil.  I've actually seen this brand before but never knew too much about it.  Her name was Julia and she was extremely sweet and very knowledgeable about her coffee.. I definitely look forward to grinding these beans up and making some authentic Brazilian coffee.. (PEIXOTO coffee)

All in all I had an amazing night, I love the openness of Even Stevens, and will definitely come back for more.  Thank you to all of the staff there for the invite:)
