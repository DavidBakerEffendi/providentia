Here's another one of my Vegas favorites. A great place for a first date or taking friends from out of town. The ambiance here is simply one of a kind. 

More neon, mirrors, and red velvet than you can shake a stick at! Oh and the video screens everywhere with cool 80's videos, those are great. 

If you can, get a seat next to the water feature with flames ripping out of it, it's a little warm but pretty cool. 

I've never actually eaten in the restaurant but the food in the lounge is pretty tasty. The selection is standard bar fare. 

The cocktails are not the cheapest in town but they're pretty good, and delivered by sexy ladies. The super sized scorpion is good for a group. 

Some of my best nights have ended here. Skip the other late night eateries and head straight for the Peppermill!
