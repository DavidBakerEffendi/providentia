BEST PIZZA, Mr Biaggio and his son are always very friendly, make sure everyone that dines in or take out is well taken care of...they makes you feel like your part of their family. 

I would recommend the The Works, All Meat or the Art of Chicken Pizza but don't stop in just for Pizza try their Chicken Wings....THE BEST WINGS, love all their salads and you can't go wrong ordering any of their Pasta dishes too. The Meatballs and Sausage are made in house soo goood. 

If your not stuffed after all that try the Fried Dough or Zeppole! :)
