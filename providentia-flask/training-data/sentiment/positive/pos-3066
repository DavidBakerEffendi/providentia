If you are hungry, come here.  Gina and Russell have a great set up.  We have been coming here for at least 15+ years.  We are never disappointed in the food.  The portions are always huge.  Side dishes are brought to your table to munch on until the food arrives.  Always a good mix of side dishes.  And you can have as much as you want.  The service is a little slow at times, but the food makes up for that.  We rarely give out 5 stars, but consistency wise, this place deserves it.  Will definitely go back, and highly recommend the combo plate.
