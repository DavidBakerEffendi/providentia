It was my families first time here and it won't be our last! 
They offer a "gluten sensitive" menu which is a bonus for my daughter and me. 
I opted for the Tex Mex salad which is huge and delicious. It has real chunks of chicken, avacado, black beans, corn, cheese and some tortilla strips along with a delicious chipotle ranch ( which I am told is made in house) and BBQ sauce. My daughter ordered salmon, smashed potatoes and fruit which was a HUGE slice of watermelon. 
The children's menu had the normal offerings and a few extras. My son opted for a burger and fries. He had no complaints. 
My husband ordered the curried tuna which was served over a mashed cauliflower. The cauliflower was so creamy one would think it was potatoes. The tuna was prepared exactly how it was ordered which is nice. 
My middle daughter, the big eater, ordered the chicken pot pie. It was huge and the crust appeared to be very flaky yet held its shape when she peeled it off. Inside held large chunks of real chicken and fresh vegetables. She devoured the whole thing! 
Our waitress, Denise, was great. She kept our drinks full and checked on us even though she seemed busy.
