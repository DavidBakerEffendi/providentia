I've eaten here a few times and have had a great experience each time.  The wood fired pizzas are great for a main dish and they're also great as a shared appetizer.   The pasta I have ordered was cooked perfectly (al dente) and the main entrees all were fantastic.  I would also recommend trying a few of their dessert choices.  The zeppoles, while not the same that I used to get off the street in New York, were fantastic and the cannolis were great to share with the table.
