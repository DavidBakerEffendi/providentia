I used to work at Child Support downtown on E 17th and Superior. Sometimes I would want to grab corned beef sanwiches. I would also eat breakfast at the original Danny's Deli on St Clair. I went here with my dad yesterday for lunch. The corned beef is great. This place is owned by the same family that owns Slymans, Joe's Deli etc... I think it is hard to find much variance in corned beef and think the Slyman's thing is a bunch of hype. I have had bad corned beef before but not at any of the above listed spots. They have good breakfast also. I highly recommend Danny's Deli.
