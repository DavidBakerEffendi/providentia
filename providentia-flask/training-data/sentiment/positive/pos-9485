Brand spanking new Starbucks with a drive through. Love it. Not a lot of parking though (and sometimes the customers tend to take up more than their fair share if space... I was in yesterday and 2 high schoolers had sprawled across 5 spaces and had their feet up across other benches. Really?!?) But this loc is just fine. You know what you are getting when you come to a Starbucks and this one is just like the last one. And the next one. It's bigger , the people are friendly , coffee is good and the drive thru makes it more convenient.
