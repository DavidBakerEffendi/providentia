Tropical Smoothie Cafe has always had amazing smoothies and food. I started going there about 3 or 4 years ago at a different location and after they closed they opened up a location near to me. They have a variety of smoothies and food that is used with ACTUAL fruit, not the fake stuff. They usually fill you right up because of the size and there is always amazing flavor in your smoothie. My favorite is the Orange Dream.
