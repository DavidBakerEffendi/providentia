Remeber the movie Mystic Pizza with Julia Roberts? They has some secret ingredient in the pizza that made is so so so tasty. I swear there is something in this pizza that makes it so good. I love this place and dont think I will ever eat pizza anywhere else. The lunch special is insane. They give you a slice of pizza that is equal to about 4 slices anywhere else.  PS. It is really small but they have a few tables outside.
