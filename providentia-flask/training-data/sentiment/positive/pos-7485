Amazing! I ordered the vegetable yellow curry to go and I couldn't be happier! It was honestly the best yellow curry I've ever had. Plus their serving size of curry was HUGE and I was able to make one order last 3 days worth of lunch! Thai food is easily one of my favorites and I've tried so many Thai restaurants in Vegas and this one is my new favorite!
