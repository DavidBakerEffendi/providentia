I love this place! They seriously have the best guac in Charlotte, and I've never ordered anything that wasn't really good! My friend and I went there for her birthday earlier this week and the server overheard me telling my friend Happy Birthday when we were sitting down. She brought my friend a birthday dessert after just overbearing that it was her birthday, and I just thought that was so nice that she went above and beyond to do that!
