Before arriving to Toronto, I just wanted a place with really good breakfast oatmeal and it sure was my best one here. My friend recommended the croissant breakfast which I happily accepted and it was mind blowing. The texture of the croissant stands out the most for me. Will be back the next time I am in town.
