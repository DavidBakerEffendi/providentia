Love this place, be sure to call ahead and make reservations because it is small and they're always full. 

They do have gluten-free pasta so ask, I had the rotini with red sauce, it was cooked perfectly.

For starter we split a spinach with portobello mushroom and cream sauce, the  flavors were so amazing, creamy yet pungent.

For the main dish we ordered the half chicken, baked to a crisp, so delicious it was herbed and aromatic.

The restaurant is nostalgic of this ma' and pa' places in New York
