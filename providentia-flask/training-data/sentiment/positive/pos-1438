I love this cafe! I'm a faithful servant to the Perfectly Grilled Cheese. This place should win some serious awards. And don't be scared off by the fact that it is a sit down restaurant, your food will be ready in literally 10 minutes. Everything here is cooked to perfection and the service is good too. Definitely stop here for lunch and have a sandwich, I won't even be offended that it's not the grilled cheese...everything is good here! P.S. The sweet potato fries are bomb too!!
