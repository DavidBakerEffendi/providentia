Love, love, love Nate's. Expecting great things based on the Yelp reviews, we tried Nate's for the first time on Saturday and were not disappointed. Our hostess was so friendly and gave her recommendation of what we should order as first-timers. We went with the felafel plate, stuffed grape leaves, half plate of hummus, and fattoush. We shared it all and it was the perfect lunch for two. All of it excellent. And the bill at the register? A tiny $19.87. Can't wait to go back.
