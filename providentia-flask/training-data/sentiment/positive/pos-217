I love Mexican food in fact I loved Mexican food so much I married a woman (back in 2007-2010 been free of the shackles for 6 years now) of Hispanic origin (Mexican). She cooked really good Mexican food but let me tell you this place is right up there in terms of authentic taste! The vibe you get when you walk in and the layout makes it feel authentic as well! Their horchata's are sweetened just enough to make you want more! Their chicken enchiladas...man don't let me get started I'm hungry now just thinking about it! All I can say is that if you read this review and you're not already on your way to the restaurant to try it out then you need to reevaluate your priorities! Juan's is the epitome of authenticity!!!!
