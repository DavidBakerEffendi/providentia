They had me at #38 ! Comes with carrots and broccoli  eggs your choice of protein and the thin flat noodles (my fav ) medium spicey  and add pineapple for a touch of sweetness!!!! We went here after realizing our favorite joint was not open and this place didn't disappoint! Service was prompt and food came out piping hot. Waitress was super friendly and paid no mind to our odd requests ! We will be back again !
