Pretty sure I just had a spiritual experience here. I work right around the corner from this place and can't believe it's been open for months and today was the first time I've tried it! Stopped in for lunch with my coworker and I'm pretty sure he'll be returning for dinner. 

An Indian version of Chipotle may not seem like a big deal but the entire concept of the restaurant is really what puts it at a 5-star level. 
The menu is easy to order from, with not too many choices, but enough to please everyone in your group. It's also a non-intimidating menu for those in your group who may not be as familiar with Indian food. 
The restaurant itself is extremely clean and they have large glass windows looking into the kitchen so you can watch the magic happen. There's also a fun hand-washing jacuzzi to make sure you're hands are clean and ready for your meal. 

I ordered a plate with chicken tikka masala and a wheat naan with a chocolate truffle for dessert (oh yes!). My food was excellent, the tikka masala came on the side so I could add as little or as much as I wanted to my bowl with chicken and rice. It also came with a side of hot sauce so I could spice it up as I wished (the tikka masala was pretty mild to start with). The truffle was only $.99 and worth every penny. It will be hard to go back there and NOT order one. 

Great food, great price, great service, great atmosphere. I'd love to see this place expand and open up more locations!
