I've never been into subs  but my coworker got me into it. 
I ordered beef sate and it was $6 with tax
Now this deli is just strictly takeout...their menu is simple...really small place...
You have a little place to order small place for them to work in they only take cash.
The bread is freshly made everyday. 
They put lots of meat and they put peanut...so make sure you tell them how u like your sub...
The flavour is so good...Lolita worth the $6 ... they also have chicken assorted veggie 
The place itself is outdated but it doesn't matter they are clean and good food.
