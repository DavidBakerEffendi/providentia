Only updating because I tried a different dog and a baby size mini dog lol.

I tried the spicy link dog, I forget the exact name, but it was the opposite of spicy.  I couldn't find anything spicy there at all...taste like a regular hotdog.  I won't ding them for that though, because although it was not spicy, it was still good.  I have to try the "dragon" one next time...my friend mentioned it was spicy.

The baby size hot dog was a cool idea.  I think it only cost about a dollar, but a cool way for the baby to have some without having to share or make us buy an entire hotdog to go to waste.  Look for it if you have a kid with a small appetite.

Again, a solid hotdog...can't really beat it for the price and quality.
