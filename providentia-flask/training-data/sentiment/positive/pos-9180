I never realized how much my grandparents made food very close to this.  They were from the mainland of North Portugal.  Most of the food there is Greek influenced there.


This place brought lots of great memories back for me.  Freshly cooked to order right in front of you.  I went with a $6 small chicken and rice bowl without tomato sauce (tomato allergy).  My boyfriend had a $7.50 regular gyro (hero) about half way through he was getting full!  I tried the meat in his gyro and it was amazingly tender.  My chicken was very tasty and flavorful.  The cooked veggies were taking in the flavor of the grill and it was great. I don't normally eat my veggies but I'm trying to eat more greens.

I swear this food tastes just like my grandpa's cooking. Staff and owner are super friendly and accommodating too. I wish it wasn't so far from Summerlin but if we are in the area, I would go out of my way to stop thru for a healthy choice again.
