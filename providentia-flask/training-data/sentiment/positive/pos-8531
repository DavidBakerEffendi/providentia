With all the amazing restaurants  in Las Vegas I often overlook Roy's. But I returned tonight and I now remember why I love this place so much.  Roy's is amazing, the service, the food quality and the beautiful presentation. The fish is fresh and cooked to perfection. 

My recommendation is the butter fish (which is really black cod).  Its fresh, firm and melts in your mouth.  The salt and pepper calamari is light and flavorful and not over breaded. The sushi rolls are well made, a satisfying size and flavorful. 

The presentation is picturesque and visually appealing.

The service is top notch.  Efficient, friendly and unobtrusive.  My water glass was never empty, my plates were cleared promptly and my every need was met.

Their Birthday service was an unexpected and exceptionally pleasing surprise.  Each menu featured a special page with my name on it.  The staff later presented me with a copy to take home.  They brought out a special birthday dessert with my  name and Happy Birthday written on the plate in delicious chocolate. They then took a picture of me and my guest, printed it, framed it and gave it to me! Hands down the BEST birthday dinner and birthday treatment I have ever experienced!

I absolutely cannot wait to return to this wonderful dining establishment .  Do yourself a favor and make your reservations today!
