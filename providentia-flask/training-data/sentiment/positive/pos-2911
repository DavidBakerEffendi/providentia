Definitely get "genos cheesesteak" comes with a side of some vinegar slightly spicy dressing....without doubt within my top 3 of all time cheesesteaks. Also for good measure I tried a slice of pep....super thin crust but not the crunchy style. Good texture good flavor, I would say this would be new York style.
On a scale from 1-10
Cheesesteak 10
Pizza 7
Service 6 (girl at counter seems to be preoccupied, while looking directly at you she doesn't exactly acknowledge what your saying. It's like she's waiting for you talk while your talking if it makes sense. Not rude just kinda awkward)
