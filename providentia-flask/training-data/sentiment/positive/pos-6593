I would like to revise my review to 5 stars for this restaurant. As I stated in my previous  review I  knew it must have just been a bad day. You know nothing or no one is perfect and sometimes things just happen. There are so many excellent reviews for this restaurant (that's why I stopped in!) and when the owner contacts you and  SINCERELY apologizes it really tells you how much he cares and the pride he has for his restaurant.  I take Yelp very seriously and rely on this valuable tool to choose where I  eat and to share my experiences. I think I just had one of those "I'm not perfect" moments and the first thing I am going to do when I get back to the mall is to eat at Kyklos Greek Cafe again.
