My fave place for brunch! 
I love the hummus trio to share...their chicken salad sandwich...and a bloody Mary...yummo! 
When having out of town guests, this is always our "go to" spot, lots of options and they never disappoint! 
Customer service is just as awesome as the food.
Ohhh...and that butter cake...a MusT trY!!!
