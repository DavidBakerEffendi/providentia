Bellagio Buffet. Wow. So I'm one of those poor Traveller eating easy Food from a gasstove in the Moment, but i love cooking and i enjoy good Food - i just cant afford it. I'm used to High Standarts, but not a Star chef demander. If you're a "normal" Person, and i say i loved it, you will at least like it a lot. 
We sneaked in at 2,45, payed lunch price (27usd each) and got the Dinner Buffet. I had 8 plates, there were things i didn't like, or didn't find Specials, and there were things that I would have begged for, i could bath in. The Prime rib, the mushroom Ravioli, the canneloni, the Indian Curry, the yam Mash, the turkey (!), And the blue cheese Dressing, the Olive bread, the nutella- White chocolate Creme tard,...... I found the meats, the pastas and the Desserts in generell really good. Dissapointing was the seafood, don't know why all those asians eat Tons and Tons of those crablegs.. it's just a hint of salt and a Kind of fishy taste.. i was so incredibly Full, wished i had another 3 stomachs to eat more. So Worth it 27 Bucks.
