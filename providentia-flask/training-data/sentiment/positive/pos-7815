Great place for brunch and a Bloody Mary with bacon.  Yep bacon.  Kickback place and you can bring your pet on the patio.

Had the breakfast burrito with my road dog today and it was yummy.  It gets very busy around lunch time so be prepared to wait.  My next endeavor is the chocolate chip pancakes.  I have a feeling that they will be very good.
