I like this place a lot. I always get a veggi burger and onion rings and I've yet to be disappointed. Affordable and clean with a simple menu that's got options for everyone.
I'd say the most impressive part of this location was the manager. Young guy with a full sleeve tattoo not only provided outstanding customer service to every guest but single handily kept the entire restaurant clean at a very busy lunch rush.

This has become my stand bye for a quick meal.
