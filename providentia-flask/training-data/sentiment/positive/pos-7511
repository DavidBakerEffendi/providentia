I gotta say...haven't been to Red Lobster is a while because I've always thought of it to be gross and fattening.  Well to my surprise I got a great grilled salmon lunch with a rice pilaf & broccoli for a reasonable price.  The service was fantastic and I would certainly recommend the Scottsdale location.
