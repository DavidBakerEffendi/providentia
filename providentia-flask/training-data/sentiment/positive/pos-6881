Probably the best value and rooms on the strip.  I have stayed at the wynn 4 times so I know the 5 star benchmark.  Yes the wynn is newer but you cannot beat the rooms at the venetian.  All the rooms have 3 flatscreens including one in the bathroom.  The beds could be a bit firmer but all in all a great value at $119 per night on travelzoo.  The pool is relaxing and I think they have 3 of them.  I was able to get some laps in the latter part of the day and it was great not having to turn around so quickly.  

Definitely would love to see the palazzo rooms after the rates go down.
