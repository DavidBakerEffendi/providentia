This place is so good! I tried it yesterday and went back today for another dose of Even Stevens. I got their Cuban which has a cool fancy name and that was awesome and filling. Then this morning I got the breakfast burrito with bacon and the salsa that is served with it is so good! Their saucy tots or whatever they are called comes with three sauces including a spicy cream cheese which I really liked but steered away from because I had already went overboard. Overall a great place! The one thing I didn't like is that they displayed a $2 side and I was charged $2.95 and then I asked for avocado on my burrito and was charged but didn't receive any. I'm sure they would make it right but it's never fun having to let someone know they fudged up and complain about .95 cents. Just a little downfall for a great place. Enjoy!
