First time to Il Bosco and I was not disappointed. We shared a Calabrese salad and the pizza special. It was a perfect amount of food for two and delicious. The timing of delivering the pizza to our table was great as was the consistency - no soggy middle like you get other places. The proprietor was friendly and helped us make good choices. The spot is cozy and their brick oven catering looks phenomenal.
