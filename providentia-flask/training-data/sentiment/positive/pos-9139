was here for their annual "big taste" (foodie, pre fixe menu event) and loved every dish served. a lot of detail and a lot of very good food pairings. great selection of ingredients used and a lot of care put into every dish. loved the chicken pate with grapefruit. Also been here for their normal brunch menu and was very satisfied with their eggs benedict. a great spot on a small island downtown Calgary on the Bow River.
