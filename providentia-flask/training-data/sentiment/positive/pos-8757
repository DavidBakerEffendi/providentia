Try the pan-fried noodles with beef or chicken-- it's my favorite of all their dishes. The husband can certainly vouch for the Sweet & Pungent chicken, and the customer service is very friendly and personal. I love that they are so busy nowadays during the lunch time-- it's well worth the wait in my opinion.
