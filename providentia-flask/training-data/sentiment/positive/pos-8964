Best sushi I've had in years. Fresh, tons of choices, reasonably priced. We had two rolls, calamari and a side of shrimp tempura for $30 minus tip. Service was prompt and pleasant. Our waitress gave me the check which was funny; took it as a sign it's my turn to buy dinner so I did. The two rolls we had were beauts. Next time, we're getting three rolls and no app. No wait at dinner time. Perfect way to start 2015!
