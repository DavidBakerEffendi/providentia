I'm more of a classic "old school" type of guy so after reading the menu I'm left wondering will what I picked taste any good? And it certainly always does. They really do have some unique pizza flavours. It's definitely not the order in pizza you might be used to, it's usually thin, almost no sauce, but somehow the crust and toppings taste great. Definitely recommend, with family or for a date night, works for either.
