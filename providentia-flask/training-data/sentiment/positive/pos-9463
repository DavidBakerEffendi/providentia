This is the best pizza in Phoenix, no contest.  I've eaten at pizzeria Bianco many times and I will be moving my business to Il Bosco. You can read my review on Grimaldi's and how i stated it was missing something,  well Il Bosco has the "it" factor.  My wife and I dined here tonight and it was just a great, refreshing experience.  The place is on the smaller side, we sat outside which was great.  The menu is very limited but everything on it looked fantastic.  We opted for the Biaggia which consisted of prosciutto, arugula, a fig sauce, a squeeze of citrus, parmesan shavings and goat cheese. The other pizza we split was the special Zita. This was a white pizza with meatballs and carmelized onions.  Both pizzas were phenomenal.  The flour they use is organic so the pizzas are super light and do not sit heavy at all.  The service is also fantastic as both our waiter and the owner checked on us multiple times and were very informative.  Also, the pizzas came out extremely fast, like less than 5 minutes fast. I can't rave about this place enough, it's worth going out of your way for
