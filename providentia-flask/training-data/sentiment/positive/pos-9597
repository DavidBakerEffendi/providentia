I was VERY impressed with this fine establishment.  I am very picky with sushi and this place hit the spot!  Sundays are all day happy hour with great appetizers and drink specials!  

If sushi portions are a big thing to you like it is to me ( I hate paying for sushi that's tiny) this place aims to please!  The rolls were thick (wink wink) and  filled us up!! 

We had the platinum and the El Diablo roll both were sooooo good!  We had appetizers and drinks for happy hour specials!  I will post pics.  The sushi was buy 1 get 1 half off.. wow!  This is definitely a must go to restaurant in the east valley for sure!   I loved it!!!!
