Will be hard to beat this place for a great dog at a great price...

Not only are the dogs juicy and packed with flavor, but the toppings aim for the stars.

Tried the Bulgogi dog, and it was an incredible combination.  I love good hotdogs, and I love bulgogi....(had it last night actually) but when combined, it is a match made well.

My friend and I also shared two orders of fries...everyone said to try the angry kimchi fries or whatever they are called, and the European fries....results?

The kim chee fries were nothing out of the ordinary for me...I am a fan of sweet potato fries, and I absolutely love great kim chee, but the combination of SP fries and kim chee didn't mesh for me.  I still ate it, but it was not mind blowing.  I would see myself eating the items separately, vs together in each bite.

However, that garlic mayo and herb sauce spread onto the European fries?  OMG this was one of the best things ever!  One of my favorite combinations of french fries ever consumed....this was the highlight of lunch!  The pork belly slivers doesn't hurt either!  But trust me, I will order this just for the sauce....amazing!

Prices are pretty fair for the food, and besides my bread coming out slightly hard/stale (not sure if grilled or just old), I have no issues and will be back for more!
