I work super late nights as a server so McDonald's is usually one of my only options. I usually hate McDonald's but every night there is a girl working I think her name is crystal or something, blonde hair, great customer service. Honestly she should be a supervisor because she's too good to be a regular team member. She always gives me the freshest fries! My boyfriend and I actually started liking McDonald's a little because of this location and their night team! Kudos PM shift! Keep up the good work and thanks for the best fries ever!
