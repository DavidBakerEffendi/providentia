The 7 dishes of beef is not only an AMAZING TASTING option, but it also includes a fun activity!  you get to roll the first 4 courses of beef (all delicious btw!) into your own cold rolls with an assortment of pickled cabbage/carrot, vermicelli, lettuce, bean sprouts, basil, mint, cucumber, and sauce! I AM IN HEAVEN!  

It's a great and inexpensive date idea for because it's something delicious AND fun to do all in one! I highly recommend this place for a first date or for someone who's just getting into Vietnamese cuisine. 

The food was incredible and the servers, while not overly attentive, were sweet and helped explain to us how to make the rare beef in the hot pot and how to use the lettuce to make the rolling of the cold rolls easier. I really REALLY enjoyed my experience there and am excited to try the other dishes on the menu!  Only downside is that it closes kind of early but seriously, it's worth trying I am excited to sample their Pho next time I go.
