I've updated my original review to 5 stars:

After an initial bad experience, I stopped in last night and had an excellent coffee (Kenya) on my way to the symphony. It hit the spot and I'm really impressed with Barrique's late hours. 

About me: I've roasted coffee at home for the last 8 years and own two professional espresso machines along with two pro grinders and a lot of other equipment, so it's rare that I find cafes that can prepare coffee on par with what I make at home.
