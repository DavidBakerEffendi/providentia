I have been to the salt cellar for dinner about 8 times. The servers have all been there for a long time. They are so professional and friendly. I almost always order the king crab because the waitress will crack it for me...yummy. last time, I had the halibut cheeks and let me tell you, they know how to make seafood at this place.  I read a few reviews before I posted this and I can't believe ANYONE would ever post anything negative. I have been there during the week, on the weekends, early evening, late night it doesn't matter the service is always superb and the food delicious.
I found one of reviews about the steaks absurd. If you go to a seafood place and expect to get an inch and a half steak. Why not ask the server "are your steaks thick"? Why would you assume that a great seafood restaurant has equally great steaks? 
I will advise that if you want to get in to this restaurant for dinner, make a reservation. There aren't a lot of tables and its very busy. Again, I have never had a meal at the salt cellar that wasn't delicious. I would highly recommend the shrimp san remo appetizer and maybe even the mussels. The king crab legs will not disappoint. Wonderful seafood in the middle of arizona as they have it flown in daily, delish!
