After noting several bad Yelp reviews,I was pleasantly very surprised by my experience here.  I found a starter of Steamed Mussels to be very good, accompanied by moist and flavorful Garlic Bread that nicely deconstructed when dipped in the mellow and tasty broth. An included salad from a tossed salad bowl was quite generous in size and featured mixed greens, tomatoes, and crunchy croutons with a vibrant dressing.  A large helping of Crab-Stuffed Flounder was a great entree that was both moist and very tasty, along with well-prepared Asparagus spears and Spanish Rice.  And I liked that Peach Decaf Iced Tea from The Republic of Tea can be purchased here.  

Meanwhile, one member of my party was pleased with her Cedar Planked Salmon, and Diane enjoyed her order of AYCE King Crab, which is available at $49.99 on Tuesdays.  If you consume enough tender legs, you will get your money's worth.

Service was excellent, with repeated water refills.  And booth seating was quite comfortable.

Surprised or not, I have to call them as I see them.  And, this was a 5-star dining experience.
