This place is amazing. The price is very reasonable and i was amazed that the bus girl took extra precautions when cleaning the tables she was using her phone's flashlight to cleanthe seats and under the tables. I had never seen anything like that in my life.  I ordered a double stscked burger and that was really tasty. I'd recommend this place to everybody
