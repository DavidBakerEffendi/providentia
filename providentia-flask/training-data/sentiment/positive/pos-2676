Love this taco stand, service is fast and courteous and for a roach coach, it's surprisingly clean. Prices are reasonable as well as the portions. Worth every peso!!! Have been eating there for awhile and have never been disappointed. if you've never experienced truly authentic home style Mexican food then this is a must stop aboard the taste bud express
