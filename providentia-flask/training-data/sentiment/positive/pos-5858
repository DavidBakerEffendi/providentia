The only thing I don't like about this place is the name.  The name is a bit cheesy and hard to remember.  

The food was absolutely excellent.  The hummus is heavy on lemon (my favorite) has some texture to it.  The chicken tacos were superb as was the organic apricot ale.  The gluten free chocolate cake was like a large slice of ganache.  

The portions are extremely generous and our server was very helpful.  I just wish I lived a little closer.  :)
