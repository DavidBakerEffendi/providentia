Moqueca Mista (all the waiters/waitresses will say that is their fave lol) & the Salmon are my go-to's. Of course, you have to try the asparagus with the truffle aioli as an appetizer. We are regulars here, and as regulars, the chef likes to treat you with special meals! This time we had kobe beef tacos (i am pescetrian, so it was nice to look at, haha) as our meal. I also love their rolls, such as the Carnival roll. The red miso is also great, I LOVE truffle, but it was a little too salty (truffle oil). The desserts are to die for, such as the mini doughnuts in the hazelnut sauce and the funky banana dish. AND, best of all... it's a stones throw from BARNEY'S!!! You can shop while you wait for your food! But, its not like the food takes very long anyway :)
