My favorite place of the year!  Outside of the "box" food wise. I have tried almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed by anything. The tonkatsu (sp?) is by far my favorite. I sub the pork belly for the spicy ground pork instead. The shishito peppers are amazing but very spicy. Best to get them early in the season of when they grow because they seem less hot then. The food is local, the pottery is local, and the environment is super friendly but modern at the same time. Love it!
