This coffee shop has all the components of a great place for a cup of joe.  Friendly staff, great coffee, comfortable seating, plentiful wi-fi, and an altogether cool space (half art gallery and half coffee shop).  Go here after breakfast at Matt's, or just to get a few things done if you're in the city!
