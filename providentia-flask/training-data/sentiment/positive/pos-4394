We walked in at about 8:30 PM on a Monday. We got a high table by the window immediately. We ordered the tapas platter for 2 - really delicious shrimp, pretty good pork slider and chicken satay, the beignets were uniformly unliked. The beef crostini was excellent - the favorite of everyone at the table. The french onion soup was surprisingly excellent for being vegetarian. We fought over it. One of us ordered a mahi panini which was really excellent as well. Our waiter was personable, friendly and really attentive. The manager came out and served our food and was making the rounds in the restaurant. Just a really, really pleasant experience with excellent food - we were impressed with how reasonable the drinks were priced too. We would definitely go back here again! Also, Hilary Duff sat next to us with her hubby. LIFE WIN.
