I know what all the fuss is about. I've been frequenting 3 of the locations for the past 10 yrs. And to me they are one of the best "different" sandwich places out there. I don't think I'll ever go to a Subway again ~ talk about generic.

These are, to me the freshest, quite unique sandwiches. And NO, I don't know the owners or have any connection to the place other than going there and never having a problem. Correction~ only once did I have a sandwich that had a bit dried out baguette. The problem was corrected immediately and even got another free cookie and drink to boot. And over 10 yrs time to only have the one problem I'd like to hear about anyone else who can say that about any other sandwich shop. I also love the choices of iced tea, though occassionally they are out of my favorite, and more is brewing, but I don't always have time to wait.

I would believe that if business was enough, they would stay open later hours. I just don't think they would have enough business after their closing time of 3pm to justify staying open later. And yes, I've been there after 3pm, momentarily forgetting, wishing they'd still be open.

Other than that, I'd say if you want a good, fresh, different type of sandwich, Sacks IS the place to go!

**I used to like Dilly's Deli, but they really skimped on the meat in some of their sandwiches the last few times I had been there.**
