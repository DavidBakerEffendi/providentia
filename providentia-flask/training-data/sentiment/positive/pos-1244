We noticed this place while driving down Craig. Based on the yelp reviews, decided to try. The service was excellent! Very friendly! 
Food came out quickly. All was prepared & cooked perfectly!  I had chicken finger meal with a chocolate peanut butter shake. Hubby had the chicken sandwich. We didn't leave a single crumb. Shake was thick & just the right amount of chocolate & pb taste. I loved the sauces! 
I really hope word gets out about PDQ because this is a great place & would love to see it be a success! Definitely would go back again & again!
