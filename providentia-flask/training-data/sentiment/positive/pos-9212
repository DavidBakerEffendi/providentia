Amazing free entertainment in Vegas. Great to see day or night. The shows ply more frequently at night than they do during the daytime. Surprisingly finding a good spot to view the dancing water show on the strip isn't hard as crowds flow continuously throughout the area. Love the mix of different genres of music that they adapt the shows to.
