Came in with my boy DJ Circle to have the "Chef Special".....apparently reserved for friends and not on the menu! Mike the chef brought us the BBQ Rib pulled sandwich with slaw. Amazing. I don't even eat slaw typically. Next we had the "Picnic Sliders"....fried chicken sliders. Yes. Last we had the "Mandingo Burger". This looked like it was off of Man vs Food. Today....man won!! I didn't even know this place had food like this. Definitely coming back!! Thanks mike!! Compliments to the chef!!
