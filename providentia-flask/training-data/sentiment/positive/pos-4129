Word's clearly gotten out about this place as it's impossible to get in and out for lunch inside of an hour.  You're usually waiting in line for a good 10 minutes, and then you're waiting another 15-20 for your food... BUT IT'S SO WORTH IT!!!!!!!  They are currently remodeling the place, so it's a little tough to get around.  I can't wait to see the final product.  Their food is so good, I can't even think of words to describe it.  The meat is expertly seasoned, smoked, and prepared.  Their menu is extensive, even featuring all day breakfast.  They offer a great selection of sauces to meet every BBQ aficionado's desires.  I was here on 10/05 with a friend from work, and the general manager spent time chatting us up about the upcoming changes.  SUPER nice guy; I was impressed at how he seemed genuinely interested in hearing what we had to say, not to mention the passion with which he talked about his business.  He even poked into the kitchen to grab me a sample of one of the meats that was being prepared.  Good BBQ can be found just about anywhere, but this stuff is exceptional.
