I'm giving Tott's an unabashed five stars. Honestly, this place has always been such a pleasant surprise. The food is consistently delicious - way better than you'd expect from a "fast food" Chinese establishment.

I've spent WAY too much time on the hunt for decent Chinese food during my time in AZ (about three years now), and have yet to find anything rivaling Tott's except for one place aaaaaaall the way up in Cave Creek.

That said, Tott's is about half the price of its closest competition and MUCH more conveniently located. They work fast, their service us always spot-on, and the food is always really really good (especially the Orange Chicken!).

I've never once eaten in, to be honest. I treat Tott's as my go-to take-out Chinese, even though I'm driving 20+ minutes to get there. (The fact that I'm driving so far for take-out Chinese should be pretty telling!)

If, like me, you're generally sad about the state of Chinese food in the state of AZ, give Tott's Asian Diner a try. I'm pretty certain you won't be disappointed. I never have been.

Thanks, Tott's, for being so awesome! See you again real soon!  :)
