Oreganos is our weekly spot. We have gotten to the point where the servers know us, and it truly is an amazing joint. You will always receive great service, and great food. Esteban & Chris are probably some of the best servers we have ever had anywhere! Amazing atmosphere & place. The Alfredo in the dark is amazing, it comes with a roasted jalepeno on top and we have it removed. The big rig is also killer! From the pizzas, pastas, apps and salad, theres not a dish that isnt amazing!
