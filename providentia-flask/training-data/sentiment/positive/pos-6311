My favorite bbq was Don & GGs in Ironwood, MI (and it is still worth the 5 hour drive from Madison); however, they only have ribs. That BBQ Joint is the  best and most versatile. I've tried the ribs, brisket, whole chicken, and some special items. Tonight, it was the signature sandwich, TBJ, along with the Italian Beef and Chicken Wings. All three were superb. The wings were smoked to perfection and needed nothing but the rub. The TBJ is a version of the Cuban and the homemade mustard sauce mixed perfectly with with the meats--the panini bread was crisp and added to the overall texture. The Italian Beef (I went with mild peppers) was incredible. Perhaps the best roast beef that I have ever tasted. The bread stood up to the au jus so that utensils were not needed. 

For the mainstays, the homemade sauces are incredible, but try the food without the sauce first just to allow the rub to shine. 
The sides are all well done as I have had them, but the meats are the stars.
Pricing is very fair and reasonable and you can sample with single ribs and chicken wings. A great addition to the neighborhood and Madison's food scene.
