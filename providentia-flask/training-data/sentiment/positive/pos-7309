What a gem!!!  I wish I could give them 10 stars!  My second time eating here this week (Lunch and Dinner) and tomorrow will be the third!  Every menu item has been magnificent and thoroughly enjoyed, particularly the bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese crumbles and for dessert?  None other than The Tahitian Pearl!  The menu is all-inclusive, and boasts a nice variety for even the pickiest of diners!  The owner occasionally walks around to display other dishes so you can take a peek!  How entertaining is that?  

The restaurant is decorated beautifully, booths and tables, as well as outside dining, including a gorgeous wine display, walk-in wine cellar and full bar.  Noise level is great--you can actually hear and carry on a conversation with the people you are dining with!  Imagine that!  Even the bathrooms are tastefully decorated with lovely soap and lotion - and the trash is conveniently placed near the door!  Now THAT's attention to detail!  I'm looking forward to trying more menu items and being a regular here!  

Run, don't walk to Bodega 13!!!
