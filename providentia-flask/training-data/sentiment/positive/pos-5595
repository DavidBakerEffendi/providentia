Hooray...they reopened!!! We drive past many  mexican restaurants just to get Super B's fajita burrito! This burrito has such a great flavor with  lots of fresh peppers and onions (clearly not frozen) with your choice of meat. The employees are really friendly too. So glad they are back in business.
