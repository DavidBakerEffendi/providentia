Best fast food. I'm from the east coast originally and when I moved out west this place instantly became my favorite place to get fast food. I don't usually get fast food often but when I do it is at in-n-out. Animal style is amazing and if you want to be healthier you can get it protein style (lettuce instead of buns). If you are visiting from the east coast or mid-west you have to try in-n-out at least once! This location is great for me because its close to my house. 

The service here was also good. There was a young man there who made sure we were enjoying our meal and took our garbage away when we were done. I thought this was really nice because I usually take the trash out myself and it was nice of him to do it for us.
