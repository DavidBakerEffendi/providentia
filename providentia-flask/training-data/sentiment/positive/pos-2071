I had the Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffles and loved it! The chicken was amazing! The spice level was right on point and the skin was perfectly crisp. The waffle was cooked to perfection and wasn't dry like a lot of waffles I've tried at restaurants so that was a very welcomed surprise. This is without a doubt the best chicken and waffles I've had in AZ and is one of the top chicken and waffles and Nashville Hot Chicken I've had anywhere. You NEED to come try it if you're a fan of hot chicken and/or chicken and waffles (they have normal chicken and waffles for those that don't like the heat)
