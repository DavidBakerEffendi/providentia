Location is great - tucked away and not in the midst of all the clubby scenester areas. The wine selection is pretty decent. The salads are awesome. The pizza is fantastic as well - light and artisan style with great ingredients. The best part is possibly the dessert - decadent and delicious. If you leave here and don't have the dolce, you're a crazy person.

This is a sweet spot to take a date or to meet someone for lunch instead of Oreganos. I like their wine list - particularly the reds. I've meant to pick some up to take home since they have a retail price as well. 

This review is revised as of May 2008. Originally, I had reviewed this and talked about the owners splitting up and all that shit and I had given it a 4 star rating. I think I was feeling peer pressure with that score. I personally feel this is a great restaurant in a great area.
