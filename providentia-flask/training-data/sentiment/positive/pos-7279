This is a really great place. I went for lunch with a friend and the place was empty, so the food and service was very fast. 
I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries; it was so good! The "bacon" didn't do much, but the burger itself was really delicious. I was impressed. 
I'd recommend this to anyone trying to find vegan alternatives. It tastes exactly like other pub food. I can't wait to go back and explore other options on their menu.
