My wife and I have made it a recent tradition to try and surprise one another on/around our birthdays. My wife knows I love Japanese food and picked shin bay to celebrate my 32nd a few weeks ago. She did well...

This place is small, unassuming, and tucked into the strip mall across from the train park. Reservations are a must as there are very few tables and it's a very popular place. Service was great and the food...oh the food.

I won't do the food any justice in this review. I will do my best. We did a 4/5 course tasting menu. 

First course: a crudo (Black Sea bass maybe?) in a sauce of ponzu, grape seed oil and what I imagine unicorn tears to taste like. Every bite had savory, citrus, salty, and slight fishy flavor. Absolutely amazing dish.

Second course: clams in a mushrooms broth. Simple, fresh, delicious. I sipped up all the broth.

Third course: wygu beef strips that you cook on a small hibachi grill. Served with asparagus and a delicious sauce. Another perfect dish.

Fourth course: the sushi course. 6 great pieces. All great.

Fifth course: a Japanese crem brûlée. One of my favorite deserts so this was a nice surprise.

I finished the night with a Japanese whiskey. I'm a bit of a whiskey freak and this stuff hit the spot. Not sure what it was called but our server said it was recommended by the chef. Again, a perfect choice.

All in all this was an amazing meal. It's pricy but for special occasions it was perfect. Something different and absolutely delicious. My highest recommendation!
