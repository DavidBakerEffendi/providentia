So. Good. Everytime.
We're here on Monday nights because of the $5 Burger deal.  Great location for us ( we live near the AJ'S on Central & Camelback Rd.) and our 4 children.  Everyone gets a burger, however they would like it, maybe a soft drink if it's not too late and the tab is often less than $50 for the 6 of us.  The only drawback is finding parking some evenings, not that big of a deal though.  Try it, you'll love it.
