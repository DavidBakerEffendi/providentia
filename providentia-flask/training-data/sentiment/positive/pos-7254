So this is a 2 time review! My son and I stopped in here Thursday night and had some hot wings and a beer. We sat outside (it was a cool night) so we enjoyed the fire pit and low key vibe. We had great service from Cassidy. She was knowledgeable about the menu and was so sweet. So tonight when my husband wanted to grab a quick bite I suggested we go back. Tonight we are in the restaurants and had chips and salsa and wings and a burger. We were served by Jayson. He was awesome too! For the food this place is the real deal! It's a hidden gem in chandler! The chips were fresh and crisp and the salsa was delicious! For wings we did a dozen they are meaty, and crisp the Sauce options we went with were kung Pao and chipotle and they were so tasty! Dare I say the BEST wings  I've ever had! My husband did a classic burger. He really enjoyed it too! Do your self a favor and stop in this awesome place oh and check out the bathrooms too! Thanks GM for awesome food and service we WILL BE BACK!
