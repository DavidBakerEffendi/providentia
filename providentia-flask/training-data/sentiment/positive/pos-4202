When I heard that Art of Flavors was closing on February 28th, I realized I had yet to review this beloved establishment. So I started my draft, and at that time, I was hovering between 3 and 4 stars... That was then, and this is now. Let me explain what changed my mind about AoF...

I had lunch plans at nearby Goodwich, and we were planning on having some gelato for dessert. Only there was a slight problem. It was noon, and Art of Flavors doesn't open until 1. 

Chef Desyree, the woman behind all of the amazing flavors, saw us outside her store, looking like someone just killed our pet puppy because we weren't going to get any gelato. She let us in, gave us hugs, let us sample all we wanted and even encouraged us to stay to enjoy what we had purchased.  What a fantastic business woman and kind hearted person she is!! 

I am not going to pretend I am so sort of gelato expert, because I am not. I just know what I like, and I like what I get here. There are always a couple flavors that sounds so strange but end up tasting amazing when I go in, and the classics are perfect. 

Knowing that Art of Flavors is closing soon, and that if it reopens it will be without Desyree, I still debated giving AoF that 5th star. While Art of Flavors knocks it out of the park with regard flavor and service, the ambiance is lacking a bit. The parking situation could be better. "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" isn't really what I comes to mind when I think of this particular location.

But  Desyree? Desyree deserved 5 stars and then some. The woman is a magician when it comes to flavor profiles. I'm not that sad about Art of Flavors closing, ONLY because I know that  Desyree will be back in an even better establishment before we know it, killing it with her gelato creations,
