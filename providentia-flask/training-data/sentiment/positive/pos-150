I first went to Italian restaurant before they had a license to sell any type of alcohol.  It was probably only open a week or 2, but I went with a group of six, and we felt that while the food was OK (3.5 stars at best), after ordering about 6 dishes, none of us were even close to full, and the prices were quite high.  I didn't go back for months because of this.

Recently, a friend told me that the food had changed, and I had to go back and try it, especially for lunch.  I decided to go with a few co-workers, and all of us thought the food was excellent, and the value was apparent.  The 3 dishes ordered were the meatball sandwich, spaghetti with tomato sauce, and cavatelli with sausage and cauliflower.  Every dish was great, and the portions were huge.  It was served with great bread and olive oil, and the service was great.

I went back for dinner a couple of weeks later with 3 of the 6 guests that were at our first foray to Italian Restaurant, and all 3 were skeptical about going.  However, once we got the food, all were very happy that I had convinced them to give it another shot.  We had the mixed grill, which had local sausage and roasted chicken with roasted veggies.  We also ordered 2 pastas, which was more than enough for the 4 of us.  At the end of dinner, the chef sent out a free dessert, which was a cake that was excellent.  

Since I work close to Italian Restaurant, I will go back for lunch at least 2 times a month, which is how often I go to Pane Bianco, which has a couple of my favorite sandwiches in town.
