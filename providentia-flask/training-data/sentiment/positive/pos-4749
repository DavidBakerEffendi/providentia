Definitely my new go-to for gimme-the-heat-sweats biryani!   This place has killer Indian food in a quick casual environment and a wild selection of house-made ice cream flavors that include things like Golkund and Rasamalai...  and are f---king spectacular!

I love bringing the kids here to broaden their palates a bit (if they're gonna try something new, it's sure easier when it's ice cream).
