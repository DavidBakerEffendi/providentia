Went there with family from Europe visiting Canada. Service was a bit disappointing, forgetting the menu orders ... happening 3 to 4 times while ordering with the Ipad. Need some serious improvement when its getting busy especially. Waiters are not friendly. Food are still OK however with lots of competitors arround, service has to be excellent. "Excellent" mean ..no wrong orders, friendly and smiling waiters.
