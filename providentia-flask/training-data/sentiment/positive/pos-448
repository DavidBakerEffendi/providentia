After watching "Food Inc", not only was I nausiated by where the majority of our Meat came from via Chains of Grocery Stores. I also felt the moral currency was far too high (based upon how these animals lived). I've not sworn off meat, but - anyone that watches "Food Inc." can understand my viewpoint.
 Now, down to Business. I had driven past Medium Rare on a number of occasions, thinking it was not a Butcher Shop. Just some shitty steakhouse. Wow. Was I ever wrong.
 First off, even if you're not into the buzzwords of "Organic" "Hormone Free" "Grain Fed" - the products are fantastic! And it's all local, and all of the above. Costs marginally more than you'd pay at No Frills, Loblaws, etc. But considering it is Independent, and everything is Organic, Hormone Free, Grain-fed and Local - it's outstanding value. The Quality is fantastic as well. I used to buy my Steaks exclusively from Bruno's...no more.
