This is one the few spots my dad and I go to regularly. Service here is phenomenally friendly. They make it a priority to keep their guests happy-- if you try something new and don't like it, they'll be more than happy to fix you up with something new (usually free of cost, at least to my experience).
 I recommend the fried guac as an appetizer. It comes on a plate as a decent sized ball of their own guacamole with plenty of chips. The last few times I've eaten here I ordered the avocado sandwich. The pesto in it is amazing! You get an option of coleslaw or fries too; both equally amazing. The coleslaw has apples in it which is a unique and tasty touch. The fries are nice and fat and their ketchup is insanely good with a sweet taste to it. I wanna say they make it themselves bc the consistency is a bit runny compared to others. I've also had the potato tacos, which comes with three filling tacos. 
Make sure you try their baked goods!! Usually all vegan and SO SO tasty!! If they've got lemon bars: do it!
