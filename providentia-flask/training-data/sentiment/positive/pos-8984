Chicken tortilla soup here=heaven

Seriously, this is the best soup I've ever had, & I've had a lot of soup. I am a soup lover. I dream of the Soup Nazi opening up a location in Old Town.

It's been soo cold outside, & then I got sick. All I wanted for my poor throat was soup, so I went to Sonora Mesquite Grill to try the soup. It was so delicious, just spicy enough to have a little heat, but not overwhelm you with a mouth fire. You know what I mean. It was a perfect combination of ingredients, & they even give you lime & tortilla strips to put in it.

I also got a side of the charro beans because they are so good, & I need my protein to get better faster. I didn't go for the carne asada with my sore throat, but I went back again the next day & got the soup again. mmmm
