Can I live here? Consistently amazing service, boozy drinks, awesome decor and the pizza...well, I already changed the name of my unborn child to Libretto Danforth, so yes, I like the pizza. (I used to go to the Ossington location too, but this cheerful, super-friendly, reso-taking outpost has gotten all of my business ever since it opened.)

Here's what to do: bring a friend. Get a red pizza (I recommend the spicy anchovy, $15). Get a white pizza (I recommend the gooey, cheesy mushroom, $17). Get some drinks. Dip everything in chili oil (except the drinks). Feel good to be alive. It's that easy.

NOTE: This is VPN (i.e. authentic circular pieces of heaven via Naples) at its finest, so any reviewer who complains about this pizza either simply doesn't know what he or she is looking for or has grown accustomed to their local fast food chain. But, as someone should tell Ken Ham, it's never too late to learn. The 'za here is not "burnt", guys. It is not "soggy". It's supposed to be exactly the way it is -- delicious.

Also, my second unborn child's name is Libretto Soft Housemade Focaccia, and my third unborn child's name is Libretto Lovely Waitress Who Gave Me More Focaccia To Take Home And I Ate It The Next Day For Breakfast.
