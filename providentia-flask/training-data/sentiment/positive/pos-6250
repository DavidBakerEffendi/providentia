As a native of Ohio I was stoked to find out there was a Caribou in Charlotte-let alone Uptown. Nearly all of the locations up north shut down so I was super excited when I walked past this location on my way to work. 

This location is ALWAYS busy, but they are super fast! A line of 20 will go down in less than 5 minutes, which is great compared to the Starbucks nearby. 

They also offer almond milk and vanilla soy milk on the counter for you to add to your coffee, which is a nice alternative to creamer. Plus they don't charge extra for it. Score!
