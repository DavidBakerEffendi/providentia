Talk about a great menu! Fresh fruit skewers and healthy options like the 'skinny bitch' omelet and the 'super skinny bitch' omelet, I like a restaurant with moxie!They also have banana bread French toast and sweet treats. The bloody Mary's are the bombdiggity! They also have lunch items, you can't go wrong!
