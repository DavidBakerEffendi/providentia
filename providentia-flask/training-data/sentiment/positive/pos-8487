If you're looking for a $5.99, quick, nutritious and delicious lunch special, then this could hit the spot! I finally tried the food counter at Rani's. They have sweets and snacks, but they also have vegetarian lunch thali, a tray filled with savory Indian dishes. It includes rice, dal, and two additional curries, plus it is served with bread. The eggplant curry was definitely the hit of the afternoon with big chunks of eggplant and a perfectly balanced seasoning. It is very informal. You order at the counter, and there are only 4 or 5 tables. After you finish eating, you can do some grocery shopping. We picked up a couple bars of Chandrika! Definitely add this to your list of quick, cheap ethnic lunch delights!
