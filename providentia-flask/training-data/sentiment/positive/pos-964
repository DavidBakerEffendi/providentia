Super fantastic. The burger patty was pink and tasted deliscious. A soft gooey bun and a little cheese to compliment the beef and voila! I love a burger and being from LA I have had some phenomenal burgers. I must say, I will seek this burger out when I go back to Vegas. it is perfect as you can taste the beauty in the beef and it is just magic in it's simplicity. the bar is great and there is a beautiful oyster bar and full menu but I had the burger and if you aren't a small eater like me, and you are a normal woman and especially if you are a man, order sides or order two burgers because they are a little small.
