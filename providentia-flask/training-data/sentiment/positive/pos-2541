Stopped in for a quick lunch. Had the lightly fried chicken sandwich and poutin. It was delicious. The chicken sandwich was light but hardy and the poutin was thin fries with the normal poutin topping. Not heavy at all and hit the spot. Really great lunch and love that everything is made to order and fresh.

Would definetly go back again for lunch!
