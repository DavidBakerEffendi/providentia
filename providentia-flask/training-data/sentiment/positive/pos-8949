I decided to try this restaurant because it was near my doctor's office, and it had great reviews. I was a little startled when I went in, and it was totally empty. I stayed anyway and am very glad that I did. It was delicious! It started off with chips and salsa. When I asked for hotter salsa, he was quick to bring me some. 

I had the Enchiladas de Chili Verde with chicken. They were hot, hot, hot just the way I like it. My meal came with soup, four enchiladas, refried beans, and rice. The enchiladas weren't rolled or flat which is the only way I have had them before. They are folded over like tacos. The beans were black refried beans and delicious. That was the first time I had refried beans that weren't pinto. The plate was large and full of food. I couldn't come close to eating it all.

They have the largest selection of enchilada sauces I have ever seen. Of course, they have the standard options, but they also had sauces like pumpkin seed, black bean sauce, and Japanese peanut. I just wish this place wasn't across town from me. I hope business picks up, so they can stay open. 

My only criticism is that I would have preferred the home made corn tortillas to have been a little thinner.
