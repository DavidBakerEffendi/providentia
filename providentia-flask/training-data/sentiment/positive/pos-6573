My girlfriend and I were searching yelp for a quick breakfast stop and landed here.  I ordered omelet with the bagel and a small coffee. Very affordable! Great value for the money.  And it was delicious.  My girlfriend ordered the sausage breakfast sandwich and really enjoyed that as well. The family is very friendly and wasn't afraid to talk to customers.  Also, as we were leaving, the son offered us free pastries to try and we gladly excepted.  I had the cream cheese filled and my girlfriend had the apple filled. They were both exceptional pastries! We will definitely be back! Always nice to support local business!
