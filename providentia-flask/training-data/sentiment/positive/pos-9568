The parking does not deter us. If you are a first timer, you must find a way... my suggestion is to park at the custard shop  (do not eat that "custard", it will ruin your palette) and run across the street (look both ways and obey all traffic laws plz), ignore the unsavory patrons of the nearby questionable establishments, and find yourself at gelato heaven.
 As soon as you walk in the door of this cozy shop you will be greeted by the angelic creator of the most delicious gelato in LV.
This woman has created works of edible art. The flavor combinations draw people in- from all over town. My sweetie and I were 2 hours outside of LV and read a tip on Yelp that she was serving Panettone gelato. Speeding tickets be damned, we made use of my guys lead foot and sped directly to the shop to get a taste before it was gone. Never mind that we had just been there the week prior. Never mind that we had re-devoted ourselves to healthier eating and less sugar. Let this place be our once a week splurge!
We walked in and were greeted warmly. The kind woman behind the counter  fed me sample after sample and I felt ashamed. Other places cut me off and scold me beyond 2 samples. Not here. She wants me to try what I want, until I happily find a match. I did not tell her I already know what I want, but I am so intrigued by the variety of flavors, they are so different from the week before. What if I don't get a chance to try the sweet corn or avocado next time? And what about the apple cobbler and peppermint, what if they are sold out next time? So she indulges me. 
This woman who runs the shop, the creator of delicious frozen delights that beckon us even on the coldest nights, she seems happy to see her customers happy. She came by our table and spoke to us like we were guests in her home. 

This shop is wonderful on so many levels. 

Enjoy. My tummy and I are happy to have discovered this delightful shop. We look forward to a long and happy relationship.
