We went here several months ago when it was still pretty cold out and had such a fantastic time here. It was our first "cabanes a sucre" experience and was so much fun. The food was surprisingly really good. The service was wonderful. The staff was extremely nice. One lady couldn't speak English and she actually apologized and gave a little hug to my husband who asked for more potatoes and sent an English speaking waitress to him. Ha!  How very sweet was that?

I've never been to a place that put a wine bottle sized maple syrup bottle on the table, but hey no complaints here!  The kids had a blast and ate all their food which tells you how good everything was. The meal included pea soup (so yum...always thought it would be green but theirs was yellow), bread, meatballs, sausages, ham, eggs, baked beans, coleslaw.  For dessert mini pancakes, mini donuts, a sugary pastry ( not sure what it was but was hard coated in pure sugar) and of course sugar pie!!!  

The greatest part was all the space the kids had to expend their sugar high.  They ran and played amongst a maple tree forest and see maple sap in the tin buckets attached to the trees.  In better weather, there's a great space to climb and be up high in the trees for the bigger kids.  The property had a mini pony ride and an animal shed that held goats and turkeys.  Not a petting zoo though so keep those little fingers off the fencing.  Especially those turkeys.  Can't really blame them, can you?  That was really my only gripe --- caged animals.  Although the ponies were super adorable, I wouldn't let my kids ride them round and round in a circle strapped to a pole.  But that's just a personal decision.
