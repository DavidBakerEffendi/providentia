I'll admit, I was a snob. I assumed that Cannery food was only for the drunk, broke, or desperate. 

I was wrong, and happily so. The meal I had was pretty terrific. Service was prompt, attentive, and my filet was one of the most tender steaks I've experienced in a long time. 

Oddly, I would recommend this establishment with all the Cannery caveats.
