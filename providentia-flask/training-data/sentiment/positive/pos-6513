Hoche is one of those rare cafes that makes you feel like you could move into the neighbourhood, because you can see your life revolving around a place like this. Swinging in and out of their door, drinking their coffee and eating their sandwiches. As well as drowning uni sorrows with one of their giant choc chip cookies while you study on their wifi. 
It's like when you meet a new guy who has no visible flaws, and so your mind gets a bit carried away thinking about your lives together.
This. happened. to. me. with. this. cafe.
Tasty food, friendly staff and vibe, unpretentious. No visible flaws.

Now to get the metro back to my actual neighbourhood and step back into reality. There will be other great cafes, I know. But every now and again I will still think of Hoche and their great toasted sandwiches.
