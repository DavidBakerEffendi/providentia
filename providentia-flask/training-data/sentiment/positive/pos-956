This little Italian shop is absolutely adorable. I usually stop in every year during Little Italy Days, but I am planning on visiting much more often. They have a ton of beautiful, unique gifts including dolls, plates, decorations, cooking gadgets, etc. It is incredibly homey & cozy in the store- it feels like you are at your grandmother's house. The coolest part about this shop? There's a complete kitchen in the back! The smell of fresh pizzelles and biscotti overwhelms your senses when you walk in the door. I have tried their cannoli, and pizzelles and love them both. I need to try their biscotti next! They also have a freezer with homemade soups, meatballs, sauce, etc. The employees are so genuine and helpful and last time I visited they informed me they offer cooking classes- which I am really interested in checking out!
