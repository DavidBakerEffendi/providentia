This is THE PLACE to eat in Chandler. My family has been coming here since I was a little kid. Common favorites are the morning monte, the breakfast sandwich, or just their perfect combo platter! They have a great location (near downtown but with better parking), and near the outdoor seating is their neighbors bird collection (it sounds gross, but it totally isn't. And if you don't like birds, it's okay, because they're always about a house away). Sometimes the wait is long, but the trade off for cheery service, amazing noms, and local/small atmosphere makes it worth it :)
