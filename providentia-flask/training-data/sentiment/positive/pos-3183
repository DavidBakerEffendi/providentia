My husband and I absolutely love this place!!! We love it so much that we decided to have our wedding reception here. The food is always...and I mean always so delicious!!! All of our guest at our wedding still talk about the great food we had. We also always have great bar service. The service all around is amazing. The owner Andy is a great person. He walks around from time to time and says hi to his guest. He always makes you feel important and welcomed. Once you experience The Sparkling, you'll be sure to come back and make yourself a regular. Enjoy your meal!
