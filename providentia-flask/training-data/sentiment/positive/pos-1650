One of the prettiest hotels on the street - The Venetian does a tremendous job of transporting you back to Venice without a care in the world. 

My favorites in the Venetian?
1. Tao restaurant (even though I'm not a fan of Asian food - this place blew me away)
2. The boat rides around the hotel
3. The singing
4. The clouds in the sky in the shopping area
5. The extravagant rooms with sofa beds and everything!
6. The extremely pleasant service
7. The ginormous Sephora planted on the ground floor

so my list could really go on and on and on and on and on.......

You just have to experience it for yourself!
