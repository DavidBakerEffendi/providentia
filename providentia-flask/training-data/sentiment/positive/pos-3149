Love this place! Everyone is very nice from the staff to other players.  I've played during the weekday as well as Friday/Sat evenings. Bingo is so fun especially when you win!  They have games 7 days a week.  The facility is clean and organized. I recommend checking this place out.

1st time players can print a $2 coupon from their website.
