The milk tea and their chicken teriyaki box tasted pretty good!  The chicken is really lean and has no skin, either.  This was definitely healthy, too!  

I also love the fact that they have kpop music on tv and posters of kpop stars. 

If you frequent this place for tea, be sure to ask for a stamp card!  

Also, $5 minimum for credit card~ 

Note: Tea drinks are generally sweet, so be sure to ask them to make it less sweet if you don't want a sugar high!
