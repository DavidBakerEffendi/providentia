Probably one of the best mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area. I've taken out of town friends and they love it, as long as they like things just a bit spicy.

The building is kind of a hole in the wall place which adds to the experience. Apparently it used to be a barn or stable... but they did a great job decorating. I don't come here for great service so I don't mind the lack of service. My food has always come quick and my glass stays full of my favorite beverage so I'm a happy camper.

If you are visiting town for one night and want an experience, Los Dos Molinos is a great one!
