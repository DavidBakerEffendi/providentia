Loved it! The best dishes were the special entree of the night truffles pasta and the ricotta on toast. The pasta was very fresh and the pizza crust was amazing. Also really liked the sea bream crudo and the caesar salad. The one disappointment was the strawberry shortcake dessert - thought it was a bit dry.
