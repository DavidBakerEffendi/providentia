As phor as vegetarian pho goes (see what I did there?) in the Brockton/Bloordale area, this is the best I have had yet! The vegetables were fresh and cooked to perfection, the noodles actually had flavor and were not "waxy" like I usually find pho rice noodles to be, the tofu was quality, and the broth was so flavorful. Not at all boring and plain, like I usually find vegetarian pho to be. 

My partner had beef pho, and also said that it was the best he has had in the neighborhood. This is exciting!  

The service was fast and friendly, the restaurant was clean and open, the food was ready what felt like only 5 minutes after ordering, and the price was right. My vegetarian pho was $6.95 and my partner's beef pho was $7.50. Next time I'll try their pad thai.
