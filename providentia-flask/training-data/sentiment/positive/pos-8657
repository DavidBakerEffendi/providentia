I'd like to preface this review by stating that I have not been to this location. Or any Carolina's location for that matter. Not yet atleast.  It's my husband who regularly visits this establishment on his lunch hour...and subsequently has RAVED about the place!

A couple months back he brought home some salsa and tortilla's for our Saturday morning breakfast burritos. I was amazed at how HUGE the tortilla's are so I only had half--which he was thrilled about since it left more for him.  They have great flavor and texture to them. I can see why they've been voted the BEST of the best! 

Then there's the salsa. Oh the salsa. I plan my weekly meals in such a way as to incorporate this salsa so I can enjoy it as often as possible. Essentially that meant paying $6.00 for a quart of it. But seriously, this stuff is like "liquid gold' to me--I'd (almost) pay any price for it...because it's THAT amazing! 

The flavor is smooth (at first) then smokey, sweet with a punch of heat and the end. I can't get enough of the stuff! It's spicy enough to make your nose run (if you eat enough of it) and hot enough to keep your metabolism up for hours! 

I can't wait to go try their FOOD and see how it holds up to the amazing reputation of their salsa and tortillas. Surely I won't be dissapointed!
