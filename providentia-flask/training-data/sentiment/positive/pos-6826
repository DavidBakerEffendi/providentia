I love this place! It's a hidden treasure and the food is SO good, and reasonable. I compare all other thai restaurants to this one; so far, none compare. I crave the Pad Thai (medium)! The Pad See Ew, Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken (YUM) ~ all so good. Very friendly family-run business.  The only down side is although I want them to be successful, I want them all to myself  ;)
