Exploring a different part of Charlotte outside of my beloved Uptown, I found myself in this cool little mini- town center and stepped into Upstream. My barber said they had "bomb" sushi so I needed to verify this, it was a strong statement. 

1st, yes the sushi roll I had was amazing, full of fresh crab and ingredients, very flavorful and had the spicy kick I needed! 
Must Try out: Sakura Roll - very filling. Warning: the presentation threw me off, looked like glop, I even looked over at the chef like "hmm" but I dived it and that was AMAZEBALLS! The topping WA blue crab, Sriracha sauce and some other yummiess. 

2nd Must Try: sweet & sour calamari - they ate more like calamari steaks vs the thin joints we know and love. Very flavorful and great spin on calamari. 

3rd, I was full after those 2 items. 

Yes, it's a little pricey but guess what great sushi, nice atmosphere, totally nice for a date or friend get together and if you hit the bar b4 7pm there's 1/2 off food specials. 

Bartender was pretty cool too.
