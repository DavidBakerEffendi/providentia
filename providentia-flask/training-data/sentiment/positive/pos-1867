If you are late night person, looking for somewhere to eat, relax and unwind this is THE spot.  Very cool scene, watch the chefs cooking your food on the wood fired grills and oven...watch an old movie while listening to old school rap...then steal your date's drink!  The food is great: octopus, shishito peppers, grilled wings are my favorite. The owner is so nice and friendly, service has always been great nice crew.

The patio is so cool, great for a group of party.
