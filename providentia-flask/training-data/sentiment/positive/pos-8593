I love Oregano's and this location did not disappoint. I ordered for pickup and the cashier was very friendly. Cannot comment on service otherwise since I didn't experience it but I was enthusiastically greeted a couple times while in the restaurant. The food at Oregano's is always delicious, great portions, and very good prices. This was my first time trying sausage as an add-on to pasta and wow!!
