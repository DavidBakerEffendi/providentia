2 of my favorite things: wine and a burger combined together is SO DANG GOOD!  The fries were cooked to perfection as well. I couldn't stop eating!  This is a dark bar atmosphere and ate here on a sunny day early afternoon. Love eating in a dark bar during the daytime.  Everyone there was super friendly. I will definitely be back!!  Yum!
