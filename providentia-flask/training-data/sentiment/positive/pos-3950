I really enjoy The Root. I have been supporting them since it was Phoenix a few doors down and I worked at The Record Exchange. The Lakewood bashing of the previous reviewer is pretty funny. I think Lakewood is a good place as well as Root. I go there with my vegan brother. It is a good thing that there are places that cater specifically to people who don't eat meat. There is a BK right across the street if you want to eat meat, so the location is ideal. The same BK where I had a knife pulled on me in grade 7 when a guy tried robbing me for my fries. I tried to ride my bike away but the chain popped.
