Trendy high end steakhouse inside of the Palms. I was taken here on a date and had an amazing experience...so kudos to the guy for choosing this joint.

The service was great. We had a reservation and were greeted at the door. They were still getting our table ready so we decided to get a drink at the bar, which was right by the front of the restaurant. 

For our appetizers, we got the rock shrimp and garbage salad, which were both, fabulous. The server helped with suggesting those.

I ended up ordering the bone in rib eye, which was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor, with a side of the mac and cheese, also just fantastic. He got the filet, which was good too but nowhere as amazing as my rib eye. 
I most likely scared him with my appetite for meat ...but what can I do? I love a good a rib eye.
