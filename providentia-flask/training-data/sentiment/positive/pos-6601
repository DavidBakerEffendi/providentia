We were craving Meat Jun and found this place on Yelp and I'm glad we did!! The pupus were yummy. My son loved the boiled peanuts and I especially liked the cucumber Kim chee. My family and I were happy with our food selection and the service is great! Meat Jun craving, satisfied! We will definitely be back!
