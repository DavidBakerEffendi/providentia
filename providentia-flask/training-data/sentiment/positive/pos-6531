Hawaiian style Korean food :)  My favorite is the Spicy Chicken plate. The kochujung sauce that they use is hot & flavorful. Other dishes I have tried and liked ..chicken katsu, spicy squid, bi bim bap, spicy pork, and bi bim kook soo. The owners are always friendly, the establishment is clean and the food Is yummy & affordable. I love this place!!!
