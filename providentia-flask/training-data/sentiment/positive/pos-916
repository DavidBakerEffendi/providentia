Stopped by for Boxing Day lunch with Hunter at grandparent's place at this super fresh Indian place with great choices...make sure you just get their platter for lunch...it's a lot of food and get to try more things with their naan and salad and lentil soup and gulag jamun along with 2 servings of chromosomes, lamb, chicken, veggie or Vegan options...their Mango lassi is really good as well...the shrimp is huge and plump, perfectly made, the sauces of karma and masala was phenomenal!!
