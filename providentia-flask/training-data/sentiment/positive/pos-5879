I just love it here. Brittani was my server today and everything came fast, fresh and perfect. I got the half n half, which is a half skillet of your choice with 2 nice size protein pancakes. I was by myself and my bill (I got a hot tea and side of sausage) was 27.00 with tip which is a little high for breakfast but I just love this place.   Its always clean, comfortable and fast. I always have great service as well. A female manager came by and asked how things were, which I love!
