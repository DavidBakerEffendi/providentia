Ok ok ok.  I know.  But this place has my heart.  It's a Vegas staple.  It's like the best late night eats.  Everything you could want or need on the menu, fancy cocktail waitresses in long gowns delivering crazy drinks,  and the adjacent fireside lounge where old people go to make out. Who wouldn't give 5 stars?

I come here often,  as it's in between my work,  my gym,  my drinking spots,  and my house lol. I've been disappointed a few times by eggs not done right,  but hey,  they put up with a TON of drunk and disorderly tourists on a nightly basis.  

 My recommendations on the menu include almost anything breakfast,  the chicken wings,  the French dressing that you can get in the side salad, the cottage cheese and...omg... the Sin City BLT. Dude,  this thingis so delish.  It's a BLT made on extra yummy Texas toast,  with thick cut bacon,  lettuce,  tomato,  and...a fried egg with pesto aoli....damn! That sandwich is so good! Hits all the spots.  Breakfast,  lunch,  and dinner cravings all in one meal.
