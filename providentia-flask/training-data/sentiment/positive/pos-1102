I visited for the first time today and I will definitely be returning. I had the BLT on the focaccia bread and it was the best thing I've ever eaten, seriously it was amazing. We also had the chorizo fries as an appetizer and the waffle/ice cream desert which was also very good. I would definitely recommend.
