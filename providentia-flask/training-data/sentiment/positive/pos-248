Friendly staff, good service, and great happy hour specials. This is in the heart of old town, but it's not so hip that you'll have to wait a long time to be seated unless you're with a large party.

They can make several of their bowls vegan. The avocado and beets bowl is really good. 

This is a good casual date spot and also good for entertaining out of towners in Scottsdale.
