This is my tribute to Bradley Ogden as this will probably be the last time I write about this place.  Sadly, the space has been bought by Chef Gordon Ramsay and he will be turning it into a gastropub.  It's really too bad because I never got to go inside the actual restaurant.

Granted, I've only been to their Lounge and have had only had their Burger.  But it's so good that it's been worth coming back for time and time again.  Once I found out that it was closing down, I had to stop over one more time to get my All-Time Favorite Burger!!

Here it is one last time....(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=NRo0AziuU9kvyPAR-2vouw).  Prime SteakBurger with Cheddar Cheese cooked medium rare with Handcut Fries.  It's so simple and that's what makes it's so great!

And here's the money shot with my Burger fully assembled (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=_NTOCJ8J_dBkacrSjgDcNQ).  Sooooooo Goooooooooood!!!  I really hope they relocate to another property on the Strip because I'm really going to miss their Burger.

Thankfully, Bradley Ogden has a couple restaurants in San Francisco so I'll still have a chance to try his fine cuisine.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to at his namesake restaurant in Vegas.  Thanks for the Burger memories!!!
