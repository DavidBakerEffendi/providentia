Matsuda is my go-to spot for sushi when I'm in Markham!

You're looking at a higher price-point for ayce sushi tho. About $30 pp after tax and tips on weekends. But trust me, it's worth every penny. 

The service is quick. Everything comes out fresh and hot, and they don't purposely slow down the food because they're afraid you won't finish.

They have a wide selection for sashimi and during the summer, they would occassionally serve sweet shrimp, which is typically rare for any ayce sushi places since a la carte usually charges $5 for 3 slices. When I went last weekend, they served scallop sashimi which is never heard of in ayce sushi places. During the weekdays, they also serve their pan-seared salmon sashimi.

Their mango rolls and yoghurt is a stolen recipe from ten-ichi it's just as good, if not, better. I can't give them any credit for innovation but MANGOOO ON EVERYThiNG...shall i say more?

Another menu item that WILL blow you away is their garlic stir-fried sirloin steak... Make sure you double or triple order because you WILL want more after!

Make sure you arrive early and if you're coming with a party, RSVP! It does get hectic over the weekend, but no matter how crazy they get, you never have to wait too long for food or wave a server down.
