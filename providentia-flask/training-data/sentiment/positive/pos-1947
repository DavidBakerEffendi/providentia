Food: fantastic. Among our group we shared the pork chop, the duck, and the cheese plate. Great cocktails, too! The food will do a much better job speaking for itself than I can describe.

Service: our waitress was a little weird/awkward but very prompt. 

Interior is very luxe-- big cozy chairs and sofas, rustic decor. 

I live in the Biltmore area-- this is SO worth the drive!
