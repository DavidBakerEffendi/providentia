Ate there today. It has been a long time and what a treat it was!! We love this place. We don't come for the drinks or the bathrooms or the ambience....we come for the food. Don't get me wrong..it is not a crap hole..it is just not fancy at all!. But the food....Oh the Food! INCREDIBLE!!!!!

P.S.

This place is much cleaner that the Peoria location!
