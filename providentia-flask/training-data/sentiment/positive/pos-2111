I LOVE NCounter!  They do breakfast well and have great dishes that are imaginative without going off the deep end.  If you like a Benedict and you are wild about cream cheese get the NCounter Omelets!  Seriously it is my go to item and it's like crack.  I also love that they have a protein smoothie on their menu so I enjoy my brunch with my man friend instead of getting stuck at some health food place.

With all this good food the place can get busy and slow which is the only negative thing I can say about it but I guess that is what happens when people find out that your food is freaking amazing.

I also love that I can order online for my to-go order.  Makes my life a lot easier with a few clicks of a button!
