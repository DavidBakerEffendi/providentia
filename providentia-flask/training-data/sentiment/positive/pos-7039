Great little converted house turned into a cute vegan eatery! I got the red bean quesadilla and it's so freaking good!!!

Love the decor and music since that's what I listen to. It's not a place where hipsters or indie ppl go, pretty much just regular people come here. I mean, this isn't San Francisco or Portland, so it's not overrun with annoying holier than thou foodies. Yay!
