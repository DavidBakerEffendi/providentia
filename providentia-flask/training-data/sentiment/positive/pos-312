Another excellent meal. Word is getting out around town about this place...last time we went, it was early-ish on  Saturday and there were maybe two or three other couples there. Tonight, Saturday, we arrived at 5:45 and were told it would be over an hour without a reservation. Fortunately, there were two seats at the bar, so we didn't have to wait. 

The food was, again, spot on and delicious. The service was great and gracious, and Bianco was greeting and thanking diners left and right. 

The choices are limited (or possibly nonexistent) for strict vegans, but there's always something vegetarian on the menu if you don't mind being a little flexible on the cheese thing.

We shared the chickpea-flour crepe with olive, sage and red onion. This was fabulous, reminiscent of a potato pancake but more delicate. 

I ordered the Fresh pasta with eggplant ragu, which was velvety with deep, garlicky, parmesan, and husband had the gnocchi with fresh corn. Also terrific.

There's a rotating menu, but I think there's always some variation of a bean side dish. Get it. The two we've had have been excellent. Also, the flourless chocolate cake is a must, and I think they have it every night. 

Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
