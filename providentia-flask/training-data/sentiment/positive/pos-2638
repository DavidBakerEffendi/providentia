This place has some pretty good brunch and short to no lineups, but only between 11am and 3pm. I love getting the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. There's an awesome selection of beers too, especially if you're a fan of Belgian and sour ales. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the bartenders that does some acrobatics with your drinks!
