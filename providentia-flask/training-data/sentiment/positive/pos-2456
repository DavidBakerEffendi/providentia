MMMM... pizza. If you have been to any of the other valley Barro's, this one is very similar as far as menu and specials. The restaurant itself is a little more pictureque that others, with plenty of booths and tables.. Best deal is the lunch special.. i mean 2 slices and a drink for  $4 ............ NICE!
