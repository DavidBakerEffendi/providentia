Brought more friends to Gaati for lunch.  We ALL loved everything we ordered and it was fun to taste several things on the menu.  We had the curry puffs, dumplings(sauce is divine) and Tom Yum Koong to share as starters.  I always order a 10 on the spice scale and today I broke a sweat- it was perfect!  My girlfriend on the other hand can't handle the heat so I recommended a 3, but she went for a 5. She loved it.  My friends are curry lovers so they tried the yellow curry and the red curry lunch specials and there wasn't anything left on their plates.  My favorite is the Thai Chicken Salad - I've been craving it since my last visit last week. Just  thinking about it makes my mouth water. YUM. But to top it off we shared an authentic Thai dessert so they brought us out the Pumpkin Custard.  I've never tasted anything like it.  It was sweet (but not too sweet), warm and oh soooo delicious. I tried just to eat a small bite but couldn't help eating my whole portion.
