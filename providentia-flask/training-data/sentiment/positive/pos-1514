Great dive bar, saying that they always have drink and shot specials. Their burgers are above average for a restaurant let alone dive bar food.. I've heard they're patty melt is delicious as well.  Wings are ok, nothing to write home about.  The staff are friendly and will remember your name if you go in a lot and you may even get a free beer from time to time on the house.  They host dodgeball and dart leagues and even dress up and decorate the place when dodgeball have a theme night.  They have craft beers now and will ask us what beers we would like for the upcoming season.. Great dive bar, one of my favorites in Phoenix!  They have two pool tables, plenty of seating, big screen tvs everywhere, a new jukebox, and a dart board.
