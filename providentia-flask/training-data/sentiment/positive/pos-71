Some of the best chicken I've ever eaten! I felt like my chicken skin was a Chicharr√≥n! It was extra crispy but also light and flaky!  Yes, I'm a chicken expert! It's a new location so I pray they keep up the good work. The plantains are so delicious! All the food was so fresh and they have great workers. They have a lot of locations so check out their site to find one near you!
