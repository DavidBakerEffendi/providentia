A true taste of New Orleans right here in our back yard!  Had the shrimp poboy and girlfriend had the catfish poboy.  Both were excellent, seafood was fresh, big, juicy superbly fried.  The bread was like you can only get from N'awlins (which is where it is flown in from). Didn't have room for any of the sides as the sandwiches are big (even though we only ordered the regular portion).  Will definitely be back to sample some more of their items.  Looking forward to the beignets and the fried oyster poboy.  Great sweet tea too!

Place is comfortable inside and everyone who served us was very pleasant.  I highly recommend you give it a try and I know I will be back often!
