Being from Northwest Ohio I have always loved Marcos pizza. I was very excited to see that when I moved to Lake County that there was one close to where I live.

Thankfully not only is the quality of Marco's good here in Mentor the workers are great as well. The manager of the store takes pride in what she does and runs a great store.
