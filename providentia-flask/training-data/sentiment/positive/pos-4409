All I can say is WOW! My mother and I came here searching for a place to grab dinner outside on a patio and this was a home run. Towards the end of our meal (during dessert, yes we had to try something for each course) I made the comment of "if someone asked for a negative I don't think I could find one". From the moment we walked in we were promptly greeted and sat on their awesome patio, everyone we encountered from the bartender to the server and host were simply fantastic. They were beyond friendly, warm and helpful! Their menu looked so amazing it was hard to decide what to order but the server helped us decipher through and make some phenomenal cuisine choices. The drinks were also tasty and they had a nice little cocktail menu to choose from. Over all this was an amazing experience and I cannot wait for a date night with my fianc√© in this classy yet chic restaurant, I texted him immediately because I was just so excited to tell him about this lovely local spot I had just discovered!
