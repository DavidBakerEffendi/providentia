Big fan!  First time i have ever been to this place, and the milkshake I got was delicious.  My mother also got a frozen coffee, and I think I wound up drinking all of it for her.

The cookies that were there also were great.  I am not sure whether they cooked them there fresh or not, but they were delicious.  

Defiantly the best stop my mother and I had while we were on Walnut street, and i would venture back to the place in a second.

PS the wait staff was also very pleasant and kind.
