The Chili Rellenos were excellent!  I love Rellenos, but it is often mediocre elsewhere...because they are hard to make!  The rellenos here were the largest I have ever been served, stuffed with ample white melted cheese, sauced lightly with a red chili sauce, served with a side of chopped lettuce, onions, tomato, guacomole, sour cream, a huge tortilla and of course rice and beans.  I have been to this place about 12 times and this is the best dish yet.  Wish I had tried it earlier.  The friendly staff is another nice thing about frequent visits.  It is a lot of meal for $7.19, compared to anywhere else in Scottsdale.
