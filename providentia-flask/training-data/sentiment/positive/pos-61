Ok, I am on like day 16 of ordering from this place. NOTHING IS BAD on the menu. The baked ziti is sooo delish and the portion is HUGE. The steak and cheese philly is the best I have had in awhile.
My staff orders pizza and wings, and cold sammies from there too, and we cant get enough!
And yesterday we even got a pretty cute delivery driver!
