Tough to determine between 4 and 5, but the friendly service pushes it to a 5. As far as the pizza goes, it doesn't have as much as taste as nearby Brooklyn South, but it is very good. If crust is important to you, it's better than most. 

It's also a unique experience because it's off the main strip in Davidson and you can eat at one of three quiet picnic benches (umbrellas included).
