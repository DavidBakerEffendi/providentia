This is a super cool little bar just a few steps west of Scottsdale Rd.  The decor is hip and yet comfortable.  The owners are super nice and friendly.  Check out the small plates offerings from their compact menu.  As the name suggests, they have a well thought out wine and craft beer list for libations.  A couple of my favorite craft beers there are the Huss Magic in the Ivy and Lumberyard's Knotty Pine.
