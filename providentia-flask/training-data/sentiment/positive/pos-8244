This cafe is such a cozy and lovely spot! They have free wifi and several outlets, so it's a good place to work or study, but it's also great for coffee dates and just catching up with friends! Their food is also great - they have delicious pastries, and I really enjoyed their savoury dishes. Their savoury dishes are tasty, but healthy and light as well, which I really appreciate. I've had the bloom bowl and the chicken sandwich, which were both really good, and I also had the soup which I really really enjoyed - it was a carrot and rosemary soup (the carrot was pur√©ed) and it was so delicious. I think their soups vary daily, too! They also have several breakfast dishes, such as waffles, which my friend really enjoyed. They also offer brunch on weekends (so many options!!) 
Overall, a great spot that is perfect for anything - getting your study groove on, eating breakfast/lunch/dessert, or grabbing coffee! Love this spot :)
