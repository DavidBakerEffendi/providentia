I love coming to topgolf! Even if your not great at golf you can still have a great time. I love coming at night cause the lights change as well. 

Came here a week or to ago and wanted to play around 7:30pm and it was a 2 hour wait. So we left and I scheduled a bay online for 6:30pm and when we got here it was quick and easy. They sent us to our bay right away.  When we got up stairs and found our bay there was someone there to help us. We swiped our playing cards and there was 4 time slots you can choose from to play 1) 30 mins 2) 45 mins 3) 1 1/5 mins 4) 2 hrs. We chose an hour & half. We got to play 3 1/2 games but there was 9 of us. 

We ordered the 24 injectable doughnut holes & you can pick 2 creams. We choose bavarian cream & chocolate. They were both really good. Also we ordered the signature nachos it was so delicious & definitely not enough for all of us that we had to order another one. 

They have seating up stairs. They have games like pool & Kinect & etc.
