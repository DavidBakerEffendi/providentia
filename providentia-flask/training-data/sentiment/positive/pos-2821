What a great addition to the neighborhood. Cool vibe inside, friendly service, awesome 80s hip hop playing all night, large patio with a huge swamp cooler blowing for these hot nights! They're actually really committed to the 80s themes with your bill presented in a Garbage Pail Kids book, 'Summer School' playing on tv, and the wait staff in 80's ts and tanks.
We only had drinks, but I liked the specialty menu, and they were pretty cheap at $8 per. My husband couldn't say no to a $5 Bud Light in a brown bag, either.
Will definitely be back next time we're in town for drinks and maybe even food, too!
