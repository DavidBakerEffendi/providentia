We have been making it a point to visit here every single time we visit Las Vegas since the place opened. And this trip we decided to check out their newest location in North Las Vegas and it did not disappoint. Although it is just a bit smaller than their number one location it is still a friendly clean comfortable place with fantastic food and excellent service. This will always be our family's favorite place to go together.
