From our service to the perfection of the food, we will definitely be coming back! It has only been a week since they have opened yet it feels like it's a place that has been here for a while. The chicken and biscuit were done just right with a modern twist. The egg was a great bonus to it. The bison meatloaf was something I'd definitely order again. Ask for Amanda when you come in.
