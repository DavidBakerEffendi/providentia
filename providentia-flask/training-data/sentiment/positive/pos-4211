The fountains are some of the best free entertainment you can get on the Strip. They're beautiful and mesmerizing. I can't believe there are so many fountains here. 

The music that plays is kind of random. It can be Christmas music (during the holidays) or it can even be the Star Spangled Banner. No matter the song, the fountains are choreographed with the song though!
