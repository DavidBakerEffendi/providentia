Because I was running late I left work without eating lunch.  Yelp on my iPhone pointed out Haps as being an excellent place to eat on my way to I-17.

Food is awesome.  Everything I had, (sampler) ranging from smoked chicken, ribs, pulled pork and brisket was really, really awesome.  And not that I'm into it but the sampler plate (to go) must have weighed 5 pounds.  No way I could finish.

One of those little hidden gems that you have to go find.  HIghly recommend and will gladly go back again.
