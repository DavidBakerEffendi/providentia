This time around it was too cold for us Californians to hit the pool.  It was in the low 70's.  So we spent our money and time on food and shows instead.  This is one of our favorite hotel to stay on the strip.  The room is big for our family.  The shopping is decent and it is connect to Palazo and Venezia tower.  The Venetian tower elevator is close to restaurants and the food court.  This time we actually walked the strip to the mall and the LinQ promenade.
