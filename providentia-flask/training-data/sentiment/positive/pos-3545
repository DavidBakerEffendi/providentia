First let me say this is a Chick-Fil-A Express so it doesn't have all the menu ideas that a traditional location would have but they have the staple items like chicken biscuit & chicken minis for breakfast, reg & grilled chicken sandwich, reg nuggets, and grilled market salad for lunch as well as hash browns and waffles fries and can't forget the lemonade. 

This location works off the banks schedule so they are only opened M- F from 7:30a to 3p. And of course lunch time is super busy with both BoA and JWU students. But the line moves pretty fast and there's hardly ever a long wait. As its self serve so you just grab what you want and pay at the register.

The staff is always friendly and working hard. The food is always fresh as you can see them making it in the back and refilling all the food. 

Every time I come I'm pretty much in and out. I have no complaints with this location. Other than the menu being a little limited and the hours being different, it's still the same great chicken sandwich, fries, and lemonade you get from any other Chick-Fil-A.
