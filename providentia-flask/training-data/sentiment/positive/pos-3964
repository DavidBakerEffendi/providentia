This place is one of the only places that at reminds me of LA.. truly a great eatery but a great place to take a date to grab a few drinks. They have wine bottle night discounts which are great. They have a pretty different menu as fair as drinks. Bloody Mary's are 5 bucks all day, and is a the place to day drink.
