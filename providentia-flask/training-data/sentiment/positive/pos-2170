This is the same Soho Sushi Burrito located on Sahara and LV Blvd. Same menu, same layout, same concept. I like this location better because it's off the strip so you don't have to deal with tourist or Strip traffic.

I always order the Firecracker on seaweed with brown rice. This is basically a spicy tuna roll in burrito form! Yum!!!! We also like to switch off between the Cajun Tuna or Triple S. Very delicious and  you can completely customize everything to your liking. 

This location is conveniently located off the 215 freeway and Jones Blvd. Once you exit the fwy, there's a small, quaint plaza that will be on your left hand side. Soho is in there. There's a hair lounge, nail salon and a dr office in there also.
