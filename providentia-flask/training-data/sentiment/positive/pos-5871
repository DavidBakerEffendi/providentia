All in CAPS: BEST! RESTAURANT! IN! CHARLOTTE!

Read again: BEST RESTAURANT IN CHARLOTTE!

I was already a big fan of B&G at Providence Rd. I went for a dinner event prior to opening and I can tell it was one of the best meals we have ever had in life.

The location is a lot larger than the original one, features a larger butcher shop and a CHEF'S TABLE! Chef Ben was absolutely on fire tonight and nailed every single dish. We ordered the duck among other dishes and the duck was so delicious that it out-beat one we had in Paris.

The restaurant is very well located into the Langtree Shopping center which is by the lake and features incredible views of Lake Norman.

If you come here I would suggest that you order the pork belly, the duck and the bread pudding for dessert. The wine list is quite interesting and I would suggest the Block and Tackle. Absolutely outstanding wine!

Service is also spectacular. We definately needed a good quality restaurant here in this area. We have a few that call themselves "fine dining" but they are nothing but overrated (see my other reviews for these places around here). If you are looking for the best meal of your life, you have come to the right place.
