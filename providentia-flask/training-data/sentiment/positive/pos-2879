Just tried Golden donut for the first time
Very cute and tidy, adorable little ladies manning the ship and REALLY yummy donuts!! Very fresh, light, airy and perfect sweetness.... I don't like mine so sweet u need insulin!!! Had to add them as a business, they weren't on yet. Corner of Pennington and baseline. Anyhow just a shout out to a new and yummy neighborhood business!
