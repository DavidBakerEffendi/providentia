Potato corner is always our go to snack anywhere we may be. They always make it fresh when you order and then they shake the fries in the flowered powder of your choice. We always get fries there and is always consistently good. I always get the chili bbq with the curly fries and that's my go to. If I share a fry then I usually get the giga which will allow you to split flavors but has to be same type of fries. The amount of fries they give you is pretty good so usually the smallest size can be satisfying enough already. My next favorite flavor would be the sour cream and onion!
