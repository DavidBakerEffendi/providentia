I had dinner here on a whim tonight and it did not disappoint.  One word of advice is to get a reservation as this is a smallish and very busy dining room.  I arrived at 6:30pm on a Sunday and it was full.

The host was great and very friendly as was the waiter. I wish I remembered his name!  He talked me through the typical spice level and what I like so the kitchen could get it right.  I'm typically hotter than whatever the locals eat but not as hot as the natives (ie.  I can't handle Thai hot or Indian very hot).

Wish I stopped in with a group for multiple offerings but since I was alone I went for my staples.  Chicken Vindaloo with samosas and naan.

The vindaloo was spiced just right for me.  The chicken and potato stew was delightful and true to a vindaloo.

The samosas were very good as well.  I look forward to returning to try the many other offerings soon as this will be my go to Indian restaurant in North Phoenix going forward.
