My boyfriend and I loved this place! We both love authentic oriental food and this is at the top of the list now! The people were all great, fast servers and the food was delicious! 

Some highlights to our meal wa the miso soup (not made from a packet!) and the sushi! This will definitely be a new regular place for us!

Make sure to get there early because it is a small location and fills up quickly in the evening!
