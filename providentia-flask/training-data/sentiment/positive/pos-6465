Tokyo is one of the first places I ate at when I first moved here.  It was right around the corner from the school I teach at, so it was our go-to place to grab lunch (before our lunch was shortened to 30 minutes).  

Anyway...you could say I'm a regular.  Or maybe the fact they know my order as soon as I walk in would mean I'm a regular.  LOL.

I get the Teriyaki Chicken Lunch Special every single time I go.  It comes with the little salad and the tasty ginger/soy dressing and a drink.  Sure, this isn't the most spectacular food in the state, but it is just one of those places that I rely on when I am super hungry and know I can get a filling lunch or dinner.  There's something about it I can't pass up.  

I have been to the one near downtown Phoenix and that one was yucky and the staff wasn't as friendly.  My bowl had crunchy half steamed rice, blech!
