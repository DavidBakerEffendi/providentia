With the new Beauty and the Beast live action movie recently releasing I thought it would be appropriate to come here and pay homage to one of my favorite candlesticks. There aren't any Disney characters strewn through this restaurant though there are some tasteful decorations through the restaurant that lend it some charm such as the enameled cast iron dutch ovens (a french cooking staple) lining the glass in the kitchen.

I gotta say the food and service here knocked me out of the park with their small touches such an an amuse bouche before your meal begins. We got a pear and gruyere bisque paired with a hot out of the oven mini brioche. This little bun was freaking delicious. Put that sucker on the menu so I can order more please. We then started the meal proper with the hearts of palm salad with lobster and confit duck leg with chocolate sauce. They are both stunning presentation wise and really perfect ways to start a meal. The lobster was just the right amount to not get bored of it and the chocolate on the duck was subtle enough to not overpower things and turn it into a dessert duck.

As for my entree I went with a rack of lamb with smoked eggplant and saffron encrusted turnip (the special for that night) and it was excellent. Though not as exciting as the fish course of my dining companion which was a tasty and well cooked chilean sea bass.

At this point we were too full for dessert so had to skip on that. But I'm eyeing that bread pudding for next time. Thanks for the wonderful meal Lumiere! You always were my favorite character in Beauty and the Beast.
