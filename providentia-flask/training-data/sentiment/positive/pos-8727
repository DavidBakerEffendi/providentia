We were driving to Grand Canyon and had no time for breakfast. My husband stopped here to grab something and the food was super good. We just had a bunch of breakfast wraps - all freshly made, very yummy. I also had the iced tea - unsweetened and it was good. Probably the same you get everywhere but I noticed it does not have the strong bitter taste which some do.

The place looks really cute and it has a very nice outside patio with some sand and sand toys for kids - I am looking forward to coming back soon for lunch and sit outside with the kids.

Last but not least, like most people already mentioned - service is super extra mega ultra friendly. Nothing fancy, but everyone is genuinely nice which makes it a pleasure to dine here.
