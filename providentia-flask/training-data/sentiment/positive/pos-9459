Have not had a bad meal here. Tonight it was the All You Can Eat Taco Tuesday (tacos & cheese enchiladas with rice and beans). I paid a small upcharge to get chicken enchiladas (instead of cheese) with my tacos and everything was awesome.

Some of the best enchiladas and taco's I've had. They are deep fried hard shell taco's with your choice of meat.

Love trying new things here and look forward to our next visit.
