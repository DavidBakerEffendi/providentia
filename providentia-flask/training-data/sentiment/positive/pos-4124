I LOVED this place. LAHVED IT. I think there are so many great, local place in downtown Phoenix but I needed to add something new to the rotation and this was perfect. I bought the $25 local dines coupon and set out. 

All of the food was fantastic. We had the baked brie and a salad to start. My entree was the risotto and my companion had the andouille pasta. Let me say that with all of that and a glass of wine, we didn't even hit the $50 limit we had with the coupon. The service was perfect and the patio was cool enough for the June heat. 

This place has it all, good food, great service, local feel and charm and amazing prices. We were the only ones on a Saturday night so that was a little worrisome! I hope the good word spreads for this great new place.
