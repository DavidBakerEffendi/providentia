They were right, this certainly is one of (if not the) best Roma style pizzas in the city AND doesn't destroy your wallet!

It's a nice, tiny little shop, and as soon as you walk in, your eyes feast on the "belissimo" slices of pizza alreay cooked. They are SO creative with the combination of ingredients, potato and proscuitto, smoked provalone with mixed wild mushrooms.....it really can't get more authentic. With so much to choose from, and with a few sitting areas in the shop, this would be a perfect lunch spot for people in the area.

 I came with a group of 4, and we decided to order a full party size pizza - only a 20 minute wait, can't complain about that! We chose the Amitricano, which had parmesean cheese, tomato sauce, hot salami, pancetta and proscuitto... Definitley was the works haha! The gentleman who took our order (and whom I believe is the owner as he's featured in lovely news articles about the shop posted around the store) was extremely friendly and seemed to truly care about whether or not we enjoyed our meal; true sign of excellent customer service!

Our pizza was served to us on personal trays, accounting for a total of 24 slices. As much as I wanted to finish all 6 of my beautifully savoury, fresh pizza slices, i had to bring some home for later, too stuffed haha!

Another side note I noticed is that the workers speak Italian which i think is VERY admirable! Really is the cherry on top for the authenticity of Ciao Roma!

Very impressed with this place, love the intimacy of the shop, and the quality and variety of pizza offered. Definitley will return next time im in the area :)
