We recently came here for dinner and I am so glad that we did. My only mistake was eating a work potluck for lunch that had left me full even hours later. Elaine was our server and she was wonderful. 

My fianc√© got the Miso bowl and added spicy pork. I just got the gyoza and brussel sprouts. Everything was amazing. Let me say it again - EVERYTHING was amazing. We will be back and this time, I will come with an empty tummy.
