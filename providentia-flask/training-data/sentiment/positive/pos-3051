Holy heavenly sandwiches! The sandwiches available here are amazing! There was live music when we stumbled upon this place. It's a cool vibe. We like that they give back to the community. The setup is a little weird - ordering and paying without much service other than bringing your sandwiches to you. If you're planning on more than one mimosa, beer, or non-fountain beverage, the prices will lure you in but getting the additional refill seems a little tough. This also applies to the all you can eat french toast. I'd vote they stick to the sandwiches. I'll be back for more tasty sandwiches in the future!
