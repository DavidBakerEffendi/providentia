Had a great time last night; popped in after a fundraising event at the Westin.  Short walk, we were seated right away though the restaurant was very busy. 

We had excellent service, really liked our waiter. He was funny and fast, but also allowed us to take our time while sharing a couple of bottles of wine and some boards.  

And the boards!  We had the butchers block and the bruschetta.  For the bruschetta, you can choose four kinds from a pretty good sized menu, so we opted for the apples and Brie, the seasonal which was a goat cheese and tomato spread (I think), the ricotta w dates and pistachios, and the tomato, bacon, and burrata (always my fav!) The presentation of the boards is so great and they're so tasty!!  We go to Postino a lot for bottles and boards, always a great experience!
