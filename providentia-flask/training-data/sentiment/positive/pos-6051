I have heard about Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake all the way from Vancouver. Sister went to Toronto for work and I was so excited. I told her to drop by here and pick up some. Even though by the time it made it back to Vancouver, it was cold but it tasted so good. I was like OMG..... 

Definitely a WOW WOW WOW. It was light, fluffly and cheesy at the same time. It was really fresh. 

I loved it. I need to make a trip out there and pick up some more. So delicious. Definitely an eyeopener. I am excited that Vancouver will open up one very soon at Metrotown. So can't wait for that to happen.
