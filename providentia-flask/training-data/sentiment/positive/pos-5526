I will cut right to the chase. Henderson has a five-star Italian fine dining restaurant. Yes it is that good.
Gaetano's is located in a small fairly innocuous strip mall and shares a parking lot with Chipotle and Wild Wings amongst others. Don't let the location fool you. The restaurant itself is a fairly large dining room with very high ceilings. Very classy. Off to the side there is a bar that is walled off from the restaurant.
After we were seated, our server, Steve, was at the table almost immediately to answer any questions about the menu and to tell us about the specials for the evening. Our busboy, food runner, and server all gave near perfect service throughout the entire evening.
We started the meal by sharing the portobello mushroom appetizer. Excellent choice! For my entree, I went with the salmon stuffed with crab. My wife had the chicken marsala. Each dish was outstanding. 
While the price point is a little higher than several of the other local Italian restaurants , the fact that this is fine dining with outstanding food, service, and ambience makes the price worthwhile.
