Expensive for sushi since the rolls are $25 and they are pretty tiny. Yet, the impeccable taste always has me coming back. The tuna sashimi with apple is a must along with the A5 pot stickers. I had a bunch of rolls and the sea bass skewers. I'm sure I had more but I just can't remember right now. Everything is pretty good. This is my 3rd visit to this restaurant. $150 for 2 without any drinks.
