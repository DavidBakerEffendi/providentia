Forget whatever you know about sushi and come to ShinBay. The food here is wonderful and each dish pushes the envelope of what you know as the "best tasting sushi you've ever tried..."  

Don't get me wrong, there are several nice sushi places around town but ShinBay doesn't hold back on the quality of fish they use so the end result on your plate is PHENOMENAL. Go try it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. :)
