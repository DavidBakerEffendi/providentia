Worth the wait!  There's almost always a line up at lunch or dinner but let me tell you it's worth it!  The flat bread they bring to start is soft and made fresh.  My husband and I come here once a month for a kabob dish and we always have leftovers.  The marinade on the skewers is flavourful and not over salted and the mashed potatoes always consistent and done to perfection.  I highly recommend you order a lemon mint drink as well, very refreshing.
