We were walking along St Viateur bemoaning the changes to the street in recent years when we all noticed this pretty but chill spot looking like it might be full of goodies. And in fact it was. Oh it was. Super friendly owner working the counter and excitedly talking about the delicious food being made in the back. My friends ordered a giant lemon square and a gorgeous brownie and I had a perfect little pot of vanilla bean panna cotta with lovely cool liquidy homemade caramel on top. There were homemade gnocci available in a 12 piece portion for $4 for you to cook up at home that looked fat and glorious, yummy pizzas with fresh homemade dough, and a weekend brunch menu that sounded super tantalizing. Cute comfortable seating, nice warm wood, really a nice addition to this changing street.
