We visit this place about once a month.  My husband is a superfan of Dragon Palace.  He absolutely loves their shrimp fried rice.  I love the banana fritter (???? - someone posted a pic of this - not sure of the name) that comes at the end of the meal.  We both love the hot tea that is served with each meal and we always order the egg drop soup.  One of my faves is the beef skewer.  It's beef on a stick that comes out on this thing with fire underneath it so you heat the skewer how you like.  I'm not sure what to call that thing but I love to get my skewers sizzling hot.  I keep trying new items each time I go and some of faves are the Orange Chicken, Pepper Steak and Sesame Chicken.  They serve it with a pot of white rice.  Each dinner entree is served on an oval plate and is enough food for at least two people....more if you eat small.  I always have leftovers, as I order the entrees for myself (hubby eats Shrimp Fried Rice always).  Service is always super fast so you won't have to wait too long for your food.  The staff is nice and the decor is a very cozy Chinese look.  This a little gem in our neighborhood.  See you there!
