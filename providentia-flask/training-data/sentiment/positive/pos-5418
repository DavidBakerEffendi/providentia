If you're an ice cream fan, you'll love this place. Whenever I come to Vegas, I stop by Sugar and Ice. I'm a huge fan of the coconut. The sweet potato fries are yummy as well. The place is pricey but I totally recommend the ICE CREAM. 

I love the outside patio. There's a very pretty waterfall. It does get a bit chilly outside if you sit out during the winter time. - J
