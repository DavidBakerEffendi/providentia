We loved our stay at the Venetian. Wish we could've stayed longer!!

What's to love? 
------------------
+classy front desk w/ very attentive, informative and friendly staff
+classy setup w/ beautiful decor ... vaulted ceilings? YES!
+fairly easy to navigate (to get to your room)
+security check at the elevators : 
   groups will not like this cuz only those w/ keys can enter the guest elevator room  areas. it keeps unwanted random people out meandering the guest hallways. but if you have a group of friends coming over, it's a hassle cuz they make your guests wait down stairs, call you and then confirm to let your guests up the elevators
+guest elevators close to parking lot
+resort fee includes wi-fi and access to their fab gym
+ they have bouchon bakery!!! right next to the guest elevators. ;) 
+they have TAO nightclub and The Stupid Factory!
+ wonderful display and shows during their "winter in venice" period.
+large (but same setup) room as palazzo
+very clean and updated room (better kept than palazzo i think)
+hallways were well lit
+close to the center of vegas ... about .5 miles from Ceaser's and 1 mile from Cosmo.. no need to drive!
+firm beds with really high thread count bedding -- soo soft. :) 
+tv in bathroom  

... and.. their gym.. is to die for. cardio, weight and machine room. plus, a large rock wall, and they have classes.. for free (well, in resort fee)!!! classes are all day and include spinning, kickboxing, yoga, core, pilates etc etc  -- so so extensive!! each cardio machine has a tv attached (w/ cable channels). wasn't planning to work out but could not resist!! 

... I think palazzo vs. venetian.. I definitely prefer venetian. :)

The only con were slow wi-fi (but if you use their lan line, it's super fast). 

Price tag for a suite on Fri and Sat night in Dec -- $129/nt. It's regularly $149 based on their "Winter in Venice" deal.. but if you are running the Las Vegas half/full marathon .. they give you a discount. :) we checked so many other deal sites and the marathon promo code gave us the best deal still. 

win win.
