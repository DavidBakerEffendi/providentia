My son Tried the chicken tacos for the first time (in like 12-13 years that ive been eating here religiously) and i could not stop eating them even though I was STUFFED. Lol
Everything is amazingly good- but again top things to try:

Butterflied red snapper fried 
Tostada de ceviche Cameron
Coctel de Cameron 
Pollo a la Padilla ( takes a Lil extra time but worth it)
CHEESECAKE FLAN is the BEST THING I EVER ATE.
