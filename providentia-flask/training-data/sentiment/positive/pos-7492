First time here got to say...was very very good..think I found my new pizza joint!..staff very friendly well some of them ..love it!..Didnt finish my review from last time I was here that's why it starts the way it says. But what I said last time is the same  love this place!..by the way I got a free slice with the points they give you!!!!...they do deliver also!!..and the same person that is not very nice got our order. she just has a face that she doesn't want to be working just a little rude. But other than that that person won't stop us from coming back...this is our second time here!..
