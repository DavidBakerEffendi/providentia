A new hidden treasure in the southwest.  It's right next to chee burger chee burger, the quality is outstanding, the decor makes you feel right at home. Their food is fantastic for a very reasonable cost. We had the date, bacon meatball that was out of this world, the sauce was not yoo sweet and not too salty. We also had the seafood pasta which was loaded with seafood unlike a lot of  places, it was pushed with shrimp, scallops, clans, mussels, and had a nice spicy kick to it.
