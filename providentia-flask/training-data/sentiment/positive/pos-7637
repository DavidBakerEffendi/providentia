Elite is a Russian banquet hall, which pretty much means usually there is a set price and set menu per person and this includes a lot of food, alcohol and dancing
The food at Elite is SUPERB (and I have been to practically all the Russian restaurants in the Toronto area); the food is comparable to Brighton Beach in New York
The chef, Dima, makes everything with his own unique spin and I love that the dishes are different than any other Russian spot in the city (he used to be the chef at Red Square, so you may have tried his food there)
I was also very impressed that he has very different and unique dishes the fill the tables....Salads with eel, kani and crab salads, delicious tuna sashimi, amazing crispy potatoes...the list goes on and on
Everything was very tasty
The way it works is when you are first seated the table has all the salads and starters (they also have an additional seafood buffet that can be ordered and is more expensive)(I tried the seafood buffet and it is DELICIOUS.. tons of fresh lobster tails, oysters, huge shrimp, sushi, caviar, etc)
While you are having the starters, waiters come around and ask what entree you want (options included filet mignon, lamb, fish, chicken kiev, and duck when I was there)
After the salads comes many other courses including a duck course (duck liver and apples), a seafood tart, beef stroganoff and many other delicious dishes (i'm sure he changes things up, this is what was served the night I was there)
While you are eating, there are breaks to go dance and there is even a show put on by professional dancers (something that only a few Russian restaurants are doing here)
The dessert is also very good. Dima, the chef, is known for his homemade apple streudel which is served with vanilla ice cream.
All in all, a very delicious place that is sure to provide hours of enjoyment eating, drinking and dancing!
