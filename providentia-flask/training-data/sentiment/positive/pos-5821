Awesome sushi burrito place with a variety of raw sushi options.  I like how they have different sauces and toppings to put in their burritos, such as kimchi crunches, won ton chips, mayo, seaweed salad, spicy sauces, etc

You get to see them make the burrito too, and they pack them full and tight!!  Love this stuff! 

They also sell burrito bowls too, but when I'm at a burrito place, I gotta get the burrito :). Yum!!

So this is basically a huge fat sushi roll, not sliced up. And I think the burrito is better than a sushi roll, in my opinion, because you get fatter stuff in the seaweed wrap and you have more ingredients inside. 

Also they have taro chips too - in 3 different flavors. They give samples too if you're not sure. 

Service was great here too.

Would definitely recommend!!
