Their original cheesecake is amazing! It's lightly sweet and fluffy and i can literally eat the whole
Thing on my own! 

My husband was recently in the Toronto downtown area and was able to pick up some cheesecake for us. He asked which one was best and the staff recommended the original. We had some this evening and we were hooked!!! 

I cannot wait to go back and try other new desserts and food but I will definitely always take the cheesecake to go from here every time I'm in the area!!
