The food is typical of Eat & Park; however, the service was stellar. As a gluten free diner, I was impressed with the knowledge and conscientiousness of our server George. He took great care of my meal (grilled chicken salad without fries) and even picked up on my gluten sensitivity after seeing me order off the gluten friendly menu and not touch any of the buns or fried appetizers that the rest of my party had ordered.

Thanks, George and Eat & Park, for a safe and enjoyable dinner!
