I've heard that the buffets at Bellagio and Wynn are overpriced but seriously, this one is definitely worth the extra $5-10. We ate at Cravings and Bellagio had more in terms of selection, comfort, quality and service.

I like that part of the sushi and salad bars are monitored by staff because some people tend to eat, cough, talk or sneeze as they pile on their plates.

Primed ribs - best I've had. Be careful not to OD on this like I almost did. 

Sushi - ask the guy behind the counter to give you fresh ones. Some people, I understand really like their sashimi, but no need to pick the fish and leave the rice. Sure, seeing the machine spit out the rice like larvae isn't too appealing. Sort of like the giant mother alien squeezing out her eggs.
