Best authentic indian food in Phoenix. Don't bother with the other reviews on here I'll tell you the real deal. 

This isn't a pretentious high class restaurant, it's in the back of a grocery store,  but with that said if you want the best palaak paneer or mango lassi come here. 

You always feel like family here and will leave feeling satisfied but wanting more.
