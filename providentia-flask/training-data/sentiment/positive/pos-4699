Coming up on their 1 year anniversary, Tony & his small crew are cranking out top notch espesso drinks matching the best in the city (Myriade, Névé/Flocon, Café Plume, Pikolo).

Good bean, grind, machines, and baristas.  All you need for fantastic espresso.

Beans are from Te Aro (Toronto based kiwi Andy Wilkins), meaning Pourquoi Pas is skilled enough to earn the right to buy their roast.
- Te Aro has one 24kg roasting machine = capacity to support ~ 30 cafés
- Canadian roasted coffee is duty free to US
So, one can infer that Pourquoi Pas is judged by Te Aro as one of the top 30 cafes in the ON, QC, and possibly IL, NY, MA area (the reasonable shipping cost area)

Wow... too much caffeine = crazy tangents.

If you're gonna get wired, why not do it with the best?

p.s. their wifi is up and running
