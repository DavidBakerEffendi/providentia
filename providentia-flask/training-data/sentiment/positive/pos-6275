One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. Our waiter, Ian, was exceptional.  He clearly knew the menu, cared about the quality of food, and made fantastic recommendations. Some unique items and great 'takes' on standards.
Would not hesitate to recommend.  (Just don't sit by the door, a bit crazy there)
