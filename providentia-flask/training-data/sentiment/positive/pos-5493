Wow! Went to a Mercury game tonight & saw the reviews of this place. Even though I arrived just before closing they were great! Ordered Chirashi (my go to) and it was superb! A bowl filled with the freshest fish I have had since being anywhere near the west coast including San Francisco. If you are visiting Phoenix or live here, this is a must visit. Let me know if you disagree.
