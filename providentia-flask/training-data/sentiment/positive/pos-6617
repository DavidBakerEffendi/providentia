I never get tired of this water show! I've seen it probably close to 3 dozen times and I STILL enjoy it, especially on cab rides up and down the strip..this is entertaining during that crazy traffic hour.

What can top a free water show that jump in synchronization with beautiful Andrea Bocelli music?
