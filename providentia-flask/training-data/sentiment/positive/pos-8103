We have adopted this as our Chick Fil A because its the closest one. My son loves chicken nuggets. We are here at least once a week. 

Service is always great, friendly, and quick. But this review is specifically about my visit earlier today. 

I went inside because I needed to order some party trays for this afternoon. I believe she's a manager, and I already forgot how to spell her name but it starts with a T, was FABULOUS. She greeted me right away, asked how she could help, and then offered me a seat so we could sit down and discuss my order.

Another guy asked me if he could get me a drink, so I ordered a cherry coke with full intentions to pay for it. He said it was on the house. Sweet!

While discussing my order, the manager asked if I wanted to do some cookies to, I hesitated because I had not tried them and before I could answer, she ran back into the kitchen to grab me one. A warm, chocolate chip cookie. It was delicious! Then another employee brought me a milk, just as a nice gesture. He told me it was the best way to enjoy their cookies. 

Its been a long time since I have had such good service. I know they've gotten a bad rap in recent years for the owners religious views, but great customer service will keep us coming back. This is how customers want to be treated, and we definitely take note and remember!

Not only was I in and out in less than 10 minutes for a large order, they offered to cut the cookies a certain way so it would be easier to serve the kiddos at the school party this afternoon. I so appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into taking care of me today!
