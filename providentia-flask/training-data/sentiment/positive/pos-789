Don't let the messiness of the pics below fool you. This was hands down the best breakfast sandwich I've ever gotten. I waited in line for about 30 minutes, in all seriousness, I would've waited hours. 

I ordered the Fairfax with avocado. It is loaded up with the creamiest soft scrambled eggs you've ever tasted. They come cloaked in melted cheddar cheese with perfectly caramelized onions giving a hint of sweetness. Surrounding these quality ingredients is a Sriracha mayo providing just enough heat to round out the whole thing. It's all served inside a warm pillowy brioche bun. I definitely recommend the addition of the avocado, it provided another layer of creaminess. I could argue that most of the textures were soft, but honestly it worked so well, I didn't miss any crunch factor.

I know Eggslut has a few locations, if you find yourself near any of them, GO. It will change your life.
