Wow, what a gem!  I've been hearing about Jun through my friends and they kept raving about the meat jun and the katsu, so I had to go try them out.

Prices are reasonable, service is with a smile and the lady who works there is super friendly. We ordered kimchi jjigae and the katsu + mean jun plate.  Banchan also came out with our meal, too.

Banchan - It's not the best, but it's still edible. you can get free refills of your banchan, too.

kimchi jjigae - actually not bad. it's better than the other korean restaurants in the general area.

katsu + meat jun - katsu was OMFG SO GOOD.  their sauce was yummy, too!  I wanted more!!  meat jun was okay - I had better in hawaii, but for las vegas, i suppose this will do and will satisfy any hawaiian local who has nostalgia.

i can't wait until i go home again so I can go back here and eat their katsu~
