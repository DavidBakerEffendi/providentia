We first tried Choy's take-out at the suggestion of a friend who lives in town. Not really sure what to order, we decided on the standard "safe" options, and then experiment with something new. Ordering from their menu was easy, and they promised it in 20 minutes... Sounds good to me! We arrived to pickup and it was ready and waiting for us. I thought I did my math wrong, as the price was less than expected. Turns out they have a 10% discount for pickup if you pay cash. I'm not complaining!

We brought the bag home, and it smelled great. Sometimes you get that oily deep-fried smell, not here... It smelled so good, we wanted to eat it during the drive. Finally home, we unpacked and noticed an extra... Chicken wings... I didn't order those...  Odd, everything else is here though. (Turns out, you get free items if your order exceeds certain price points.... that'll teach me not to read all the menu). I appreciated that, in addition to the plastic containers, they also bagged any items that were liquid and could leak or spill. Plus the extra cardboard pieces so things would not get crushed. That's some attention to detail that I have never experienced from a take-out place before. Usually I get home with a sloppy mess or a soggy bag.

Their Lemon Chicken is the best I've ever had. Good portion of chicken with just enough breading. We now order a double portion and save the leftovers. The beef with diced vegetables and almonds is also a hit, along with the Curry Beef. It has just the right amount of spice. If you are a tofu fan, try the braised bean curd with garlic sauce. I'm not big on tofu, but was pleasantly surprised by that one. We like to try a new dish with each order, but those are some of our favourites to date.

We haven't ever tried their sit-down restaurant, but it looks decent enough. The staff is friendly and helpful, the food is fantastic, and the prices are reasonable. No complaints here!
