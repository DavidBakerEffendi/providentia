YESSSSS, BLOOM BAKERY. I was so excited to try this place, a great bakery with a great mission- & a great addition to downtown! Have I used the word "great" enough? OK, great. 

They have a limited amount of pastries to choose from - it's not some giant, sprawling place - but everything they do have looks like pure art. It all looks borderline fake, like it's a photograph in some rustic furniture magazine, or something, set atop a handmade burnished oak dining room table or something. Does that make sense? IT'S ALL GORGEOUS-LOOKING,

Luckily, it all seems to taste just as good. On my first trip, I bought a plain croissant, two molasses cookies, & a savory scone (can't remember what was in it, but definitely sun-dried tomatoes & some sort of cheese). I tried them all over the next 48 hours, & even not-quite-fresh-anymore, they were delicious. The molasses cookies are chewy & rich; the croissant was flaky & decadent; the scone was salty & soft, everything bursting with flavor. 

10/10 would eat every single pastry again. Looking forward to my next visit!
