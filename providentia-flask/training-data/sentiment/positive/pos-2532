Best wings in Town! Their spice ratings really mean what they say: hot is really hot. On Thursday evenings this place is hopping. It's an American-style sports bar, with Budwiser promotional gear all over the place: so don't expect local craft brewed beer here.

If you like sports, beer, noisy raucous crowds, and the best wings in town, then I highly recommend this place. It's a little bit out of the way, but if you live in south Etobicoke, you would be hard pressed to find a better bar.
