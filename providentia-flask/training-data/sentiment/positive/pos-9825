I love this fuddruckers. I drive all the way from 75th avenue and cactus to go to this location. I hate the one by my house. Which is why I come here! All the employees are helpful and nice , always a smiling face when I'm there. Plus there are good times and memories I've had there that I won't ever be able to forget. I love this place.
