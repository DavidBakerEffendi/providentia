Went back again on a week day. There were about 3 other parties besides mine there, so service was amazing! I tried their special for the day: seafood linguini. Holy MOLY!! It was SOOOO DELICIOUS! There were lobster, crab, clams, muscles, shrimp, calamari, scallops, oh my is right! The flavor was perfect: not too fishy despite having the whole Atlantic in my meal, the sauce wasn't too rich so I could keep eating without getting tired of it, and the meal itself was ginormous. I ate for about 30 minutes straight and didn't make a dent in it. My leftovers fed my boyfriend and I for 2 days!! MmmMMmm =P Plus, I was able to watch the basketball game that was playing in the bar section. What a perfect dinner!

LOVE IT!
