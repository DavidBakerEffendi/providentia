This is an absolutely lovely place for an afternoon lunch.  It's the Wynn so the food and service are world class.  The pool is a nice backdrop for a leisurely lunch conversation or just some quiet pondering as you enjoy your time in Vegas.  

It's the Wynn, so it goes without saying it's not inexpensive.  But well worth it.
