My friend and I popped in here after work and had a wonderful experience. The decor is beautiful with trendy and kitschy touches. We ordered the sea scallops, shrimp, lobster, and corn. What a fun and delicious experience! The seafood was great and the sauces were super flavorful. The Boil King sauce was my top pick but my friend preferred the garlic butter. Decent beer selection with some craft options.  Our server was very pleasant and attentive. The whole experience was super fun. We'll be back for sure! We want to try the crab options next time and crawfish when it's in season.
