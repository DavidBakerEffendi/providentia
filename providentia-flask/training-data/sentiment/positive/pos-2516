I love the concept of Topgolf! I really suck at golf, but you can make it fun here... especially with a few drinks. The food is AMAZING and there's a variety of food. Try out the donut holes, they're a great dessert you won't want to share. If there are people in your group that are not a fan of golfing, they can still enjoy their time here by relaxing on the couch grabbing a bite and a drink or playing some games in the lounge area. Fun for all ages... seriously all ages!
