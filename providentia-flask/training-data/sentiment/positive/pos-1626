I have to start off by saying I love tacos, real authentic tacos.  I'm so happy to have his taco spot in Scottsdale!! 
The meat and chicken are grilled over mesquite, making it rea carne asada. 
The tortillas and salsas are like if I was sitting in a taco stand in Mexico. We really enjoyed our tacos, will definitely be back!

My only wish is that they had pastor. But I'll keep chowing down on the carne asada
