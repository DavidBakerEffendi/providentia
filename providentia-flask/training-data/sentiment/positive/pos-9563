Stopped here today to give it a try and must admit the food was excellent. I ordered the vegetarian Soyrizo (fake sausage) burrito and fell in love. It was well worth the $6. It's not like the big chain restaurants where they serve you a massive sloppy burrito. It was the perfect size and easily handled. 
It's small and quaint, with some seating outside in under a canopy. The owners were a lovely couple, passionate about their food. 
Excellent.
