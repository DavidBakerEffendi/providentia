After having a very terrible visit at Alice Fazooli's a year ago, I was very pleased with yesterday's visit.

We arrived for our dinner reservation at 8 and were surprised that there was no wait at all. We opted for patio seating and got our drink orders in about 10 minutes in. I ordered a long island iced tea (which had no taste of alcohol at all) and my friend got a gin and tonic (should've gotten that to get a buzz going). 

Our server was fantastic! He provided recommendations and they turned out to be great recommendations. I chose the ravioli over the chicken risotto and my friend got the margherita pizza. When I saw that there were only 5-6 pieces of ravioli I thought I would still be hungry. Nope, those hit all the right places and I was full. The meat filling inside were hot and wasn't dry at all. The pizza was a bit thicker than paper and tasted pretty good. We ended off with a slice of cheesecake which we could barely finish. It was creamy and the hazelnut crust topped it off well.

The bill came up to about $60 (before taxes) for the both of us combined, which is pretty decent to me. Overall, the service and food was fantastic! I am definitely returning in the future.
