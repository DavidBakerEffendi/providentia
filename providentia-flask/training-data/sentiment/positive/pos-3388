I really enjoyed this restaurant. I went here a couple nights ago on a mommy/daughter date with my 7 year old. I knew it was across from the Barrymore and I was expecting to have to park a bit away. So I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had a parking lot. It was a beautiful night and we chose to sit outside. Our waitress, Jennifer, was great. She brought out a kids menu and crayons for my daughter right away which kept her busy. My daughter and I went to Monty's because they serve breakfast all day and we wanted breakfast for dinner. I got decaf coffee and the eggs mornay. I had never had mornay sauce before and I found it absolutely delicious! Move over hollandaise! Also, it was the best tasting decaf I can ever remember having. Can't wait to go in the morning sometime when I can get the caffeinated coffee.
My daughter got the Mickey Mouse pancake and she loved it. It was a great price and came with juice and I was thankful they put a lid on it! It drives me crazy when I go places and they give little kids adult glasses filled to the brim. It's just an accident waiting to happen. So the lid gets a thumbs up! Also, REAL maple syrup. It's all we use at home and my daughter turns her nose up at imposter syrup so that was also a big plus.
I can't wait to go again. Truly, that neighborhood has to be my favorite area of Madison so I know I'll be back soon.
Almost forgot, a great bakery too! Took home some delicious pie. I loved the Mississippi mud. Chocolate overload! Mmmm!
