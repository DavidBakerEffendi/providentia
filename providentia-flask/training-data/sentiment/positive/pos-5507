I just love this place! Although I have only been here twice. But, when I want Mexican this is the place my mouth salivates for. mmm.. writing this review is making me crave it now!

I ordered the Mango Chicken burrito. Superb! The balance in flavour is amazing. The rice is nicely seasoned and the touch of mango just makes it pop. But beware future customers, the hot sauce is no joke! Opt out for medium to mild. If your feeling brave, then go for it!
