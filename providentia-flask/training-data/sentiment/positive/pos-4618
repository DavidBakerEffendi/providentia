This time around, despite knowing that ample stomach room was needed to address a large pizza to come, fresh Pizza Dough Bread slathered with butter just could not be completely resisted.  At least I limited myself to just 2 slices!

A bean-studded Small Minestrone Soup differed somewhat in ingredients from previous versions but was still packed with fresh mixed vegetables & pasta.  And a Small Dinner Salad graced with Metro Pizza's own formula for a zesty, tomato-based Italian Dressing was another great starter, along with a cheesy Mozzarella Stick.

But, as usual, top-notch saucy and cheesy New York style pizzas were justifiably placed squarely in the spotlight.  A Large Ham Pizza with Extra Cheese greatly pleased Diane; a Small New York Pepperoni Pizza satisfied my two dining companion friends; and I was quite happy with my order of a Large The Gotham Pizza with added cooked sliced Tomatoes, which was already studded with a whopping six included toppings: Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Sausage, crunchy Green Peppers, Ground Beef, and Onions, and featured a perfectly executed supple crust.  If I were to order this pizza again, I would have reduced or eliminated the Onions, which were just more dominant than I prefer.  But this is more of a quibble than any real complaint.

Seating at two joined tables was comfortable; the casual Italian ambiance authentic for a pizza parlor; and waitstaff service swift, accurate, and commendable.        

Another five-star-level pizza eating outing at this Metro Pizza location!
