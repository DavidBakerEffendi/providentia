I'm glad they have a second location. Last time I got two Bahn mi: Grilled Pork and a classic cold cut. They were both excellent.
This time I ordered a Pork Noodle Bowl and the Crispy Special for dessert (coconut, Longan,jackfruit, jelly, basil and lotus seeds.
The waitresses are cute and perky. The service is excellent and they always have great smells coming out of the kitchen.
