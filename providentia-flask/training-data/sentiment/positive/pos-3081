I find myself returning to my favorite restos time and time again in Toronto. Ravi soups is one of them! There are two locations. Both are great and there is no difference in food flavour or menus

I got my favorite wrap with curried lamb and mango. It's a touch spicy but nothing crazy. I also tried the Ravi stew, very hearty with chicken and I love the sweet potato. Also really enjoy the cheddar biscuit with the soup. A combo is enough to keep you full. 

Great service, reasonable price. Usually around $13-14 with tax for combo. Has bathroom downstairs. Plenty of seating. Good hours, open until 9-10pm most nights. Free wifi.
