Heard about this place a while ago and was looking forward to trying it.  I was pretty hungry after a long hike in the McDowells and wanted to go somewhere quick with good eats.  This was it.  Located at a gas station and car wash I had to double check the address to make sure I was at the correct place.   I had the pulled pork sandwich.  Amazing.  Tender and tasty.  So good, I can eat just the pork without any sauce.  If you do want sauce, they have a number to choose from.  Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.  Great service and friendly staff.
