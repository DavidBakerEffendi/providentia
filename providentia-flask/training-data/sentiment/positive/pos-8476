Have been hearing amazing things about this place so had to go try it out. We ate lunch here today and boy the food is good. I had the shrimp and fish taco, it came with coleslaw, beans, rice. It was a plate full and was just the amount if you are quite hungry. If not very hungry, I'd say one taco is good enough. The pineapple margarita was very tasty!!! I am sure to come back to try other items in menu :)
