A really nice grocery store that sources some local stuff and has just about everything you can want/need.  If you are a coffee snob, like me, this place has you covered with loads of different local roasters.  Their hot bar is ok and their butcher/sea food counter is very nice.  This is one of my regular stops and am grateful I live close by.  It is good.
