I think the name of their shop is my catch phrase!  It's also my new favorite place for a treat!

We stopped in one evening to fulfill my sweet tooth.   We walked into a contemporary designed shop that is right up my alley.   Beautiful with pops of color from their towering cake designs.   

We were helped by an amazing lady with eagerness and personality beyond compare.  She informed us about this wonderful little shop with tidbits about their items.   We decided on the vanilla bean cheesecake and tiramisu.  I didn't plan on getting a macaron because here's the kicker...  I've never had one before.  Crazy?  Yes, I must have been.  Upon mentioning this to her she threw in one for free for me to try.  How nice is that?! 

We didn't stay there to eat our treats but rushed home to try them all.  Insanely great is all I can say about the macaron.  Being a macaron virgin, I can't compare it to anyone else.  I will say it was one of the best desserts I had ever had.   The light and airiness that surrounded the filling touched every taste bud with extreme delight!

As for the other desserts, fabulous as well.  They went way above the competition.  The cheesecake was creamy with the vanilla bean infused flavor.  Yum.  Tiramisu is another favorite treat of mine that they have also perfected.  They have their mastered their craft here.

With the utmost top customer service, clean contemporary shop and fabulous desserts, I just don't know if it can get any better than this.
