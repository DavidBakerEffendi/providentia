Stopped here for a later lunch after a morning/afternoon of the current Festival VB tourney. Group of 6, mostly hungry teens! We walked in and Hannah the hostess with the fing mostest greeted us. Hey girl...heyyy. She gets my vote for best hostess EVA! She was so welcoming, has a great attitude and she was joyful. Yes joyful! I even got up from my table to go back and chat with her for a few mins. Keep sparkling and doing the damn thang girl! Yasssss.

We also had an amazing waitress but I don't know how to spell her name tho(sad face). She checked on us just enough and made sure we actually were enjoying our food. 

Ok on to the food. My kiddo and I split the shrimp appetizer which was delicious, chopped salad(champagne dressing) was so good along with the fish and fries. The fish was light and not heavy but needed the vinegar or whatever you fancy and the fries were delicious... lol. We really enjoyed our food. Rest of the group had burger, grilled cheese, prime rib sandwich and the mac n cheese. They all raved how good the food was. When you are out numbered by hungry teens taller then you make sure you feed them good food folks!

Alec one of the mgrs stopped by also, he to was warm and genuinely welcoming.  Great customer service. I was feeling the A to the B y'all vibe was on point, decor modern and a lil boujee boo boo just like I like it..heyyyy now. I will definitely be making a return visit to hit them up for dinner to see how they vibe.

Thanks Yelp Fam!
