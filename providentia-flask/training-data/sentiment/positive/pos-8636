I lived in Seoul, Korea for three years.  I am not Korean, but I sure do love Korean BBQ.  I'll get bashed for using the word "authentic," but I believe the only thing missing at this place in terms of authenticity is sitting in chairs vs. sitting on the ground like in Korea.  Other than that, this place really meets the expectations for AYCE Korean BBQ.  

We hosted our daughter's two year birthday here and after we finished the AYCE, we had brought our own cupcakes.  The servers were way cool with this and also brought us sides of fruit to go with our cupcakes.  LOVE THEM for this!  Super sweet.  

My favorite part about Korean BBQ is the Banchan.  I know, I know.  Here, it is plentiful.   
Make sure you try the tongue if you want something other than the short ribs and traditional Korean BBQ meats.  You will not be disappointed.  

Hwanho, cheers!
