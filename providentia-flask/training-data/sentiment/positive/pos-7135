Wahoo's is a yeshoo!

After seeing the cute location and reading reviews I checked it out and was very happy to find the food is very good.  The fish tacos are very good, the spicy salsa is awesome.  The white rice is very tasty, unlike major chain competitors with similiar fare and the black beans tasty as well.  

Went again on another trip and tried the Kahuna Grande: selected the spicy fish taco and chicken taquitos w/guac & sour cream - very good, not greasy at all (they do not use lard), tried the white beans I like better - quite saucy with a bit of zip.

Tried the Wahoo's salad with grilled Cajun fish - this is spicily wonderful!  The fish portion was as long as the platter (not bits of meat chopped up), and the cilantro dressing quite tasty!

Try it -very nice atmosphere!
