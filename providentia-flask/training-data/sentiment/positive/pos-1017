Estrellon, or a male conjugation of "star" in Spanish, is a carefully and respectable establishment in the Capital Square restaurant block. Most of the reviews talk about the food, and I will as well, but my first visit was to hang out at the bar, so I will be focusing on that aspect. 

The food is tapas, since in America it seems all Spanish restaurants have to be tapas restaurants. But unlike other restaurants who call their plates tapas only so they could overcharge the customer, the tapas here are legitimately in the spirit of tapas. In Spain, tapas are like food carts where you pay a euro and grab a small bite of fried seafood and sangria. Here, that fundamental spirit was maintained, even if it was atop silverware and linen. All the items are small and cheap, usually around $2-$3, and a full meal will take a constellation of these. My prior experiences with tapas have been Catalonian, so there was an emphasis on seafood, but I felt that here the emphasis was more on cured meats. Whether that's a stylistic choice or merely the impossibility of procuring good seafood in Madison I don't know. 

The drinks, like the food, were well done and with expertise. I struck up a conversation with the bartender, and I learned of the fact that Wisconsin does their Old Fashioned with an orange slice and grenadine. This explained why I was always confused about why my prior orders were so sweet. The bartender there knows what he's doing, and when he accidentally made me a vodka martini when I wanted a gin one, he soundlessly gave me the correct one gratis. Good job bartender for knowing enough to know when you've made a mistake.
