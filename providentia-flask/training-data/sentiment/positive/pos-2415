Any lunch that leaves me satisfied under $8... you will probably get a 5 star rating.

The shwarma plate had lots of vegetables, from the fresh salad and pickled sides. The rice was flavorful, the meat and sauces on top, to die for!

It gets busy around lunch time during the work week (I've been twice), so be prepared to wait a bit for your meal.

If you are north of the Pape and Danforth area and looking for shwarma, this is the spot, just go.
