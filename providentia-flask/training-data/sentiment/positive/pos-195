Oh how I love La Tavola! I have eaten here many times, and it never disappoints. From the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall; but the inside is a cute, quaint, family run establishment. The best part about this place is that it's BYOB!! I usually get the shrimp and crab tortellini. It has the perfect amount of spice in the red pepper cream sauce. 
Oh, and the homemade balsamic dressing for the salads is the bomb! 
Two small cons: the service isn't very fast. Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours at the restaurant during your visit. At this point, I expect it so I plan accordingly. Also, they will NOT do separate checks. If you go with a group, they won't take more than 4 credit cards for one check- so try to bring cash! 
Anyways, La Tavola gets an A+ every time from me!
