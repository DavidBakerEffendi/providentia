This is currently our favorite place in the neighborhood -- we've been back 4 times in the past week. Can you say addicted? 

I love the atmosphere, they play 90s hiphop and 80s movies. We sat at different places each time we've gone, and each area gives you a different vibe. We sat in the patio area, the bar area facing the open kitchen and just a regular table. My favorite by far is the bar area -- I really enjoyed watching them cook and prepare the food. Makes me want to eat and order everything. The patio area was nice at night, it felt intimate, but it was just getting a little hot for me. 

The first time we tried the bone marrow, mussels, and notorious B.I.G. Burger. The mussels were my favorite, so good, I love dipping the bread in their sauce! The bone marrow was ok, I enjoyed the marrow itself but I didn't like the toppings that it came with. The burger sounded so good, pork with chicharones on top? But it wasn't as good as I hope it would be. But that didn't stop us from coming back!

The wings were good, but I thought they were small. I wouldn't order it again. The skirt steak.... I recommend though, it's the best! It comes with a chimchurri sauce and red peppers but the steak itself was just cooked so perfectly! I love their side of fries -- I love the sauce that it comes with. Wow! Garlic aioli and curry ketchup. I don't understand how I've lived without curry ketchup! I could just eat their fries with that all day! My bfs favorite is the poutine, he loves fries and cheese and this definitely doesn't disappoint! 

This used to be an old drive thru liquor store so they serve a 40 oz in a brown bag! I thought that was cool! It's busier on Friday night than on a Saturday. I'm probably going back to try more of their apps next time. I love coming here, service is amazing! Everybody's so friendly and welcoming!
