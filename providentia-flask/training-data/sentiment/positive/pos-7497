I'd be at this place all the time even if it weren't located inside my favorite gym. Healthy, fresh, low calorie, low fat breakfasts, lunches, smoothies, etc. Every menu item shows calorie content, fat content, protein, carbs, etc - and they keep it low. The staff - every last one of them - is unfailing upbeat and friendly.

Did I mention how tasty everything is?
