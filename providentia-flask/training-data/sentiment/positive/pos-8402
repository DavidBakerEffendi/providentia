My wife is obsessed with this place, and I couldn't agree with her more!!
She accidentally said italian hoagie instead of italian cheese steak when she last ordered, and when she realized, they fixed the order super quickly!! We kept the hoagie, and that was just as good as their cheese steaks!!!
When we have family visit, or friends ask us where there is good food, we always tell them to try this place!!
The portions are generous, and the food is always made to order.
The best way to order, is to call ahead, then go get it. They have it cooked and ready for you when you get there! And they are always soooo friendly!! We love the east coast atmosphere and the welcome we receive when we come in.
