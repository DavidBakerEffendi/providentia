I'm a big fan of Fuddruckers. I was excited to see this place when I was driving past the mall and stopped for lunch. I like that you can order a 1/3 or 1/2 pound burger depending on your wallet or hunger level. It's always an added bonus to add your own toppings instead of someone in the back doing it. For example, I like mustard on my burger but don't want it drenched in mustard or on the bun.

I usually order the Bison Burger but decided to order the manager's lunch special for $6.99. That includes a 1/3 pound burger plus a drink and wedge fries. I don't know if wedge fries is the proper term but I forgot how good they were. So I'll be back.
