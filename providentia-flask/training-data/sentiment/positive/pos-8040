Woot! Another cafe down, 1000 more cafes to go!! I am loving my cafe adventure, no doubt wanted to add Caf√© Replika to my list!

I knew they served food and made sure I am here for that. Oh students, students all around in December, filling up every single cafe. For the poor coffee lover that is me, it's really hard to find a seat and enjoy my cup in peace! Nonetheless here at Replika, people come and go, lots of students in December, but I managed to secure my little spot. Where people kept dragging my jacket down when they walk pass. That didn't bother me.

There is one single washroom, a little gross. That didn't bother me.

The food is gooooooooooooooood. The service! There is service here!! She will bring your cup to you. The coffee is gooooooooood. So are the baked goods! I prefer the bagels though. I loved the generous smoked salmon, which is Smit Sandwich 1. It's a toasty and tough sesame bagel (teenie sweet at the top) loaded with smoked salmon and leaves. It sounds weird but was filling!
