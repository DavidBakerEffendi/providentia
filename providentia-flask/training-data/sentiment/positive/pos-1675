This place closed a while back, quite suddenly and without much (if any) notice. Too bad, it was a favorite. 

Such a fun place, there is a great energy. The menu is full of little surprises and interesting combinations with Japenese influences. Of course the main items are sushi and they do it right. Also, for those with a sweet tooth, GET THE FUNKLER!
