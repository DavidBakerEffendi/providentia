Hands down my favorite Indian Food Establishment in the Continental U.S.  

I used to live in Vegas and frequented Mt. Everest on Sahara, and upon a recent vacation in Vegas a friend recommended this place.  It is so good that I would almost consider moving back just to be able to eat here more frequently.  It is THAT good!  

Mango Laasi was exceptional, as was the Saag Paneer.  The Hyderabadi Chicken was out of this world - the coconut milk gave exceptional balance and flavor and it wasn't too rich, as many cream-based dishes can be.  

I also love that Origin India has a naan sampler basket.  Makes the decision easy - garlic, regular, cheese, or spicy - how about ALL!
