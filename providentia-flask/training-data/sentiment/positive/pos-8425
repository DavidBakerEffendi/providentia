I've looked for a place like this in Phoenix before and they have all disappointed. I searched for a raspado place again and came across Chayos and decided to give it a try. So glad we did. The place is delicious and had a great variety of treats to choose from. I had the Tostielotes which is an awesome twist to the nachos, and the Mangoton with fresh mango and spicy candy. Def recommend.
