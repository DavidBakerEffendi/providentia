You walk into this "off the beaten path" place and instantly get the feeling of being in a warm and caring environment. The staff there are all kind and warm. It almost feels like eating at grandma's house. (If grandma was a great cook). 

This place is known for is pasties and I understand why. I had the roast beef on a kaiser and I think it was the best one I've ever had bar none. I think it was even better than the cake dessert but that was still amazing too. 

If you like pastries, you will love this place!
