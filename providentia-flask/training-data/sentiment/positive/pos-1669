We came as a group of 6 and all loved this place. The food was amazing and authentic Mexican (not the typical Westernized style you get at other places), and our server was extremely friendly and accommodating to all of us. I got the grilled chicken chimichanga and it was delish!  Everything was freshly made to your liking. Make sure to also get dessert! I had the churros (authentic Mexican style, not typical Spanish style) and was amazing, and some of the others got the Impossible Cake which was amazing too. I'll definitely be back!
