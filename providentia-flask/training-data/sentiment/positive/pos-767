Awesome experience! One of the best new restaurants I have come across in a long time. 

This hidden gem has been open about 8 months and was opened by 4 families that know each other from church. When we arrived, one of the owners greeted us personally, and checked in on us throughout the meal. The chef also came out to meet us half way through the meal. Everything we had was fantastic, and the owner and our server showed passion and enthusiasm for the food. 

While we were there, we had the cream of mushroom soup, and the french onion soup, the crepe de crevettes, the macaroni el forna, and the seafood paella. everything was made to order, fresh, and unique. the owner explained that the macaroni el forna is an israeli dish, and explained that the chef was trained in europe. the pride the owner's take in their food is obvious, the food is superb, and the owners gave us samples of a few dishes they are working on that were yummy and i would definitely come back to try. they also let us know that they are doing a wine tasting in june, which i would also come back for.  

the atmosphere is casual and cozy, and makes for an excellent, affordable dinner. the restaurant is a little tucked away and hard to find. i hope that this won't negatively effect its business because there isn't anything like this restaurant in the neighborhood, and the food is definitely worth a visit.
