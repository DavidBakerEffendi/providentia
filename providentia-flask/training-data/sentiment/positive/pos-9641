Managed to walk into this gem before the storm of people arriving. Ambience is very hip. Ordered steak+cheese, beef rib with coleslaw and a sausage roll. Pies came in a cool looking box. 

Started with the sausage roll. Crispy and flakey on the outside, nice soft sausage on the inside. All of the pies had a marvellous crisp. It was buttery and extremely flakey to the bite. Smell was irresistible and overwhelming. These pies were truly a meat pie as it was stuffed with a generous portion of meat! The coleslaw was perfect to cut through the savouriness of the flakey and buttery crust. Thank the lord that I live far from this place or I would be a mess on a daily basis.
