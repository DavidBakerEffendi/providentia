I'm a big fan of Delicious Thai. Every time my friends and I want to go for a low-key dinner, and don't want to venture too far, I take them to Delicious Thai.

Here are my favourites at the restaurant:
-Green curry chicken. I love love LOVE their Green curry chicken. Absolutely amazing sauce, and I love the array of vegetables in the curry. I am pretty sure I can literally eat it every single day.
- Papaya and shrimp salad. So unique and flavourful and light and fresh and tasty!!
- deep fried ice cream. Mmmm!!! Try it. You have to.

Their service might be a bit slow sometimes because the restaurant gets packed pretty quickly. I went yesterday on a Monday night, and every table was occupied, and there was a steady stream of people coming in the entire time I was there! Even though the service might be a bit slow, it is very courteous. Every time I have been there, I have been greeted warmly and politely. 

I love this place, and recommend it to everyone. My favourite Thai restaurant in Calgary so far.
