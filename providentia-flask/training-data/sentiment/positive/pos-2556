Wow ... I'm from NYC, and this place is one of the best, most authentic places I've ever eaten at. I came on a Sunday when there was a buffet (and I normally hate buffets), but everything was very well prepared and delicious! There was even a drink similar to a mango lassi offered at the buffet table. I also ordered a mango lassi, which was one of the best I've ever had! The service was also amazing, quick, friendly, and efficient. LOVE this restaurant!
