I generally feel like anything that could find itself smack dab in the middle of a strip mall, isn't something worth my time.

Alas, I was honestly impressed with B - spot.  

My favorite thing about it is that they actually cooked the burgers as you like them.  None of that "well done" crap that most restaurants throw at you.   I ordered the Medium Rare, which if you look at the board at the front - means you should be expecting a "cool center".  It was PERFECT!  

Overall, I've been told about Bspot and with all the hype, I didn't think it could live up to it.  It did indeed though.  It did, indeed.
