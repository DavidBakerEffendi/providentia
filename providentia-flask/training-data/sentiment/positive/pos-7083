Nothing like ambiance of a Big Ten college bar, mixed with the smell of stale beer and deep-fried appetizers.

Happy hour was ridiculous at this joint. Pitchers of beer cost whatever time it was. Yes, you read that correctly. At 4 p.m. my group of friends and I rolled into State Street Brats to find the building packed with Wisconsin and Michigan State football fans. We plumped down about $40 bucks and got six pitchers of beer and some orders of deep-fried cheese-curds (better mozzarella sticks).

Didn't eat a brat, but the cheese curds were as good as people say they are. I especially loved the upstairs of this two-story bar. We sat down at a long counter that was elevated above the staircase and that faced a huge T.V. 

It also had a mammoth statue of Captain Morgan which was the difference between a four star review and a five star review.

I suggest this restaurant to anyone who visits Madison. Make sure you try out the cheese curds and get there early for the cheap beer.
