I've driven by this place so many times and never stopped in until now, don't make the same mistake. Once you walk through the door you will immediately feel the the hometown vibe that you don't find very often. It's so straight forward long straight bar to the left tables to the right a few TVs, a few beer signs and a lot of friendly people. This definitely could be my local hangout.

They're famous for their Lake Erie Perch and let me tell you a lot of places in northeast Ohio claim to serve authentic perch from the lake due north but few consistently do. This is no doubt the best fried Lake Erie Perch I've ever eaten, lightly battered, fried perfectly, it's truly heavenly. I'm not a huge fan of side dishes when I'm eating fish this good but the fresh hand cut fries were awesome.

There are a few other things I found to be exceptional here.

The service - the prices - and the homemade warm chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream with whipped cream (this is a must try when they have it)

I can't wait to return......
