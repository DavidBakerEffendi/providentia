was in yesterday for the fresh falafels.  They are aaamazing.  When I'm in a hurry, sure I'll take the pre made ones.  But I find I just had to wait for the fresh falafels.  As she broke them open, they were steaming with goodness, and she loaded the pita with amazing fresh vegetables and a little spicy peppers(perfection), it was a little hot, but not a burn where you can't taste anything, "just right".   This is the best food of the gods, and its right here in calgary.  Best falafel in calgary.  PitaPit/extremepita, all the other places, nothing compared to this.
