Pleasantly surprised. 

My gf and I were looking for an ayce sushi place in DT Toronto when we stumbled upon this place. Even though it wasn't all you can eat, it was definitely worth it. 

Upon walking in, it looks like your typical small take out sushi place with a small eating area. I wasn't too impressed with the eating area but once  the sushi came, it made me forget all about the small eating area. I was in a "foodies" paradise for the remainder of my meal. We ordered the sushi/sashimi combo and both were outstandingly fresh. The prices were fair and they have unlimited free green tea while you wait/eat. The staff was nice and attentive. What more could one ask for? 

Ps. We never received a complimentary handroll while waiting but I'm not devastated, I would definitely come back here.
