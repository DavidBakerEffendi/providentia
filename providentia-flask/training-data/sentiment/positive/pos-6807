This is now on my list of Go-To places in Vegas for Happy Hour(s) 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 pm (drink/app prices increase $1/hr). And both the drinks and apps offered are THE BEST menu items!! I ordered the Long Island Iced Tea...OMG, delicious with fried pickles, street tacos.

The place is Ginormous, with bars extending into the Casino, a bar on the street, and a bar in between. I chose the street bar, where the bartendress was WORKING HER ASS OFF, professionally serving customers while waiting for the relief bartender to appear! Most impressive.

I strongly encourage anyone wishing to visit the NY-NY side of the strip to target this place 4-5 PM..
