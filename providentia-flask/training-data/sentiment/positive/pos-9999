I know my way around a chicken shawarma and I have to say Jimmy's might be the best Lebanese style chicken shawarma I have had to-date.

Upon entering this unassuming corner store you are blasted with the heat from all of their spits spinning their meaty deliciousness. Your order is written on a paper bag, giving you time to browse at all of the Mediterranean/middle eastern grocery items and the cases containing samosas, Jamaican patties, falafel, salads, and amazing looking baklava & sweets while your order is being made.

The lady at the checkout, who I suspect might be a co- owner, was absolutely delightful and would be a reason to return even if the food was simply mediocre - but it wasn't. How she could call the behemoth that she handed me a "small" is beyond comprehension.

I ordered "the works" and boy did it work. The chicken was moist and spiced to perfection. They were very generous with the meat portion so it was present in abundance in every bite. These bad boys are a tad messy to eat so it is nice that Jimmy's has quite a few outdoor tables to sit at. I think I will have to return before I leave to put the bug in their ear about moving or opening a branch in Vancouver!
