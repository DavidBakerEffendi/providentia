This is one of my favorite small plate restaurants in Charlotte. All of their food was excellent having unique flavors, my favorite was the Brussel sprouts. In addition to the food they have an extensive craft beer selection and focus on North Carolina beers. All of this is wrapped up with a relaxing  sports bar type atmosphere. Pint Central has become one of my favorite restaurant destinations in Charlotte!
