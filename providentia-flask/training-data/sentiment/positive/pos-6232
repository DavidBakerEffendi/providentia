This is a definite Vegas classic, never to be duplicated. Well, let's be honest. It should be against the law to duplicate it. One is enough for the world. 

The diner is standard yet with massive portions deli fare, with decent sandwiches and stuff like that. Pro tip: Get the multicolored sprinkles for your shake or dessert. I don't know why but they have them so indulge!

The fireside lounge, on the other hand, is where it is at. Fake fire places, neon lights, velour couches, massive frozen drinks bigger than your head, and a cheesy ambiance beyond anything you could possible imagine truly define the scene. Check out the pictures if you must but instead, just go there and experience it for once. You may regret it but it is still worth it!
