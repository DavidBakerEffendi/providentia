This local famous restaurant is a fun place to eat for lunch.  Everytime I come to Phoenix I have to complete my trip by eating there.  Their chinese-mexican mixed foods are tasty.  The line is always there but the foods are served fast.  I always want to try different combo but end up eating Emerald Chicken and Jerk Chicken because they are that yummy.

While you are there check out their chinese proverbs T-shirt.
