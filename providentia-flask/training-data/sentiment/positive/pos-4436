I am a huge fan of hand pulled noodles and I'm so glad that GB opened up so close to me! I've tried the jellyfish app, Lanzhou beef soup noodles as well as the noodles with homemade pork sauce. Both noodles were delicious but I think I prefer the noodle soup. I also like that there is varying noodle sizes so that I hopefully get to try all of them and figure out what I like. The noodles are handmade in front of you essentially and comes out chewy. If you are noodle lover like myself, you must come here! I haven't been let down so far with my two visits so I will definitely be coming back for my handmade noodle fix. Lastly, a tip for couples- share a Mega size bowl.
