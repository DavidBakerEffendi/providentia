We met another couple here for drinks and dinner and were impressed with the ambiance, decor and service which was very attentive and friendly. Drinks were great and so was the food: very reasonably priced and something for everyone. Large servings, good quality, tasty and all round a very enjoyable evening. While we didn't bring any furry friends with us, we were very happy to see they had a dog friendly patio and have over 20 locations from California to Las Vegas and apparently soon in the Florida panhandle. As full time travelers and RVers, this is definitely a place we would return to and recommend, especially to those who like to take their dogs to restaurants and want to feel welcome. Good job Lazy Dog!
