This place has high " Wow" factor to it.  It's up north way from the strip. The food is excellent and beats anything I've had down on the strip.  Place is also the oldest steak house in Vegas and started out as the guys home.  It's a Vegas treasure that one must find on there own. Hardly any tourist here at all.  You'll enjoy yourself
