I returned to Rani yesterday, and the food was amazing.  Yes,the service may be a bit lacking, but the food is not.  I bought the methi trepla from the counter to eat at home, and it so delicious.  It reminded me of a paratha made with methi, it was so fresh and fragrant.  Very glad I gave it a second try.  I do wish the restroom were better taken care of.
