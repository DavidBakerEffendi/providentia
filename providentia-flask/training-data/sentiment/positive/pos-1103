The food was awesome!!! I was at the hard rock hotel and the restaurant was downstairs in the lobby next to nobu. The lady who took my order was the nicest ever. They brought it up to my room. The lady who brought it up was friendly and so nice - we talked about our kids and her living in Vegas. If I was there longer, we would have gone again. Priced well too!
