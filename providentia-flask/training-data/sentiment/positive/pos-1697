Driving past this place today and noticed it has now opened. Piquing my curiosity, two of us ventured in for lunch. 
What strikes you first is that from the outside, the restaurant seems tiny, but inside it it fairly large. Decorated with warm woods and minimal clutter, it is a great addition to the concrete plaza it sits in. We were greeted at the door and seated promptly. The menu is on an iPad, so you can peruse the items at your leisure. It seems as though the main thrust of their business will be the all you can eat menu, however, seeing as how we were there for lunch, we ordered a-la-carte. 
I ordered the Terryaki Bento meal, my dining companion opted for the General Tao Bento. First to arrive was a small salad and a miso soup. The salad was excellent (with a peanut dressing)...but I'm not a fan of Miso (too salty for me) so it just sat there. I did taste it...but seeing as how I don't like it, this didn't change my mind.
Next came out our California Rolls..6 rolls per bento meal. They were excellent.
While scarfing down the rolls, our bento boxes arrived. They contained the meat selection, 2 spring rolls, vegetables and white rice. It was a ton of food and I couldn't finish it all, despite the fact it was deliscious. 
Food was of an excellent quality and not overly expensive.
Staff were attentive but not in an in your face kind of way. 
I'll definitely be going back to do the all you can eat option.
Great addition to the neighbourhood.
