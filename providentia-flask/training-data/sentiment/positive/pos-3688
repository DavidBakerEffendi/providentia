This is such a great location. The staff is super friendly, and is consistently fast. There's been a few times they have my drink ready before I even walk over to the pick-up counter. AND, I love that it's always the same staff. I've been going here for almost two years and I recognize almost every face in there. Low turn-over tells you what type of place it is.

Their crafted pressed coffee is legitttttt. Wayyyyy better than Starbucks cold brew, and I'm actually biased more towards Starbucks. If you want to kick it up a notch, try the White Chocolate Crafted Press. Dessert in a cup, with the added bonus of caffeine! 

Great coffee + great service = happy me.
