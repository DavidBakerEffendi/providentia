absolutely deliciousness!!

came here based on a recommendation from a friend and we really enjoyed ourselves. 

it's a boutique location with that old Manhattan feel to it. 

we had the butter chicken pie and the chicken bacon one. they were nice enough to split it up in half for us and package it in separately.

it was so flavourful and and the pastry was so fluffy, not greasy at all! totally enjoyed my visit here and i will return!
