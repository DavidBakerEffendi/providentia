I've been to Joe Maxx twice now - both times for a double espresso Machiatto - made with Half and Half.

Both times the drink has been strong and delicious! Just really tasty espresso!

Joe Maxx is located right in the midst of the craziness of Cleveland State University (CSU). It's very small inside - and because of it's close proximity to CSU - there are periods where the place gets packed with students coming in for their caffeine fix.

Parking can be a problem here.
