We are from Las Vegas, and we have eaten a lot of amazing steaks at home - but this is literally the BEST steak I have ever eaten. The filet is crusty and salty, and cooked to perfection. Our waiter, Colby, said on Friday and Saturday's the grill guy "bobby" works and is the best grill master ever. 

We also had the butcher platter and that was the best cheese and meat selection ever. It only included 2 cheese and 2 meats, but it also had bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, cherry marmalade, mustard and deviled eggs, plus the thick cuts of crusty bread with a balsamic drizzle. Unreal. Seriously so amazing. 

We live 300~ miles away and we will come back to Phoenix just to come back to this restaurant. Can not miss.
