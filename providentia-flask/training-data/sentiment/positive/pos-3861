I have loved eating at Kneader's every time we go to Utah now I'm so happy to have them local! My only complaint is that they aren't closer to me. 

I went for lunch during the first week they opened, the staff was amazing and helpful and the food was great! My kids both had kids combos, my eldest literally drank every last drop of his chicken noodle soup, I ordered the Chicken Ala Mondo salad and my Mom (1st trip for her) ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia. We were all impressed, the kids sugar cookies were so good we had to go back and get more. 

Next trip there will be for breakfast, can't wait for the french toast!!
