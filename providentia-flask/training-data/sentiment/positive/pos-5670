My review of this place is super late considering the fella and I come here at least once or twice a month.

Unlike some other places, DWs puts as much emphasis on quality as quantity. The 60 taps are always thoughtful, sometimes rare, and obviously plentiful. The bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable, and they take their beer seriously, but they aren't snooty about it. The fella is a beer nerd, and I'm a total novice, and we both love it. Even the food is surprisingly delicious for "bar food."

We typically go during the day on a Saturday, so neither the parking lot nor the inside is very crowded, but this is always our go-to when we're looking for a comfy, casual place to drink. There are a bazillion TVs in the bar and the restaurant, and they have free wi-fi, so it's a great place to watch a game or just hang out with friends.
