I had a great experience at this place. Even though there was a line up we were quickly given a number and seated within 5 minutes. To be honest I'm getting a bit bored with shaved ice after being to Snow Time so many times. The shaved ice here is excellent if not better than Snow Time. I found the shaved ice here to be a bit more sweet. I aslo ordered a yam rice cake topped with a layer of melted cheese. Its worth a try but not something I would crave for. Pricing is comparable to other shaved ice places. There is a bit more seating than Snow Time. Service was quite fast for how busy it was on a Friday night. I gave Snow Time a 5 star so I have to be fair and give this place a 5 star.
