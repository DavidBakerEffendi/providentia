Hidden just east of the busy financial district at the intersection of Victoria & Richmond streets, Bob's Bulgogi is a rare gem that serves up delicious bulgogi to those who are lucky enough to be in the know.

It's quite small in here, so don't plan on dining in unless one of the four seats is available. Two are bar stool style and the other two are somewhat cramped benches at the front window. Aside from that small inconvenience, it's a dope takeout spot.

Any Bulgogi dish

The Bulgogi is as good as you'd expect it to be. I recommend the spicy beef. There's no doubt that I'll have everything on the menu before too long. Prices aren't too steep either, considering the portion sizes. They play hiphop, R&B and trap music which may catch you off guard. It didn't bother me at all. Definitely a dope little gem on the east side of downtown.
