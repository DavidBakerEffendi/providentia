Brought my lady to this place for a dinner date. Nothing extravagant but this place is new to me and the location I wasn't familiar with.  I researched this place on Yelp and saw all the great reviews it had. 4 stars and over 36 reviews. I knew I had to try something new and this seemed to be it. I came here on a Friday (Yesterday) late night around 9 pm and although not crazy busy, I came for the food and what the hype was based upon the reviews. 

I had a server named Miranda which was great! She was very polite came around enough but not too much to make it inconvenient. 

Why this place was absolutely phenomenal. 
1. Excellent customer service
2. AMAZING food. The chips are inexpensive and it is a large amount. Chips are one of the best chips I have had in a long time. 
3. Great prices on the beers and liquor. I asked for a gummy bear and they made one of the best ones I have tasted in a while. 

Overall, this place is not close to me at all; however I raved to my friends about it and there was not one thing that I didn't love about it. I am definitely going to this sports bar again and soon. 

Big Guy's just became in my first visit alone one of my top 5 bars to go to for food and drinks. 


Oh and lastly, I'm sure this place gets packed for sports because they have an open floor plan and DOZENS of flat screen TV's. 

If it wasn't for Yelp and for the reviews this place received I would have never known about this awesome place!
