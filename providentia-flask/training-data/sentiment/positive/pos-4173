This place is the bomb! The prime rib is some of the best I have ever had. The fish absolutely melts in your mouth. Love the outside seating which is what we usually opt for. The one time we sat inside it was so hot we were sweating and had to ask if they could turn the air down. It is crazy packed on the weekends but that's to be expected. Give yourself enough time to get down there and wait! Service has always been really good. I love bringing people here who have never been! Yummy
