I go to Vegas about once a year and have been since the days of Comdex (remember that one, kiddies?), and The Buffet at the Bellagio is still the best in Vegas, fighting off challengers like Wynn and Cosmopoitan (Wicked Spoon). Here are the two main reasons why:

1) For $38 for their weekend gourmet dinner, you get an immense selection of relatively high quality food. Go to a very ordinary non-buffet restaurant on The Strip and Vegas and $38 gets you a very mediocre steak and maybe an appetizer. At the Bellagio, you get an unlimited amount of relatively expensive foods like prime rib, Chilean sea bass, Kobe beef, sushi, Peking duck, etc.

2) The selection is more plentiful and higher quality than at Wynn and The Wicked Spoon. Sure, if you like a smaller selection of lower quality food *but* in small, expensive containers that's made in France, go to The Wicked Spoon. That actually adds negative value for me as the superfluous containers takes up previous space on my plate!

After all these years, the Buffet at the Bellagio is still the best.
