So glad that there is an Argentinian restaurant in Vegas. Being that my family is from Argentina I am used to home cooked Milanesa, Empanadas, ribs etc. Although this place has no luster to it, the food is so close to home cooking its awesome. From Alfajores to Flan all the treats are there too. Its a Deli/Restaurant which makes it convenient if you want to take some meat or other Argentinian snacks home with you. Overall great tasting food with good prices and will have me coming back in the future.
