I love you Big Bertha!  Your desserts are "OMG" goodness and are priced a third of what I would pay for!  I tried the Salami Pesto and the Asparagus Havarti Sandwiches and they are both good. The cookie that is included with your meal is always the cherry on top of your meal! Average, you spend $7 for a sandwich and a cookie.  

In addition, the peanut butter brownie is HEAVEN!  

Big Bertha, you are so good to me.
