Second year in a row here:  I give it full ratings not because I liked the particular type of food overall (more fishy seafood, whole fish, big jiggly squid parts, etc) but for the originality of the menu and the unique experience it offers.  Well decorated, impeccable service with (at least ours) Portuguese waiters.  Fancy yet not totally killer on the wallet.  Of course being a queasy fish guy I ordered the steak: it was huge!   Servings generous.  For desert I think I had the most bitter thing ever created: espresso with a nasty bitter strong alcohol (forgot the name) which I managed to gag down....all part of the experience.
