Amazing noodles, broth, service and side dishes. My fiance didn't like the noodles slapping sounds as they were being made but I loved it because I know my noodles are being made fresh! It's a pretty small space and it's often completely packed because of people coming from sick kids but it's worth lining up for. The mega size easily fed 2 of us and their tea egg and jellyfish were on point. Get the second largest round noodles size and spicy broth and you will be in heaven. There's a hand pulled noodles place on Dundas as well but don't go there this place is infinitely better. Will come here a lot!
