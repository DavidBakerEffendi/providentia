IN LOVE! This hole in the wall is amazing. Don't let the appearance lead you a stray! the staff is awesome and always waiting on you in a quick manner. The food is great authentic food that is very fresh. The margaritas are fantastic and very cheap. I need to learn to venture out on this menu, but I usually stick with what I know and order a number nine. I love bringing out of state family here to experience this gem. I might become a well known customer real soon as the pace I enjoy eating here.
