I absolutely love this dance studio. I have known Amber and Mike for about 12 years and they are the most giving and caring people I know. Not only do they work hard to keep the children happy and healthy but they are incredible teachers. I wouldn't want my child to go anywhere else. Thank you Adaptive Force!
