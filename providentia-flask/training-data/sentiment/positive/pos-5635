Bottomless mimosas for 21 bucks inside the gorgeous Wynn hotel and an order of chicken and waffles that came with a spicy syrup made for quite a perfect brunch. 

The coffee was also delicious and they kept the pot full and hot. 

Service was at times lacking (mainly when we wanted more mimosas) but that's the one complaint. 

Did I mention the chicken and waffles. Drool. So good.
