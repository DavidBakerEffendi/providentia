Wow! I'm so glad my friends and I stop by this place! Came in and we were greeted very professionally and got seated right away. We had 2 servers taking care of us, Mary and another Asian lady. They were both very nice and sweet! We started ordering and when our sushi came out the rice was purple! I started thinking "omg what the heck, it's not gonna be good." I was wrong! It was the best sushi I had so far! The rice was so soft and the tuna was so fresh. We also order Gyoza and those were pretty good. More sushi came out and let me say, they were all good! I love it here. The vibe is very nice and the decorations were very modern. Great service, fair price for sushi, I will definitely come back again!
