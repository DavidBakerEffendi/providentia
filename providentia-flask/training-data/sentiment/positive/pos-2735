I was absolutely blown away with the dish I had, the lemon roasted half chicken. Absolutely divine and easily the best chicken I have ever had. The ambiance here is stunning, food is great, and menu looked fantastic! Definitely pricey, but if you want to impress, this is a winner. Cant wait to go back!
