finally a ramen place that has light and not too oily broth. I typically don't care for chashu but this place cooks it perfectlyyyy. it's a pretty simple small menu. 

although a few downsides to this place would be that it's really small, not really accommodating for parties for more than 4. even 4 people may be pushing it if it's packed. and there's no vegan options. 

I do wish to see if they would do appetizers one day. but for now, I'm content with what they have. :) 

TLDR: want ramen but don't want a heavyish broth? come here.
