After reading the back and forth reviews we were a little unsure of what we were walking into.

We started with oysters which were a bit small but delicious. We split both the lobster mac and cheese, which was huge, and a lobster roll, which were both fantastic. Yes the lobster roll was small, it's a lobster sandwich, what else do you people want for $11? Order 2 next time if you're so upset about how large it isn't. The chips on the side were great, much preferred them to the usual french fries you get everywhere else.

The best part of the experience was the service. Our server looked like he just walked in from a skate park and started picking up tables but he could not have done a better job. Friendly, accommodating and even brought us a free drink on the house just because.

Couldn't recommend this place more.
