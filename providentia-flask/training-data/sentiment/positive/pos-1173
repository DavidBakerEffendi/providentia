I literally live right around the corner from here and come about once a week or every other week. The staff here is super friendly and the food is pretty quick to get to you after you order. The selection is amazing and the waffles and toppings they offer are def mouth watering. Its different but in a good way and i dont know how else to explain it lol but if you like your waffles sweet topped or looking for a more salty styled breakfast topping they have it here. If your a waffle fan either salty or a sweet toothed kinda person you need to hit this place up. Parking is free and its easy to find. Hit them up and make sure you get there red velvet pancakes....soooooooo goooooood
