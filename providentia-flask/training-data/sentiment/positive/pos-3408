Forget about Chinatown if you're looking for good, authentic TASTY pho, Pho Lien is the best place in Montreal for this Vietnamese comfort soup, but don't take my word for it. Just ask any of your friends in the Vietnamese community and they will tell you the exact same thing.

It's a bit on the small side, they only take cash and if you can, try to go during it's off-hours since there is usually a line up here. Service is very fast, prices are super cheap. The food is also very fresh and very tasty. A large Pho soup will fill you up for the whole day, no joke. I also found their spring rolls to be outstanding. 

Their pho soup is like the nectar of the gods especially on super cold and windy January days!
