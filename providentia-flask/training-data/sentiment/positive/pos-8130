I was craving some good homemade Italian food minus me being the one to make it homemade so I opted for take out. I was able to easily order through Yelp and pick up my order within 20 mins.

My boyfriend and I shared the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti and some breaded mushrooms. This was easily enough for the two of us to share and the total was only around $20. I loved the sauce they used and the food was all cooked perfectly. I'd definitely return again.
