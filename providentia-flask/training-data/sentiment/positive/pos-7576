We just got back from here.

Every time we go, everyone's happy. This is a GREAT place to get a frozen treat, not just in the summer. They have Blizzards of over a dozen flavors. Right now (gotta find out until when exactly), blizzard of the month featured are girl Scout mint cookies! 

They have a special menu (for now) that's 2 for $3, 3 for $4 and 4 for $5. Inside they have posters of cars and Americana that's not just limited to the 50's. they also make ice cream caked for kids' parties. they also have a window with DQ logo wear. But, the first time I went there it was packed, and since, the stock has gotten lower and lower. I'm waiting for them to replenish so I can get a button up/ uni type shirt.

Love this place!
