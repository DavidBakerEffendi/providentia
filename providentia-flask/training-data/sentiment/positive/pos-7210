Based on the three things I tasted this place was amazing, I am not vegan but the vegan vegetarian pizza is one of the best pizza I've had. I also tried angel but dessert which is vegan too was delicious. I started it all off with their margarita which was good average nothing special but maybe they should try something like mango or watermelon margarita because someone knew what they were doing ! If you have a vegan friend this is the place to go with them ! So good I'll be back soon !
