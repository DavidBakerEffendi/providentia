Go to this place now!  Served is a quaint little spot in Henderson with a chef who has big ideas and the skill set to pull them off splendidly.  The restaurant is quaint and rather small which is totally fine as it seems more inviting this way.  I happened to go on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all which rocked.  The service was great and waitress was very attentive and kind.  She told us a bit about the place and the chef and how he makes just about everything from scratch which was pretty awesome to hear.
Now to the food.  It rocked!  I got the miso pork burger which I assumed to be a burger made of pork but it turns out the miso pork came on top of the burger which made it stand about 66 inches or so tall.  Literally every bite oozed juice, that's how well it was made.  It was outstanding and the mac salad on the side was quite refreshing and a good accompaniment.  The rest of my group got the tempura shrimp po'boy, the banh mi, and the berry french toast, all of which, according to them, were fantastic as well.   
I don't know if it's because it wasn't that busy or because this is just how he is but the chef came over and welcomed us after our meal and thanked us for eating there, asked us how we enjoyed it, and if we needed anything else which was an extremely kind gesture.  I am definitely going back here and want to try everything on the menu!
