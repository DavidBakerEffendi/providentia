Took mom there for dinner yesterday. Great experience. Very good food. And the waiter is super nice. I got the groupon but still ended up paying over 60 but its definitely worth it. 

Accidentally ordered the bottled Italian spring water. Thought its free. lol~~~ Why would it be? Love the bottle so asked waiter if I can take it home. Answer is YES. May use it as vase in the future.

We skipped the appetizer but got the mushroom soup. Totally loved it. Like the texture. Creamy but not too much. Light and tasty.

Entree for mom is Main lobster. Very fresh. Food amount is decent.  I had the lamp. Made this decision because quite a few yelper said great thing about this dish. Totally enjoyed it. Very tender.  Melt in my mouth. We took waiter's suggestion and ordered the chocolate souffle. Maybe Im not a souffle person. Not a big fan of it. But the table next to us cleaned the whole thing up. So my opinion may not be that helpful.

Overall, great dinning experience. Will go back if they offer another groupon deal some day.
