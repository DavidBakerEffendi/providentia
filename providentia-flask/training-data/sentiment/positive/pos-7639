Selection, selection, selection. This place has one of the rarest beers in the world on their list and we savored every moment of the experience!!! The service was great, they accommodate to us outside when the weather appeared to be getting warmer outside and they also helped us to navigate to our next stop for the day. Great neighborhood and a place we will make a point to return to on our next visit.
