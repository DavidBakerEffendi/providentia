Came here for the car wash and ended up having one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've had in Arizona. This place really is one of the "Yelpiest" businesses in the Scottsdale area due to its unusual combination of offerings.

It's a massive convenience market in a sense, everything from a gas station/car wash to a BBQ bistro and convenience store inside. 

The sandwich was nothing short of delicious, and I tried 3 of their home made sauces which were all very good.  All of the staff were great, especially since I was a first timer and Tom's can be a bit overwhelming when you first arrive. I'm 100% sold on this place now, and I'll definitely be returning to try the brisket - and maybe a car wash too.
