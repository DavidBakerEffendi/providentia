Was going to go to subway for a salad but saw the gyro salad.  Thought hey give it a try.  The lady taking our order was very friendly they were very busy putting order together. The cook was absolutely great with customer service talking to all walking up to the counter to look when we were given our salad he made sure to tell us that the olives had pits  
Being from out of town we return the gyro salad was just as great as the first one same great customer service so nice to go to a restaurant time and again and get the great service and food
