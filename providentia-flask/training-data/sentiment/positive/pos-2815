Went here with a couple of friends for a late lunch after aborting the trip to another restaurant that was west of 7 and 404 when the traffic was insanely slow

Considering it was 1:30pm, the place was still pretty packed.  That's usually a good sign.

Looking through the menu I can feel my wallet thinning away already.  The prices were a bit on the higher end.

My friends were hungry so they ordered the kalbi and Soon Tofu while I waited for the $50 sashimi platter (which was the cheapest party tray they had with the most pieces)

Since this was a Korean place as well we did get some appetizers, though it was good it was just two: sweet potatoes (yum) and some other thing which I didn't like as much.

Their food arrived first.  The Soon tofu looked spicy so I didn't bother trying it.  I had one piece of the kalbi.  That was enough of a turn off for me.

Eventually the main event came and a big tray of sashimi had arrived.

All I can say was yum overall.

They had (in order from dislike to like):
* shrimp heads uncooked, didn't bother.  They need to deep fry this sucker before I'd eat it.

* semi-cooked butter fish, didn't like that one too much.  Left my mouth feeling a bit icky.

* Something wrapped in squid.  Though I never liked squid sashimi, this was actually quite good.

* Surf clam / Octopus / Red Snapper (run of the mill)

* Variety of RED tuna (not that white crap) tasty

* Shrimp sashimi ooh.

* Variety of salmon parts.  Though my friend didn't like to eat it because it wasn't "cleaned" properly, personally I liked the inner skin of the salmon as it gives it a bit of a real fish taste.

* mackarel with roe attached to it, never had it like that before and it was yummy yummy.

* finally they had what could be the equivalent of ootoro in salmon form.  My friend also says they normally though this part out, but oh man it was sooooo good.  It was very fatty and buttery feel in my mouth.  I put the thing in my mouth, bite, let the flavor waft inside, savor, repeat.

Something that tastes that good is likely bad for me but I don't care :)

I would come here again, even though it's significantly pricey.
