Food Truck Fav right here!

I've been wanting to try Pizza People's Pizza for a while now.  I found out they were setting up at 180 Degree's Automotive and I figured if Bogi was hosting them then I needed to check them out!  I finally caught up with them at Local Fest.

Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $8 but she assured me it was yummy!  First of all $8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal!  Secondly, Bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world...and I trust her implicitly....so I ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes.  I ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato.  I took it back to my table to share with my Mama (who is also gluten free) and we both said at about the same time: " Oh, my gosh this is really good!"   Something I've only said about twice since eating gf pizza!

The sauce is fresh, the dough was the best gf dough I've had to date and the toppings were just divine.  I need to put a GPS tracking unit on this truck so I can track it daily! (Oh, wait.........I can just check their facebook page!)  Yeah, I'd eat it daily!  It's that good!
