Great food and customer service. Erick was very attentive and constantly came to check on us. I ordered the Boozie Pancakes (Cinnamon Toast Crunch). They even included the delicious milk that is left at the bottom of the cereal in a cup next to the pancakes. I would definitely recommend, just wish they would have included syrup with this order. The environment is very loud, and upscale being Scottsdale of course.
