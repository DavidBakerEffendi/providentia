Johnny B's is one of my favorite Belmont spots! It's a more affordable and slightly more relaxed option than most offerings in downtown Belmont.

Pretzel drops are a must-have to start. Dough drops come baked to perfection and tossed in a parmesan-butter sauce. (And they are always tossing out coupons for free ones--double bonus! Your Yelp check-in can even get you free ones!) There's no way to go wrong with their pizzas either. I'm a classic girl and tend to err towards a plain ol' pepperoni pizza. It's always positively perfect! Service is always fast & attentive as well!

Life Hack: If you're wanting a cozier night at home, for just a few dollars, you can also order fresh dough from Johnny B's and make your own pizza at home, too!
