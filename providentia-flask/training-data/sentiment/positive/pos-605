When we are in the mood for a guaranteed good pizza, we get dominos. The large one topping hand tossed pizza with the garlic crust is great! See photo for visualization. Usually we do pick up and you have to leave your house once the order is placed as the pizza is done within 10 minutes.

Last night we ordered delivery with all the rain. It only took exactly 32 mins from when I submitted order online to being at my door! Very fast especially with all the rain.

Pizza has great flavor as long as you know it is different type of pizza than a Rosati's pizza. Highly recommended ever once in a while.

They do get a bad mark for not having any pepper or cheese packets ever! They told me they stopped stocking them! Wow! So make sure you have your own on hand!
