This is the best Thai food I have ever had. This includes approximately 10 months living in and visiting Thailand on multiple trips over a decade.

The service was great.  We had a party of 5 fairly adventurous foodies, and our server (T) helped us select dishes.  We had Panang Duck curry -- amazing.  Drunken noodles (very good, but not really special).  Really good green curry.  Another highly spiced curry (amazing).  Some amazing pork belly.  Great soup (the unique one they serve; I'm sure the classics are good too). A couple great appetizers.

It was great getting the check for 5 at the end: $110. Even with a good tip, this is less than I've spent as a single diner on the strip for a far lesser meal.

Another nice thing about the restaurant: open until 3am.  A new favorite late night place.

Strongly recommend!  If you want great Thai food, fly to Las Vegas, not Bangkok!
