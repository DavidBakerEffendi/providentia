Vegan, gluten-free pizza. Vegan, gluten-free pizza that doesn't taste like sickly sweet cardboard covered in greasy plastic. Vegan, gluten-free pizza that is delicious and something you'd share with friends if you didn't already burn your palate shoving it in to your face?

This is a great place off the strip with delicious thin-crust pizza, with any of the options easily made vegan with their Daiya mozarella. And unlike a lot of places, they know how to get that bubbly, golden crust on the Daiya, so it doesn't turn in to a weird, goopy, oily and sweet mess that happens at a lot of other pizza places that so kindly offer it on their menus. I got the Truffle Oil and Mushroom Pizza, swapping the brie for Daiya, and it was probably the best pizza I've had in a long time. Easily in my top five for vegan pizzas.

Also a winner? Their "Wok'd" Sesame Shishito Peppers. It would've probably been something I would've glossed over by myself, but I'm so glad that my friend ordered them because I nearly polished off the plate. So good, and simple. Now that I'm back home, I daydream about them.

Great service, a lovely patio, and amazing vegan options? Love.
