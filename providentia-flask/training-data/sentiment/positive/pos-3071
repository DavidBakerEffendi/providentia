This is about as authentic as you will find in the US. The Pizza is great .  The meat and cheese platters and bruschettas are very good.  The Italian wine selection is excellent, not the junk you find in most places.  This owner really knows his wines.  Most comes from a distributer, Chianti.  I had a bottle of 2009 Unmerto Cesare from Romanga the other day thats was outstanding, 85% Sangiovese and 15% Cabernet, 91 points rated by Parker.  It was excellent and you can buy it to take out for $22.  Oh the nutella.banana calzone for desert with a giant scoop of ice cream tops of the dinner..
