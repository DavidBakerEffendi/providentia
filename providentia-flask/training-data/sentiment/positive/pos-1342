I love pizza, especially Neapolitan pizza. I've eaten more margherita pizzas here than I can count and every time my love for pizza grows stronger.
We came for Valentines Day and I chose the "special pizza" with red sauce, mozzarella, basil and Cayenne maple glazed soppressata, really good, but my heart lies with the traditional margherita! The Capo Saisson was the perfect match, definitely a keeper.

PS Thank you Libretto for the sweet VDay treat, a pink and white meringue
