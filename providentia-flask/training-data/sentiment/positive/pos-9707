I came here with my girlfriend's parents who were in from out of town.  We were looking for something light and vegetabley because we did Korean BBQ for lunch.  Remembering the a la carte style of ordering from glancing at the menu as we went by in the past,  we chose Cardinal Rule.  Oh boy am I glad!  Our group tried the: Potato and leek latkes,  squish squash quesadilla,  beef brisket panini,  mango cold rolls and a salad with goat cheese,  apples and candied pecans.  Everything was so good.  I am not a food aficionado,  but everything seemed fresh,  the ingredients were high quality,  and the flavours were intense.  Additionally,  the server (owner? I am not sure) was fantastic.  Very helpful,  attentive without being in our faces and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I will absolutely be back to Cardinal Rule,  and I'll be telling as many people as I can to do the same.
