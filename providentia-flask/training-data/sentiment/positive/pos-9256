Although this place is always packed, it's completely worth it. The service usually isn't very good but the food makes up for it. This last time we were here my nephew was being fussy (two years old) and the waitress was so kind to him. She was able to calm him down and have small short conversations with him. He doesn't usually respond well to strangers but she was so friendly that he melted into her hands. I wish I remembered her name but she was amazing. Again the food is great and the wait is worth it.
