I DREAM about their Chicken Tikka Masala! I add vegetables which is extra but well worth it. We were dying for some last night, and got caught up at Best Buy waaaay too long. We came running into Marigold 25 minutes to closing and they were gracious night to serve us.  It was greatly appreciated and is still amazing next day as leftovers !
