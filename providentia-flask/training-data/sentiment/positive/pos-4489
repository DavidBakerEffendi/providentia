The stars are based foodwise. I've won an Instagram giveaway where I received 2 free bingsu. I ordered the Oreo bingsu and the Matcha cheese bingsu. It was my first time having a shaved ice dessert in Canada, and I definitely LOVED it. 

Foodwise: The shaved ice for both bingsus was perfectly shaved, so beautiful to the eyes and it literally melts in the mouth. People would usually think that it's too sweet just by looking at them, but the sugar level was on point. Although both were delicious, I found the matcha one a bit plain as everything was matcha (it was also my choice, so not their fault). The oreo bingsu had its top covered with crushed oreo cookies and something else that tasted a little peanuty. And on top of that was a piece of oreo cheesecake, surrounded by mini pieces of oreo. 
Personally, the Oreo bingsu is the winner of all bingsus at that place (although I only tried 2). 

On the downside is the price. An average bingsu is $9-$10, which I find a bit pricey. Also in the pictures the desserts look big, I thought that the size is sharable with a group of 3, 4 people, but when I saw it in person I was surprised that it's quite small (1 or 2 people).

Will go back if/when I crave for bingsu as this is my first and only bingsu place i've been here.
