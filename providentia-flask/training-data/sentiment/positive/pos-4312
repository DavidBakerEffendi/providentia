Absolutely blown away by this place. I'm usually not interested in most specials at restaurants, but *every* *single* special I heard when I was there sounded mouth watering. I had a pappardelle pasta with sliced filet mignon, porcini mushrooms in a mushroom Marsala wine sauce and I thought I died and went to heaven. The decor & atmosphere is simply stunning. Service is fine dining level. The owners son waited on us and he's really a great dude. They make all their own pastas, stocks, and sauces in house. The slightly higher prices are TOTALLY worth it. A must go!!!
