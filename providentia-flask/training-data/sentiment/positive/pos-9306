Getting a bagel here is like getting a bagel in NYC.  After moving here from the east coast I pretty much gave up on ever getting a decent bagel again.  That was until I met a former New Yorker who tipped me off to this place. His pizza suggestion was kind of a bust; but the Bagel Cafe really lives up to expectations.  I wouldn't go anywhere else west of Pennsylvania.
