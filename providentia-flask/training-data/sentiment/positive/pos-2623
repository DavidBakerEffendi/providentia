This place leaves Lindo Michoac√°n in the dust! The food is delicious and the service is exceptional. I frequent here often and I have yet to be disappointed. Hernan is the reason we keep coming back. He is always very attentive and makes sure we are full taken care of! This place is definitely worth our drive from Henderson.
