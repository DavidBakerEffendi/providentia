32 Shea is a local business we visit 2-4 times a week. The bartender, Josh, is the best in the valley (in my opinion). His mixology skills are amazing and his attentiveness to his customer exceeds most. The food, cooked by Chef T, is unique and unexpected, but the mix of flavors are better than perfect. The servers are superior for a small joint, and the wait can be longer than most places in the area but well worth the time. The owner, Rebecca, gives extra care to her business and customers. 32 Shea is always on our radar when we are looking for quality local food and bar! The music and neighborhood patrons add an irreplaceable touch! AND we can bring our dog to the patio!!
