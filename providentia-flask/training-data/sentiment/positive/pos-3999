Had not been back to the Mirage in awhile. The buffet was totally remodeled, much more spacious. You could get your own drinks which was great!! The crab legs were hot, as was the butter!! Yum!! They were cut open to make it easy to extract the meat!! The Asian food was great too. The won ton noodle soup was very tasty, as were the sel mei, pot stickers and egg rolls. often times at other restaurants,  they are not. The vegetable chow mein was spot on too. There was a large variety of pizza, although a bit too doughy for me. There is even a cappuccino machine. Have to compare it to the Rio tomorrow night.
