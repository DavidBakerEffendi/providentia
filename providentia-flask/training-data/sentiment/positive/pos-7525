Open wide for a mouthful of homemade goodness!

A small unassuming diner located in the middle of nowhere-BoulderCity, where burgers & sandwiches are still fashioned in the ways of old & service makes no compromise of treating you right.

That said while everyone raves about the burgers, its smaller cousin; the sandwich stands out in it own limelight. Hot juicy roast beef, served over rich buttered sour dough toast (over their griddle most likely), topped with melted cheese & a slice of tomato. Perfect!

The first bite which instantly transported me back to days long forgotten, where afternoons comprised of this humble snack & homely warmth. (An experience that mirrors a scene from Ratatouille). Prompt & keen service even during the lunch rush, while in hindsight service at the city marks low in comparison to here. 

If you're in the area, stop by, if you're not in the area make a reason to stop by, if you're starving & really need to use the bathroom stop by!
