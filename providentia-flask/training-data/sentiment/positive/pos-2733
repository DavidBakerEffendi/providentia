Get in your car and drive. Take Grand to 101st Ave and take a suicide left (or right, if you're coming from East LA), park your car and go in. Seriously. You'll want to press your nose against the glass when you see some of the delights in their cases. 

Want a black and white? CHECK. 2-pound double-seed rye? CHECK. Florentines? CHECK. Mini Napolean? CHECK. Pizelles? CHECK. Real chocolate-submerged Devil Dog? CHECK. Good lord, I could write this review all day and not completely list everything I've had. It doesn't matter, they're all good. And they use the old bakery boxes with pink & white string from a spool, it's so cool. 

The staff starts super, super early and delivers a complete buffet of bakery madness. Absolutely awesome place to load up with a variety of after-dinner desserts for company, or at least pretending you are. 

They do pies and cakes galore during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter, but there will be a line. Brave it.
