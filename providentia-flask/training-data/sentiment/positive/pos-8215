JK Sushi is a great local spot where you get great service! Chan was my server tonight and he was always attentive. This is my go to spot for catching up with friends for a nice Korean dish, a side of sushi, and a sake bomb to top off my meal. Chan is always friendly and always remembers what I previously ordered and makes great suggestions that never fail.
