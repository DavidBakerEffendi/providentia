When it comes to great service, delicious food and in a hurry Claim Jumper has nailed it.  Trevor was our server & host; he was fantastic.  I asked before actually ordering if he could have us in & out within 30min. for lunch and he certainly did.  The food for both my husband and myself was delicious!  I had a stuffed baker and my husband had the chicken potpie; both were very fresh and piping hot!  Also, I always order iced tea when eating out and their tropical tea garnished with an orange was perfect!  It was our 1st time here and we'll definitely be back!  The manager even stopped by to see if everything was up to our liking and of course it was.  So, we mentioned it was 10x more enjoyable because of Trevor!  Good people doing a little extra make a huge difference, especially in the food and service industry.
