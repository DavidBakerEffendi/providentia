The absolute best Indian food in Las Vegas.  The best appetizer is the lamb seekh kebab.  So tender (I recommend getting extra mint sauce)
I love this restaurant, because I can take first timers as well as friends that love Indian food.  

Some of my favorite entrees are Chana Massala (vegetarian) Chick peas cooked with tomatoes and various indian spices.  DELICIOUS.  I prefer it pretty spicy, but I hear it's also tasty when mild.

The New Zealand Lamb shank is absolutely amazing.  The chicken Tikka Makhani is probably the most popular, and best dish for beginners.  If it's your first time, I suggest getting a few family style dishes to share, so that you can sample some of everything
