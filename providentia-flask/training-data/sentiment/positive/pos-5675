Wow.. As good as it gets. I truly love this place. It's a little out of the way, but anytime I am in the area, I make my way to Sasa.  This restaurant is more Asian flare than straight up sushi. Regardless, whatever is ordered is always a tasty treat. 

First, as a sushi lover.... The sushi is fresh and fabulous. This is a VERY vegetarian friendly place. They have edamame sliders! I mean....that is awesome since not many places accommodate people like me. There are other vegetarian sushi options as well. There is also a flaming sushi roll that arrives to the table on fire!  It has meat, so I haven't eaten it, but others tell me it's super good. 

I understand that that this is a family owned business. The owner is also the chef and runs his restaurant. I prefer to patronize places like this. It always shows in the quality, which at Sasa is top notch. 

Sasa is situated in Shaker Square, perfect before of after a movie. 

P.S. You must try the Sasa Fries!
