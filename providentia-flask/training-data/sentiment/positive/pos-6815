I love this coffee shop. I work from home, so when I get a bit stir crazy and need to work elsewhere I come here. They have a great house blend and I always get the pb&j croissant - so yummy. Wifi is free but you may not always get a table that's close to a wall with an outlet. Great service with very friendly baristas.
