pretty good. i LOVE the interior space and the succulents are a nice touch- great if you love having your coffee in an inspired space. not that much seating during a saturday afternoon and a lot of poeple camp out here with laptops, which took up the majority of the seating. I would probably like to see a maximum seat-time implemented so that there was more seating available for other patrons. 

also they're either going cash free very soon or are already cash free.
