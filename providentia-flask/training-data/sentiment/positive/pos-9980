Holy dog shit!

This place has the best Chinese food in the city (from my experience).

Where most Chinese places have nasty greasy food that makes your insides cry, this place's food actually tastes like a proper meal.

I almost always get the Cantonese chow mein and the general tso chicken, there is a great assortment of vegetables, meat and shrimp in the chow mein and its always evenly cooked, delicious and consistent.

The general tso chicken always has a delicious sauce that doesn't taste like ketchup or come in excess, the chicken has a nice layer of batter but it still retains its full meaty flavor. It's perfect, just try it.

It seems these two things are what most people get for take out, and probably the best things to order here.

I've had other chicken that they do, the vegetable plate and the phad thai and its all delicious but their specialty is really the Cantonese chow mein and the general tso chicken.

1 serving of the chow mein and the chicken feeds three people. You get really good quality and value for your dollar here. My favorite Chinese place and the only one I trust.

This was also where I had my first date, as a wee 14 year old. I thought it went great but she never talked to me again. : (
