I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, just dropped in for takeout. I'm pretty sure me and my boyfriend have gotten food here once a week for the past three weeks. The people that work here are very friendly and very helpful, if there's anything you want to know about the dishes they'll explain it to you. We've tried the chili chicken, egg fried rice with chicken, beef and broccoli, fried noodles with chicken, sweet and sour chicken balls, egg fried rice with shrimp, spring rolls, and cashew chicken. Everything has been fantastic! This is definitely our go-to place for chinese food and it doesn't hurt that it's about a 2 minute walk from where I live!
