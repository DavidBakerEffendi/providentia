What's for dinner at least 3x a week in our household? PITA JUNGLE! The food is CONSISTENTLY fresh and delicious! When I ask my five-year-old son where he wants to go to eat, his answer is the same as above. He enjoys the kids plate that consists of chicken, hummus, steamed spinach, and fresh fruit. I always order the caprese salad as my meal with extra basil and vinegar. Their cold green tea is always refreshing! About 90% of the time, the service is outstanding! It's that 10% that gets a lil under my skin- cuz when it's bad, IT'S BAD ;(  I don't wanna have to flag my wait staff down for something I need to even start to eat. That puts a damper on my dining experience. I have to say that the service at the location and the Tempe location are the best. I am surprised that the one in Mesa is still open because I consistently get SUPER HORRIBLE service there!!!!
