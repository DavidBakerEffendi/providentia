If I had to recommend to a friend a list featuring the best vegetarian restaurants in Montreal, ChuChai would definitely make the top 3! It offers a delicious selection of tasty meals which may please vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Although the price is moderately high for a restaurant of its category, they offer a remarkable service, smiles all around, and some of the best food in town; a wide selection of faux-meat, noodles, salads and more. If you happen to stop by and still have some space left for dessert after your meal, I recommend the chocolate avocado mousse as well as the thai tea.
