This is an update for my previous review about MOD asking us to pay for a cup with a lid to be able to give water to our 3 year old without worrying about him spilling. Well Mike, the district manager for MOD, reached out to me the very next day after my review posted and genuinely apologized for the incident. He ensured me that all cashiers would be properly trained and that this wouldn't happen again and even sent me a gift card so that I would give MOD another chance. My mom and I took my two boys last week and when we asked for a cup with lid for my son the cashier handed it right over. I could tell that Mike followed through and made sure that everyone was properly trained. We had a great and stress-free dining experience and the food was great as always! I love companies that use Yelp feedback to improve guest experiences and will definitely continue to eat at MOD!
