I am so glad I found this place.  Very cute, small, modern interior with kind servers.  The menu features creative dishes which made it hard to choose just one.  This isn't the type of Thai place where you order crab rangoons and pad see eww.  I ordered the crab curry and I could have easily devoured 3 entrees of it since it was so delicious.  For the quality of the food, I was very impressed on the reasonable prices.  Keep in mind this place is only open from 5pm until 3am.  I will definitely be back!
