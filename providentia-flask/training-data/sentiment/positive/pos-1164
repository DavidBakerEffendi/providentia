I was really pleased with my entire experience here...with the exception of the name of the restaurant.  The name is too "brown bag," too generic for this little gem in the middle of the city.

It is quaint but not so quaint that those with testosterone would not see its great qualities!  The atmosphere was ideal: old bungalow home, great patio--very large--with shade for the heat of day and heaters for the cool of night.  The food was excellent, VERY reasonably priced, and the service was outstanding!

We happened upon this restaurant by accident so were really glad to see that they serve brunch until 3PM.  And we were so impressed with brunch that we will return for lunch and dinner.
