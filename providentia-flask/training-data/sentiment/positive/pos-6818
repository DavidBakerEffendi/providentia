Came with a group for Summerlicious Lunch at Luckee. We enjoyed  ourselves. The  service was without a fault 
I went with what i thought would give me  a unique experience and  had the crispy shrimp & lobster wontons to start, baked chicken as my  main,  & finished off with the dessert trio ( Its always an enjoyable surprise so just enjoy  it when it comes) 
The others  with me  got the Hot &  Sour Soup, and the spicy 'mouth-watering' chicken salad as the starters , and  the luckee soba salad & the soya glazed cod
 as their mains. 
The wontons were very tasty and the  fruit salsa helped balance the seafood . The hot and sour soup was quite good  and the pancake that came with it was a bit too small  , perhaps because it was a lunch portion. 
The baked chicken entree was fresh and juicy and  every bite was to be enjoyed from the chicken itself to  the bites of chicken with other items on  the plate. 
The luckee soba salad was  very nice . My guest said it was like a  mini  version of the Singapore Slaw you get at  Lee but nothing close to that. Its like comparing apples to oranges. Both r fruits but thats as similar as they get 
The dessert trio was fantastic because Susur Lee takes ordinary desserts and transforms them into something great. 
For example the sesame ball is usually fillled with lotus seed. Here the sesame ball was stuffed with custard and topped with chocolate sauce . 
The sponge roll was softer than what you get at stores and was well  complemented by the rasberry coulis. 
Lastly the Mango Sorbet felt sweet and natural instead of the artificial stuff you get  elsewhere. 

The one  issue I had today was the cod  entree and has been pictured. My guest  received a tiny piece of cod  on  his plate and we were a bit disappointed.   Please do not give uneven portions for some entrees  as it can potentially ruin a persons dining experience. My  guest was not happy.

Aside from  that I will be back  for more liciouses  and to try the dimsum
