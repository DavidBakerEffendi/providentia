My husband and I saw a video on my Twitter page and took our grandsons the next day for breakfast.  The boys loved the smore pancakes and the nutella and banana crepes.  My husband had a great veggie omelet and tried the banana pancakes on the side.  I had the goat cheese and fig jam omelet.

Every bite was delish and we were able to share w/ the huge portions.  The coffee was fantastic as well.  Our server was new but really wonderful.  We hope to make reservations and take the entire family for a holiday breakfast very soon!
