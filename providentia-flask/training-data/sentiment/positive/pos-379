This Teahouse, located in a historic century home, is SO cute. It's a struggle to find dedicated vegetarian places around eastside suburbs, and Greenbridge has tons of adorable small plates as well as a few heartier options that make it just perfect for lunch or an afternoon snack. Most menu items--including a couple desserts--are VEGAN! 

There are also vintage teacups to choose from, and the staff is so friendly, patient, and willing to answer any questions. We got to meet the owner and our server, Joanne, was really kind. I wish this place were open longer! The hours are 11-3 Wed-Fri, and Sunday during brunch.
