Very pleased. The menu has a great deal of options for being only 2 pages. The mix of classic style crepes and exotic options makes this a great go to plce. They even have a great deal of lunch options. Don't be fooled though their breakfast crepes easily can suffice as a lunch. I had the Sofia  (because it's in the only country on the menu I had not been). It had very delicious Turkish sausage and a vegetable omelet encased in a crepe that was fill with harissa (a red paste hot sauce ) it was incredible. We will be back for a almost traditional walnut french toast next.
