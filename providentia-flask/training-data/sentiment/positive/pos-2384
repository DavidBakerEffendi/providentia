I had a really great experience at block and grinder last weekend. We didn't make reservations which we should have on a busy Saturday night, but were seated right away when we walked in. Our waiter was very knowledgeable- giving advice, going over specials and suggestions. We ordered the charcuterie board to start, with duck ham, prosciutto and a soft mozzarella. It was served on a bed or arugula with mustard and toast.. and it was excellent. The cocktails were great, and our main courses were out of this world. I got a filet with brussels sprout, and my fianc√© got venison over a bed of mushrooms and onion that was out of this world. Everything about this place is 5 stars, we throughly enjoyed it and will be back.
