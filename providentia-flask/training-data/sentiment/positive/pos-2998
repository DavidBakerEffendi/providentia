Where do i begin! Been here a few times for dinner. ordered the beef jerky which was great as was the spicy herb spring roll, had the beef penang which was the best I ever had, also had the crispy beef with rice powder which was out of this world. They are consistent with their dishes which is key in my book. They actually use tea leaves in their hot tea not some tea bag out of the box! They also have a giant wine selection as well. Service was on point and fast.

This place is nice atmosphere, clean, relaxing and intimate. From the outside you would not know this gem exists. Definitely a date friendly place.

Forget about trying another Thai restaurant this is the place. I tried a bunch of them. Keep up the good work!!
