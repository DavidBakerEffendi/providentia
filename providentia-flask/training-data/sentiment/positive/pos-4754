We stopped here for a late lunch today and there was plenty of seating considering today is the last Saturday before Christmas.  We sat in the dining area which was very nice and clean.  Our menus had stuff on them, though... ewwww...

The chips and salsa were good.  The chips were warm, one salsa was heated and the other cold and tomatoey.  The iced tea was pretty good.

I ordered the avacado/ artichoke enchiladas.  They were sooooo good.  They came with this vinegary cabbage/onion salad on top of spinach and a jicama, carrot, mango salad.  A friend had Chicken Mole enchiladas which were sooo delicious, I wished I had ordered them, too.    M ordered steak fajita tacos.  The steak was smokey and rich.  

No room for dessert after these meals.
