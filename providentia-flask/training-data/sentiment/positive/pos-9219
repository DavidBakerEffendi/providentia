I just have to review on this place because my husband and I practically live here. I mean with half price drinks and slushes for happy hour and half priced shakes after 8pm, who wouldn't want to hit this place up. Their food is always cooked fresh and is delicious. And the staff is great as well. Great quick place to grab some food or something to drink. Try the Cherry Lime Dr. Pepper and the Chocolate Banana shake! And their Mozzarella Sticks are to die for!
