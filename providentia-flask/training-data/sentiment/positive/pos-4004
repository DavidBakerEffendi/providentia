Very impressed by this small but mighty sushi joint located on College! The front of the restaurant is relatively bare with big windows for natural light and a dark paint job. Sometimes during the summer, the front of the restaurant is completely open to the street, which can be nice on a warm evening. The inside is clean and decorated with some simple japanese accents. There's not a lot of seating here and they usually get pretty full around dinner. With the food and the price at which they offer it, this doesn't surprise me in the slightest!

We ordered the Chirashi bowl ($19), and 2 maki rolls: the ikashiso and the futo ($7 and $8) and shared this between two of us. The chirashi bowl came with an assortment of fish on top of a bed of rice and was topped with salmon roe. All the flavors of the fish were distinct and they also did the rice well! This dish was memorable and worth it at its price. The ikashiso roll was also pretty good, with the sweetness of the shiso leaf pairing well with the chewy texture and fishy bite of the squid. The futo roll was definitely a highlight: the saltiness of the eel was balanced well by the acidity of the other vegetables and the mushrooms and this was all rounded out by the light sweetness of the tamago. 

Great experience here! The only thing that I should mention is that they stopped serving hot food after a certain time when we arrived (approximately 7PM) so if you're looking to try some of their hot dishes, arrive early. Although this isn't too big a deal as the sushi here is fantastic considering the price! Will definitely be dining here again in the future.
