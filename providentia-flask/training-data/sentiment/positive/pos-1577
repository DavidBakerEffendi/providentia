One of the best pizzas I've had in Vegas came from Papa Murphys, I've been buying their pizzas since 2002 when I first stumbled across it and couldn't pass up the 6.99 family size pepperoni pizza. Unfortunately all great things come to an end and that awesome deal is gone but luckily the amazing taste is still just as good as ever. Just had this pizza and it still tastes just like the first time I had it, incredible. Overall amazing pizza, I would choose them over any other pizza.
