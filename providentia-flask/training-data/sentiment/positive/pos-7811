Man, those banana nut muffins!!! They're hot,  delicious, and big! I ordered the bacon avocado omelet, and it had a lot of avocado &  Kudos to my server, Twila for suggesting a half size omelet.  It was exactly the right size. Still a HUGE omelet!!! This place is very attentive.  You can flip the little smily face on your table to a sad face if you need something!  They pay attention to that and come running if they see that you've 'flipped'!
