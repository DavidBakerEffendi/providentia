I cannot say enough about this place.
My husband booked the Valentine's dinner last night and O.M.G. ,how amazing everything was.
Dim lights with candles  , they gave us a warm infused tea tree oil towel to use ,as some food was finger food.
The food was amazing,with a delicate taste and plated like a gourmet restaurant;i believe whoever works in the kitchen knows their job and put heart and soul in it.
The ladies who were running the food were great, smiling and knowledgeable about food .
This is The Place to go,Vegan or not,for great food and great atmosphere. 
Finaly a real Vegan place in the valley .

5 stars are not enough for this place.
