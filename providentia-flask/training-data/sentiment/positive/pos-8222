Coda is AMAZING!! So glad this place is finally open in Tremont.

Went there last night to hear some live music. The music was awesome, the decor of this place is so cool and the atmosphere makes it that much more awesome.

The bar is small but has a wide variety of good drinks. And then there's the food. My God was the food fan-freakin-tastic!!! Get the spaghetti & meatball pizza. You will not regret it! We ordered that pizza and grilled mac n cheese w/ Cheetos and they accidentally brought out the wrong order but let us keep that food too! It was amazing!!

You've got to come to Coda, I can't rave enough about all it's awesomeness!
