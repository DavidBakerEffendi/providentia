Got take out chicken tikka masala, sagg paneer, lamb vindaloo, lamb biriani, and garlic nann.  I've tried a lot of Indian food throughout the valley and this was the best I've had.  The flavors were very clean, and judging from what I saw and smelled when I walked in, the chefs that cooked this meal really know their stuff!  This is with out a doubt my new go to Indian restaurant in town.
