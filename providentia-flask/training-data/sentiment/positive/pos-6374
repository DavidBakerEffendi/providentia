Decided to try this restaurant mainly because of the Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. 

Our server - David was excellent,  he recommended and told us what were the popular dishes since this was our first time having Indian Food. 

We started with the Masala Dosa, a potato and onion crepe which looked like a huge burrito which came with 2 different sauces which was exceptional. Also got the Gol  Guppa which was a whole wheat puff that you break a hole to stuff which was fun and tasty. 

We ordered the following entrees - Lamb Chops, Tandoori Salmon and Classic Curry Chicken which all were excellent. 

We tried the Garlic Naan and the Hot Chai Tea.

We were asked about dessert but we were so stuffed we could not eat another bite.

Was a great new adventure and everything was perfect. 

Will recommend this restaurant and also be back.
