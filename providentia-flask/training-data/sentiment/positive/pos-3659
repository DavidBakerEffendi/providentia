Holy Cow - Simply Outstanding!  Brand new, this past week so still working out the kinks in the service execution, but the quality of the bagels and food is fantastic. Highly recommended, and worth traveling to if not from the area. Many people not from NYC have no idea what a true bagel is. Dominic, the owner of NYBD and a true New Yorker, nailed it. And the chopped salads - fuggedaboudit. Enjoy.
