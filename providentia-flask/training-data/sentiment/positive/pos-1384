I randomly popped in here yesterday to catch some football and a bite, as someone who doesn't get out much I could tell as I was walking in that I made a good choice. There was a good amount of fellow football fans who had the same plan. 

You can definitely tell this place has a lot of good regulars, but if you're a newbie you aren't ignored. As someone that isn't a drinker, I get left hanging at other places after they hear my water order...NOT THE CASE AT ALL HERE. Marisela was eager to grab my water and even dropped off a menu, in the midst of her full bar of customers. 

Shortly after, my food order goes in (I'm a taco fiend so naturally that was what ordered) on a busy day like this it was out surprisingly fast, and was exactly what I hoped for. I was continuously checked on and was asked if there was anything I needed, I seriously couldn't count on both hands how many times I was checked...I love that! Even a low spending visitor is treated like something special. 

I'll definitely have to return to the place some time in the future, Sunday mornings Marisela seems to be the favorite, but I heard many GREAT things about another employee who was simply called "Floody". Every assumed regular I met seems to love them both. Even though I'm not much of a drinker, the employees, service and tacos are more than enough for me to return!
