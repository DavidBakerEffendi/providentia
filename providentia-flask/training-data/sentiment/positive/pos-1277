My family has been dining at Bangkok Ocha for years, and with good reason.  First, the staff is friendly, and they make a point of getting to know their customers.  They truly want guests to leave happy.  We always do.  The food is excellent, and the price is right.  I've never traveled to Thailand, so I can't vouch for the true "authenticity", but I have dined at a lot of Thai restaurants in the US and Europe, and this is my favorite.  I truly believe you won't find better Thai food in Charlotte.  The owners (Steven and Sunny) have made sure the flavors are perfect, and they aim to please.  I feel fortunate to have this delicious place just down the street.  And as a BONUS,  when I have a head cold, I go in and ask Steven for a curry dish to help clear my head, and he knows what works!  Also, the soups they serve at lunch are delicious.  Highly recommend!
