This is by far the best Mexican restaurant ever! The chips and salsa, with warm beans and a jalape√±o salsa, are like heaven in your mouth! They bring out complimentary soup...not being a big fan of soup, I was hesitant to try it but I did and I loved it! I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans! They were phenomenal! The service was absolutely amazing, quick and very attentive! This is "our spot" now! Salute!!!
