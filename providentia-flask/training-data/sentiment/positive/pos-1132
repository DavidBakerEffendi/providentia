I just can't rave enough about this place.
First time getting my car wash detailed here, and the guys at the wash were so sweet, straight-forward, NOT pushy - a miracle!
Now I am sitting in their air conditioned restaurant/shop on their wi-fi and enjoying a delicious pulled pork sandwich. I mean it doesn't get any better.
Their shop is super cute and has lots of fun, unique things to browse and buy.

Thank you Tom's Thumb for everything you offer being top notch, clean, nice, welcoming. I will be back many times over!
