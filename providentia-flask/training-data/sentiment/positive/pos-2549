I've seen this place quite a few times but never came in.. and today I had some time to kill around lunch and I'm really glad I tried it.. Although I shoulda read the reviews first and thought more about the chow mein option.. next time..
Had the jerk chicken special, works, extra hot.. it was.
Jarritos Mexican Cola was pretty good too.
Service is so friendly here.
Music is pretty mixed - I heard Stairway to Heaven, with Miley Cyrus after, followed by some Mexican tune, then something that almost sounded like Enya.
Only 2 seats though so mostly takeout.
Really enjoyable vibe while waiting for my car repair.
I'll be back.
