On the strip it's difficult to find good bang-for-buck. Tom's Urban does a great job though. The location is great for pre/post T Mobile events and the food and drink have been excellent in my 3 times at this location. Can't complain about the service. We sat at the bar facing the strip after a concert. Wasn't thrilled to get beer in plastic cups--maybe they thought we were traveling. Great selection and service. Decor is nice, would like to make it back for brunch.
