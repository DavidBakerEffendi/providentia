I come here often in the evening/night. The customer service is always top notch. The staff are super courteous and they get the orders correct all of the time. It's always timely as well. I have only come through here once and had a bit of a wait time. At that time they apologized and offered a free drink. This is my favorite Jack in the Box by far.
