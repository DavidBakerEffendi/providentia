This was my first time at Duckworth's to watch Sunday football.  A large group of us sat at the long high top table in the bar area.  
We had awesome service with David!  The nachos are a must try and the extensive beer list was great.  Thumbs up all around.
We were able to see all of the games unlike a lot of other local bars.  We will definitely return!
