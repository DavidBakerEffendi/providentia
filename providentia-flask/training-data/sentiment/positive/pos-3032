This is my first time here! I think its great. We came after a movie and I am very pleasantly surprised. I do not normally come to Shaker square. I'm not that  familiar with the area. Sasa is an Asian fission type of place. There is a large selection of sushi, salads, and Asian inspired cuisine. There were such things as tofu sliders, daikon vegetable wraps, and flaming meat that is cooked by a hot stone.  I can say that one of my favorite items tonight were the Sasa fries. They were served in a fried rice paper bowl sprinkled with seaweed. They were lightly battered and fried. Absolutely exceptional. 

Another surprise was the desert selection. While Sasa offered traditional deserts, they also had poached pears and homemade ice cream. 

Finally, the service was also exceptional. Our server was very attentive and answered all of our questions about the menu. I absolutely recommend Sasa. They have a great combination of sushi and Asian Flair.
