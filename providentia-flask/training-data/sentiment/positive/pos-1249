The octopus appetizer is just amazing. I will return for the octopus and the "some like it got" sweet and spicy cocktail. The lemon rotisserie chicken full portion is enough for two. Our server split the dish for us. 

Chica is a sister of its neighbor Yard Bird which is my "go to" when I come to Vegas. They both make the juiciest, tasty chicken. 

The service was prompt, friendly, and helpful. Our server recommended the octopus and tenderloin. We got the octopus and we will try the tenderloin and guacamole next time.  

The decor and ambiance is cool.

One caveat:  if you're going to split the chicken, just order a full order. Don't say "split" because they gave us 2 half orders and charged us for it. One full order is enough for 2 people if you order drinks and appetizers.
