I went about 3 times to this location and each time it has been great service and ambience. My boyfriend and I visit the Keg quite often and this location never fails to satisfy us. 

The only downfall I'd have to say is that each time we came, they always ran out of escargots. Hopefully we can get some the next time we visit!
