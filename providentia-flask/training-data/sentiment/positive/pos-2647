So I come here almost every week for my angry dog fix. Caesar the cashier is very friendly & has awesome customer service. He's professional & remembers exactly what I like & want every time when I come to Buldogis. The man deserve a raise ;) anyway the food gets better everytime. & the cooks are also pretty cool & really friendly & food comes out perfect every time. This place definitely deserves 5 Stars more like 6 stars. All around this restaurant gets it all. From customer service to food. They A's it in every category. Thanks guys for providing awesome customer service & delicious food for all of us.
