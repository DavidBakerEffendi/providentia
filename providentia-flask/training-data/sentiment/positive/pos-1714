My friend and I stumbled upon this place one day when looking for a new bar close to home that played the Green Bay Packers game.  We had a few important things on our list:  Good food, lots of TVs for the game and cheap beer.  Is that too much to ask?! LOL.

Hammer's Grill and Bar is located close to Horizon and College Dr in a small strip mall.  The inside is really cool.  For such a small bar, this place is PACKED with TVs.  EVERYWHERE.  They also have sound boxes which I LOVE about it.  That way, all the games can be on the TV and you won't miss the sound at all.  

Now let's talk about the bartender, Reid.  He is probably the coolest guy and best bartender I've met in a long time!  He's super cool, chill and on top of his game.  Just don't touch anyone else's slot machine, even if they're your best friend.  He will scold you LOL.  It's all in fun.  

Their food is actually really good.  Heck, I love it!  Both times I've been there, I've gotten the chicken nachos for $10.  It was a HUGE platter, filled with tortilla chips, shredded chicken, jalapenos, cheese, garlic salsa and sour cream.  These nachos were bomb.com and so huge!

If you live in the Henderson area, you need to check out Reid and the rest of the gang here at Hammer's.  He really remembers your name!  It's like Cheers!
