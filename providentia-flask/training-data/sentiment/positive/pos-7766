A must try if you're visiting from the west coast. 

Pulled into Swensons for a quick lunch before heading to Stan Hywet. Our server ran over to our car at top speed!

Food: 3 Galley Boys, Potato Teezers, and a California soda, or "pop" as they say in Ohio. 

The Galley Boy, was voted best burger by Forbes, and I have to say it is delicious. The sauce is slightly sweet and the cheese is melty and oozy, more like a sauce than a melted slice of cheese. The double stack of meat and lack of veggies makes this burger a meat lover's paradise. 

My favorite thing was the Potato Teezers, crispy on the outside, jalape√±o bits inside for a tiny bit of spice, and a delightful nacho cheesiness that doesn't have that barfy nacho cheese taste. Love these, a MUST try. 

As for the california, its a grape soda that isn't too sugary and really refreshing with the burger. I think i'd also be interested to try the Ohio next time, a cherry pop. 

Can't wait to come back!
