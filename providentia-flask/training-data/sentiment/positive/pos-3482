jimmy's has the best chicken shawarma, bar none!   you can go for larger, but i usually just go for the small size and even then i am always stuffed!  very generous portions and sooooo good.  super great deal and the staff are always very warm and friendly.  if you talk to any of the family that owns jimmy's, especially 'mama', they will talk and treat you like family.
