Expect to wait if coming on the weekend! I have been to this restaurant several times for the past 2-3 years and the menu has changed a bit but it is a gem (there used to be an amazing Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict on the menu that they no longer have :(). 

Fresh ingredients. Current favourites are Huevos Rancheros, Animal Fries, and their insane Red Velvet pancakes.
