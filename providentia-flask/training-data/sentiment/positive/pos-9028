I'm going to keep it short and sweet for once... this place is GREAT. Everything I've had- from sandwiches to salads, soup and scrambles, brownies and smoothies... all wonderful! And even better- they deliver! We used to have them deliver to our office weekly. They do weekly specials (my husband's fav is their Lobster Melt) and send out a weekly email with coupons for each day. You can't beat this place for an overall great meal that meets many different flavor palates. YUM!
