I love this place... fast quick and healthy.  I've been coming here since it opened.  I have always loved Indian food, so it's really nice that its super simple to grab a quick meal. 

Exterior/Location: An old car dealership on Chagrin Blvd. 

Interior:  Totally re-done, modern, well lit, and They have some real high tech gadgets... like the hand jacuzzi!  

Vibe/Ambiance:  Moderm and technologically advanced.  Friendly, foody atmosphere.  

Staff: Awesome and talented.  Welcoming

Clientele: Anybody.  Mostly younger, cultured adults.  

Price:  I think very resonable!  I fed four people for $36.  That's even with extra soup and naan.

Must get items:  Buttered naan!  All items are tasty.

Why I love or hate it:  Love it!  Fresh, healtly and different than my usual food. 

Final thoughts:  Try it.  I actually like it better than some of the more fancy Indian restaurants.
