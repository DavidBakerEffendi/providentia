The drink selection here can't be beat. They have something for everyone and can make good recommendations. The food is also delicious. We got the cauliflower bites, chicken sliders, beef sliders, avocado egg rolls, chicken poppers, and Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious. The avocado egg rolls and beef sliders were my favorites. While the cauliflower bites were good, the bigger pieces did not get cooked all the way and still had uncooked batter in them. I will definitely be coming back!
