I love that this is a small "hole in the wall" type of ice cream place. Love love love. Location is good. Lots of street parking (and a nearby lot). I opted for a strawberry banana supreme parfait and it was delightful. Not too sugary and not too sickly at all. Next time I would like to try the scoop ice cream with waffle cone, though... and a hot dog. :3
