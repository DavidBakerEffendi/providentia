Great value! Hope they can maintain the quality and size/quantity.

Some items are unbelievably cost effective, and yet the taste and quality are both worth a lot more. Oh I'm just repeating myself about the value being great. 

Nice decor, something new, and definitely very nice for Markham, considering this is a rather quiet area of Markham.

Will go back again!
