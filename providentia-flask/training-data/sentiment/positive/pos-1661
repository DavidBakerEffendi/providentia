Stopped in the other day while I was in the area for a quick bite. Two enchiladas, rice, beans and a chicken taco about $11.00 average. What wasn't average was the size of the taco! Holy crap that thing was HUGE and tasty....skip all the 'bertos places and come here, the staff is friendly, fast and polite and you can even understand what they're saying to you. No marbles in their mouths here!
