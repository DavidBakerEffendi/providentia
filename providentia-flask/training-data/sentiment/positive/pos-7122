I have now dined here 4 times so I feel qualified to give an expert review. Hands down the best indian I've had in the valley. I absolutely love the Flavors. We ask for ours extra spicy but they still make a great mild for all of the wimps out there. What I like most is the meat in each dish is quality. 

Service is excellent they really take care of you while you are here and every single person we've had is very friendly and accommodating. 

I also like that the restaurant feels clean and fresh. No dark corner booths with ripped vinyl in sight. 

My only complaint is they are closed next week for their expansion. Congrats to them for being successful but how are we supposed to survive without it for a whole week? I guess we will manage. Can't wait to see it when it's finished.
