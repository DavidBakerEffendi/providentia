I've been called lots of things, but "foodie" isn't one of them. However, i know what I like and expect and Humble Pie exceeded both. We are new to AZ and Humble Pie came highly recommended. Glad we listened. Loved the decor and the service (thanks Rizzo) was very good. Our food was outstanding (shared a chopped salad and each had our own pizza). I had the olive pizza and it's now my favorite. My wife raved about hers and she's not a big pizza fan. Bottom line is we loved Humble Pie and will be back.
