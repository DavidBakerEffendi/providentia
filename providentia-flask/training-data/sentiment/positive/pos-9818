I finally visited this location last night as its been years since I have been inside of a buffalo wild wings. The food was great, but our waiter Levi was awesome. He made sure that we not only had great drinks but that our food arrived in a timely manner so that we would not miss our movie. How cool is that.? Great food, great drinks, fabulous service. What more could a girl want?
