One of the most underrated and hidden spots on the strip! The drinks are fairly cheap and they have tons to choose from and the food is very good and delicious. You have to get the homemade pop tart of the day and the lobster tacos. The garlic edamame is also amazing as is the potstickers, mac & cheese, hashbrowns, and any of the burgers. Our server, Bear, was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of.
