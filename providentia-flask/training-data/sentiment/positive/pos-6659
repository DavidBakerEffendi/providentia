I decided to try a place I hadn't before with the new Ubereats app so I chose this. I'm so happy I did. I went with the ahi poke tacos and the crab wontons. I only eat seafood so I'm slightly particular about it. The tacos were hands down some of the best I've had. Bigger than street size and you get 3. Amazeballs! The crab wontons also had a rich filling better than most. I wish they had dessert options for delivery but that's a minor detail. Highly suggest!!!
