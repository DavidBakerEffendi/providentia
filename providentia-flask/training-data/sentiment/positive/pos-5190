Great new location!! This locations lay out is a little more spacious than some of their other locations around the Valley. I very much enjoyed the nice large patio. 

I went and met up with a few friends here last week. (Shout out to Tim B. & Natalie G.) Natalie got us a nice little table outside by the fire. We were there for the Bottle of Wine and a Board of Bruschetta special (Monday's and Tuesdays after 8pm.) Our very charming server Ryan offered us some samples while we waited for the 8 o'clock special to roll around. We went through about 5 or so samples. Finally landing on 2 bottles of Red wines. One of them being the Espiritu Malbec. The other escapes my memory. Both were very smooth and velvety, pared with our boards of bruschetta and our Chocolate Bouchon with vanilla bean ice cream. We had just about every kind of Bruschetta besides the Salami with Pesto and the White Bean with Chopped Tomato. The seasonal was a mushroom Bruschetta that I wish they had all year round. 

Some how we ended up with a 3rd free board of Bruschetta. We did not complain. Ryan was a delight. He kept us fully entertained, he knew his wines, and he was very patient with us when need be. 

I recommend giving this location a try. Its very beautiful and has a bit of a different feel and vibe than the other 2 locations I have been to. A bit more classy and cute. But still has all the things you enjoy about Postino. And of course ask for Ryan if you can.
