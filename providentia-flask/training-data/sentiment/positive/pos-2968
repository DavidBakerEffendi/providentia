We were able to sit outside, on a perfect night. The server was great and very attentive despite having to cover the 6 tables outside. But enough about that, let's get to the food! It was fantastic! I don't normally eat vegetarian dishes but I decided to to try the "Meatless Meatloaf". I am so glad it did. It was very flavorful and the sauce had a nice peautnutty taste. The mashed potatoes were rustic style with the skins and very creamy and a very generous serving of broccoli was on the plate as well. My mom had the curry and I tried that and it was super yummy with a nice kick at the end. We were full after our meal so we did not get to try the desserts/malts but everything looked amazing when it came to the other tables. If we lived near by we would be back and I will be suggesting to others that they go here! It is a must do in Madison!
