BEST PLACE! I took my husband here for his birthday and boy was he so happy! Our food was amazing. We got a chicken empanada, meat platter (grill) for 2, and my son chicken fingers and dolche dessert! We had left overs too;) The meat was soo good, the platter came with 2 filet mignon, chicken breasts, sausage, two stack of short ribs, and wow delicious!  GO, YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY!
