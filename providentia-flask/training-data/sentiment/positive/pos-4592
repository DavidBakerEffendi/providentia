I get a plain bagel with cream cheese...pretty basic but this is my favorite place. The cream cheese kind of has a onion taste or something I can't really put my finger on but it's good! I absolutely love coming here because unlike some other places...they make the bagel so it's ready to eat. They put tons of cream cheese on it...just the way I like it and I can eat it on my way to work because it's ready to go lol!

The woman that works in the morning is super friendly and she will remember your order if you keep going back. I like that!

Only bad thing is they close around 3pm.
