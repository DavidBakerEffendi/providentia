The best Pakistani restaurant hands down in Calgary, it's a small mainly takeout, but seating is available for small groups, or just a solo session, the menu has been the same since they opened with minor price changes, holds the best value for a combo. You have a choice of a couple meat curries and a couple veggie curries daily served with the best Naan bread or Rice. The Tikkas are amazing, flame grilled while you watch or wait,  also they make chicken  Biriyani fresh daily, I am a pioneer here, I have been eating here since the first day they opened. A Must if you haven't tried. I noticed a few reviews on service, well, the food is amazing, the washroom is clean, the service is based as a small takeout or a quick sit down, not a full service restaurant so go enjoy the best Pakistani food in Calgary!
