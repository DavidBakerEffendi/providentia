This is got to be one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas!
The quality of the food is incredible!!!
We had the calamari for an appetizer and it was so tender and fresh, not a bit chewy at all......
The Filet Mignon Pho was delish! Flavor was really great! Lots of tender filet noodles and super spicy just like I wanted! 
My husband ordered the Duck w/Curry sauce. I had saw this dish on Yelp and my husband was excited to try it. When we were looking over the menu I couldn't find it anywhere. The waitress said 'oh yes we have it', 
I am not sure why it isn't on their menu???? 

I saw so many dishes I want to try........ Singapore Noodles.... Pad See Yew...... Drunken Noodle...... ALL look amazing!!!

I love spice so I ordered a spicy level 5 after the waitress warned us that their food was on the spicier side. (I usually get a 6 or 7) The spice was perfect for me!
Compared to a lot of other Thai places though, be aware they are on the spicier side of that 1-10 scale!
