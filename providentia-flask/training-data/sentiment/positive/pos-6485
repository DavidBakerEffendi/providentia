Note: I have only gotten carry-out  from Ohashi.

still worth leaving 5 stars. The sushi was really delicious. Although I didn't eat it for about 35 minutes after I picked it up, the sushi was still in tact and fresh. Often times, the rice becomes crumbly if it sits but that was not the case.

My sushi was ready moments after I got to the restaurant and the price was very comparable. We'll definitely be back to dine in.
