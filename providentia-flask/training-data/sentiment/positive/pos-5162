Pure Pizza is definitely the best pizza I've had in Charlotte thus far. I ordered the pesto pizza with tomatoes and red onion with a few friends, and it was superb! The crust is thin but stays crispy enough to hold up the toppings, the sauce to cheese ratio is solid, and all of the ingredients added great flavor without overpowering the pizza as a whole. You can really tell with their farm to table approach that they have high quality ingredients based on the taste alone. While this does cause the prices to be a bit higher than pizza chains, the quality more than makes up for it. My only complain is that I wish they had smaller options than 12" so that I could get a personal pizza during my lunch hour at work- but hey maybe I'll just have to feel like pigging out or want some leftovers that day.
