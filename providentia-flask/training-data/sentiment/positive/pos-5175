My family has been going to Don Michaels since they opened. The food is strip quality at off strip prices. We have brought many friends and we have never been disappointed. Currently one of the specials is Grouper and it is world class seafood.
Don Michael and the staff of become like family to us. It's so great to have them right around the corner!
