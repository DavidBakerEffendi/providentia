Found this restaurant by accident but wow! I mean, this place is absolutely the best brunch I've ever had in Montreal! BEST!
Their portion is very big, but also taste great! My boyfriend and I order the avalanche and something else the waitress recommended. 
Both of them are really really good, and we both really enjoyed them. (We are really picky when it comes to food!) their fresh juice is good too!
Their menus are only available in French, but the waitress are really nice and explained everything. 
LOVE this restaurant, for like $13, you can only get a very small portion in other high rating brunch restaurant. But at this place, you can have a huge dish. 
Also, their decor is really cozy and it was really quite in this restaurant, you don't have to yell. 
Will define rely come back with more friends!
