The first time I came here, I was between 3 and 4 stars. The servers seemed a bit uncertain, and they were out of the agedashi tofu that I had so looked forward to trying. I asked for the vegetarian ramen, which is not on the menu, but I had been advised on the Facebook page would be an option. My server advised that they did not have vegetarian ramen. However, right as I was about to leave, the owner came out and apologized and stated he was, indeed, able to make vegetarian ramen. So of course, I stayed. The ramen was phenomenal. Jay, the owner, is exceptionally nice, and he remembered me the second time I came in. By my third time, they all knew right away I would be getting the vegetarian ramen. Oh, and I got the agedashi tofu the second time I was there and it was great. Jay always comes by to chat. This is a very new place, so clearly they have some kinks to work out, but the food is just incredibly top notch. Some places offer vegetarian ramen that is just weird. Or creamy, I don't like that. But this veg ramen is just spot on. The broth is so delicious. And the noodles they make in house are just divine. If you are looking for curly noodles, you won't find them here, but it doesn't make them any less fantastic. I will be coming here at least once a week while I still live in the area. It's so nice for the east valley to finally have a ramen house!
