Love love LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I eat here almost every week! Super cute old house with lots of seating inside and out. Have never had a bad meal here. My favorite sandwich is the Doc's choice. It comes on an awesome pretzel roll. You can buy all kinds of local art and listen to some great live music. GREAT COFFEE!!!!!! I LOVE YOU HOB NOBS!!!!!!!!!!
