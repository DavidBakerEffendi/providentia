I have been going to Beach Cafe for many years.  It is down the street from my children's schools (Canarelli Middle and Tony Alamo Elementary).  Every time I have ordered take out, it was fast, hot, and delicious, not to mention, my orders have always been correct.  I recommend this place for breakfast and lunch.  And I just learned they do catering!  Excited to have them do my next office event.
