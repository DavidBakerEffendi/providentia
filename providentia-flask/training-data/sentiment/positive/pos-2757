Bulgogi literally means, "Fire Meat" - Buldogi, literally means, "Hot Weiner"

I don't think there's any place in Vegas that serves this style of hot dog and french fries. Come here with an open mind and an empty belly, because this place is definitely worth the calories. 

When you first walk in the smell is intoxicating; grilled meats, french fries and Kimchi, a great foreshadowing of an amazing lunch. After perusing the menu, I finally made up my mind and went with the Bulgogoi Dog. 

This is a hot dog covered in Bulgogi cooked meat, Asian slaw, green onions, sesame seeds and Bulgogi mayo. Amazing flavor combinations with each bite, the crunchy slaw mixed with soft bun and charred meat is a pure food party in your mouth. The seared meat on top is super tender and surprisingly goes well with the all beef hot dog. 

I also ordered the Kimchi Fries. Normally I'm not a Kimchi fan, but Buldogi has made a believer out me. Sweet potato fries, with spiced pork bulgogi, layers of cheese and Kimchi plus jalapenos and a fried egg! Why a fried egg? Just because! 

Come. Sit. Stay. Good Buldogi.
