Harumi sushi, oh me, oh my! Heart of downtown, and there it should be! Love the interior nice and small and well lit! Once you walk in you are definitely welcomed with such enthusiastic smiles and service. Sushi here is very active as when I say active sushi is always made so you definitely know your plate and rolls are going to be fresh indeed! You get a simple paper menu, and they also have to go sushi if you want to do grab and go which is something I can definitely get into. Our waitress and the workers were really interactive and so helpful! Guiding us Thru our menu and definitely the elder lady in the glasses helped us out with her cheerful personality. She pointed out he special which was better than the special roll we were gonna get which was the spicy combo roll or h3 maybe? But definitely get the "omg" roll cause it will let you be saying oh my gosh! Such a cool concept and delicious roll you'll just have to try it yourself! All their sushi roll is made with a healthy purple/black rice which is delicious and healthy for you I heard. Definitely don't mind, you pay for what you get and that's excellent sushi! Might be the best one in Phoenix so far! Well you'll certainly see my face there! If your in downtown ; it's a must stop by! Stay hungry Phoenix!
