What a great place! From the ambiance, to the food to the service. Absolutely fantastic!
Our server, Eden was so great. She started by giving us a run-down of the menu and explaining that all the meats in the burgers can be swapped out for other meats. When I told her I was a vegetarian, she told me about which option she preferred. Let's take a moment to do a happy dance for the fact that they have more than one veggie option!!! :D
Ok now that that's out of the way, we ordered the the hot honey milkshake adding peanut butter, per Eden's recommendation. It's sweet with a little kick. Not your usual milk shake. For my main I ordered the Guadalupe with Sweet Fries. It was sooo good. Definitely not your usual soy veggie burger. In fact, both their veggie burgers are very unique. I can't wait to go back next time to try the other one.
