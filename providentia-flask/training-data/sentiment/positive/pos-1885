If I wasn't leaving Madison, this review wouldn't be going up because I would want to keep this place a better secret. But because I am and I want this place to definitely be around when I come back, up it goes.

When I think of Madison, I will forever associate it with Barrique's because it's just so perfectly representative of the city in coffee-house form. It's laid back, charming, relaxing and mellow. Plus, there's no music playing--which is fantastic for someone like me who prefers to study/work in silence.

I'm not a coffee drinker, so hell if I know anything on that front. But the Italian sodas here are the best in Madison. Everyone else can sit down, Barrique's has got this one on lock. Do yourself a good deed and get the cherry flavored one; it's my favorite and while it's sweet, not overbearingly so. In addition, they also have wine and are willing to put some alcoholic beverages inside of your coffee or other ones. Boozy hot chocolate in the winter, anyone?

For food, the pastries are wonderful. I am also in love with the Blueberry Jubilee salad; the mixed greens are fresh and firm, the blueberry vinaigrette isn't overwhelming--just the right amount to add some taste, the blue cheese adds a nice kick and the walnuts and apples are just the icing on the cake. The true mark of having good food is to not need to have anything to dip it in/add to it--and with the bread I got from here, it's definitely the case.

I'm so disappointed I didn't find this until very recently, but when I come back to Madison, you know where you'll be able to find me.
