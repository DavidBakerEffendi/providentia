Absolutely love this place. 

I wish there was one closer to Tempe. 

I would recommend the chorizo burrito (freakin delicious)!!! The guy taking my order said it was one of his favorites, so I thought I'd try it. It did not disappoint. 

Everything else on the menu is excellent too. Love the chicken marinated in green chili!
