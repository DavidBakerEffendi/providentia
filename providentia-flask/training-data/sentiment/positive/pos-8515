We just came back from Paris and these Crepes matched anything we has there.  There was an old crepe place here my wife did not like but these folks are friendly and have a great sense of style and warmth.  

We only wish it was open for dinner.   But please try this new place.  We had the Tahiti the Belgium and the French toast and each one was a winner
