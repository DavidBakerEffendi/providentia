Went here with my sister for a late lunch. We arrived at around 3PM, the lunch rush was still happening so we had to settle for the bar like seating, which was fine with us.

We ordered a crispy chicken rice (8.95) and a green tea snow ice (6.99)

The chicken tasted really delicious! Better than Destiny's IMO and it came with rice, tea egg, tofu and corn. The chicken to rice ratio is a bit uneven with the chicken being greater, which is a good thing to me.

I had high expectations for the snow ice as I've seen many people raving about it with pictures online. My expectations were met! The portion is HUGE, and a good value considering it's only 6.99 and comes with condensed milk and tapioca (on the side) and grass jelly with red bean at the bottom of the bowl. The ice has a subtle yet not watery green tea flavour, it was really enjoyable. The condensed milk goes the best with the ice out of all of the toppings.

Service was quick, friendly, and inviting. No troubles with it.

Overall, I will definitely visit again to try the other items like the tea, cake, and of course, another snow ice flavour!
