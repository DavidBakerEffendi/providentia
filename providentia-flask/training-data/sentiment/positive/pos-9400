To say the least, this place just serves great food. If you're not from here you definitely need to come to any of their locations and grab a double double with well done fries and a shake. This is probably the best combination I can think of when coming here. 

The only thing is you're pro ably and most likely going to have a long wait for the line but that's to be expected with good food and at a great price too. If you go to a generic fast food chain such as McDonald's or Burger King that will just be a disappointment just because missing out on such a good meal should be a crime. 

The burger buns are placed on the grill so the edges are nice and toasty. With every bite you can taste the special sauce they lather inside which is the spread and their crispy letter even they put in between the buns. In the end you most definitely won't be disappointed with the burger once waiting that long line.
