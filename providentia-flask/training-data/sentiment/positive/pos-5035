I've loved this restaurant in Toronto's koreantown since I was in my university years. And it expanded to North York and Mississauga. It's obviously doing well with about 10 dishes to choose from. They specialize in tofu soup with purple rice in a very hot stone bowl. 

Happy:  I'm happy to indulge in 4 small dishes, and my favourite is the spicy sweet radish one. They used to have it with another type of root veggie that was chewy and to die for. The soon tofu is always bubbling hot, so is the rice. A perfect meal when it's freezing outside. Your tummy will love you!! 

Not happy:  The bulgogi dish needs more veggies and could be a bit bigger. The orange decor can be modernized. Sometimes, the staff don't really speak English. 

Verdict:  I love Korean food and this one is one of my favourite!! The price is great too!! Back then, $10 is all you need for a meal, taxes and tip in. It's a bit higher now that it is 2015, but all is good. I've returned so many times. Tried all three locations too!!
