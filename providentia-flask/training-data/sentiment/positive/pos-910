Came here to eat with my hubby and loved it. 

Foie Gras: Excellent! Loved the fruit compote it came with and the brioche

French Onion Soup: Perfectly seasoned

Raw Oysters on a 1/2 Shell: So delicious. Fanny Bay & Kumamoto was very fresh

Prime Filet Carpaccio: Just Ok. I've had better. It definitely lacked seasoning. Maybe some capers and aioli could've made it taste less bland

Creamed Corn: Very Yummy. Perfectly seasoned and very fresh

Potato Croquette: Very bland. Could use some seasoning or dip

Porterhouse: Very good

Bone In Filet Mignon: Saw great reviews on this so had  try it even  tho I'm more of a Ribeye lover. It was very lean and tender. 

Strawberry Shortcake: Delicious!!
