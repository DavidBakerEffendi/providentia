Why the hell does anyone go to Kona Grill?  Unless you want to take a spray tan gold digger to be your wife, seriously the food blows.  Happy hour can suck it, like the girl who can't find a seat and has to sit on your lap.  

Want great food, real happy hour, and a chill environment in real Island style hit Roy's.  Not only is their food fresh, delightful, innovative, and their staff is attentive and friendly.  We dont eat huge meals and they were happy to let us share.  The server actually recommended we have Opah two ways and both ways were wonderful.   They have a really cool cocktail menu and a great prix fixe menu deal this month. 

The crab salad with mango and avocado is now a new craving.  I could eat this for lunch everyday.
