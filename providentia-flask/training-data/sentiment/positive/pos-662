Heck yeah I'm going to write a good review for them! Love this place, can't wait to come back, period. Why? After a long trip, I went to Roy's across the street late on a Sunday, around 8:45pm and they said they were closing. Walked across the street to Flemings, got there at 8:50pm they were closing at 9pm. Guy at the front was like NO PROBLEM, come on in sir...

Not encouraging anyone to do the same and get there before closing but when people go out of their way to serve you that really goes a long way. My server was down to earth. Salad was amazing, filet mignon out of this world. Dessert was vanilla ice cream I believe with chocolate cake very very good as well. Thank you guys, might come back this Friday and bring my co-workers :)
