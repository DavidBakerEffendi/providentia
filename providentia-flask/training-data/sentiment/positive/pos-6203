I'm not sure what happened, but I haven't been to Pizza Heaven in quite some time (2+ years??) until just the other night the vegan Agave Bbbq pizza popped in my head.

I convinced my family to join me, and we each got something different so we could all share. We did the vegan pizza, vegan spaghetti, and a vegan calzone with vegan sausage and sun dried tomatoes.

First off, those 3 dishes produced leftovers of at least half the food. The portions are huge.

Second off, the food was AH-MAY-ZINNNNGGGG. The calzone was especially delicious and I have been thinking about it ever since. Even the spaghetti was fantastic. In fact, I'm eating it cold right now which is my inspiration for writing this review. 

My husband opted to not go the vegan route and built his own pizza with double Canadian bacon, mushrooms, and some other items I don't remember, but he was extremely satisfied and had his own set of leftovers he finished today. 

I will say that if you are on a diet, this is a terrible option, but if you want an incredibly delicious and hearty meal, do not skip this place; especially if you are vegan! 

Ps they cater to all eating types including gluten free and vegetarian as well. They also have vegan cheesecake which I've always been too stuffed to try.
