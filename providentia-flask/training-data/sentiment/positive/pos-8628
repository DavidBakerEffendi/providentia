This is my favorite favorite favorite place to eat, drink, read & work in Cave Creek. There is always an awesome band on the weekends. I love the Sunday afternoon music; there is a either a soloist or a duo strumming a guitar and singing - ahhh just perfect. I highly recommend this gem. Oh and their 'Wine Wednesdays' are an awesomely unpretentious way to expand your knowledge of that delectable drink.  Overall this place just has a wonderful vibe.
