O Shima is still hanging in there! I had lunch at O Shima yesterday and was as almost always blown away- now I do order a la carte which gets pricey, but for what I consider the best nigiri sushi in Calgary it's worth it. I got an order of chicken karaage (LOVE the spicy mayo on the side!) and three each chili gomae ebi (this is gunkan style- other places call it cajun prawn), spicy tuna (the gunkan one- not the roll- this is much better, more tuna and a nice spicy mouthful) and inari. That was a lot of food and every bite was delectable.
