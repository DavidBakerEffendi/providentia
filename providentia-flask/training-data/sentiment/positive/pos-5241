Location/Hours: On Market Street leading into Market Square, across from The Market and in between Diamond Market and Prantls. Mon-Fri 11a-8p. No Weekends : (

Staff: Warm, receptive and will remember your and your order if you become a regular. They will ask your name for the order and no matter how busy, they work hard but keep composure with the cashier always easy to talk to.

Sushi: It's my objective to try every roll that they have but that will be a while. They have many selections and roll sizes. They have party options and catering available. Their rolls are served rice on outside but let them know and they can change that. Wasabi/Ginger/Soy sauce will always be in your to-go order so don't shake your container around unless you enjoy ginger all over your sushi. They have miso, seaweed salad and other menu options as well.

Drinks: The options are awesome. They have cans/bottles of soda, Snapple, Red Bull of all sizes and fair priced, teas and traditional Asian drinks. 

Overall: Great sushi downtown, can become a tight space during lunch hour so I suggest going outside of 11a-1:30p. Yami Yami roll is a good start for those who haven't experienced raw fish sushi. The menu is a bit hard to read and on the wall. Grab a paper menu and sit down before ordering, there will always be a daily special on the chalk board. Enjoy
