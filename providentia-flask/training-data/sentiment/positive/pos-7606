A very inviting and comfortable place to eat with a good menu selection at reasonable prices.  Everyone who works there is super nice and eager to make your dining experience a good one! I had an omelet with cheddar and veggies which was good.  The breakfast potatoes wasn't the same old same old because the potatoes had red and green peppers and onions...those red peppers really make a big difference....Yum!   My husband had a burger, fries and cole slaw. He said everything was very good especially their cole slaw.  We took a piece of raspberry cheesecake to go and was delicious!
