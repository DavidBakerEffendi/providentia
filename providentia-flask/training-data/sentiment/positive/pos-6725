The food here is always top quality! They have one of the best salad bars with the freshest ingredients.  Their Ice-T is the best EVER!!!!
The waitstaff is very pleasant and kind as well it's very attentive.
The only drawback I saw was one of the bathroom stalls really needs attention!  There is something seriously wrong with the plumbing on One of the toilets. Otherwise, the bathroom is very clean as well as the restaurant.
