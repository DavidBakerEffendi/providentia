This was the best dinner I've ever had in my life for three reasons: unbelievably delicious food, amazing service...and somebody else picked up the tab. If you read my review of the Park Hyatt, you'll see I was lucky enough to attend an all-expenses paid conference at the hotel for work; we kicked off the meetings with dinner at Annona.

The restaurant had a set menu for us. My appetizer was a mixed greens salad with beets in a light dressing. That may not sound like much, but Annona managed to take something fairly simple and make it extraordinary. For a main I ordered the Chilean sea bass, which was served over wild rice and a mixed-veggie salsa. I love seafood, and this was out-of-this-world fantastic. Another main offered was steak, which most of my colleagues ordered and which was raved about by said colleagues for most of the week. A word of warning -- Annona is truly the place to turn any diner into a major critic. Every restaurant we went to from then on was rated as "good...but not as good as Annona."  And for dessert?  A lovely platter of little cakes and goodies. Most people went for the chocolate lava cakes (which were also raved about for the next week), which was fine by me since I got more than my fair share of creamy hazelnut ice cream. 

And the wine!  I don't know what kind it was, but like the meal, it was hands down the best I've ever had. A fruity white wine, not too sweet, and went down so smoothly. My glass was constantly refilled by one of the servers, and that just made it even better. I'm no expert in wine, but one of my coworkers worked for a winery in the Okanogen Valley and agreed that it was fantastic. 

If you're looking for a restaurant to go for a special meal, save your pennies and splurge at Annona.
