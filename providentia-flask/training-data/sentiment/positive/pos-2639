I'd been reading the Talk Thread "JJ's Dog of the Week - We Need Your Ideas to Create the Yelp dog!" https://www.yelp.com/topic/charlotte-jjs-dog-of-the-week-we-need-your-ideas-to-create-the-yelp-dog and loved the sound of the new Yelp Dog. Grilled beef dog on a pretzel bun with beer queso, sauerkraut, mustard and sweet sauteed onions.

And it took me until Saturday to get there, but the wait was worth it. The dog was tasty and super fattening and very messy. The queso and the pretzel bun were awesome, but about three quarters of the way through, it collapsed. Still, very tasty.

Get a seat upstairs if the weather is great!
