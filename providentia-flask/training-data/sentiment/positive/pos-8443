Absolutely love this new location, which features possibly the best food I've ever eaten at a Keg. I ordered the saut√©ed mushroom supreme chicken and my boyfriend ordered a steak and both dishes were cooked perfectly and to our liking. Service was great too and even though there was a bit of a wait (it was a Saturday night after all) it was pretty prompt to get a seating for two. They quoted us at 40 mins but we maybe waited 15. 

I also like the decor and the obscure art at this location. It really did have that King West vibe and it kept things visually interesting. There was one piece in particular, a backwards print that said "Road Ends," that kept catching my eye. Our server told us the artist who painted it was inspired because that was the last thing he saw before he crashed his car. I don't know why, but I kept thinking about that for a while after.

This location feels very alive. There were a lot of groups of friends going out for dinner and drinks, and this kept the ambiance exciting. Overall, it maintains a pretty chill vibe even though everyone was beautifully dressed. If you can't make it east of Yonge to check out the mansion, the King West version also has a lot to offer.
