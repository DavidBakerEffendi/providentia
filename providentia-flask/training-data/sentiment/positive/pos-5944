Had friends meet for a birthday party here! 1st time I've been there heard about it Glad I went had a fantastic time! Sitting outside on the turf furniture with the heater and fire pit going it was just perfect on a cool nite last nite . Don't have to wait for service from cocktail servers or self service plenty of bars open even on a Saturday nite. Music outside live and Dj spinning inside whatever you like to spend your time doing there you'll have fun! Playing beer pong or giant chess? It a great time very hip I will recommend this cool establishment to all my friends and I'll be back
