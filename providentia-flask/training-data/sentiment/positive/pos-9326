I came here with my dog one afternoon I had off of work to try out one of their facebook specials- a turkey and cranberry sammy with cream cheese, tomato, and lettuce. The sandwich was seriously phenomenal and the employees were very sweet and happy. I can't wait until they start staying open later and add music to the patio so I can sit out there one of these cool nights with a glass of pinot and maybe the OMG sandwich. Definitely loving this neighborhood restaurant, even while they continually grow.
