Quick and tasty drinks before Tarbell's opened and pleasantly surprised at the cocktail menu! They do not serve hard alcohol so I always admire the craftiness and originality restaurants come up with.
My husband drank a green flash IPA and I ordered the sake champagne mojito. Fresh and tasty! We sat next to the window and enjoyed the rain fall and parents night out. Our server was attentive and made our transition to dinner awesome!
