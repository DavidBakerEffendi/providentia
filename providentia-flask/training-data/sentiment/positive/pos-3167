This cute little restaurant is simply incredible.

The food is delicious. We had the duck ravioli with foie gras and scallops ceviche with kiwi as an appetizer. Needless to say the foie gras mousse is so good that we wiped the dish with the warm bread that was brought to our table at the beginning of the dinner. 

Main course consisted of the famous braised pork belly and catch of the day. Don't miss the pork belly dish, it has an amazing combination of ingredients. The catch of the day was grouper served with tiny baby potatoes and bacon, bacon baby, a fish dish with bacon can't go wrong and this one was outstanding!

For dessert I had the caramelized endive with goat cheese and citrus, which for my surprise is listed as an appetizer in the online menu. Appetizer or dessert the endive was great. The other choice was the chocolate mousse with cherries, my favourite! 

The cocktails in this resto are made with love, spicy caesar with a white pickle and old fashioned with amaretto were certainly perfect choices to kick off the dinner. The small list of wines is carefully selected, it is rare to find sauvignon blanc with so much character as the one we chose to go along  with our food. 

Last but not least the service is great. As the pause between the different courses was a little bit long the sweet staff brought us single dumpling as amuse-bouche to consume while waiting. 

I'm coming back for more and next time I'll be sitting at the bar to observe how this magic food is prepared!
