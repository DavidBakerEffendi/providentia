Went here twice on a recent foray in Vegas - once for dinner at the bar and a second time just drinking at the bar.

Sushi-wise, the restaurant does a good job. Their rolls are creative and beautifully presented. Check out the Rainbow Dragon, as the use of red peppers offers a pretty un-traditional take on Japanese sushi rolls. It's definitely expensive to grab a meal here once you tack on drinks, but I would say it's worth it. Don't come expecting traditional/formal sushi, although you can definitely get that if you come here. I would recommend being adventurous and getting something that is unique to the restaurant. The portions aren't huge and while it's easy to complain about that, well, this ain't the Wynn buffet people! Consider it your opportunity to splurge and try a plethora of dishes to widen your palate. Or, since their kitchen is open well past midnight, stroll in later in the night for a post-gambling/show/club-hopping snack.

Samba-wise, the ambiance fits the decor they're trying to promote - some sort of trendy and dark restaurant. If you want a quiet meal, don't come here (actually - why are you even in Vegas??).

Drink-wise, this place excels. The Tequilana Caliente is a tasty cocktail that packs a punch. The Caipirinha uses high quality Leblon cacha√ßa. And if those two aren't good enough (or you're like me and you drink both cocktails and want a third), try the Chu-Cumber sochu - our bartender made this into a shot, which went down so smoothly even though it was basically all alcohol. The one downside that evening was that they were out of their plums for their Bushido drink, a cocktail that has daikon in it too. I guess that means there's always something to come back to.
