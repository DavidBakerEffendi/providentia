One of my favorite local spots for years. The food is amazing and not what you would expect from a "sports bar".
Most of the staff has been there for years, some over a decade. I think that alone speaks for Armadillo as a establishment. The owner is often seen serving and helping out which is rare these days.  They have Trivia nights, horse race betting and several TV's going to keep you entertained. Don't be deceived by calling themselves a sports grill. Their food is some of the best in the area. Add them on Facebook and check out their daily drink specials. Hats off to Armadillo Grill for staying great over the years.
