Ok. I have now been to Zenith, NOT for shopping, but for their delicious food!

There evening dinners are a feast of cheap and plentiful vegan and vegetarian cuisine.
And then there is the Sunday brunch...
For 10 bucks you get coffee, an all-you-can-eat buffet of every type of salad, noodles, cakes, and pies imaginable... PLUS a brunch entree!
Get there early or you will have to wait.  The atmosphere is super casual, the food is homemade, and it is the perfect spot to catch-up with friends.
