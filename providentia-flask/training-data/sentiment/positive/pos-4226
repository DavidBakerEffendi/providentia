I freakin loved TOPGOLF in Scottsdale. It was a blast! Think of a huge golf driving range that is high on testosterone. It's got the golf aspect, mixed with the team and competition aspects of bowling, with the scoring aspect of darts.

You get a bay with a computer that tracks where you hit your ball. And there are targets on the range worth various points. Hit your targets and score. 

Besides the golf, they've got crap loads of bars and have all kinds of booze in bottles and on draught. Plus, their food is great too!

Topgolf is a place to have competitive fun, eat fresh food, get plastered and chase tail. It's super popular, and there's 2-3 hour waits on weekends to get a driving bay. Crazy stuff!

Can't wait til one comes to the Bay Area!

5 stars!!!
