What a pleasant surprise. Trip advisor reviews do not do this establishment justice. Yelp is a true reading of what this restaurant is...a gem! A limited but fantastic menu. I started with a maple old fashioned which was amazing. Next was the local snow crab chilled on ice with an amazing warm herb butter in a dish to dip which was almost not needed because the crab was so sweet! Crab was cut so we didn't make a mess extracting it. For mains I had the braised Venecin that was perfectly cooked with Brussel sprouts and fried caramelized pasta on the side. The meat was not gamey and was very delicious. I liked how it was under salted so you could taste the true flavor of the meat but others may say otherwise. My wife had the truffle pumpkin risotto which was also fantastic.  Could have used more pumpkin but overall amazing. Service was on point and the ambience/decor was outstanding. Some mentioned that the music was too loud but it was just fine up until I left at 9:30. Would highly recommend! Make reservations as its a small place and fills quick!
