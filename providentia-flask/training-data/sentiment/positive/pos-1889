Found Gimme Some Sugar at a local temple bazaar selling chocolate brownies and cookies and had to give them a try.  YUMMY!!!!!!!!!! Great chocolate brownie with both delicious cake and frosting.  Ditto for the oatmeal peanut butter cookies wih mini M&M's.  Found out that the storefront business is open Fridays and Saturdays so I'll be back on special occassions.
