Have you ever been in a situation where you wanted brunch, but didn't know where to go?  With 9.5 other people (one being a small child)?  All of different ethnicities and food tastes?  And with no reservations?  Well, I was in this situation last Saturday.  Thankfully, Served bailed me out and provided a wonderful brunch to this motley crew.

Even without reservations, the staff snuck us in and seated us pretty quickly.  While the majority of my party ordered regular "American" breakfast food, I could not pass up the longsilog, which came with 3 crispy-cooked links of Filipino sausage, pickled papaya, and garlic fried rice topped with 3 fried eggs, just like Mom used to make (if you grew up in a Filipino household).  

My brother-in-law did get the soft shell crab benedict, which he "crushed," leaving the plate clean.  Other offerings at the table included some huge omelets and a few orders of blueberry pancakes.  By the end of the meal, all of our plates were empty, but our bellies were full
