Went here walking back to the hotel from the Riviera.  Excellent atmosphere.  Really quiet setting, kind of like they pump white noise into the place.  Got the patty melt and onion rings.  It was the best patty melt I have tasted in my entire life!!!  The onion rings were a little greasy but thats what made them so good!  Large portions and well worth the 10 bucks!  Highly recommended spot!  I will definately be back again when I venture out to Vegas!
