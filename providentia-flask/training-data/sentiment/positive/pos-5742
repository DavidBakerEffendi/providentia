I've never had a bad experience here! The people are nice and the food is delicious! I think the seating is kind of weird because all the table are in the center of the room surrounded by booths, it feels a little awkward, but that would be my only complaint and it is definitely not worth not trying this place out! One of my favorite places in Vegas. Yum :)
