I've had a few matcha lattes here and overall I really enjoy the good food and excellent service here. It's pretty unique. You know about the maid costumes and the dancing. You can actually go on stage and dance as well as part of the show. I did not but there was a bachelor party there and the groom did. The dancing is ok, the music is fun. You can take pics with the maids or uncle tetsu if he's there. 

Matcha latte: very good, comes with a bear image on top but you can ask for other things like a cat.

Yuzu lunar cheesecake: sweeter than the angel hats, and more like a traditional cheesecake. The yuzu flavour is apparent and the presentation is well done.

Strawberry angel hat: pretty fluffy and tasty. Not too filling so good for dessert.

Overall, I can't see much wrong with having a unique experience and pretty good food and drinks. The more the better.
