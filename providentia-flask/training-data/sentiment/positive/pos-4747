It's far away from where I live, but it's always worth the drive. I lived on the east coast my entire life before moving to Vegas and this place feels like home to me. Admittedly I've never had anything other than the bagels here- but because they're so good! I've had their various sandwiches on bagels and always been happy with the food. The prices are reasonable, the service is quick, friendly and efficient.
