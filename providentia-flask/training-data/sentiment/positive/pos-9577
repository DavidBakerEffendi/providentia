This burger place is definitively a hidden gem. 
Great service and friendly staff. 

Their number one seller (according to their employee) 'Apple Butter Burger' has made to top of my favourite burger list. It is one of the best burger I've ever had. The patty is cooked to perfection, it's juicy and thick,  the apple butter sauce goes well with everything, and the big buns soaks up all the sauces and extra juices so no messiness.

The 'Masala Burger' is not as heavy as ABB in terms of sauces, and has a curry taste to it. It's a bit spicy, and you also have an option of adding extra spicy sauce. 

The 'Salisbury Burger' is another one of my favorites! Lots of gravy and meaty! Yum!

The poutine was also great but I'm gonna stick to regular fries next time as it was a bit too heavy for me and their regular fries are pretty amazing!
