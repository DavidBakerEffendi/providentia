I'm not sure why I don't eat here every week.  The shishito peppers are to die for.  I tried the forbidden rice and it was unbelievable.  So many great flavors and very unique.  Too full for dessert.  My husband loved his short rib ramen and my margarita was solid. Great place!! Also Heather our server was very sweet.
