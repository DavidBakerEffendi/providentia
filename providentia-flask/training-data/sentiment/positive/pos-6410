The Porch is our new favorite local hangout. The wings are sooo good! All the food we've had has been really yummy.Great happy hour with good beers. Love the open ambiance. The manager was super nice trying to get the MLB game we were looking for. He said they didn't have it, but we're soon getting the MLB pkg, so should get all the games. Servers/bartenders have all been really efficient and nice. We do try to avoid coming on Friday & Sat, as it is way too loud and packed. We come during the week which has a more relaxed chill vibe. Also, always great tunes playing!
