I've had this restaurant bookmarked to try for over 3 yrs but was hesitant because I was not big in formal or pretentious settings.  I am so glad I finally came here! The service was impeccable and I absolutely loved the spinach gnocchi that came with my meal. The texture was both gooey and pillowy at the same time and it had a hint of lobster demi-glaze versus being drowned in sauce. My main course, a white fish that was similar to sea bass, was very tasty as well. loved the western atmosphere and even though it was a bit formal, it was not pretentious at all. I will definitely be back for brunch.
