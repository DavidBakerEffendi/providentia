Delicious! Have come here many times over the years whenever I'm craving authentic home style  Brazilian food for takeout and dine in. 

The decor is very casual, the staff extremely friendly (even if you don't speak Portuguese!), and the service prompt.

Highly recommend trying the:
- mandioca (an appetizer a bit like fries that are slightly sweet)
- beef or cheese pastels (an appetizer sort of like a fluffier version of an empanada)
- coxinhas (an appetizer sort of like tastier versions of chicken drumsticks)
- chicken milanesa (an entree, imagine a chicken parmigiana-esque dish)
- picanha (an entree, essentially a good cut of steak with great seasoning)

All their entrees come with seasoned rice, salad, and a hearty portion of beans. Don't forget to ask for some farofa to be sprinkled on your entree - I can't do without it! 

My only complaint: the beans are a bit on the salty side!
