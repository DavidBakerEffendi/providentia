Well, dang. This place served it up really well. 

I pulled out the Yelp app to get myself directions to the place (as I was meeting friends) and quickly learned I could get a $.01 mimosa for checking in when I got there. OOOOOOOKAY. No problemo. Doneski.

The mimosa was delicious with my veggie sandwich on an everything bagel and the onion rings. DUDE. Order the onion rings. They were delicious. The service was impeccable and we were all sufficiently stuffed and so happy when we left.

I highly recommend this place, especially for lunch! It's huge, perfect for groups and so delicious.
