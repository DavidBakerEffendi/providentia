This bakery is becoming an addiction... geez. I now stop in weekly to pick up scones or a treat for my weekends with my love. Who doesn't want a maple pecan glazed scone with their coffee? I switched it up and got the salted caramel brownie and the pumpkin cheesecake for our dinner date and was blown away by the brownie. Crisp on top with flecks of sea salt, caramel oozing on top like a proud river of sugar love. (don't judge me... It was so good I got poetic) The pumpkin cheesecake knocked my guys socks off and will be his birthday cake this year for sure. Fresh whipped cream, whole ingredients and perfect texture make this a clear winner. Why have you not been here yet?
