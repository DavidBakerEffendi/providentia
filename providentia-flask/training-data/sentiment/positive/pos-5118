Stopped in for lunch.....had a wonderful French Dip w/ the best deli-style cole slaw I've had in yrs !  This place takes me back to my Long Island roots , where we practically lived at the deli....fully intend to take my wife back there for Sun. brunch. ( also brought home some macaroons .....my wife loved 'em ).
