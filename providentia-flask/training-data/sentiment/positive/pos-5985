I love this place! 
Service is always top notch, and the entertainment is great! From the moment I walked in, I knew it would be a good night (well, night*s* - I got the same feeling both times I went here). The music is soulful and full of life. Mirrors line the stage and stage ceiling so you can watch the musicians work their magic from any seat. The decor is pretty over the top, but that's what I love about it. Giant chandeliers, wine bottles on the wall, stained glass and grape-cluster lights, horse and dog statues - quite a bit of visual stimuli. The waiters and waitresses are efficient, friendly, and very attentive. The chicken and ribs combo is really good, and the chicken wings have a nice kick. The escargot were garlicky and delicious. The potato skins are nothing to write home about - they're topped with imitation bacon and lack a bit of oomph. The martini with port is pretty good, too. The creme brulee trio is presented nicely, and is quite good. 
There's just something about being here that puts the rest of the world on hold so that you just enjoy good company, good music, and good food.
