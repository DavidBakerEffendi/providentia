Great little quaint bakery specializing in fresh made pastries from cream puffs, tiramisu tortes, mini cheese cakes, cupcakes to chocolate mousse bombs. They also make cakes for all occasions from birthdays to weddings. Don't forget the huge pie selection from fruit pies to banana cream and even hot fudge pies. And if your in for lunch they also have a nice selection of sandwiches, wraps, salads and soups. 

We ordered their Lemon Ricotta cookie, Chocolate Chip cookie, Turtle Torte, tiramisu Torres, Cannoli and mini cheesecake. They were all really delicious. Not overly sweet, they were light and airy, just pure perfection. My wife really does not like tiramisu but she pretty much ate the whole torte here. If your craving something sweet this is definitely the place!
