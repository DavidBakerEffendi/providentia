My husband brought me here last night to celebrate Mother's Day. There was quite a crowd and we were told that is we wanted to be seated sooner, we could choose the patio. It was starting to cool down, so we decided that would be fine. We were served blueberry lemonade as we waited outside under the misters, that was an awesome touch. A waitress came by offering menus so that people could choose what they wanted prior to being seated. Our orders were written on a slip of paper that we were instructed to hand to our server at our table. It only took about 30 minutes to get a table. This outdoor section is much quieter than inside and there is more space between tables, it is very intimate, but you can still enjoy the ambiance of the place. Our dinner was amazing as always, and our server Krista was fantastic. Our drinks came out almost immediately, followed very quickly by our salads. BY the time we were nearly finished with our salads, our steaks were delivered. We didn't have time to need anything else. The service was absolutely outstanding! Thank you so much for a great date night out Krista! You went above and beyond for us.
