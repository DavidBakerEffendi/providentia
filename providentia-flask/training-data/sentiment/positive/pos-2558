I don't know where their breakfast sausage comes from,  but LOVE at first bite!  

I don't understand how some people think the food here is mediocre. Everything I've tried so far, and there's been quite a bit, has been delicious. It's a hidden gem! Of course the area looks shady and there's questionable people in the parking lot, but the restaurant itself has some tasty meal options. And boy do they have options!  Which for a small restaurant is difficult to manage and sometimes can be a bad thing if everything has the same bland flavor, but the things I've had have all been very tasty in their own way.
