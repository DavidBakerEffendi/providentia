Ravisoups, where have you been all my life? I've been working on the edge of the Entertainment District for almost 3 years and I just found out about this place a few months ago. It's not in a location you'd usually walk by...it's on Adelaide west of John, just a little bit past where you'd think anything would be.

I've only been for lunch along with all the other suits who know the Ravisoups secret. Most businessmen seem to be in too big of a hurry to stay, but they have a very comfortable and serene back patio, as well as a giant communal table inside.

You can either get a soup, a wrap, or a soup & wrap combo (recommended). I'm not much of a soup guy myself, but Ravisoups has me on my knees praying for forgiveness from the soup gods. Each soup is made to perfection using a variety of flavours from North America and the chef's native Sri Lanka.

If I had only been to Ravisoups once, I would have recommended my first menu choices (flank steak wrap and red pepper bisque soup, oh how I remember you well). But after trying almost everything on the menu, you can go wrong. Pork shoulder wrap...corn chowder...roasted vegatables wrap....miso hot pot....just keep on coming back to try everything on the menu.

Go. Now.
