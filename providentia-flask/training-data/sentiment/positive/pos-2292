The owner of this fantastic pizzeria and restaurant is Nick, formerly of Bona Pizza. 
My husband ran into him at a gas station. We were wondering what had happened to him. His food was too good for him to not be cooking. 

The food is as always delicous.  I had the chicken Angello which is my favorite. The pasta  has the best sauce I have ever had. The chicken perfectly seasoned with a magical lemony sauce. 
The DH had a philly cheesestake. He stated it was one  of the best he has had. 

The family is so welcoming. They make you feel welcome and want to be there. 

The prices affordable. 

We will be back!
