What an amazing burger place!

First visit I tried the County Fair burger which is bison, and on my second visit I had the fried chicken sandwich with pickles.   Both were fantastic, the buns, the meat, and the toppings were all superb.

Each time we visited our servers were enthusiastic and energetic, it is always nice to go somewhere where the staff actually enjoys their job.  

Would highly recommend this place, get a milkshake, they are delicious!
