This location is in a great spot nestled in the DC plaza with Sprout's Farmer's Market. We both ordered the Cabo plate (shrimp burrito, fish taco, rice & beans). The restaurant is new, fresh, clean and beautiful!

Today was the official "soft opening" for all Beach Club members who RSVP'D for a time slot in the day. This location opens to the public on March 8th!

The Staff is Super friendly and the food is REALLY TASTY!

The entire menu is great however my favorite is the Cabo plate and it is delicious! 

Thank you Rubio's for being so Awesome!
