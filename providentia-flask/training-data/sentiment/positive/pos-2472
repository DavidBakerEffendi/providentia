Have lived in south charlotte my whole life I have eaten at every fine dining restaurant and heritage is in my top 5. People usually save such a special place like this for a birthday treat, but myself on the other hand constantly seeks fresh, farm to table food and that is RARE my friend. You will not be disappointed here. The price may be high but for the quality it sure is worth it. Very romantic- service impeccable, and have never been disappointed. With giving a try, + they were voted best restaurant in Charlotte recently.
