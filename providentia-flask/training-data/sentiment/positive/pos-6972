Wow you guys, This place is the best of the best! 

I have walked by here sooooo many times on my way home and every time I always think to my self " hm gotta try that place sometime!". Well friends I finally have and I am getting some mixed feeling about this place. Only because It is SO close to my house and I have to try and stop myself from eating here every day. It's that good. I almost wish it was further so I wouldn't be so tempted! 

Anyways I took my boyfriend here for his birthday lunch the other day. He got the burger of the day which was a mozzarella burger that looked and smelt so amazing. I got the club sandwich and honestly I'm not 100% what was all on it but I think magic was one of the ingredients. Yum!
The price was totally worth it ($40 ish), usually I'd spend a bit less for lunch but it was a special occasion so why not!

Also staff was A+! Super friendly and accommodating. 
I for sure will be returning soon!
