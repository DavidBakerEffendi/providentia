wanted a change of scenary from the loews resort...and decided on heading over to the ritz for the night...."the ritz"....familiar sound that has been embedded into my mind as the definition of old school class, elegance and luxury....

the ritz carlton did not disappoint.....amazingly friendly and attentive staff...quick to make every step within the ritz comfortable as possible.....decore is impeccably classy and comfortable....neutral colored environment to make it all that more comfortable for the eyes also.....
