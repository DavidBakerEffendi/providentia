This place is top notch and a great addition to the area for a number of reasons.

The gas is cheaper than the nearby Shell and other gas stations. They also have full service too.

The car wash/detail service is excellent -- especially in comparison to everywhere else in the area. My black car looks great after the wash and the hand sprayed polish wax (part of one of the wash packages) keeps the car finish shiny and protected for weeks and through multiple washes. If you have a high end vehicle or just want your car to look great, take it here. A refreshing plus is that nobody here will attack you with high pressure "deals" you neither want nor need. 

The food is also excellent. I never expected to be eating regularly at a gas station, but I get food here every few days. They serve all three meals daily. The brisket (best I have ever had), chicken tacos and breakfast tacos (the bacon and egg one is my favorite) are top notch. My kids like the chicken skewers and my wife favors all of their salads. This place has tasty food and is a good value with large portions.
