Beautiful! Beautiful!!  Is how I describe the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas.  Walking through the grand entrance, looking down on the pool with gondolas paddling by, takes you away to another world.  Inside, the ceilings are not to be missed!  Be sure to look up!  Oh, this hotel just takes your breath away!
