My first time here and I loved it. Was recommended to this place by my good friend. Walked up and Lisa was just amazing from the start. Explained to us a few of there entrees and she recommended a couple. I ordered the short ribs which Lisa recommended and It was just amazing. I'll start coming here and bringing my family too.
