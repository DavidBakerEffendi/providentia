If you are a dessert fanatic this is definitely somewhere you should try! 

Just left with complete satisfaction. We came here because I saw it on yelp as well as it's 5 star review. Theeeeen I saw it online for being on the Top 15 places to eat in Las Vegas. That sold it for me!

Today we had the opportunity to go after shopping at the north outlets. I was excited because I knew it was far and in a random area. It's located on the very end of the strip heading into down town. It's a small shop so keep a good eye looking for it!!! I was super excited when we found it. It's pretty small but can fit a good amount of people. 

The moment I walked in, I noticed the colorful display of gelato. The owner was really nice and started us on the gelato tour since we're newbies. It was pretty awesome getting to try all the flavors! They are soooo delicious. I'm a very basic girl, so I didn't know how I would react. Usually it wouldn't be hard for me to decide on what I wanted, but this time it was hard for me to decide!! I ended up going with mixing orange and lemon. Lemon was yummy and sour and the orange leveled it out with a not too sweet taste. My boyfriend got a mix of raspberry and snickers&almond flavor and was in love! His little brother got the cookies and cream which was smooth tasting. And my friend got a mix of three: snickers&almond, chocolate something and chocolate something.....they were just two different chocolates, lol. They all had really cool names and then we saw all the other creative flavors like salmon, to lavender, to creme brûlée. 

This place is definitely awesome and a MUST go. I'm gonna bring my friends and make sure that this place is well known!

It's a hidden delicacy of Las Vegas.
