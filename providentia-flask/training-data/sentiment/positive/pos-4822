This place rocks! Solid food, very well defined Flavors and textures. Fantastic wine program accentuated with Trocken Rieslings and beautiful Austrians. 
Service is great, big upper hand when compared to Lotus. Items recommended:
Crab curry
Quail eggs and dried shrimp
Beef Jerky
Pad Thai ( I know, maybe boring, but it's the main indicator of quality for me)

Don't be afraid to over order one or two dishes. The price allows to do that. 
Make reservations!
