FANTASTIC!! I found their food truck today at University and Gerrard and had the chicken sabaya roll. It was absolutely delicious! Stuffed full of veges like mushrooms, peppers, onions and tender chicken bursting with flavour. I got a touch of their awesome house hot sauce which added just the right amount of kick. Looking forward to trying out their other menu items too.
