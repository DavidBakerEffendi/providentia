I have only love for this awesome sandwich, salad, and sweet shop. Bertha stays true to her own menu with a breakfast burrito with roasted tomatoes and sweet carmalized onions. The veggie sandwiches were a huge hit with coworkers... If I can only stay away from the awesome chocolate cookies with white chocolate.
