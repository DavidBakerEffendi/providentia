I came here a few nights ago in search to try out my first Mediterranean restaurant and was glad I did my research.  Duzan had opened just a few days earlier and  Amer, was extremely friendly.  They were scheduled to close at 8pm but stayed open for us to enjoy the quality food and time.  Some people even walked in after we left and they stayed open for them. 

Service: 10

They treat everyone equally and let each person take their time. 

Food: 9

Only reason it's not a 10 is because I don't know what to compare it to but I'll definitely be back to Duzan.  I'd like I try out their original location, Amena Cafe & Bakery.


I'm getting hungry... Thank you Amer!
