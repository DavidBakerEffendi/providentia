Seriously amazing late-night bites. We enjoyed every single dessert they have on the menu and loved them all. The big surprise was the hot apple tart - oh my land, so yummy. Service was amazing, even with a smaller bill - we were taken care of just as if we were spending hundreds. Thanks so much for a great visit!!
