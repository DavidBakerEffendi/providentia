I came here for happy hour (or, happiest hour!) with my coworkers, interested to try out a place that I hadn't heard much about. Open-minded and ready for a couple drinks amidst tax season, we took our seats outside at a picnic table. 

To start, we got bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers, fried pickles, the giant pretzel with cheese, and drinks. My fig mule was just what I needed. The Besos Calientes and skinny margs were very well received by our table. We polished off the first round of apps happily (the pretzel was my favorite, but everything hit the spot) and ordered round two: more jalapeño poppers, twice cooked chicken wings, and the short rib nachos. The wings were alright, but everyone really enjoyed the nachos. 

We also jumped at the opportunity to try the tacos. One order of each: green chile pork, blackened shrimp, and braised short rib. Plus veggie tacos. YUM. All of them. 

Service throughout was great. Our girl was friendly and made sure our drinks were never empty. When my friend and I decided to share the Porch burger off the happy hour menu (with a side of the truffle parmesan fries- which I wouldn't recommend only because the truffle was REALLY strong), it came out split and on separate plates. We hadn't even requested it that way! 

Overall, we were thrilled and appreciative of everything The Porch had to offer. I can't wait to enjoy more patio drinks and eats before the temperature climbs any higher.
