We stopped by to discover this new sports bar-style location opened in the last few days. The pizza was great (Brak had sausage and I stuck with cheese). 

The bar sits in the middle of the dining room, with plenty of bar seating and at least 20 booths and tables nearby. They've taken the sports bar label seriously; with all the TVs, this would be a good place to watch the game. 

They are staffed up and don't seem to be held back with opening issues. Don't forget to ask for pie cut.
