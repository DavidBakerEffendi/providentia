A friend recommended this place to me and on my last night in toronto a small group of us made an early reservation to get a prime seat on the front patio.

I can't remember what it was called but I ordered a cocktail with ginger beer in it. High recommended! I only had 1 - but if I didn't have to fly the net day I would have had a few more - fantastically unexpected bite!

Started with chips and salsa and guacamole - seriously could have made a meal of these and almost did. Chips were served warm. We were all in our glory!

Nadine and Karen and I decided to split two orders of tacos which ended up being a perfect amount of food - short ribs on one side and LA truck (I think they were called) on the other. Equally delicious. Howard ordered tacos with poblano peppers and cheese and ate all 3 without a peep so I know him enjoyed them! We also shares an order of corn on the cob for the table. I would love to find the recipe - they were a major hit with our table!

We topped of the meal by splitting a churro a poutine between the four of us. The churro a were delicious on their own but the hot Carmel sauce and melting marshmallows added to the experience - and there were 4 in the order so we were all happy!

Service also should be noted as it was fantastic. Very good recommendations - we took them all - and very pleasant attitude. She went to find out what was on the corn for us and was back in seconds with the ingredients. Haylen always had a smile on her face and everyone there seemed really nice - we will definitely be back!
