This is one of my new favorite spots!! We sat at the bar and found the drinks to be moderately priced. We ordered the Poke Tuna, which was phenomenal! Highly recommend this appetizer! We ordered two entrees to both try, steak and the scallops. The steak was cooked perfectly! The portions were perfect! For dessert we ordered the apple pastry dish. It was unique and delicious. With dessert we had two coffee drinks. Wow - really good and HUGE! Well worth the $4!! We will be back soon!
