What a wonderful smoked brisket penne for a lunch special. Absolutely delicious. Tender and perfectly smoked. The Zin by the glasses goes excellent with it.

Bartender is polite and friendly and over bearing or in your face.

Excellent room, with the bar and kitchen behind, but all open, as the centre piece.

The Bay did a great thing opening this space up for the downtown client√®le

Thank you.
