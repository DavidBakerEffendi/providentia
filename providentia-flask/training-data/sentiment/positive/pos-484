The hubz and I landed in Vegas at 9, checked in at Wynn and met my bff and her hubz for some brunch. The Lobster Eggs Benedict alone hit the 5 star mark! Here's the play by play...I asked for outside seating since it was such a beautiful day and the pool looked intoxicating. Hostess mentioned a 15 minute wait so we headed for the bar for some yummy flutes of mimosas. Our table was ready in minutes but we got held up at the bar. The hostess kindly mentioned that are table is ready whenever we are :) We headed out after our drinks and ordered a huge pitcher of Sangria...ummm delicious! The hubz ordered a burger (wth?) the bff ordered waffles with a side (or should I say a mound) of bacon and fries while her hubz had some linguisa! Everyone savored every bite! Now more about that adicting Lobster Eggs Benedict...its addicting...forgive me for not providing photos...trust me...GO!
