Was at the beer store across the street. My wife and I wanted a night in. I have driven by sloppy joes everyday for the past couple of years. Thanks to yelp we decided to call for take out. I ordered 10 wings mild and a sloppy Joe sandwich with fries. First off the portion was enormous. Two of us shared each meal and couldn't come close to finishing. The price was a little over $20. Which was fantastic. We ate Saturday night bar food for $10 each. Never seen wings that big. There probably raised on an all you can't eat chicken feeder barn. The sloppy Joe sandwich looked like it came out of a can. But exceeded expectations with a great taste. Coleslaw was warm. Should be served separately. Fries had a great fat oily taste to them. Probably super calories. Picked up food at bar. Waitress very polite and was eager to serve. Will go back again next Saturday and dine in. Thank u very much sloppy joes.
