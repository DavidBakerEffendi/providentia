This is a very friendly, NY style deli.  Our server, Jessica could not be any nicer or more efficient.  By far, the best blintzes west of the Hudson river.  Pastrami is very good.  Lox and bagels excellent.  Good size portions and very reminiscent of my growing up in Brooklyn.  We are there at least once a week for lunch.  Full bar available.
