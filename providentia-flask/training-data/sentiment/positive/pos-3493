Kyoto is by far one of the best all you can eat sushi places in Vaughan! The fish tastes fresh compared to a lot of the other sushi places iv been to. It's also not as expensive as other sushi restaurants and their all you can eat menu has a large selection! 
You have to try their pink lady speciality roll! It's my favourite !!! 
Their take out menu is great and cheap. Pretty much the same selection as all you can eat and you can get rolls for as cheap as $3! 
Kyoto is my go to sushi place. Try it, you won't be disappointed !
