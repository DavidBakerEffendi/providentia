I've only done take out from here, but it has quickly become my favorite for Mexican food in the area. Their nachos and green chile dip are amazing. The nachos have tons of cheese on them and the take out size is enormous. I had the fish tacos as well, but they should probably be eaten at the restaurant. They were good, just something that should be eaten as soon as it's served. Definitely looking forward to going in person and trying out their margaritas.
