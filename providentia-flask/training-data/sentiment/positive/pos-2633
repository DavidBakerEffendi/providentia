I am not a steak and potatoes gal, so normally a steakhouse isn't really my kind of place, but I came away from N9NE feeling it was one of the best meals I had in Vegas.

The interior was intriguing. At most places, eyes are drawn outward at windows or art on walls. Here, the walls are stark concrete and eyes are drawn inward at the reflective interior columns and the center of the circular bar in the middle of the main floor. Colored lights created the atmosphere and I don't mean bright flashy lights. It was more mood setting light and the mood was a cool ambient chill. It doesn't hurt that some of the music was from my favorite band, Lemon Jelly. 

Our waiter was a big man, but gentle and helpful. He recommended a wine for our meal that he honestly thought complemented our food best. It so happened to be one of the less expensive ones.  It was a light pinot and we all loved it.

Two of us were heading towards the Surf and Turf, 8 oz filet mignon, half a lobster tail, white truffle aioli and red wine sauce ($52?) and one was of us was getting just the filet mignon. But the waiter then mentioned the specials, bless him, that included veal tenderloin and king crab bernaise (same price as the steak and lobster) and I immediately switched over to the special.

Absolutely no regrets, my beef was perfect, soft like butter. Delicious with the bernaise sauce too. Surf and Turf gal and I swapped bits from our plates and while hers was good, I just loved mine.

We ordered a selection of sides, too. Mac and cheese (good, the pasta was spirals, yum), mushrooms with caramelized onions, green beans (perfectly crisp tender, even as leftovers 2 days later) and lobster mashed potatoes, a meal in itself.

We arrived fairly late in the evening, maybe 9 pm, and lingered over our food until midnight. We were one of the last to leave, and nobody ever made us feel like we should go. 

I really can't fault them for a single thing, everything was perfect.
