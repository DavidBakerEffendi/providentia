I'm going to up my review for Urban Beans to five stars. The music generally seems to have improved, but more importantly, the weekend brunch offerings are awesome. In addition to a la carte items, UB offers a great multi-course breakfast, with your choice of side, main dish (including custom omelet), coffee and adult beverage (choice of mimosa or bloody mary). I don't remember the exact price but it's around $15 and worth every penny. And, if I'm going to have to be a coffee shop working on Sunday, it's awesome to be able to get a real breakfast and not just a pastry. Highly recommended :)
