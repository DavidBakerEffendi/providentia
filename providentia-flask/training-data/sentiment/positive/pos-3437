Art of Flavors definitely lives up to its five star rating. We were greeted right as we entered. It was our first time, so the gentleman behind the counter kindly gave us samples, without us having to ask, and explained each one. The gelato is creamy, delicious, and authentic and it was hard to choose a flavor. Friendly staff and great food make me a happy girl.
