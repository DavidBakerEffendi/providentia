The food here is outstanding.  I reiterate my previous 5 star rating from last year.  We waited 5 minutes for a table and had our food within 10 minutes of ordering.  The pizza is spectacular and the pasta doesn't disappoint.  I think they could do better with the dessert menu but overall it's fantastic.
