We stopped into Mimi's Cafe yesterday evening for dinner. It was our first time dining with Mimi's. We were promptly seated and waited on by a nice gentleman. I ordered the "Fit Fare Mahi-mahi" and my husband ordered the "Fit Fare Salmon". Before our order came up our waiter brought out some fresh bread. The carrot/raisin nut bread was amazing. It was almost like having dessert before dinner. Our entrees came out shortly and were well presented. My Mahi was on a bed of spinach and brown rice with a tomato basil sauce. The meal was excellent and I ate up every bite. My hubby enjoyed his meal, as well, and loved the tomato basil sauce my entree came with. After our meal, our server brought over some complimentary muffins (one low-fat blueberry muffin and carrot/raisin muffin) since it was our first time dining there. Mimi's exceeded my expectations and I look forward to going back again when we are in the area.
