We decided to do a Fried Rice fest the other night and ordered several fried rice dishes from Gaati Thai Kitchen in Henderson. We were blown away by the quality and flavors of the various dishes we ordered. Definitely going to try the rest of the menu soon, but if you're ever looking for outstanding fried rice dishes this place should be top of your list.
