I'm going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars because it's the closest thing to real Japanese tasting food I've had in Phoenix.  I had just spent 8 days in Tokyo after living there for many years, so I wasn't all that excited to try out another "almost" Japanese restaurant, but I'm glad I did.

The ramen was just like Japan, full of flavor and extras.  Usually ramen in Phoenix ends up being weak and small, but this was a massive bowl and very strong overall.  I got the tempura, which could have used a little more salt, but the ebi was very good.  Reasonable price overall, very large portion for about $9, then I got the meal option which gave me miso soup, rice, and salad with miso dressing.  The dressing was amazing.

My friends liked the nigiri sushi, but not the rolls as much.  I didn't try it so I can't comment.  

I'll be heading back to try some of their other offerings.
