We've been coming here a while now. What used to be one of Surprise's best kept dining secret is no longer much of a secret. 
Why? Because, like many diners, every item I've had from the menu becomes a favorite dish. I literally have to force myself to try something different each time. Eventually I reckon I'll make it all the way through the menu. 
Here's the hard part. Chef and owner Denis always puts some new amazing dish on the menu. Tonight's dish was rack of pork tenderloin with garlic noodles ($20). The pork was perfectly prepared and quite delicious. Hopefully it will make it onto the menu permanently. 
More good news is the long awaited expansion is complete. The seating inside and out is easily doubled as is the bar. 
This place rocks.
