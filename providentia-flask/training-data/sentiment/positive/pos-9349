I've been here twice and the food was great both times.
The first time I was here it was tapas night. My friend and I split 4 items and loved each one.
I came back a few nights ago and was able to enjoy their regular menu. We split the prosciutto wrapped stuffed mushrooms and I had the Chorizo manchego risotto. It was amazing. The chorizo was so flavorful, and unlike most chorizos, was not greasy at all.
Service here was always great. 
It's a very tiny restaurant so make reservations just in case (though I have never had to wait for a table, but better safe than sorry)
