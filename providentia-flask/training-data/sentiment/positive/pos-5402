The service here is beyond amazing! I only came in for fries, because my mother was taking too long in the grocery store, so I stopped by to check this place out, and it's so nice in here. It's a fun place to go and their food looks amazing! I've never had so much flavor on French fries in my life! They're addicting. So much so that if you try them, you're going to have to come back. If not for the food, then definitely for the incredible service. I can't wait to come back to try a burger!
