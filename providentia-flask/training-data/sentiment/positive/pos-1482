Monty's has started to bake their own doughnuts and they are without a doubt the best doughnuts in Madison.  One day they had a cake doughnut with oreo crumbles and icing and it gave me flashbacks to Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland, OR.  If I had a higher metabolism I'd stop and pick up a couple of doughnuts every day before work.  I can't do that but I do enjoy one once or twice a week.  Caveat emptor, these things are addicting. I only hope they broaden the variety of flavors.
