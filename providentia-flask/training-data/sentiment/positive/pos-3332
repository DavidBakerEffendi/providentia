Amazeballs
I've eaten here many times and brought my family here and we love it
Everything is very tasty and the service is quick 
The rotisterie stuff is especially tasty (we've tried the chicken and lamb and a friend has had the pork and loves it)
the chicken souvlaki is also great

We usually start with a mix of dips (all are really good)
