I hadn't been here in years when it was owned by the prior owner.  What a fantastic dinner we had!  The place hasn't changed that much physically, that is, still the bright red walls along the bright turquoise ones.  This place is the stereotype of chinese restaurants.  But, boy oh boy has the food changed.  The food was incredible.  
We started with egg drop soup, hearty and delicious at a mere $2.00  It had tofu in it too.  I had the shredded pork with brown rice (1.00 add on).  It was a huge portion but more importantly, delicious.  The other dish was a beef dish (name? ) Shi- something.  Large, large and delish, delish.  
Prices are super reasonable and service is attentive.
I will be coming back soon.  This place is giving great food with great pricing.  You can't get that in Scottsdale.
