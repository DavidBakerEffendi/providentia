Can only write about the beef buldogi because even though their menu is fairly extensive, that's all I ever order!  Even when I go to their foodtruck. Am hooked.  Love the slices of tender bulgogi Korean-style beef, Asian slaw, green onions, special sauce, all piled high on a yummy grilled dog.  Like plate lunch on a bun. Makes me want to drive right over and get one--just wish they had a drive-through!  Parking is usually available right out front, so only a few steps into Buldogis.
