This is seriously a hidden gem! Right off the corner of 16th street and Camelback. The burgers are cooked with red wine and you can really taste the wine once the burger is cooked- added with the cheese and awesome fries, this place is killer. they also have a sweet lunch menu deal that includes fries for like $6!
