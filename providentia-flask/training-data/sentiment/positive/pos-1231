Owner operated adding to a friendly environment and service.  A genuine establishment starting with quality ingredients and prepared with care right in front of you.  Delicious pizza!  I had and will definitely recommend the Biaggia pizza with prosciutto, fresh arugula, and a light sweetness from fig jam.  The Elana is very tasty as well with a nice savory and salty combo.  I look forward to returning and exploring more of the menu and specials.
