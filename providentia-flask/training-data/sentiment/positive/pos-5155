1st time here, we went for happy hour. Service was awesome, food was awesome! I left smiling ear to ear! We ordered fish taco Baja style, taquitos and a margarita all for $25! Yes $25! We couldn't even eat all the food and had tons of leftovers.  I will be back very soon! Looks like a favorite here is the fajitas,  100% will be trying it on the next visit.
