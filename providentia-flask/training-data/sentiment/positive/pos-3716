The last two times that I've been here were during lunch and then a few times before that for dinners with friends. Each time, the ramen has been delicious each and every time. Some of the ramen's broth does get salty in the end so that's just something to keep in mind.

I've usually get either the miso or the spicy ramen. The toppings and broth is slightly different for each of its ramen. For those who prefer something other than ramen, there are a few dishes on the menu that would be perfect for anyone who's not craving some delicious ramen.
