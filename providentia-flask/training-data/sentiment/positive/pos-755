Geez louise. I'm blown away. These pierogi are without a doubt the best I've ever had. Hand-made, browned perfectly, filled with fresh (vegan!) ingredients, and served with a tangy yogurt mustard sauce. And the portions! Well worth every penny.

I also enjoy the fresh craft cocktails and craft beers available. My fave cocktail so far is the vodka with black currant and burnt lemon - full of flavor and refreshing.

The vibe at Apteka is laid-back, with mismatched chairs and minimal decor. You order at the bar and food/drinks are brought out to you (seat yourself), which adds to the relaxed feel. Street parking is available on Penn Avenue. I see they now have a brightly-lit moniker out front so it's even easier to find.

Apteka will please your veg and carnivore friends alike, and I look forward to many more delicious meals there.
