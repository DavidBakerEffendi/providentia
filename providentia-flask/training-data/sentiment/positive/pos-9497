This place is awesome! A small "dive" bar with a retro vibe, a decent beer list, and fantastic hot dogs. Literally, the hot dogs are one of-a-kind. If you're a "foodie", you have to checkout this place out. 

The beef is high quality, juicy, and full of flavor. You can choose from a laundry list of divine toppings including multiple kinds of cheeses, pickled veggies, house-made condiments, meat toppings, and unique items all for one flat price. You can order as many different kinds of dipping sauces as you want, free of charge as well (I highly recommend the chipotle ketchup, garlic aoili, and this one spicy mustard which I forgot the name of)

The servers and bartenders were all friendly, we were greeted promptly and our food came out quickly. 

If you're looking for a casual and inexpensive date night or a place to meet up with friends to share great food and drink, while supporting a local pub, check out Happy Dog - another great local spot here in Cleveland!
