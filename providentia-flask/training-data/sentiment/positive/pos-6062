This is one of the best little quick-style Mexican food joints I've found. Compared to all of the 'Bertos out there, this place is second to none.

The quality of the food soars over similar places while the prices coudn't be any lower. I work across the street from Amados with one of those 'Bertos right around the corner. I will never even consider going over there when Amados is the much better choice.

Try the cabeza taco or the chorizo burrito if it's breakfast time! And the rolled tacos are perfect here!
