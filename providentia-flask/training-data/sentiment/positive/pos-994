When I have a craving for some Kalbi or Bulgogi this place comes thru for me. A big plus, I dont have to drive all the way over to Spring Mountain.  Lately Ive been having the Kalbi combo with salad and white rice. It also comes banchan too! The Kalbi soup is pretty good...although I wish it came with more meat!

The place is not that big but enough tables for 5 families maybe? There's a long table for larger groups in the middle. It gets busy here during lunch and dinner hours and the owner is usually the only one here. If dining in just seat yourself. Menus are on the table. For orders to go, just order at counter or call ahead.  

Cool thing too is they sell the Kalbi and Bulgogi marinate sauces.  I make a point to get some. They keep well in the fridge and make a good marinate for strip steaks!
