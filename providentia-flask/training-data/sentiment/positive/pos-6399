I loved it! This is the most cutest cafe I've been too in my life!  and the desserts and drinks are all a reasonable price and the service was absolutely great! If you ever come here this is a very good place have a nice dessert especially if your into Japanese culture! I'll be definitely coming back here when I'm in Toronto again
