This is one of the most interesting new restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Apteka serves Eastern European cuisine on Penn Ave near the hospital. 

A lifelong carnivore,  I can honestly imagine living on Apteka's vegan dishes happily.  The tastes are unique and the dishes well prepared.   Try the Tartines, three different spreads on thick seeded bread.  The bread is fantastic, one of the owners is a former baker at La Gourmandine Bakery and has brought his craft to Apteka. The Tartine toppings include carrot pate and radish pickle; leek, Apple and mint and celery, pickle, apple and dill.   All are culinary delights.  Other small plates include beet soup with celeriac toast; Kartofle (pictured) which features potatoes, apples, lingonberry jam (mmm) and yogurt; Belgian endive with pickled prune and beech and oyster mushrooms.   All are delicious.

Big plates include pierogis (a Pittsburgh staple, but these are among the best I have sampled), see pictures.  Four is enough for sampling.  Golabki is an interesting cabbage, buckwheat, roasted tomato and bay bolete dish.  I have not tried the sorrel salad but a friend described it as excellent.

Apteka also offers sandwiches,  try the horse and pepper (pictured) which includes a vegetable pate, horseradish slaw, pepper relish, black garlic butter and chilies on a roll.  They have a variety of interesting cocktails and an interesting beer list.  For a non-alcoholic drink try the birch water.

Under no circumstances should you skip the deserts.  If you are like me, and try the apple tart with dried fruit compote, you may never try the others, though the spiced gingerbread with poached pear and prune preserves may eventually catch a wandering eye.

The restaurant has caught quite a following in a few weeks since opening and for good reason.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
