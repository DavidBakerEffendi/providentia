Met a friend for late lunch. My first visit. Very interesting ambiance. My friend liked the decor a lot. Modern and whimsy. A bit noisy, not the place for a first date, IMO, good service. Had food related questions and the chef made time to come by and talk to us. We were impressed. The food was fine. Worth another visit, maybe happy hours?
