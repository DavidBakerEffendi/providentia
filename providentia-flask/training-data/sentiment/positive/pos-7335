Great service and HUGE portions!  Our waiters (are they still waiters if there is no wait?) helped us a ton by letting us sample a few of the different types of fish before we chose the final version of our poki bowls.  Each ingredient scoop was very generous, and the resulting large-sized bowl was giant and filled to the top.  I actually wasn't able to finish the entire meal, which isn't usual at all for me, especially in poki restaurants where you often leave regretting the fact that you didn't decide to go to an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant instead.  The price is extremely reasonable as well, with our total per bowl being just under $10.

There's some sort of Chinese street food option down the aisle in the same restaurant that we'll probably try on a different day... if my husband can drag me away from the poki option.
