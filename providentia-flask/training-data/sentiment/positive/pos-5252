My bf brought home 4 choices of poke for lunch. We had the the spicy combo poke, wasabi ahi, salmon poke, & spicy salmon. Both spicy have a mayonnaise dressing over them, kinda like the dressing you taste over rolls from sushi joints. The spicy combo is ahi with crab. Salmon poke taste like reg salmon sashimi. And last bust not least wasabi ahi was just the right amount of spice and juicy. All of them were juicy and nicely sliced chunks of fish. He was telling me that at Poke Express you're able to try before you order and there's a a bunchhh more too choose from like a ton of ice cream flavors but a ton of fish flavors! They price by pound. So we got half a pound of each of the 4 totaling to about 40$. It's fresh fish so 40$ not that bad. We couldn't even finish all of it! Amongst the two of us, half a pound each in all good for us. Can't wait to try what other pokes they have!
