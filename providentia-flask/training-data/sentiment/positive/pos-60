It took us a while for my boyfriend to convince me to eat at a Gas Station and now I regret not coming sooner!!! We loveeeee this place! The Mr. Mustard is our favorite sauce. And honestly we haven't had a bad item here! Their chicken salad sandwich is not kidding the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever had!!!! The boys favorite tends to be the pigs and grits but he just loves anything BBQ!!! 

We would highly recommend this to anyone who wants just a delicious meal!!!!!
