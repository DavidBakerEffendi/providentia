I was in town for work and whenever I travel, I always find Vietnamese restaurants to try.  I did a Yelp search and Pho Thanh Huong came up.  I walked in and could smell the anise floating in the air.  I got seated right away and ordered the following:

Meatball pho ($8.50): it was so good!!  Portion was huge, lots of meat and other goodies.  

Vietnamese Ham, pork and Pate Banh Mi ($3.25): it was good too, I haven't had one of these sandwiches in a while so it was so good. 

I definitely walked out of the restaurant a happy camper.
