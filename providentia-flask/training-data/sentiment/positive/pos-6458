Lunch !!! now that is a different experience. (No belly dancer)

They have a short lunch menu of or either a wrap, or one of three dishes. (Not a fan of mushrooms, but on the day I was the Veggie special was a veggie Korma. I had the Veggie Wrap and my wife had the Veggie lovers special. Both meals were very good. Service was fast, Perfect Indian Lunch.

Will go again, and will consider taking my business contacts over too. (Only for Lunch, way too traumatized by the belly dancer for trying dinner again)

Still the best Tandoori Chicken.
