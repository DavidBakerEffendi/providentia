I make excuses to come here.
Birthday, anniversary,mother's day. I've only been three times due to price, which is another reason it's reserved for special occasions. It is however the best buffet I have ever been to.
Best move:
Gourmet night. Kobe beef sliders one night, venison sliders another night. Beef wellington is absolutely sinful, I went back twice. Nice variety of sushi and acompannying accessories. Fun with seafood-shrimp, crab legs, ceviche. Huge dessert bar.
Icing on the cake:
They served me after dinner coffee.
Lord.
Know how to win me over.
On Saturday, I will be trying Wicked Spoon at Cosmo to see how it stacks up!
Oh ya, and there's a full bar right when you walk in the seating area.
