We'd read a couple weeks ago in the Toronto Star about The Caledonian, a Scottish pub in our 'hood (College/Ossington).  My husband was intrigued because they offered a beer he hadn't had before and can't buy in the liquor store.

We checked it out this afternoon.

Gord started with a traditional Ebulum - Elderberry Black Ale.  I had my usual Keith's ... yum!

As an appetizer, Gord ordered a Scotch Egg (a hard-boiled egg, wrapped in sausage, breaded and flash-fried, then baked. Served with organic greens).  I had a bite and it was good.

We both ordered Fish & Chips (fresh haddock in their own Caledonian beer batter, served with hand cut chips and homemade tartar sauce).  It was delicious!

We were full but had to check out dessert.  I ordered the Deep-Fried Mars Bar (served with ice cream and butterscotch sauce) only because I've never had one before.  It was interesting ... I doubt I'd order it again.

Gord ordered the Bread and Butter Pudding (homemade bread and butter pudding made with Innis & Gunn beer aged in 21-year-old Highland casks).  He loved it!

The hospitality was excellent. The owner, Donna, greeted us as we came in the door and stopped by our table a few times to see how things were going. She said good-bye when we left. Our server, Beth, arrived in Canada from Scotland a couple months ago and started working there on Tuesday. She was awesome and took such good care of us. Such a nice place ... I'll be back.
