Every time I come here to eat it is always so clean and the staff is friendly. Food is delicious. I like in Henderson we have many healthy food options/restaurants. And this is another  one on the list. If you don't have time to cook or meal prep, stop by Daily Kitchen and grab something to eat and/or drink.
