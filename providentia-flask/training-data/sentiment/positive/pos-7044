My wife and I went here for the first time because I hear that their burgers are great... And I am always on the lookout for a great burger. I must say... This experience was awesome!! 

The decor is awesome. They have a wall of beer cans that's pretty cool. It was a beautiful day, so they basically had their wall open (it was like a huge garage door). Seating was comfortable, not too loud. Very nice.

Their beer selection is top notch! Lots to choose from, both on tab, or bottled. Expensive, but what do you expect for Crocker Park :)

Now for the burgers. I ordered their "special" which was a burger with pulled pork, jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, sirachi mayo (think I spelled that wrong). My wife ordered the burger with egg and bacon. We also got an order of fries to split. (Yes... Fries DO NOT come with the burger). 

Burger came out fast, and I immediately sunk my teeth into mine. It was wonderful! I order my burgers well done, and this one still came out juicy!! No one can do that right! The bun was perfect... Everything together was great overall experience.

Even with ordering fries on the side, we only spent around $30 eating here (with a beer for me). We will definitely be back!!
