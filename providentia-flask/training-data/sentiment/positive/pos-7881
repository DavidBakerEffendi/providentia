We are exploring our new area and this is a gem! Kept finding coupons (with menu) in the local weekly paper for this restaurant and decided to try this new place. Saw the good reviews on yelp as well as the menu. Yelp check-ins get 20% off.

It's a small place (a dozen tables, and a pair of tall stools at the bar), but has very elegant ambiance (one wall features brick, not the traditional full size kind, the partial but pretty type), which is unexpected, in a strip mall. The tables are dark wood (we opted for the booth). The dinnerware is dark but is in line with the overall theme. It is sit-down, but you can order takeout too.  

The food is asian fusion. We got the pan fried noodles with pork tenderloin, combination fried rice, and the ramen noodle soup (including mushrooms, green onions, seaweed, mmm) with shredded chicken. It was excellent. Everything was delicious. The cuts of meat were exceptional. The beef was angus. The pork tenderloin was lean. The shredded chicken breast was clean, no veins, no tubes, perfect. Come to think of it, there was no fat in any of the meat (high quality). Nothing was overdone or salty. Hubby, son, & I enjoyed dinner very much. Also, the portions were quite generous. We had leftovers, mmm.

There was another family eating dinner, besides us, and later, another family. The service was excellent. The owner and the entire staff was very nice and attentive. Also, the owner did something really nice, she modified the chopsticks for our son, and proceeded to show him how to eat the fried rice. 

We will be back.
