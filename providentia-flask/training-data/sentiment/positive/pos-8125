Lots of schnitzel. Not a schnitzel fan so I had the bratwurst instead plus a huge stein of beer. Decor is very Bavarian and staff are friendly. Good place to get up and walk around and admire the decor. Left the place tipsy from drinking lots of beer. Thankfully wife was driving. Would totally go again.
