Ah the stuff of art.  Picasso once said, "Mmmmm, that's tasty." or more likely it was "Mmmmmm, eso es sabroso."  Well my friends, Chino Locos is so locos he's making burritos and tacos with asian staples such as chow mein, edamame beans, slow roast bbq pork and his own green onion ginger sauce.  Theyve also filled them with many healthier and tastier choices like a brown, red and black rice combo instead of a fried rice, black turtle beans versus refried, and great veggies like watercress, cilantro, eggplant and others.  I could list the whole menu probably because if my eyes governed my stomach id have had one of each kind and then have made my own kind.  that's right folks!  the days of make your own pizza, make your own salad, make your own halloween costume have been blown out of the water because now, at chino locos you can make your own burrito or taco.  pick one or make one for 5.99.  now is that locos or is that locos?

I cant stop talking...so get this:  when was the last time you tried a dessert burrito?  anyone?  what say you close your eyes and imagine a tangy, gooey bite of a PUMPKIN & BLUEBERRY BURRITO!!!!!!!!!!!!  I didnt actually witness this but i did witness Minh (the co-owner with his partner Victor) hypnotize an already hypnotized locos groupie (some great kid who lives upstairs and feels completely at ease hanging around wearing a token sombrero) with an apple pie burrito.  All homemade.  (Like his chipotle, of which, unabashedly, I had second helpings.)

Look for new menu items to come as the owners, like any artists worth their weight in jalapenos, are sculpting that menu until its perfect.  But i personally think that thats not possible.

Because its already perfect.

ole, as it were and watch out because this restaurant will be the first of many.
