This seems to have become my families go to place for celebrations. Please make a reservation, this place is small and always busy. With a reservation we have never had difficulty getting right in. 

This last visit, the baked stuffed shrimp was amazing. The portions are decent for a higher priced restaurant. The amaretto cheesecake...FANFREAKINGTASIC!!! They bring an actual shot of amaretto :) 

Others in the party had stuffed fish, crab legs, and salmon. Everyone said their meal was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh. I like the atmosphere here. It may not be for everyone, a little small and closed in but you feel like you have left Arizona and are in a little restaurant on the east coast. It is reminiscent of my favorite place in Massachusetts. 

I have always had quick, courteous service. Always several people refilling drinks, food is always quick and we never feel rushed.
