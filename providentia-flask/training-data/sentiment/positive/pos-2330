This is the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.

The service is flawless, drinks refilled before even reaching halfway. Quick, polite, attentive service. 

The food is excellent. All sauces served with tortilla chips are delicious. All food has a bit of spice and peppers and onions are served for when you want strong heat. Flavorful and well seasoned. The beef, tender and moist, well-seasoned. The green sauce was perfect. 

Pulled Beef Burrito with green sauce - 5/5

Beef Fajitas - 5/5
