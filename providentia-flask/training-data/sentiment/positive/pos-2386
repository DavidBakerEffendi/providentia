My first Sushi Samba experience was in Miami, and I have been in love ever since. Fusion cuisine...hmmm, how about just delish cuisine??!!

My all time fav menu items are:

Sashimi tiradito - yellowtail, salmon: everything is so delicate
Samba rolls - neo tokyo, bobo brazil, el topo, and rainbow dragon.  The rolls are not huge, actually prefer smaller rolls, difficult to fit everything into your mouth in one bite if the roll is 2 inches thick.
Hot dish wise, try the Moqueca Mista, its to die for!  I always finish off my meals with this dish, never mind desserts!  Also, try this with a cocktail, I recommend the Caipirinha, my mouth is watering writing this review!
