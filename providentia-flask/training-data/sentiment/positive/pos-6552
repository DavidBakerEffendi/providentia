Came looking specifically for SoCal's famous California burrito. Drawn in by the only 5 star rated taco joint. Was easy enough to find in the dark. In the sinclairs gas station mart. 
Ben was very inviting. 
Informed me of the birthday meal, which I'll come back for.
And I think I overheard something about an anniversary meal too.

Ok. On to the food. California burrito on point. 
Warning: red sauce is hot.
Green sauce mild.

Will definitely be back to try other item on the menu.

Keep up the good work guys!
For those who left the few under 4 star reviews, thanks for trying, but won't stop me from coming back, plus there are at least 200 more 5 star reviews that will have any new comer over looking your criticisms.
