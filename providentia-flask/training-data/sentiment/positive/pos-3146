I found this little hidden gem of a bakery and I could not be more pleased!! not only are the breads and pastries  the best I have had in phoenix, but I am going to go out on a limb here and say that this is the best bakery I have ever found.the owners really car about what they sell and you can tell that as soon as you walk through the door. Dont miss this bakery!!
