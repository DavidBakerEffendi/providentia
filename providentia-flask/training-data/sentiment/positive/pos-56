Came here with a group of friends before a Phoenix Mercury game and we arrived at a good time, being it wasn't overly crowded, and we got right up to the register and placed our orders. Upon completion of order and payment, they give you a disc that lights up when your order is ready. We grabbed a table, filled our drinks, and got condiments while waiting for our number to be called. Once our food was ready and we all divided up our orders, we got down to business and enjoyed our meal, re-filling drinks and getting more condiments as we went along.

This was my 2nd time here (first time, I brought my dad here for lunch while he was visiting me from out of state), and just like the first, I really enjoyed it. I learned on this visit, however, that they have added Sweet Potato Fries to their repertoire, so next time, I will definitely gt those with my meal. My friend got them with hers and they looked so tasty!

My burger was cooked to absolute perfection and they put very little lettuce on it, which I prefer, being I have braces and get lettuce caught in my brackets very easily. The fries were perfect...not really salty, which is one big complaint I have about a lot of places. I am so NOT a salt person and can't stand overly-salty foods. 

I recommend The Habit to anyone looking for a new burger place to try. One bit of confusion I must clarify: the drive-up outside is for the Starbucks next door, and people have thought that The Habit has a drive-through. Not the case, unfortunately, but they do offer take-out as well as dine-in.
