You're now reading a review of Rani's by the DUKE of Rani's.   Yes, the long road to Dukedom was finally achieved today with my...... 2nd check in?   HOW DID Y'ALL LET THIS HAPPEN?   Okay maybe not everyone else is glued to their iPhone as much as I am to try to check-in as often, but still.

First and 2nd visit I got the Thali.  Both times the service was extremely pleasant, though this 2nd time the woman working the counter sort of forgot about my order and served the next party first.  Wasn't too big of a deal and she seemed apologetic.  

I love the ordering/checkout process, as both times it evolved into some sort of old school bartering system, always in my favor.  Me:  "I'll take a smart water too"   (grabs $1.39 bottle from the fridge)   Her:  "Just give me a dollar"   Deal.    Almost convinced that if I wandered in there with nothing but 75 cents to my name, I'd somehow walk out with a full stomach.    Don't try this kids! 

Onto the food.   I have no idea what the proper names are of what I ate either time.   The first time I just waited for the woman (Rani?) to make my plate, and then I devoured most of it.   Didn't care for the onions as I noticed someone else mention, and I also had some cold chickpea dish that day that wasnt appeasing to me.  Everything else (Rice, Dal, Roti, some tofu thing) was delicious.

This time another woman (not Rani?) actually showed me all the different options for the Thali.   I heard her mention buttermilk and cheese in a few of them so I simply requested that I not have anything with milk or cheese and she happily obliged.  I ended up with a dish with chickpeas, one with red beans, an eggplant one, the rice, and those onions (grrrrr) and some sort of hot pickle/pepper thing.   Loved it all except the onions

Now go beat me for this Duke title.  I don't deserve it with only 2 visits!
