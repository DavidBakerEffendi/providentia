I love Pita Jungle sooo much!  I go for the hummus alone, but everything else I've ordered has been fabulous.  The lentil fatoosh salad is my favorite menu item (besides the hummus trio), but the last three times I've had a special....the red quinoa salad.  OMG.  Best. Salad. Ever.  I crave this salad.  I wish they'd add it to their regular menu.
