When I first tried this place out I had an iced Chai Tea that I didn't like, but I think that's because I said yes to whole milk (which I never drink). I'm sure I would have liked it if I would have gone with one of the other milk options. 
What really won me over was the Mexican Mocha iced coffee. It has a bit of spicey/cinnamony kick at the end, and that's what makes it great. Yesterday I tried their Hot Chick sandwich and it just became one more reason to come back. I think what makes it so tasty is the combined flavor of the blue cheese and franks hot sauce. 

A big plus is Jewel's Bakery & Cafe's customer service. I'll still go to place that has bad customer service, if I REALLY like their food. I'll go to places with mediocre food if they have REALLY good customer service. Jewel's is one of the places where you get both: Great food & great customer service.
