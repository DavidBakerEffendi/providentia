Kirei is a relatively new place, and I would love to see them succeed.  Simply the best sushi in its category in downtown Toronto. My partner and I have gone twice.  The first time, upon entering,  we felt slightly anxious, wondering if the restaurant was perhaps trying a bit too hard. Once the food started appearing: wow!  Delicious.  Luscious, silken homemade gyoza and delicious agedashi tofu for appetizer.  The sushi deluxe was truly a work of art; superbly fresh fish, brilliantly presented; not your run-of-the mill frozen fish.  Even the rice, pickled ginger and wasabi were head over heels above average.   What I thought was nice is that my partner's vegetarian sushi was not just an afterthought; it was taken very seriously by the chefs and the vegetable selection was interesting.  Rounded off the meal with some terrific black sesame ice cream.    And on the second visit: delicious oysters, divine sea urchin... again, definitely not your typical sushi joint.  This place shines above the rest.  

There are some Korean specialties on the menu as well.  Indeed, more expensive than restaurants at Bloor and Christie, but much better.  Case in point was my dolsot bi bim bap the other night.  The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, the veggies superbly fresh.

A wide list of cocktails (try the peartini and the cherry blossom margarita), and some nice white wines by the glass.  

Fantastic service: knowledgeable, warm, welcoming, and professional.

I would definitely return, and would encourage others to try it..  Not the cheapest sushi place, but it is several notches above other places.  I almost thought I was back in Vancouver for a moment!  

Still, though, with ample food, a glass of wine each, one cocktail which we split, and one dessert, and a generous tip, the bill came to about $150.00 in total.  I've spent more at other places and have not had the same satisfaction.
