What a delightful dining experience!
Came here for dinner on a Friday evening, before watching a show in Pittsburgh's downtown. We visited "Mezzo" the second floor of the restaurant, which mainly has Italian dishes like pizza, pasta and paninis. The first floor is a meatball joint and the third floor is a beer rooftop garden. We were quickly seated as we had already made a reservation. 
The waitress was so attentive, and she explained to us the menu thoroughly. I started with the riesling, which was smooth and sweet. For the entree, I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo which was a spicy red sauce, orecchiette pasta and fresh shrimp. My dining partner had the vegetable panini, which I grabbed a bite out of, and I found that to be really good with fresh vegetables, pesto sauce and mozzarella cheese.
I loved the atmosphere of this place, which was casual yet a little hip! I would love to go back and try the other levels in this restaurant as well!
