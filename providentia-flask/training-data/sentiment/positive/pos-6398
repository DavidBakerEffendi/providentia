Very good sushi restaurant right on the border of Parma. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The prices are great and the quality of food you get makes some other sushi bars look very incompetent. You can tell that the fish is fresh, nice and cold and no bad tastes or weird textures (don't ask, I've questioned my sushi before at other places....). Some other restaurants use too much rice and not enough fish but I feel that Mizu has the perfect combination of both.
