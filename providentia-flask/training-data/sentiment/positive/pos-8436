We celebrated my niece's confirmation or some god-type event there this afternoon.  Had a really good time!  The basement space is special, lots of ambiance and a spacious layout.  Really enjoyed all the courses we had, even the table bread is worth mentioning, sprinkled with rosemary. Our large group universally agreed its worth further visits as the food was great. I'd like to congratulate the bartending staff.  Had some outstanding cocktails. Quite a few really.  Service was outstanding, not sure who is posting poor service reviews, must be some poncey spoiled prince/princess who -if they don't live at home with mummy- probably will go home to their unmade bed and filthy kitchen because they're fundamentally useless and I imagine those are the ones whinging about service.
