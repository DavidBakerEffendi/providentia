I just went through the drive thru and got the best customer service ever. This young lady, Amalia was so sweet, she literally made me smile while ordering. I ask for the manager to compliment her, and she is the nicest young lady too! (Xena) Both of them displayed great customer service.
Kudos to this establishment for hiring, training and promoting our young adults and giving them the tools to give excellent customer service and excel at leadership. 
P.S. My All NATURAL BURGER WAS FABULOUS!!
