I've had my fair share of Chinese food in Charlotte, and I must say that Best Wok ranks near the top. Yes, it's definitely Americanized, but that doesn't mean the taste and quality isn't there. 

Some recommendations I have include sesame chicken, the chicken wings (YUM), Happy Family and Triple Delight. Must tries! I have gone several times during lunch and the portion sizes are generous and plentiful. I love that they don't skimp on the food, so it is definitely worth what you are paying for. This also gets 5 stars because of the service. The workers there seem happy to be there and are always smiling. That makes the visit that much more pleasant. I am excited to go and try other dishes on their menu. Give this place a try and you will love it!
