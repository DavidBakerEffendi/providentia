SO GOOD.  Large menu of "regular" hotdogs, specialty dogs (Angry Kimchi Dog!!), and rice bowls.  My Angry Kimchi Dog was fantastic and had generous amounts of bulgogi and kimchi sitting on top of the actual hotdog.  Party in my mouth.  

Fun atmosphere and helpful staff = enjoyable dining experience.  Everything on the menu is under $5.  Portions are generous but everything is so yummy that it's not hard to eat everything yourself.  :)
