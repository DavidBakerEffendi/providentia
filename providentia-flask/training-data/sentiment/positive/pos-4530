This place is incredible! Authentic and inexpensive, does it get any better than that? I bought 2 crumb danishes, 1 chocolate cigar, 1 lobster tail, and 1 cream horn all for around $11. These are big ticket items too, each filling enough for one person. They have a huge selection! From all kinds of pastries to many different types of cakes. Oh and I have to add that the staff was really patient with me as I was taking my time making my decision.
