Great place with fantastic cuts of meat! They have great history all over the walls, a perfect steakhouse ambiance and the Chef seems a bit loose on those meat cuts (in other words my 8oz steak was over 8oz after cooking).

My steak was cooked perfectly, juicy, tender, and flavorful. 

Waiter had worked at the property for something like 30 years and was very knowledgable and professional. 

Worth the money and a stop if you are staying at the Westgate or near-by.
