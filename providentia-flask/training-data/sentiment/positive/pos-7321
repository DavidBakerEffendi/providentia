I have searched the US for the perfect chile relleno, & I've been dissapointed many times over! Little did I know the most perfect chile relleno was just here in my home town, at Frank & Fina's Cocina! We tried their steak uxtal & chuletas... needless to say our plates were licked clean! Am very picky when it comes to mexican food, this is the only place I will go to! Prices are reasonable & definitely worth every bite! The staff & atmosphere is friendly, clean...u might even catch a glimpse of the Frank & Fina themselves humbly working in their beloved restaurant! If you are looking for a good authentic delicious mexican place, come here, u won't regret it!
