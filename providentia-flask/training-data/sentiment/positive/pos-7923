We were walkind down Queen looking for something to get into and BOOM! There it was, in all it's glory. With all the craft beer I could handle, I stepped in for a good time with my young lady who knows how crazy I am about local brew. Our bartender,  Andre was extremely knowledgeable about not only the beer but the area. It was our first time in Toronto and he made us feel welcomed. I enjoyed a several brews while checking them in on Untappd with others at the bar. Even made new friends! We will be stopping by this place every time we are in Toronto. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Two thumbs up over here
