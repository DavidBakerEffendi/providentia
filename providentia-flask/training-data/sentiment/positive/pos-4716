Amazing oysters. We were craving oysters after work - where else would we go but to John & Sons! As with all eateries in the Financial District, it's pretty busy during the weekday lunch hours. We got a table immediately on a Friday evening though at the bar. Service was quick. Oysters were fresh. The company was great.
