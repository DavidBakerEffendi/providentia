This place is a hidden treasure. My wife wanted come here for lunch no matter how cold it was. My wife had the Half Sandwich and Soup ( Pecan Chicken Salad Sand and vegetable soup) and coffee. The soup was delicious which warmed her up. I ad the Italian sandwich with chips and Fresh Lemonade. Both sandwiches had fresh veggies and the french bread was nice and soft, as if it was just baked.
We decided to take home one of their mini pies, APPLE, $6.50 and serves two people. The pie was so good I could have licked the plate. The apples inside were cut to the right consistency.
After lunch we strolled down the path to where The Stone Grove is located. Nice little exercise  to walk our lunch off. The store was closed and is only opened from Wednesday to maybe Sunday.
We'll be back when the weather warms up.
