Ordered the Turkey add pepperoni on white bread. Add tomato, onion, jalapeno, mayo, salt and pepper, with extra green peppers, just the way I like it. Sandwich artist was patient while I was being kinda difficult with my special order and extra questions. The shift leader who is always there it seems was busy finishing his sandwich but then was happy to help. Both guys have great customer service skills, and the sandwich was made nicely. I really appreciated the time (like 10 seconds) he took to explain the uncharges, which made me happy to pay $.30 to upgrade my drink to a bottle. Sandwich was fresh and hit the spot, ate every bite. 
Bonus Note: This location has the seafood sub which is bomb.
