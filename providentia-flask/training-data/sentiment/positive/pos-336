I feel like crepes are something you always see in movies but can very rarely order out expecting a good quality one. And it's definitely not a breakfast you attempt to make at home unless you're prepared to spend all morning in the kitchen perfecting your technique. 

Anyway, really wanted to try a cool latte or hot chocolate after seeing pics of their foam designs but needed some normal coffee. It was good. For the crepes, I went sweet with the raspberry white chocolate and mascarpone and my friend went savory. Here had chopped up chicken and Swiss and some sort of hot sauce. We were both happy with our picks. I almost got the Halle Berry crepes, and a lot of people around me ordered them. I bet they're also good. Cute little rustic place half-underground, would definitely return!
