Great tasting sushi and reasonably priced! We did takeout of two maki sets - spicy maki trio and 17piece Sushi; more than enough for two people. Typically California roles are my least favourite and just a filler, but these California rolls were amazing!! Huge piece of fresh creamy avocado and just sooo tasty! Salad was much tastier than other sushi restaraunt takeout salads. The colours on the Sushi (tobiko, fresh veggies) were pretty and enticing. 
Definitely our new Sushi go to place in the area!(way better than other options nearby)
