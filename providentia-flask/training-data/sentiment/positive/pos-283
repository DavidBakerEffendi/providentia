Just wanted to give a huge shout out and HUGE thank you to all the staff at The Venetian for hosting our company for the week.  From our catered Suites to our daily breakfast, to our luncheon including our awesome catered company dinner, prepared especially by Chef James DeFraga from AQUAKNOX was simply, fantastico!  You are all ROCK STARS!
