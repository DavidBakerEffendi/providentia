Such a cute little shop. There's a nice extensive wine section and you can enjoy a bottle in the shop or to go.

We tried the beignets and they were AMAZING. I cannot emphasize how good they were. Go on a day where you don't care about your diet and just enjoy these gorgeous, fried, delicious, magical treats. You get three in an order, and you can easily split the order with two other people so that you each get one.

We got a baguette to go which was also delish. I really want to try their dine in menu and other dessert items.
