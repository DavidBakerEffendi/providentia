Went in today to get a bowl & a sushi burrito. THANK YOU , for those who gave me such wonderful service. I appreciate you! I'm so happy that Soho is so close to my job! YASS! 

Food and the taro chips all amazingly delicious. However for my bowl , I felt like the brown rice could of been more softer. BUT , I still enjoyed me food.
