WOW! Amazing lunch, and AMAZING service from Paul the bartender! He made me feel right at home. He can talk about anything from hot spots in town to motorcycles and always has his bar packed. Had the Uncle Fu's combo fried rice and it was outstanding. They actually use filet for their beef in this dish and its cooked perfectly! Thanks Paul and Ling and Louie's for a spectacular lunch! Also really friendly staff. I was greeted by 3 other staff members and a manager during my visit
