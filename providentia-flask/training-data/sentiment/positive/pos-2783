The pancakes were amazing, couldn't finish them entirely but I would if my stomach allowed it. I ordered the granola and blueberry pancakes, they were so delicious and fluffy. Didn't have to wait for a seat either, we were seated to a table right away (we came on a Tuesday afternoon). I'd definitely come back again to try the hyped up red velvet pancakes.
