I can't imagine why there aren't more amazing reviews for this place. It is the tits. The bees knees. The cat's pajamas.

I have a Trinidadian friend, I brought her here and she said that the flavors were better than the rotis in Trinidad.

Everything tastes fresh fresh. There is a little bit of a wait, but that is because she prepares each to order. I didn't once hear that ominous beep beep of a microwave over and over that I often do at other roti places. The accompanying hot sauce and mango pickle really add for a nice touch. Her pumpkin is insanely good.

The sorrell, mauby and ginger beer are all home made and each are fantastic. 

I have never been let down by anything on the menu. Ever.

The real clincher though is the woman that cooks/serves/owns the place. Even if the food wasn't up to snuff I would still want to go just to ensure she didn't go out of business because she is so sweet, attentive and pleasant.

It is a must to try in my opinion.
