I LOVE Greenland! This is my weekly grocery store, and where I do most of my shopping at. You can get good quality seafood here, there is a meat section that is already marinated, kimchi and side dish station plus daily made kimbap, battered and pan fried veggies, grilled fish, etc. The produce area is far beyond impressive. You can buy apples and Korean Pears by the box, bagged veggies at a good price, and for the people who don't like to deal with the hassle of peeling Garlic, they have bags of peeled garlic ready to buy. 

You can also find a little Hawaii food section isle over there also...something that used to be at Longs Drugs before they were taken over by CVS. 

They have an area in there that has fresh noodles (Udon, wheat flour, chow mein, etc.), that beats buying the dehydrated noodles. They even sell rice cakes there, so I like to make Dukbokki :)

My favorite part of this store is the household section. We bought one of those portable stoves that you can put in the middle of the table, so we can use it at home ;) I also love their plastic storage containers, they are sturdy and airtight so when I store the Kim chi in there, it wont smell up the refrigerator.
