What can I say? A HIDDEN gem in Stouffville. Their Main Street location is gorgeous but their lakeside location is perfect for an evening out under the stars. Situated literally looking over musselman's lake their big white umbrellas shade you from the sun and at night the string of twinkle lights drape over your head over the most fabulous deck.
The food is fabulous. Upscale gourmet Portuguese pub food is my explanation. Their Brussel Sprout appetizer is AMAZING! I had the Crab Burger last time I was there and it is also mouth watering. My friend had the Tagliatelle which she said was delicious and we couldn't resist ordering a side 12" Mediterranean pizza. The menu is too delicious to not go BIG! 
This is the most perfect date spot - expect to be there for a few hours as table turnover doesn't seem to be quick.
