I first started coming here about 4 years ago, and now I try to hit it up at least once a month.  The counter staff is always friendly, and there is a nice amount of seating available.  If you are a fan of weird art, you can enjoy the 6 foot mural of some sushi rolls made out of torn magazines.  If this isn't your cup of tea (shame on you), you can get your food to go as well.  There is enough variety on the menu that even a picky eater like myself can have multiple favourites.

Banzai does rice bowls (I can't get enough of the Chicken Teryiaki), soups, Bento boxes (a combo where you choose two mains to go with your rice, salad, and spring rolls), and tons of assorted sushi (I especially like the veggie rolls, and they even do Alberta rolls here).  Everything is reasonably priced as well - the rice bowls range from $6.50 to $7.50,  and the Bento boxes are around $9.  More importantly, they have forks available for those of us who clumsily skewer our food when forced to use chopsticks.

They make all the food fresh, yet I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my order, and that was during the dinner rush.  Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed.
