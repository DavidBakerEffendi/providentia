Really great new addition to the village! To start I had the boozy slushy with gummy bears which was delicious! I saw it listed somewhere as great for sharing but I drank the whole thing myself. I then had the squid app which was good but needed a tiny bit more seasoning. My main was the beef Kho soi which was beautifully plated and wonderfully spicy. My fiance had the soft shell crab pad Thai which was literally off the hook. The crab was soft, fresh and delicious and the noodles perfectly cooked and flavored. I most definitely will be back. It's a bit expensive but worth the price.
