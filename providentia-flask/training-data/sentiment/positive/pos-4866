A very nice person brings these goodies to a local AA meeting and so we have all been able to sample these yummy treats.  What a fantastic gift of gratitude!  

I would never have known about these delicious cookies and pastries if it wasn't for this person.  I know that the food is wonderful, but it's hard to separate the kind generosity of the donor as well.  Good karma all around!
