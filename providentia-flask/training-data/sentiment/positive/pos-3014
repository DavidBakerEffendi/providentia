I keep meaning to review The Root Cafe. It has quickly become my favorite CLE coffee shop. Good bevies, good food... cool atmosphere. The boy tends to like their sweets - french toast and waffles on a Sunday morning. I almost always get the egg, tomato, and goat cheese sandwich. Everything is fresh... and local. It's amazing. Get there early on the weekends - it fills up fast. 

The customers are family-like. You can even share a table with most of them if they're not using the whole thing (they will put a note out to let you know to have a seat!). Very cool vibe. The employees are friendly. They make killer fancy drinks with heart swirls in the foam. Totally Instagram worthy. 

Try it. You'll be back... every.single.weekend.
