This bakery is phenomenal!!! And it's all gluten free!!!! The buttermilk syrup is super sweet, but super delicious. I typically don't like overly sweet things but the syrup was amazing. My celiac husband was like a kid in a candy store and bought just about every dessert they had. We will definitely be back!
