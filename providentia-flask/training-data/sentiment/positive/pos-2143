Love love love the ambience here I really feel like I'm in a France cafe with the Easter- like decor of clay rabbits, the florals,  and the rustic wooden tables.  I went here during their happy hour which is from 5 to 7pm. They have such a unique cocktail menu,  like Parcae, and my favorite from there was the Herbes de Provence ($14) -  calvados, lillet infused with herbs, lemon juice,  sugar and egg whites. For the pastries I recommend trying the eclairs ($4.50) - citrus light pineapple filling, and the canele - lemon filling. They have a new menu option that i really enjoyed with crostini tapas customized with toppings of my choice.  I liked the anchovies with sundried tomato spread the most!
