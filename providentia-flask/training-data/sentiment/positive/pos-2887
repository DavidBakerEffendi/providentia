AWE SOME!!
after spending weeks creeping Jojo's facebook waiting for news of the trucks opening, I finally found my way to the Barbacue's Galore parking lot.  

So worth the drive.  Went with a group and got to try the brisket, the mac and cheese and jalapeno fries.  It was delicious...Jojo had some problems with the propane but she managed to fix it.  

friends with me had the sloppy Jo and said it was delicious. 

Go now because the lines will be long once word gets out!
