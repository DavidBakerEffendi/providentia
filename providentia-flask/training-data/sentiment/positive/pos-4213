Loved stopping here for breakfast this morning. I was staying with a friend in the area so I was looking for something local and close. Glad I chose White Cup coffee. When I was arrived at 9am on a Saturday morning I was a bit concerned thinking that the place should be more busy. However, after having been greeted by a beautiful and friendly woman at the counter, who also happened to be carrying in fresh cinnamon rolls, I felt welcomed. She continued to take my order and made me a wonderful soy latte, all while smiling the entire time. :) I ordered the veggie scramble and it was just what I wanted. Clearly freshly made and came with a side of fresh fruits. VERY fresh. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my time and breakfast at White Cup Coffee and looking forward to returning.
