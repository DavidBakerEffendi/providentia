Today was my first visit here. This place is pretty awesome. Really good food except I'm not into the french fries they have. They are really small and skinny and crispy. Some people probably like this kind of french fries, but not me. 

Anyways, I wish it wasn't raining today because I would have been really into getting my car washed while I munched on a burger.

So yeah, I'm really full right now, time for a nap.
