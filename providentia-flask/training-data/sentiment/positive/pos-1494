U.S. Egg is a great place for breakfast and the protein cake is notable.  The other dishes are good, too, but the protein cake can only be gotten at this restaurant (as far as I know).  It is just delicious!

Another thing to know about U.S. Egg - there is often a line outside the door but do not let that dissuade you - it moves quickly and you won't wait long.  And of course, it's worth it!

Plenty of parking, too.
