This takes my spot as the best hotel I've ever been to. The architecture is so rustic and looks like you're really in Italy. I was mesmerized as soon as I walked out of the elevators. The ceilings and shops look so amazing you will not be disappointed with this hotel. Rooms were spotless when we checked in and they were very responsive over the phone when we needed assistance. We had ample space in our room. Very good experience here.
