My aunt and uncle were in town from Arizona and we wanted to go out to dinner for her birthday.  She was craving Chinese food since she was pretty sick of Tex Mex out west, so we tried to find a sit-down place nearby that happened to have Chinese food.  This restaurant kept popping up in our search so we decided to try it out...

Driving by the shopping plaza with Dollar Deals on one side and TJ Maxx on the other, it would have been easy to miss Blue Ginger (definitely not somewhere I would have just walked in to).  Once you walk in the door, however, you forget that you're in a strip mall; it is very clean and decorated in a modern and comfortable way.  The hostess was friendly and we were seated right away.  

We ordered a pretty big selection of appetizers (cheese flowers, chicken skewers, lettuce wraps, and egg rolls), and were very pleased with all of them... they were very flavorful!  For my meal, I order the general tso chicken, and it came with either soup or salad and your choice of rice.  I opted for the wonton soup and was very happy with my choice!  The broth was flavorful and the wontons were soft and full of delicious filling.  The chicken for my entree was also scrumptious; it had a definite kick to it (one member of our party found it too spicy but I love a little spice in my food so I was very happy).  The fried rice was full of flavor as well... they certainly aren't afraid of seasoning the food here!  I cleaned my plate (even after those appetizers) as did the rest of the table!  

I'll definitely be coming back again!
