Welcome to Firehouse!!

I hate to admit it but I like Subway, I go there often during lunch but when the boss is paying, you go where he wants. So a couple months ago he suggested we stop here for lunch. Ehhhh, I don't really like trying new foods. Besides hiring me, this was the best decision he has ever had!

I ordered the Capt. Sorensen's Datil Pepper Grilled Chicken and fell instantly in love. They claim it's under 500 calories but I think that's a lie, it takes way tooooo good. 

I've been here more than subway in the past few months and I'm happy to say, I love this place. I also love that you have Mellow Yellow, no one ever has that anymore. 

I can't comment on any other sandwich since I refuse to try anything different. I crave this sandwich.
