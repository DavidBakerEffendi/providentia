First of all, Ben the owner and his daughter are incredible hosts! The tacos here are absolutely on point - we've had tacos in Mexico and in San Diego and Jefe's blends the best of both worlds with seriously high quality protein. Great drinks as well - both the horchata and limon are tasty, authentic and not too sweet. 

This is definitely our go-to taco shop now in Vegas
