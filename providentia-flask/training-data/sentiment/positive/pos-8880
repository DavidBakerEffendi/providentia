Love this Salsaritas. Yes it is a chain, the food is the same, but the management is wonderful and they do what they can to make you happy. Quality is always very good!

Love their outdoor patio. We have brought our dogs many times when we have house showings because they are always welcome. Located near a Petsmart so it makes sense! 

We also like getting to go chips, queso, and salsa as easy sides for parties.
