The server is very bubbly and nice which is rare to see at a sushi restaurant. The special rolls are unique, HUGE, and delicious. Normally I don't prefer large rolls, but when they taste this good...I don't mind. They also have a nice choice in desserts. It is however quite pricey, but that doesn't mean you don't get what you pay for.
