This is my Sunday afternoon Burger Paradise.  The fella's at HM make truly one of the best damn Angus burgers in the valley.  Get the Pretzel Bun.  The weekly burger special (off menu item) is my favorite.  The BEST fries in town; I don't know anywhere that has better fries, nowhere.  I get excited even thinking about it and look forward to my next Sunday trip.  It is filling to boot!  Plenty of screens covering sports if you're into that.  Cool layout.  They have a pool table as well.  The waitresses have been very nice and timely.  I haven't been here when its busy or during football season - some of the reviews I read are a bit rough and hard for me to believe, I speak from my experience only.  Get the burger, enjoy the fries and pretzel bun!
