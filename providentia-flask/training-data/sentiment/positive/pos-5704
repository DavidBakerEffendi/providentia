Best breakfast buffet in vegas. Eggs benedict done right. Great atmosphere it's the Bellagio they do everything right in terms of appearance. 

However, would not recommend for lunch, dinner, or brunch. Not worth the lines, not worth the price. Too clich√© in terms of dishes offered and taste is good, but again not worth the time or the price. 

I can't speak any more highly of their weekday breakfast buffets however.
