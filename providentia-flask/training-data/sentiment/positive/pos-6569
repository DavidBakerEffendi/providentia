My favorite Mexican place in Charlotte. Not authentic Mexican but it has some great and interesting recipes. The table side guacamole is a must, as the fresh avocados and other ingredients make for a great appetizer. You can also get crab and goat cheese with the guacamole, which is great. I'm a huge fan of the smokey duck tacos and the Marco Polo tacos, which have a nice shrimp with jalapeno bacon. Also tried the mushroom quesadilla and the crab quesadilla, both of which are awesome. 

I'm sad the Dilworth location is moving as I will miss grabbing a margarita and sitting on the patio.
