Ok, since I came back to Vegas, I had to hit this crape joint again. I decided to try something new: 
The blueberry crape.
If the Nutella crape I tried last time was the best I ever had, this is even better. I think the fruits are organic, and the mix of warm crape, cold cream on top and the very tasty blueberry, mulberries and strawberries mixed all together will leave you impressed for sure. Try it out, it's not a common crape place that tries to impress you. I let you, the reader be the judge. If you know of something better message me ;)

Still the best grapes I had so far and they are expanding the menu.
Thank you Liliana.
