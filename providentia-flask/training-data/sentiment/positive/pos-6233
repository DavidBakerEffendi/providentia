My graduation brunch with my family. We were famished after I graduated from Ottawa University which was held in Surprise.
My fit breakfast was awesome with fresh egg whites and spinach, turkey bacon, fresh fruit and yogurt. 
My family's food was prepared fresh and served hot. Everything was delicious! Service was great! We enjoyed our food . I recommend this location of Denny's.
