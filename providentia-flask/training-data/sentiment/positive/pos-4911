Just an update on my previous experiences at the Tom Thumb Market and Car Wash, which receives my highest recommendation. Wonderful service across the board, especially from Candy, our cashier who represents Tom Thumb in magnificent fashion and from Jason, the automobile detail manager, who is most deserving of special recognition!
Our lunch was delicious and the service was excellent, as usual. Same for the car wash.
