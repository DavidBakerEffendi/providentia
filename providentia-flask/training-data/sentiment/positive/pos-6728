Great little Chinese restaurant, family owned, not a buffet like some of the pics show. We were taken here by some friends that said this was the best Chinese food in the area and they were right! The son, one of the owners, Lee is so kind and caring he really wants to make sure you're taken care of. The food was delicious, fresh and boy was there ALOT! 
I'd definitely recommend trying this place, it doesn't look like anything fancy but the best places often aren't. Oh ya, the crab puffs and hot/sour soup were my favorite!
