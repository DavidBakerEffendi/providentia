I'm always recommending this place for any group activity that I can think of! It's great for the amateurs and even fun for the pros. There is usually a long wait (we waited 1.5 hours on a Saturday night) but they have pool tables and a few other games to occupy your time. 

Food wise, tons of great snacks, with an impressive number of vegetarian options!
