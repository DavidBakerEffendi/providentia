OMG!  This is our 3rd time here for happy hour.  We usually come here once or twice a month for the regular sit down steak house.  I always get the bone-in ribeye and my wife gets the butterflied filet mignon.  Today we came for the happy hour and she got the mac & cheese and I got the oysters. Wow!  Everything was  amazing.  We will be coming back and for those who are reading this and wondering whether or not to try it.  TRY IT!  You won't be disappointed...
