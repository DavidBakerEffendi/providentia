As I've said before, I typically  don't  bother writing a review when there is already a voluminous set of other reviews stating everything I'd want to, and more concisely than I could... but Sakana is my favorite sushi bar in the valley, so I'm still going to add my two cents.

I've never had a bad meal at Sakana. Even when busy, which seems to be more often than not as of late, the service is good, the prices are decent and the portions huge.

Recently, they started having a Monday night happy hour-ish menu offering discounted maki rolls that include lettuce in the place of avocado. I've also seen promotions offering appetizers for 0.50 when you buy a Kirin or Kirin Light. Oh yeah, last but not least, you get orange slices with your bill... which is a nice touch.
