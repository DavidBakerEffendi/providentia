WOW!!!!!!!!!  This is one of the best "hole in the wall" diner/sports bars I've been to that was actually fun, great burger and the staff are all very friendly (a little slow), but friendly.  I was there with my son, grandson and cousin that was in town visiting.  We were all able to sit in the bar, watch the game (cards lost...no surprise there, but the bears won!), have a great meal and enjoy the ambiance.  I would recommend this to anyone, drinkers or non drinkers alike.  There is a condiment bar so you put on your burger whatever you want.  I enjoyed the Fiesta Burger and the guacamole was so tasty and fresh.  Awesome!
