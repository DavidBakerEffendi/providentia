What a wonderful place to enjoy the afternoon with great company.  This was my second visit to The Farm and boy the weather was prime for it.  We ate at the lunch restaurant because we got to the Farm right at 1pm as the breakfast restaurant was closing.  

The picnic baskets were awesome as we took our food and wondered into the large grassy area under a couple of tress to enjoy the beautiful Arizona spring weather.

I can't wait to comeback.  This is definitely the type of place to bring some family or friends that aren't from AZ to enjoy a great meal and the great Arizona weather.

They do close down during the summer months so just make sure the Farm is open if your planning on making a trip.
