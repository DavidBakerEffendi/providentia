They have a patio out front to enjoy the weather or you can sit at the bar or a booth or a table.
The servers are friendly and enthusiastic. They have a nice wine list and happy hour daily from 3- 6 pm. 
The decor is dark yet calming. Pizza is their specialty but there are other appetizers and main dishes to chose from also. I have yet to try their desserts but from the ones that were on other tables, they look very scrumptious.
I gave Sammy's a 5 for their vegetarian/vegan options.
