Oh. My. Lanta. 

Vic the Chili Man isn't just a food cart ... it's an EXPERIENCE. You cannot escape without having a hilarious conversation with Vic. How else is he supposed to entertain himself day-in & day-out at the stand if not by interacting with his favorite people, his customers?

The life changer is obviously a must, as it's what he's really known for. I got it with the apple pie BBQ in lieu of his spicy mustard and WOWZA it was bangin'. The next best (IMO) is the Frito Dog. He also does weekly 'Dogs of the week' which are always on point. Pretty much, it's impossible to order anything here and not like it. He's ALWAYS got a line, so make sure to leave yourself some extra time to accommodate for this ... you won't regret it!
