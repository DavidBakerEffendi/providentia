I really, really loved Humble Pie. They make the kind of pizza that Sauce aspires to in it's deepest fantasies. 

Seriously - We split two: Artichoke and Potato. they were SO. GOOD. Just what I want from a pizza - wood fired, creamy, crusty, yummy. 

We also split some fries... Get these. Just do it. 

The service was decent, but we went at a weird time - there was hardly anyone there. 

Humble Pie: Please open a location downtown.
