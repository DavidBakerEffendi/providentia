5 stars because every time I come in here to satisfy my gulab jamun craving, the owners are extremely friendly.  I like to buy my chutneys and lentils here, as well as some frozen veggies.  But the one thing I am never without from this place are the fresh roasted peanuts in their produce section.  I don't know what makes them so addicting, but you really must try them!  OMG!!  Everyone I offer them to wants to know where I buy them.  I'm not a fan of their hot food section....maybe it was because the one time I tried it, it was near closing and everything just seemed old and dried out.  Plus, it looked a bit dirty.  Maybe I will try again when things are fresher earlier in the day.  But this is a fun place to discover new spices and sauces.
