Fast food pizza made fresh to order before your eyes - truly amazing! I couldn't believe that our pizza was ready before we finished getting our drinks. I guess that's what happens when you use 800 degrees... The pizza crust was perfect and so delicious. I highly recommend this - they're open late, too, so it's the perfect late night snack.
