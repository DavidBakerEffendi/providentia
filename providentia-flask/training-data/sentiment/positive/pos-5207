Wow!  Where do I begin.  We went there with intentions of having their pizza but their menu looked so fabulous that we ended up trying variety of different dishes.  Not a single one of them disappointed. We started off with a stuffed shrimp appetizer on bruschetta which was absolutely delicious. Then I enjoyed a seafood linguine although I can't remember the exact name of it. It was superb. My daughter had lasagna which was above average... Very good. And my friend had a chicken pesto lasagna which was very rich but extremely delicious. My youngest kids had a ricotta/pepperoni stuffed calzone and it was delicious.  We finished with Italian donuts -- (a solid five stars on those) and enjoyed "Coke light" and Pellegrino's with the kids.  It's my new favorite place in the West Valley. We will definitely be back.
