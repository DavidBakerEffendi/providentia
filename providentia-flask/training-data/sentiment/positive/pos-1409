Oh my dear LORD how does such perfect soup exist?!

At 2am, there was a line to get into this noodle house.  And rightfully so!  Situated next to the poker room, it beckoned me..."You know you're starving...and you just won a $600 pot!  You can afford $15 soup..."

I chose Roasted Duck and BBQ Pork Soup.  It was beautiful.  Glistening, fatty duck and lean slices of BBQ pork floating among baby bok choy over thin egg noodles.  Clean, clear, deep-colored broth...not the oily kind commonly found in your average Chinese restaurant.

I enjoyed every slurp, every morsel.  It will now become my post-poker ritual at the Venetian from now on.  Absolute perfection.
