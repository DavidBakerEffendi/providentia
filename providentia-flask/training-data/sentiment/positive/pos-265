I'm a little biased with my review. Being a lifelong Phoenician we grew up going to a Garcia's in central phoenix that has long since closed. My partner and I had been frequenting the location on Rural until the hotel bought it.  We have gone to the new location on Warner many times. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, the staff is great and attentive!  I have my favorite items on the menu usually Pollo Fundido or Pork Tacos, no matter what is ordered I am never disappointed. I love the new location's space, very cozy and feels like an actual restaurant.  The patio is a great touch.
