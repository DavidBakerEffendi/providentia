The food here is fantastic as others have said.  The portions here are also pretty filling, especially if you get extra ramen on the side.  That being said the server here was nice and checked in on us several times.  It was a little difficult to find, as it's in a small corner of a strip mall but it was worth searching for as the Tonkotsu ramen was delicious.  The egg and pork were so flavorful!  If you're in the east valley, check this place out.  It's reasonably priced and has great food.
