I enjoy my visits to the pub. The staff are great guys (& gals) and Sundays are chicken wing nights that tend to perk up my weekend. They used to have great jazz Thursdays as well, shows how dynamic the small space can be. It's a really inviting setup that seems to suit every season better than the last.
