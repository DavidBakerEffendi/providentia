I'm staying next door at the Super 8 and woke up wanting something that was filling, hopefully healthy, but not greasy and vegetarian. 

I'm from LA and brown so Mexican away from home is rarely an option. Alas, I gave in and very happy not to be regretting it right now. There is no veggie option on the menu but the se√±or making me a burrito made it veggie and delicious. Affordable too!
