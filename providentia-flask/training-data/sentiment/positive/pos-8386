I like this place very much! It was a good experience (late afternoon) for espresso and light lunch and glass of wine...and a light taste of Creme Brulee - life is good! Wines are emphasized from French, Italy, and Spain...which I found a few labeled vineyards I liked. It's a lovely Bistro/Grocery (wines and cheese/beers). Staff are super friendly. Clean place! I would like to try this again for dinner. Happy dinning!
