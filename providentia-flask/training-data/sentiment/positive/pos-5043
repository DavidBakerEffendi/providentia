Did not fail to meet my loukoumades cravings. Everyone is new but already know what they are doing..hot and fresh as they are making them to go for the crowd. 

Cute, sunny terrasse to enjoy your Nescafe Frappe on..but zero ambiance as it's in a parking lot on nightmarish st-jean(totally under construction) 

It's dough. And sweet. And gooey. Just go.
