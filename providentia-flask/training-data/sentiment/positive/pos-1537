So, I finally found Vic the Chili Man. And I love him. 

I got the Nacho Dog - best. idea. ever.I can't even describe how excited I was when he put the cheese right on the grill top. OMG. delicious. The dogs are cheap, compared to the experience. He takes credit cards, with no minimum. And the line is worth the wait. 

Vic is so friendly and welcoming, that you feel like you've known him forever. He talks you through the line, so don't despair, get in on the conversation. Its obvious that he loves what he does, and loves the people that he meets. He's one of those people that you never have to think twice about saying hello to, you say hello and then chat for 20 mins about New York or Amsterdam. Seriously, we chatted about both yesterday. He's the guy that you go to get a dog, and bring your family and friends to meet Vic. 

After my experience here, I'm not surprised at all that he has such good reviews, or such a long line. You can't blame people!! Vic is fantastic.
