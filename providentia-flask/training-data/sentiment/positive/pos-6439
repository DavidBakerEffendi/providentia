This is my new favourite local sushi place. I've often walked by to see a full house inside, and had been meaning to check it out for months. Finally had dinner with a friend a couple of weeks ago and it was great! The service was super attentive, the food was delicious, and the prices were reasonable. Additionally, they were very sensitive to my food allergy which was greatly appreciated. 

I was so impressed that I called ahead the following week and ordered a tray of sushi for a client meeting. Although they don't open until 11:30, the chef offered to come in early to prepare our sushi. 

Delicious Sushi + Five Star Service. I just know I'm going to be a regular.
