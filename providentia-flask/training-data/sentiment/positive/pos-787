It has been 2 years since my initial review and I still faithfully visit here. My current favorites are the jalapeno burger (they fry the jalapenos and they are amazing), the 5 meat pizza, and the oreo pazookie. They also added some new pazookies to the menu and the white chocolate raspberry is amazing. The service is always fantastic, love the atmosphere, and they always have a new list of seasonal brews.

They just started a loyalty card and I am saving up for the free $25 gift card. It is easy to use and I can check my balance on line. I am halfway there!
