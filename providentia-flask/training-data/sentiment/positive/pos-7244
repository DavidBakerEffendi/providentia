My husband and I are HUGE fans of Thai food.  We are lucky, in that just recently in Ahwatukee, TWO new Thai restaurants have opened.  Taste of Thai is one of them.  So....this place is simply amazing.  We have picked up orders twice in the past 6 weeks; last night we actually went and sat in the restaurant to dine.  The place is super cute and has a modern vibe.  Tarn waited on us and she *might* have the friendliest personality I've run across yet.  To the food:  the flavors are layered, nuanced, and delightful.  We had the bacon fried rice, the Spicy Cashew with Beef (highly recommend) and have ordered several other dishes including one with duck.  The menu definitely has some surprises - things you don't typically find on a Thai menu.  We seriously love this place.  You will too!
