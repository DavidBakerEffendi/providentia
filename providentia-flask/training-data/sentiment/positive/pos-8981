Wow!! Started out with the Buta Hara Saut√© and I thought, "if everything is as good as this, we are in for a great meal." Turns out everything was even BETTER!! 

The only criticism I would have is for the "808 Ceviche" which was good but needs some extra lime and rock salt and should be served in a wider dish. 

You MUST GET THE "GARLIC CHICKEN" it's fantastic!!! The Kalbi is the best I have ever had. Coming from a self proclaimed "foodie" this place is the best meal I have had in a while!!!!
