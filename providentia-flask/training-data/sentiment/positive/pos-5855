One of my favorite places to eat. I come here pretty regularly. The service is fantastic and the employees are extremely friendly. Plus the food is great. The buns for the sandwiches really make them stand out. I love their milkshakes, and I look forward to trying each seasonal flavor. I'm not a big fan of there fries but the side of apples are outstanding with the dip that comes with them. I highly suggest trying them. All this and your food comes incredibly quick. They take fast food to a new level.
