I am a huge burger fan and have sampled burgers in the US and the UK.

Five Guys is definitely one of my favorite burgers. Fresh and juicy, their burger tastes like it was made in someone's backyard in the best possible way. Their fries don't have that manufactured french fry taste...you can still taste the potato in their fries, which I love. 

I also love that this Five Guys location has the awesome soda selector where I can still enjoy Vanilla Coke.
