Oh the Flavors!!! I am absolutely in love with this place from just one visit.  How my boyfriend didn't enjoy his pad thai is beyond me.  I loved my sisters tofu pad thai i felt like it had so much more of like a sauce on it compared to most placed being all dry and gross.  Not this place unless the chicken is that much different.  I cannot wait to go back and get more of their pad thai.  From the looks of the pictures the panang is pretty soupy looking. So that i am definitely steering clear of because according to my best friend we like when it is cooked incorrectly like at thai ramas where its more of a thick curry that coats your rice rather than drowns it if that makes any sense.  My mom had ordered a seafood curry dish of some sort that tasted amazing as well. So this is definitely the best thai food spot for pad thai and certain dishes cant wait to try more off the menu!
