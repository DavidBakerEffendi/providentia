We go here on Saturday nights. They have karaoke. It's not any karaoke, it is high end. They have back up singers and a guy that will play the guitar for you and if your song  calls for a harmonica your covered there as well. Super fun. Usually the same crowd and they are very good singers. If you want to go somewhere and watch a bunch of people have a very very good time and this is the place.
