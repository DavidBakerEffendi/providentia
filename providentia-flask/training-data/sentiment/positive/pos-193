Our first visit was during Queen's Feast which is always fast and furious.  We started off a little rocky because our reservation was at 8 PM and we did not get seated until 8:30.  I was little miffed that others that did not have reservations (apparently) were able to get seated in front of us.  But we already had a couple of drinks before arriving, so no big deal!

I think what pushed the rating all the way to 5 stars was first, our server, Chris.  He did a remarkable job and we could not have been happier.  Secondly, two words:  foie gras.  I pity the goose that gave up its liver, but oh man still licking my lips.  For Queen's Feast it was a $10 up-charge for this appetizer--so very worth it.  Lastly, I ordered the pork cheek which was braised to perfection.  It was succulent with a unexpected depth of flavor; moreover, it was nicely paired with mushrooms and fingerling potato.  Add a reasonable bottle of wine for $30 and the four of us were happy campers.

The rum cake topped off the evening with its light show and awesome taste.  Yum, yum, yum.  We'll be back.
