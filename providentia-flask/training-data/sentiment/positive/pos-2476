I love their shawarmas... delicious, simple clean sauces, tender beef slices and crunchy vegetables. Love the twice wrapped and grilled style. Wish they would put a bit more meat, though that's just me being greedy. Filling is more than adequate. The platters are awesome as well - the garlicky sauce they put on the roasted potatoes and rice is deadly. Beware - you will be burping up garlic all day.
