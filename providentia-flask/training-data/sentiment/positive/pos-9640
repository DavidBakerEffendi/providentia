Only thing wrong with this restaurant is the name. Botig...botlag...botalia? Whatever. 

Food: excellent. Every dish was perfectly seasoned, well thought out and creative...but not too creative (in the best possible way). 

Service: attentive, personable, but unobtrusive. I'd also like to point out the patience our server had with a nearby table who was being terribly rude to him. He also dealt with my obnoxious 11 month old daughter in stride. 

Atmosphere: this is where botigglia (sp?) really shines. I felt comfortable, but there was an air of distinguishability...hautiness. But not in an annoying way. I felt like I could be dining at a restaurant on the coast of the Mediterranean. 

Wonderful addition to the growing number of great restaurants in the area.
