Simple food done very well!  The chicken kabobs and rice are delicious!  I order from here at least once a week.  Everything tastes very fresh and delicious, and the service is friendly.

The chicken kebabs w/ half rice and half salad is delicious.  They give you TONS of rice, and the chicken is perfectly seasoned.

I do not recommend the Pomegranate chicken - sounds good but was highly disappointed.  

Huge portions, great prices, and customer service very friendly.
