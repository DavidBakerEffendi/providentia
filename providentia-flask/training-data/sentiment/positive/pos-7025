I ordered delivery from uber for the first time and chose Annie's. I never even heard of this place which is crazy because I have lived in Henderson for 18 years and worked in many Italian restaurants back east and here. The menu looked amazing and I'm glad I made this my choice. I had a garden salad which was crisp fresh and the dressing was amazing.  I then had the chicken masala. That is one of my favorite dishes ever and they executed it perfectly (a lot of places cant). I truly enjoyed my meal. I look forward to actually dining in the establishment. Great job! Great find!
