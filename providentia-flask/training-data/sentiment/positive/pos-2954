I haven't gotten out much recently to dine out, given current economic woes, but felt I had a good excuse to check out The Cove Trattoria to meet up with fellow Yelpers and Yelpettes. Service was prompt and courteous and the Happy Hour prices on drinks and food were a bit astonishing.

As for the food, I decided to treat myself to seafood and ordered two of the "small plates" which included the Shrimp Verde and the Mussels. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned on a skewer with a side of reconstituted sun dried tomatoes. Delicious! I shared a few with my Yelp neighbors and then greedily kept the rest to myself. The mussels were amazing, especially the slightly chunky rich garlicky broth that begged to be soaked up and scooped with the accompanying toast points.

Between the two small plates, I had enough to share with other people and fill myself with seafoody goodness. Beers (Stella Artois, for me) were only $2.50 a pop according to Happy Hour pricing. I tipped generously and then was reminded that gratuity was included (since we were dining as a group). Nonetheless, I didn't retract my original tip because the food was so delicious and affordable.

Their Happy Hour here has to be one of the best-kept bargain secrets around. I will definitely be back to "treat" myself sometime soon.
