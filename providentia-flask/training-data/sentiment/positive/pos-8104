I'm in love.  Hands down one of the best lunch places in downtown Pittsburgh.  I love their sandwiches, and rotating hot meal menus or special of the day.  Their desserts are uber tasty and unique and the staff is friendly and so helpful, kind, and they know how to dress!  They are super busy during lunch with a line out the door.  So I suggest you go there early (rather than late - they tend to sell out of the specials).   Definitely stop in if you are in the market square area of downtown Pittsburgh.
