I love this place. I don't get why people are arguing there's no chicken option here. ITS SOONDUBU, which translate to TOFU SOUP. 

The broth here is delicious, it's even better then what you get in Korea. 

The tofu is outstanding, so silky and smooth.

The rice is well made and the side dishes are always present when you come in.

It's classic, delicious and simple. The menu is small but it forgivable when it showcases it's best. 

Anybody who's a Korean cuisine lover has to come here for a taste on their own.
