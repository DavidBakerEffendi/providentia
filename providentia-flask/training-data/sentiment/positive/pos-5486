Pretty much the perfect Sunday football experience. If your a Packers fan, this is the place to be, but if a fan of any other team, you might want to stay away because your game may not be on and if it is, it will be on a very small and older TV. I went with a Packers fan and luckily I could see my Giants getting mauled on another TV.
The bloody Mary's were excellent at $3.50 a pop (ask for a pickle), but no other drink specials. The philly cheese steak was the best I had in ages and is in my Top 5 list. White American, ribeye, onions, sweet and bell peppers and the cheese curds were authentic as possible. Friend from Wisconsin said the curds were the best she has had since home. Marcie was a great waitress, just too bad the packed bar had to leave sad after a wild loss.
