I was in the area after an interview and trying to decide what to eat...(Jeopardy Theme)

Suddenly, I had a memory of home, mom making crepes and us kids, drizzling, spreading, sprinkling, packing them with sweet syrup, chocolate chips, icing sugar, fruit, whip topping. But beyond the breakfast/Dessert crepe from home I have never been to a creperie and always wanted to try a savory type like the one's I have only heard of. 

First of all, this place is so bright, clean and organized it puts our hospitals to shame. I think I could have ate my meal off the floor! Ok maybe not that clean but it was looking good and modern. Even the bathroom was super clean and fashionable. And I am actually big on bathrooms and their cleanliness and decor. LOL.

Ok back to the food. 

I ordered their lunch special. A choice of one of their select crepes and a choice from a select list of beverages. You can order anything but then you are adding $1 or more for something off their $10.99 deal. 

My crepe of choice - Chicken: pieces of chicken breast, spinach, cremini and swiss cheese with a nice savory dressing. 
My bevvie - Matcha green tea latte

Crepe - savory. delicious. healthy? I dunno. But the crepe itself was perfect texture, not too egg-y, hint of sweetness, soft, slightly chewy with a thin layer of crispy from the pan. 

Latte - AMAZING! Best green tea latte EVA! and first time seeing real latte art! That wowed me big time! I'm sure I am just a newbie to this frothy white and green wonder in my mug, but I would come back just for another one of these!

First creperie I have been to and loved the experience, so this gets 5 stars from me. 

There were other desserts and my mouth salivated at the sweet crepe options shown in a little photo album. From latte art to crepe masterpieces!!

Highly recommend!
