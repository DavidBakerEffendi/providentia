I love the filet mignon from here! It is paired with creamed spinach and a little toasty potato that I like to "crack" open! This all goes perfect with the cold Modelo's they serve. And for dessert, the salted caramel pudding is exquisite!!! I can not get enough! Enjoy coming here, they have indoor and patio seating as well. Always a treat when I come here!
