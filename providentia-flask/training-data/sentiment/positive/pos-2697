Unfortunately this place is huge which makes it look empty but the experience is great, especially with our waiter leading the show. You could tell he likes to guide people to what is fresh and delicious and he did that on this trip. The menu has every type of Asian food choices and sushi. He asked if he could bring us some sushi to start to earn our trust. He brought out white tiger roll which wasn't on the menu. Exquisite with shrimp, mango and white seaweed with a pair of sauces. Delicious. We also had the calamari which had a light tempura fry on it with Thai chili sauce, spot on. The bang bang shrimp was good but after that we just trusted our server with sushi choices. Next he asked us if we liked eel and we declined so he brought us out the Eptks roll minus the E for eel. Another night choice, smooth and creamy roll just melted in your mouth. After that we had a lobster tempura roll which was great with mango and then he brought a variety plate with a eye catching glowing blue  presentation which had white tuna sashimi  (best of the night) with red snapper and rainbow roll. With what looked like a slow Saturday night, I hope people find this place so we can keep going back. Thought the value was good with the plates he brought out averaging $2 per piece.
