After discovering the most delicious cookie in the Universe on a trip to Seattle, I have scoured the Valley searching for this gem called "macaron". Having tried 3-4 bakeries and being left flat on both flavor and texture at all those places, Aunt Abby's was recommended to me. Loving the macarons I tasted in Seattle remembering the freshness, the perfect texture, and exceptional flavors, I dropped by and tried one of their macarons.... EUREKA!!! Abby, herself served me a white chocolate grand mariner before placing my order, immediately my mouth was thankful for the delivery of this amazing cookie!!! Friendly, knowledgeable, professional service combined w out of this world macarons, have I died and gone to Heaven?!?!  I would give this place 20 stars if possible! I'm picky about bakeries... Like Sprinkles is worth a negative star kind of picky ... I'm not easy to impress, but happy to say socks... Knocked off this morning! Thank you, Abby for sharing your gift w the world, especially this east valley macaron conisseur! I will be back and turning all the people I know onto your glorious confections. Absolutely love the pistachio ones... Maybe coffee or hazelnut flavor in the future? Looking forward to holiday flavors too!
