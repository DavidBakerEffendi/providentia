Been to this location three times since I've moved out here. 

Pros: Always extremely clean, staff is really friendly. They even helped my mom order for her first time (and changed the order when she changed her mind with no hassle)

Cons: Food takes a while to cook. However, it always tastes good so I try not to complain :)
