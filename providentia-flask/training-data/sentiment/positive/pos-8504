Adding more sweet treats to my favorite list.  Guri Guri!! It's like gelato but the island style way with tropical flavors.  We had Lychee & Melona, very flavorful and refreshing treat!  How cool I heard the radio hosts on 94.1 radio station give a shout out about the malasadas here. I was beginning to question myself thinking maybe my tastes buds are off. Good to know they're not!  The malasadas filled with macadamia nut cream is my other favorite filling . Mr. B likes the pumpkin with topped white chocolate.  They're fried up to order so it's nice and warm,  although the pumpkin filled ones tastes better cold! Love the creative ways this place keeps coming up with to make them.
