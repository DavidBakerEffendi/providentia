We have been here a couple of times and will be back. We love to bring our dog and sit on the patio on the weekend. They have a pretty impressive and reasonably priced menu just for dogs, so she loves to come with us. 
All of the people food we have tried so far- stuffed prawns, burgers, and risotto- have been great too!
