Cozy cafe in southend, feels like a hideaway! My friend and I were searching for some caffeine & lunch in south end. We found Roots cafe and they have great coffee and a quality lunch menu. I had the coconut milk latte with cold brew coffee. It was amazing and strong and lovely flavors of coconut! The turkey sandwich had goat cheese (my favorite food) and pickled red onions and cucumber and it was delicious! I have never liked onions but pickled red onion, with the turkey and goat cheese was yummy. Each sandwich comes with a side, I chose the pickled cucumbers, nice flavor. They also have wine and beer and kombucha, so I must return. The vibe at 11 a.m. was cozy and private and great for conversations. The parking lot is tiny but it seems like you can park on the street too. Service was great, awesome people !!  I had previously eaten their catering food at a Christmas party so I knew they had good eats!
