The Sweet Potato Hash breakfast is FAAAABulous!!!! The ambiance is great with the sweet, retro diner feel. I've popped in late mornings, during the week, and have gotten right in, no wait, fast service!! I love the bottomless cup of Joe...it's fair restaurant java, but always hot and always rapidly refilled! This place is hoppin' come the weekend, so plan well and expect a bit of a wait...but it's worth it!!!
