Eggslut actually changed how we cook at home. We were told to go and try and eggslut and discovered that amazing world of sous vide cooking. I was skeptical that a runny egg with mashed potatoes could be this good and was so pleasantly impressed that we bought a sous vide to use at home to make the dish in our kitchen. The line can be intimidating at this small spot but don't let that deter you from getting your very own eggslut. The breakfast sandwiches are excellent as well but be brave and get the eggslut even if you don't think you'd like it, you'll be happy you did.
