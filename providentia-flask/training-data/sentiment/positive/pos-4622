We dined in on a Wednesday evening and the place was already full with groups of guests. We were seated immediately by an overly excited waiter (he walked us in when we barely reached the door outside lol) and he accompdated us with the menu and drinks in a friendly manner. The place is quite big and has luxurious atmosphere with exotic props. We ordered pork cup-bop (fried rice with signature sauce), 2 orders of baked scallop rolls, las vegas rolls and yaki-udon and yes, that is too much food for two people but we finished all. Serving sizes are pretty good and two dishes and an appetizer would have been enough but we were very hungry and we eat a lot in general (like "a lot" a lot.) and all the dishes were delish! Will visit again for a nice dinner date.
