What a nice gem in a fairly lack luster selection of chains that is the Las Vegas restaurant scene. I have heard about Honey Salt for awhile but hadn't gotten a chance to go when I was asked my preference for a 2nd date location. Btw, this was the only good part of that date...

The place is nestled in the corner of a fairly nice shopping center with lots of parking. I instantly notice the great patio and take note that I'll be hitting that up when it gets just a touch warmer. Walking in it's a relaxing, eclectically decorated place with wooden tables, half booths, and nothing matching in a kitschy way. The bar is beautiful and there is an open kitchen in the back. 

I ordered the caramelized scallops and my date orders pork. I also got one of their sangrias, which I must say was fantastic. I'm pretty picky about Sangria after having enjoyed these fabulous ones at a restaurant I use to regular in Denver. I also make my own. They can't be cheap wine with splash of oj. They need to be solid sangria with brandy and spice. I was very pleased with their offering. 

The food came quickly and the service was outstanding. I wish I had gotten the girls name. I know she said it but I've forgotten now. She was fantastic. I luckily got a taste of my dates pork which was just as excellent as my scallops. Sadly date was in a hurry so there was no dessert but I definitely loved everything about it (place not date) and can't wait to go back. I hear they have a fantastic brunch.
