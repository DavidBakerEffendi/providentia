Four years later, I'm back!  Felt almost like a pilgrimage back to burrito heaven or something.  Nothing but joy filled my body knowing I'd be coming here again after traveling across the pacific ocean and through miles and miles of cactus filled desert. 

Visiting AZ for a wedding so my girlfriend and I was here for a few days so Amados was definitely on our hit list!  

Oh how I wish Hawaii had late night Mexican spots like you.  This visit made me realize just how important places like you are in my life.  

Of the four nights in AZ, we ate here three times.  Such quality burritos we just don't see in Hawaii.  And these burritos were no slouch either...these things came packed with carne asada....and for only 6 dollar-ish!  That same burrito would cost 10+ here. 

Til next time, Amados.  Sigh.
