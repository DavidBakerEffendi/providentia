Every time I'm craving meat jun I always have to come to jun's.   I usually go for the bbq chicken and meat jun plate.  It includes salad and 4 sides which I love the potato and Kim chee.  On the weekends at dinner it can get busy and service get a little slow as there is usually only 3 people working.  But they are kind and pretty on point with customer service.
