Whenever I want really good (New) Mexican food, I will go to Los Dos Molinos always & forever. I love the building (old hacienda former home of actor Tom Mix), I love the kick-ass margaritas, and I think about the carnitas more often than normal. My family has been going for years and years so I my perspective on the service is skewed, i love the sassy servers I see every time I go.  But even I know, if you show up less than a half hour before closing, they will give a loud exasperated sigh, look at their watch, then up at the clock, then back and you, and then possibly seat you. Maybe.

But there is a special place in my heart & stomach for Los Dos and this is by far my favorite location. It's a fun place to go with a group because no one cares how loud or tipsy you get and it's semi-amusing to see your friends get shot down when they ask for mild sauce.. just fyi. they don't do that. They "don't know HOW" to make mild sauce.
