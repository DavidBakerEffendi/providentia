Service, service, followed by amazing service.

Here's the scoop.  Arrived Saturday night to a 60 minute wait for a table. Wife did some magic wifey stuff and all of a sudden we were seated at the chef's table on the side where salads and apps are created.

We sat down, and were greeted, immediately by a server with amazing energy and passion for his work.  Efficiently he took our drink orders, made recommendations, and went to acquire the goods.  Next, an equally energetic line cook welcomed us to the restaurant and asked if this was a repeat visit.  No we advised.  He truly beamed with excitement and welcomed us, telling us about how excited he was to have us and started offering us what I expected to be small samples.  At this point, I felt like they thought we were actually important.  As though we were famous, knew someone in their corporate office, etc.  BTW - were just normies.

Wife asked for an off the menu item due to food allergies.  Did they respond?  Yes!!!!  I was able to watch the employee hand cut a head of lettuce, grill it for a moment, hand slice chicken.  He then confirms what the allergens are and asks if he can add more to the salad to make it better for my wife!  He then turns to a line cook to coordinate the timing of the delivery of our food.  I am soooo impressed at this point.  Everyone was getting along, no egos were bruised as the staff (tactfully) hollered to their peers, what they needed.  It was amazing to see the true team work and the fun being had!  

Salad - perfect 10.  Turkey Sloppy Joe - 9, just a bit sweet.  Portion of fries served with Sloppy Joe, enough for (4) four adults.  

Overall experience?  11 out of 10!  (Or 5/7 for my Imgur peeps). 

One the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Made my last $250 dinner at Dominicks feel like a dinner at Chillis.  Two entrees, one draft, one soft drink - including tax, title, license, and docs fees - $40.
