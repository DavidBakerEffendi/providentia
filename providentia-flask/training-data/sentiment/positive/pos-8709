In town for a meeting and had a craving for Chinese. This place was the closest and had decent reviews so I gave it a try. Food was delicious and hit the spot (shrimp fried rice, shrimp/scallop dish, veg and shrimp egg rolls. Food was ready for pick up in less than 20 min. Service was very friendly and helpful. I would order from them again.
