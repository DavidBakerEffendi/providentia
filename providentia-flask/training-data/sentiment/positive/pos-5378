Kind of hard to find if you aren't from the area it's in the complex with the No Frills next to Erindale Go station. I'm not big on breakfast so this is one of my favourite "breakfast" restaurants as they don't just serve breakfast food. I can get a soup and a sandwich for an extremely reasonable price of and did I mention the service is super quick which is amazing as I hate sitting around in a restaurant waiting for my food.

I ordered the Taiwanese sausage sandwich which was awesome! I ordered it with the laksa soup and they were the perfect combination for me. This is definitely a one of a kind place and serves good you can't find elsewhere. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly what more can you ask for!

I will definitely be back here soon!
