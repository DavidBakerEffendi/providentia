My only complaint about this place is that the tables are wobbly. Should be easy to fix. Staff is generally friendly, albeit some are certainly more anxious to please than others. Variety of food and drinks is excellent, despite the fact that they are vegan. Haven't tried the wine bar.  Open 24 hours, and usually parking is readily available (which is not the case with the mini-center just across the street).
