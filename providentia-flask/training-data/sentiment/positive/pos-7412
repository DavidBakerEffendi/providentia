Went here again recently and this place is just awesome. It's like being in Vegas when Vegas was awesome, in the 1950s-60s. Our friends who take us here (who live in Vegas) have a standing Friday night reservation there and they treat them like royalty - the valet saves them a parking spot and they get "their" table every Friday. Awesome staff. "Their" server is a great guy named "Papa". 

They got amazingly yummy salmon and we got the special of the night which was steak and shrimp. So good. Comes with garlic bread and amazing salad, and as I mentioned in my previous review, all-you-can-drink wine. Mmm hmm. Yeah.

Just go here. It's so fun.
