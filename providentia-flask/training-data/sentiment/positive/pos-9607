My brother got me to try Buldogis for the 1st time yesterday. (Yeah, I know. I'm late to the party.) Congratulations to Buldogis!!! A spot I consider to be the only accepted form of Korean fusion. True fusion isn't simply stock-piling ethnic ingredients in non-ethnic foods. It's about merging 2 cuisines together to create something special. *sunshine and rainbows over*

I wanted to try a little of everything so we ordered a Korean Hangover Soup + Kangnam (Gangnam) Dog + Angry Kimchi Fries. The soup had a homemade quality to it. I'm not sure exactly what kind of soup it is but I want to say it's like a not-so-spicy Yukgaejang w/ chicken instead of beef. It's a savory and not-too-salty broth with an herbal tone filled with tasty vegetables, chunks of chicken and dangmyeon (sweet potato noodles). I could probably live without hot dogs. Although they use 100% premium beef franks, I still get a sick feeling after eating one. It's either guilt or nitrates eating away at my soul. The Kangnam was tasty but I think their Bulgogi Dog would've been a better choice. I am totally obsessed with their Angry Fries. They look absolutely terrifying when they approach the table. Sweet potato fries topped with spicy pork, fried kimchi, an egg and other goodies. It sounds like an artery blocker because it is. But surprisingly, Korean food and sweet potato marry perfectly in this paper plate.

In summary, I am no longer the anti-Christ of Korean fusion. It can be done and Buldogis does it well. Can't wait to be back to try their Carne Asada (bulgogi) Fries!
