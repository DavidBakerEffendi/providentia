Being new to Toronto I had no idea I would be putting on 15 lbs. my first couple days here. The food in this city is outstanding and the keg is easily one of the best meals I've had in my life. 

We went on Christmas Eve (yes! It was open!! And packed) and were seated immediately and waited on by the cutest girl ever. The only thing I don't get is they apparently have their employees speak with accents...we noticed everyone had an accent which we could rarely identify and often our sever dropped hers completely. It's was bazaar but entertaining. The food though...the food...

We started with a cheese appetizer which consisted of baked Brie, perfectly crisped bread slices, and a jalape√±o jelly that I can't stop thinking about. Absolute perfection. I loved my chicken and my love absolutely devoured his blue cheese crusted filet and lobster tail. For dessert (and we NEVER order dessert but this meal was just too good) we had the cheesecake and wow. Just a perfect meal. 

Thanks!
