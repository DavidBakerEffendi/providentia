OMG, awesome buffet! So many choices of dessert!! I love the grits and the mashed sweet potato. The line wasn't long because I got there around 4ish. The price you pay does pay off, so go hungry, chill and digest. 

They have a sushi area, salad area, italian, chinese, dessert. Many choices to choose from and they have a bunch of variety of fish dish. The salad area has a lot of fresh veggies and fruits, which is a PLUS. 

The place is a bit hidden, or maybe I just had a hard time finding, but once 5pm or 6pm comes round, you'll see a long line.
