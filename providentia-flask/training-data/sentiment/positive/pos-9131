Portofino was amazing! I will get to the spectacular food next but what elevated  this restaurant was the world class service.  Starting with William at the bar who will make your favorite drink and make you feel like a friend for years. The hostess appeared at the right moment to escourt us to our table. The decor is classic elegance with a touch of an old world feel.  The menu has lots of delicious sounding choices and the waiter greeted us promptly. However when Chris came by our table, the meal went from dinner to a fine dining experience. Chris was an expert on the menu and thrilled us with his explanation of the dishes. He solved our ordering delimma by offering split plates so we could have all our heart's desired. Chris is also the sommelier and paired the perfect wine with our order. We are almost exclusively red wine drinkers but his recommendation of a delicious white wine from Italy elevated the food. And the food was spectacular! The pasta was fresh with decadent lobster and a sauce that makes you want to lick your plate. The scallops were huge, sushi grade and the best I have ever eaten. The dishes are unique flavor combinations that dance on your palette. It's not on the menu but the chef makes an outstanding carbonara. If there is anything you want don't hesitate to ask because every dish is made to order and their outstanding chef can make anything. The portion size is huge so we didn't have room for dessert. The amazing food and service made our evening spectacular. We would definitely recommend that you visit soon as this restaurant is slated to be closed which is heartbreaking!  So hurry and see Chris and his team for a truly evelavated dining experience.
