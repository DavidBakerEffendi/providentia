I was disappointed when Bragg's Factory Diner closed.  Whenever I passed through Phoenix, I made time to stop there.  Fortunately, the owner of Bragg's opened The Coronado.

I wanted to try everything but I limited myself.  Horchatte (horchata with espresso) is such a natural combination that I'm surprised I've never seen it before.  The huevos rancheros were elevated from routine to memorable.  This may be the best I've had since a visit to Oaxaca a few years ago.  The street corn was average but I think it was really because the corn isn't in season.  The peanut butter cake was great but too much.  I couldn't eat it all.

The Coronado will be my new regular stop whenever I'm in town and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.
