Aloha Las Vegas Yelpers!!!

So my search for amazing Hawaiian food continues on the 9th island called Las Vegas! :D

I've been living in Las Vegas for a month now and every week that goes by,,, I'm coming across new businesses to get my grind on! Love it!

Came here recently with my ex roomie from LA... she never had Hawaiian food before, so it was exciting for me to have her go through the experience with me driving.

I was craving Kalbi, so I went with the Kalbi and meat jun mix plate :)) and I suggested my friend to hit up the fried noodles!

Russell is super nice and to top it off... he's from Hilo on the Big Island... ahhh small world... I'm from Hilo! He knew my uncle too! funny, but not surprising.

Free parking. Casual dining. Indoor seating only. Great customer service. Helper picture menu. 

You'll def find the Aloha spirit here!

I can't wait to come back and try other yummy local food!

Stop by Island Style for your local fix (hawaiian & korean.. tell Russell I sent you!

Mahalo Island Style for making me feel like I'm still back home in Hawaii!
