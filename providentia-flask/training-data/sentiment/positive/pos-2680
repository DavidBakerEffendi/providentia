Had a great experience here. I showed up at 2:50pm and didn't realize they closed at 3pm until seeing the hours on the door. I opened the door and asked the owner if it was too late and he was like "nah come on in, we're still open!"

After sitting down, he then introduced me to some of their cuisine and best dishes. I opted in for the Venezuelan Creole Breakfast which had slow roasted beef, eggs, shredded cheese and black beans. I also added rice to the order. He said he wouldn't charge me for the rice since I was a newcomer and wanted to try some new things out.

After the order was placed, the owner popped back out and surprised me with some fried cakes as an appetizer, for free! They were very good!

My meal came shortly after and I chowed down on the deliciousness. It was all very tasty and I really enjoyed the rice & beans mixed together. The owner also kept popping back out of the kitchen to make sure I was pleased with the food.

Overall I was very happy with the service and how welcoming the owner was. I will definitely be back!
