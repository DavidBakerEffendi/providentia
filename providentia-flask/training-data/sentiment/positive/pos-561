Delicious food, friendly staff. Conveniently located near the movie theatre. The carne asada tacos were delicious. The beans were flavorful. I ordered two tacos. My only complaint is that I wished they placed two tortillas (for each taco serving) instead of one, because the taco falls apart with one tortilla.
