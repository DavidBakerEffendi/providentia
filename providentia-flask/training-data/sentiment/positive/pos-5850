El Chorro certainly deserves more stars then it has! Whenever family comes to town we always go here for their final night. Although the menu is small, everything on it is AMAZING. Waiters are extremely attentive and are never hard to get a hold of. I went for my graduation and it was beautiful. We sat outside by a beautiful fire. Two adorable young hostesses were at the front and led us to the table. Lighting outside is gorgeous. I had the seafood pasta, and wish I took a picture to post. large portion sizes, and as a recent college graduate, I appreciate that more then anyone.
