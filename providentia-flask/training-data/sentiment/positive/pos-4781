There is no better place for crab legs in Northeast Ohio especially since Chef Bob Bundy is back in the kitchen. The food is delicious from the fried dough with honey cinnamon butter to the salads with homemade croutons and the amazing seafood. I love Pickle Bills especially in the summer. I take all of my best customers here for lunch because it always makes an impact. I can't say enough about this place. Try the king or snow crab, the prime rib or the lobster tails. Also the blackened salmon caesar salad is to die for!
