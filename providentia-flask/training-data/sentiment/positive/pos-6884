I'm continuing to enjoy JPH.

Very good, higher quality/priced coffee and pastries. The breakfast sandwich is bomb and i would happily argue that they have the finest prepared cup of coffee in Madison, if not Wisconsin. 

While some have labeled this place pretentious, i have always had great interactions with the owners and barristas. In regards to the "pour over" vs. already prepared coffee and their prices, you must remember that this business is not run on the quantity over quality concept (i.e. Starbucks, Pete's). They pay a premium for their products too in order to serve the best of the best, so they must charge more. Some people see it fine to pay $100 for a bottle of wine. While that may not be something i would ever do, i can respect and understand the reasoning behind purchasing such a luxury on occasion. Their coffee is the same way. It is the best you can buy. Thus, It is more expensive than the rest. If that's not your thing, then don't drink it. Just don't knock them for caring.

long story short, if you like quality coffee and a chill environment, give Johnson Public House a shot (no pun intended).
