I thought 5 stars?!?! I need to try it for myself... and it did not disappoint! The 5 star rating is well deserved. As we hesitantly approached the front entrance looking at the menu in the window, we were greeted with a big smile from the owner inviting us in. 

Both hubs and I had the lunch special. I had the grilled steak and he had the beef and chicken skewers. As other yelpers mentioned, the food was flavorful, not salty, and plentiful! Lunch specials are under $10 and it comes with a drink, soup and salad. 

This is a take out joint but there are a few seats inside and outside to enjoy your meal. We opted to eat outside. The server, I assume the owners daughter was super sweet. 

Good food, great value and excellent service! Will definitely be back next time we are in the area.
