YUM! I love anything grilled cheese and this place did not disappoint. I was able to check out this truck at the Streets Food Festival. I got there early and luckily the line for this truck was not too bad. When we were leaving, the line was crazy. There is a reason though. The grilled cheese was delicious. I got to try a brie and green apple grilled cheese. Oh I still dream of this concoction. It was just crispy enough and had so much delicious cheese. I just wish it was bigger or that i ordered too. My husband had a grilled cheese with fritos, spicy cheese, pork and he was amazed. He does not get excited by food, but he got excited by this. We loved it.
Follow them on facebook. They are franchising their trucks, and keeping a truck in Phoenix now. I will definitely be going again. It is also owned and ran by veterans- so I felt even better giving them my money.
