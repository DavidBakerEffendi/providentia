Blackened salmon was fine, there was nothing extraordinary about it. The quinoa salmon bowls we incredible, my mom and I just kept raving over them. We were trying to figure out what the spices were but I waitress was a little overworked and said she would find out for us but then she forgot. My daughter liked her fish and chips, there were plenty of fish pieces, at least four big pieces. And my son ate both of his mini cheeseburgers and cute little skinny fries.
