This place is absolutely fantastic! My boyfriend and i have dubbed this place our "Sunday Spot" for a number of different reason. 

My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar, so of course i could start by saying they have an excellent drink menu. They have specialty cocktails that are all carefully hand crafted and delicious. I am more of a wine drinker, and the wine list is perfect for anyone with a sophisticated pallet. My boyfriend has a little less knowledge about wine and the bartender took the time to help him to find a wine that he would like. Brent is another reason we come to this place. He is an amazing bartender and incredibly knowledgeable and skilled at his craft. 

Moving along to the food. I have yet to order something here that I have not enjoyed. Everything had been so tasty!! If you're in the mood for some comfort food you have to try the meatloaf. It is so delicious and the portion is perfect. If you have decided on wine with dinner, I would recommend trying the cheese board. It was fantastic and a little different then ones I have had before in the best way. Even the dessert is amazing. 

I have nothing bad to say about this place and we both have told multiple people about it and have suggested to our bosses that it is a great place to go for a business lunch. Do yourself a favor and try this place. You will not regret it.
