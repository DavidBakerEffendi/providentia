CARNE ASADA. that's what you should get here. So good.

the husband ordered the carne asada burrito (~$7.50) and was in heaven. i had the carne asada taco combo (~$7.50 - you can get them with flour or corn tortillas)- and loved it. the rice and beans to me were kinda meh, but those tacos!!! we got the horchata ($2.00) and it was also pretty good. at the end of our meal, we sprung for a mango-strawberry raspado. The large size (~$4.75) comes with lechera (condensed milk) AND a scoop of ice cream! Perfecto!!! I recommend eating some of the overflowing cup of raspado and then mixing the rest all together. mmmm.

Now, let me talk to you about the salsas. They bring out a roasted tomato/green chile/onion salsa that is SO GOOD. we practically licked that little bowl clean. they also give you a bowl of salsa verde, which has amazing flavor and the perfect amount of heat to it. mmm. We didn't spring for it, but chips are ~$1.50 and guac is the same. 

they offer nachos, quesadillas, and a few veggie options. but really. if you don't try the carne asada, you are just cheating yourself out of amazing. 

the service is incredible and super friendly. the older lady, who i assume is the owner and possibly a chef? came out of the kitchen to check on us, told us how they make the salsa, and then made our raspado for us. she's so sweet.

in my husband's words: we are definitely eating here again.
