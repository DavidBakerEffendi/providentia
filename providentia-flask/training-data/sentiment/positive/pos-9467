With all the Thai restaurants in Vegas, it's hard to say which one is my favorite, but Chada is definitely up there with the best for me.  Hands down it is the best looking Thai restaurant in all of Vegas, they did a fantastic job with the inside.  It has a dark, wine bar feel to it.  Red glass chandelier hanging from the top, wine covering the back wall, and another wall filled w/ framed pictures.  You will be pleasantly surprised when you walk in.

Rib eye salad appetizer is money!!  (For all of you who do not understand the urban slang "money" it means 'of unusually high quality, very good.'  For example, Kobe Bryant is money).  The whole menu actually has rib eye options if you don't want their regular beef chicken, pork or shrimp.  Bless their hearts for not putting fatty rib eye either, I gotta give them that, it's money!!

The server recommended their grilled pork dish.  Also a money dish, big pieces of sliced grilled pork over a bed of Chinese broccoli.  Not a saucy dish by any means, very simple, but very satisfying.

Last recommendation was the crab curry.  It is served with three spirals of rice noodles.  Also a money dish, the crab is not over powered by the curry.  You definitely get the essence of the crab if that is your thing.  It doesn't have that strong flavor that you are used to in other curries like panang for instance.  It's a light dish, I would share it with friends, I wouldn't make it your main entree.

The least money dish was the drunken noodles.  Typical, sweet noodley dish you can get anywhere.  I would instead try the three dishes I mentioned earlier.

Perfect example of a restaurant having a decent rating and not a lot of reviews but still being excellent (or I should say money).  Yelpers do not be fooled by the reviews, I would make this the next Thai restaurant to go to, it is a hidden gem indeed.
