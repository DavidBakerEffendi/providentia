Definitely deserves a 5 star rating! My friends and I have been coming to the Archi's Thai Cafes for a few years now and we always order BIG family style! If you're lucky to get Pete at one of the Archi's, he's a real cool guy! We used to order the Catfish Delight until Pete highly recommended the Choo Chee Catfish at #3! Soo good! The mood is right for casual dining or if you'd like to have a good quiet dinner with a special person ;) Our friend is Thai and they said it's one of the best they've ever tasted!


Our usual order looks something like this: Tom Kha soup, Choo Chee catfish, Pad Kee Maw, Lard Na, Eggplant beef, and LOTS of steamed rice! Hope you're prepared for some knockout food! Sawadee ka and bon app√©tite! (dang, three different languages?!)
