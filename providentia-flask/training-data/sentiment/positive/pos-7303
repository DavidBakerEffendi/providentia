I offered Everly as an option when my roommate's mother was in town for a place for us to have dinner together. It was great! 

We arrived and were told that it would be a 30-45 minute wait, but that we were welcome to grab a drink at the bar and eat there if a space opened up. The bar was crowded, but we found space to stand at the far end of the bar. All of the servers who had to maneuver around the area we were standing in were so polite! 

We got to the bar and decided to order a bottle of wine. We asked if we could have a sample of our top two choices before ordering a bottle and they gladly accommodated us. I have no idea how long we waited (probably close to the predicted time frame) before we were seated. The time flied as we loved perusing the menu and chatting with one another. 

Once we were seated we were met with great service. We ordered the steamed mussels and bread to start, very good! I ordered buckwheat Bolognese and I LOVED it! Highly recommend. I also tried the farro risotto and that was quite good. At the end of our meal the general manager stopped by to ensure everything had gone smoothly. A really nice touch.

The only downside is we didn't save room for dessert! I'll be back to check out more things on the menu for sure!
