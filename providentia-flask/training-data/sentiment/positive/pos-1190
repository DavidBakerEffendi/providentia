I was very impressed with how pretty and open the restaurant was. I really enjoyed bringing my out of town guest here for lunch. The food was BETTER than I expected. I would go here again. Especially for a special occasion or very nice lunch in the afternoon. There are other menu items I will return to try. 

PROS: Grilled Octopus salad
             Service
             Atmosphere

CONS: Out of the way from my side of town.
             Pricey ($55.00 for a salad, 2 iced teas and an entree)
