The parking lot is small, the restaurant d√©cor is unsightly, and the service is mediocre, but the value and the flavor of the food makes up for it!  The family and I wanted to eat Korean food and we came to visit based on my sister's recommendations.

We ordered the rice hot pot, kalbi, chicken, black noodles and red chili shrimp. Everything was so good!  Even when I knew I was full, I kept eating!  We had 5 entrees and paid with tip close to $100.  We even ended up with a doggie bag!

The next time I visit Vegas and want Korean or Hawaiian food, this is the place to go!
