Not only is the food good, the Brothers running the show are awesome! Chipotle...BYE.
At chipotle, the employees seem to have their own menu going on. Like..who's on first?? I always and all of you as well have to say "can I have a little bit more"
Not at this place. My family has had burritos and bowls, so awesome. Better yet, they have a rewards card and they are in the Entertainment book. You can order that on line. Keep up the good work!
