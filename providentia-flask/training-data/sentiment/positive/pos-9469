I am surprised that this small Filipino fast food is not included in the list here in Yelp.
Mami's Philippine cuisine is located on the second floor of the Dragon Centre at Sheppard and Brimley.
They offer combos that are affordable and well satisfying.

For a $4.99 combo you get two entrees, a cup of rice and a bottle of water. They give you a bunchful of food unlike other Filipino fast foods or restaurants that give you just a tiny piece of their food. The quality of food is superb. Try their Laing and Diniguan.  You get to choose your food and they have around 15 or maybe 20 entrees there.
So far this is my favorite Filipino food quickie here in Toronto
