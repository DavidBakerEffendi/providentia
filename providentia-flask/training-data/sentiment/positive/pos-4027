I said I'd update to 5 stars once I tried more of the menu. Glad to be keeping my word. Service: wonderful. Food: excellent. Atmosphere: comfortable and eclectic. A lovely place to come with a small group or for date night. I'm looking forward to coming back for the always impressive ramen, the seasonal, unusual ice cream flavors and sake flight. J'adore.
