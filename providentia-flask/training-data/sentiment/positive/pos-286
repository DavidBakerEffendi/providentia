Hands down the best eggs Benedict I have ever eaten.  The trio was awesome and worth every penny of $24. The turkey sausage patty was so decadent and tasty.  Not a typical sausage patty by any means.  And the smoked tomato hollandaise sauce on the crab cake Benedict was literally one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Can't believe this place only has 3.5 stars.  The food is amazing and the service was stellar.  Great food for the money!!!  

The coffee was also excellent. My wife and daughter had the pancakes and eggs, and it was by far amazing scrambled eggs with an amazing pancake. Definitely one of the many hidden gems in the Vegas world for breakfast.  This place is worth the walk from center of town. Thank you for a great meal for my family !!!!!
