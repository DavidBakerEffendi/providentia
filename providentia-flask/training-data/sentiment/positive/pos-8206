I found this place on Yelp after reading the reviews, we decided to give it a try.
(We went earlier few months ago, before they changed the name.)
But the food we had was phenomenal.  We ordered one of their combos with lobster and blue crab and shrimp, such a good deal. Other places everything is an add-on and it can get pretty pricey. Their spices and flavor is so much better then Hot & Juicy (I used to be their fan until I discovered this place across the street).  The spacing is bigger and nowhere as near crowed. I think it's because this place is a hidden gem directly across from their competition. I'm hoping to visit again soon and hopefully their food is still as great under their new name!
