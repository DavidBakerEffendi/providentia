Got my side business on Etsy started yesterday! Yay! So my husband and I went out to celebrate and decided to give Bistro 19 a try since we has heard so many great things from friends. Gotta say that everything was really good, all our food came out at the right temperature, wait staff was attentive and we didn't feel rushed. Atmosphere was romantic and trendy but remotely quite, which we definitely appreciated after a long stretch with the business. Definitely have to give them 5 stars since it all went so smooth and I truly wish I had had room for dessert. 

There was only thing however, I was disappointed in and that was their current summer menu. Many times I find summer menus to be overly saturated with "fresh" meals that are overpopulated with vegetables. That is what a salad section is for in my opinion. I wanted  to see more of a variety of meats and styles but a friend told me that their fall and winter menus usually encompasses that more. I love summer but sometimes it is my downfall :). Looking forward to going back though and seeing what they have to offer.
