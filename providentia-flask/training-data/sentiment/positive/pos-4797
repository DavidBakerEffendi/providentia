Hello Bistro, you minx, you. Always serving up scrum-diddly-umptiousness. I've been here twice before and had good experiences both times. I've had their cauliflower and broccoli grilled cheese and the Caribbean shrimp salad; both solid choices. I would love to do a milkshake here sometime. I think HB is right up there with other really good chains like Shake Shack (even though SS only has burgers). I can't cheat on Shake Shack though, they are my fav. Anyhow, this is one of the only places in Pittsburgh where you can get a freshly made salad. Kinda sad, for sure....but a dependable and honest win!
