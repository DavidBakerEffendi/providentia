I am a lover of diner food (real diner food...unless I'm in a pinch, you can keep your Waffle House). And Landmark is the real deal.

1. I've been for breakfast, dinner, and late night and the food is killer all the way around. It's not 4 diamond or anything, but that's not what this place is. As far as diner fare goes, these guys set the standard. The French toast is excellent, and their Greek selections are pretty great, too.  And the dessert case. My word, the dessert case. I ordered an eclair on a late-night dessert run and the thing came to me on a full-size dinner plate.

2. They are open until 4am. In Charlotte. No further explanation needed.

3. This place is great for people watching. Awkward teenage dates? Yep. Bikers? Of course. Little old ladies fanning themselves after church? Why not. And they are all welcomed and happily coexist at the Landmark. 

Are you still reading? Haven't lost you yet? Well, why not? Stop it! Go to the Landmark.
