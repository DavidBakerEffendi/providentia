Thai food is my favorite cuisine, and it doesn't get better than Chada.  Every meal here has been delicious - flavorful and cooked to perfection.  They also have the best (cold) spring rolls ever.  So many are bland but Chada's are my favorite.  The wine list is IMPRESSIVE too, so make sure you eat enough food ;)  

I've been to Lotus, LeThai and Pin Kaow -they are all great, but Chada is my #1 in Las Vegas.  I just wish there were more tables!
