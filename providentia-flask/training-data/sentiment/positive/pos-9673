Second only to Lotus Of Siam for Thai food in Las Vegas.  The flavors transport you into a different dimension of Thai food.  My favorites are the spring rolls, pad hed, pad kee mao and drunken noodles, but everything burst with flavor, nuance and quality fresh ingredients.  Believe the hype and the Riesling selection rocks.  Ambiance is simple but perfect for this type of dining.  Service is wonderful.  You'll love the food.
