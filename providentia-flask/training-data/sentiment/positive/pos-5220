Love love love Big Boy! Use sirloin burgers. So tasty no need for toppings. Huge servings. Awesome Greek salad. They cut the veggies and make it fresh right in front of you. One of the cooks has gotten to know us and has my husband special burger on the grill as we walk in. Reminds me of the old drive in burger joints. Great service. Has become our fav place for burgers. Fries are awesome especially the poutine.
