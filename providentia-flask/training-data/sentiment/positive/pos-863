Damn you, Maizie's... Why are you so damn delicious?!

Maizie's has become my temptress as of late, luring me out of the confines of my apartment to dine on oh-so-delicious food, and drink great local beers all while not breaking the bank. I'm honestly more than a fan of this conveniently located restaurant. Maizie's is a well-decorated and well-staffed eatery with a menu that has the ability to please almost any craving a diner could have. I've yet to have a bad experience here whether it be with the food or with the staff. Also, they have some fantastic daily specials and a happy hour (M-F / 3-6) that rivals most in the valley. 

Some of the dishes I've tried include their Wingless Buffalo Dip, Bistro Tender Steak, Pizza Burger and the Matt's Pesto Manifesto Pizza. The dip was a bit much for me due to sheer guilt, but it was exactly what you would expect it to be, and the steak sandwich was above average, but just a steak sandwich. The other items though are fan-FLIPPIN-tastic! That pesto they use hits some high marks for me, and I find myself craving it much like crack-rock when I don't have it after a while.

Every experience at Maizie's so far has been a great one for me, and I waited until many visits went by before writing this review. It's probably not for everyone, but it's one of my favorite spots for sure.
