Trinity Common is one of the more spacious restaurants in Kensington Market. There is plenty of seating which can fill up rather quickly on a Friday afternoon. The dining area is very open and the ceilings are high, allowing for a cozy atmosphere. 

The place does get quite loud and busy, but it feels more like part of the mood than it does an unwelcome disturbance. Service can be slow and inattentive as a result, so keep this in mind if hip, well trafficked bars are not for you.

Must-try items:
Fried Chicken & Waffles
Trinity Burger
Chicken Wings
Sweet Potato Chunks
St-Ambroise Cream Ale

The ambience near the front windows and bar is especially appealing for folks like myself, with a really nice view of Augusta Ave. and all the people walking by. The food took me by surprise, as it was really well done and satisfying.

There isn't anything on the drink menu under $7 except the smaller servings of wine, but the food is fairly priced and the portions are worth it. Give this place a try, you probably won't regret it.
