My daughter and I went out on A Monday night.  Not really knowing what to expect, she got a pulled chicken sandwich with fries and I ordered pork medallioms with sweet potato tots and mac n cheese.  The mac and cheese was ok..... but everything else was outstanding including the beer.  I highly recommend this place.
