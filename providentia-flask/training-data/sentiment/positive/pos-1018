So Good!  A interesting menu of about 4 pies with a Bianco, Margherita, Formaggi and Tennessee Pig.  I know they have some others but today these were available.  The Tennessee Pig peaked my interest.  It has smoked bacon and smoked Gouda cheese drizzled with Jack Daniels infused pure maple syrup and topped with walnuts and dabs of ricotta cheese.  Really enjoyed the combination of flavors.  It was a little on the sweet side but since we were sharing the size was about right.  
They have a good system and it did not take to long even thought they were busy.  Hats off to Chef Rob who was working the oven and the two associates in the truck.
