This place is where its at! For drinks, snacks, and a cozy atmosphere. 

We were there on a Monday, which happened to be ladies night. I didn't partake, but gals can get a manicure and cocktail for just $14. I'll definitely be trying that sometime in the future. There are drink specials on skinny cocktails, beer and wine all night for the girls. 

The best part was the live music. Cameron Degurski was awesome. He performed acoustic versions of everything from The Beatles to C-Lo Green, it was a perfect addition to the cozy setting. I hope he is a regular there.

Overall, this place has the best atmosphere. Comfy couches and dark wood, with an indoor-outdoor feel. This is the perfect place for drinks and snacks and relaxing, though I wouldn't go here for dinner. The food is great, but more small plates and sandwiches than actual meals, which is fitting for the lounge-type setup. Try the cheese fondue! We completely skipped the nice little fondue forks and just dunked the assorted breads and veggies straight into the cheese. It was too good for proper etiquette.

This place is the best of its breed here in Chandler.
