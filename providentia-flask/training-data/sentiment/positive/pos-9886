My friend and I stopped here after we left the Pittsburgh Irish festival. We were cold because it was 60 degrees and it had rained all day so we wanted to eat in a warm place instead of eating at the festival. I'm so glad we pulled into this place. I think they were short staffed because the waitress apologized for our wait (although it wasn't very long) and it gave use time to look over the menu. We decided to start with the calamari which was outrageously delicious. Light batter coating, fried to perfection, so good. We had both decided to get the Fish and chips.I switched out my chips for their "smashed potatoes" and my friend asked for extra coleslaw instead of french fries and we were both glad we did. The smashed potatoes were the best I have ever eaten, they were red potatoes,skin on, gently smashed that were creamy with just amount of lumpiness to have great texture and seasoned perfectly. The coleslaw was the creamy type with good favor and texture. The fried cod was in a light batter and cooked perfectly. Crunchy batter with perfectly cooked and moist on the insides. We were stuffed but the waitress told us the deserts, I had lemon sorbet, and she had the key lime pie. My friend told me that it was better than any key lime pie that she ever had in the Florida  Keys and my lemon sorbet, just delicious with tiny bits of lemon pulp in it.I just couldn't find anything to complain about except the tartar sauce was a bit drab. It was more of a dill mayo than tartar  sauce.
