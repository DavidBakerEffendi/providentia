Amazballs!!  Everything was yummo!! I hate the shrimp and it was really good cole slaw was out of this world!  Husband had the jambalaya dinner and all I can say was Wow!! Juniors bruschetta ... Try it and you tell me!!  We went @ 3 pm not realizing it just opened and Junior sat and talk with is like long time friends.  We will definitely be back!!!!  Took awhile for the food but well worth it!
