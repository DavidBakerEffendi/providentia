Wow! Great food. My wife and I went for lunch today and were very pleased with the meal. The strong but delicate flavor profiles were evident that the chef here know what (s)he is doing. 

First off, they deliver a basket of chips with home made dark chips, but wait...there's also fresh plantain chips. It  was delivered with an awesome chili flavored salsa, as well as, a borderline spicy tomatillo sauce. Both tasted great. 

I had the beef tacos of lunch. There were 3 on the plate and they are a bit on the diminutive side, but boy they pack a flavor punch. If I recall correctly, the meat was filet mignon and the sauce it was in was out of this world. It was also topped off with a smoked flavor chili pepper mayo and a fresh grilled green onion in the middle. I could eat 10 of those. 

My wife had the pork enchiladas. She begrudgingly gave me a single bite to taste as they were so good she didn't want to give em up. And I tasted why as they too were awesome. The stewed pork was very flavorful, and the sauces melded perfectly with flavor

Oh yea! Try the Sangria...it was so spectacular. Served up by the bartender Elitza. Later i watched her make a house margarita all from scratch with fresh juices and wish I had ordered one of those too. She said their margs are all hand crafted with freshly squeezed juices. She also showed us a happy hour menu that was killer and sure to bring us back in...especially for one of those margs at half price. 

Two thumbs up for this new joint!!
