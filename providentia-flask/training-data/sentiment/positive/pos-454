Love this place! I would totally expect this place on Campbell or in Old Town Scottsdale, but just West of the 51 on Shea this is a gem in front of a strip mall. Not knocking that part of town, just saying that this place doesn't fit in! That's a good thing. Awesome atmosphere without the pretentious Scottsdale crowd! Sorry Scottsdale. Hell I'm probably pissing everyone off with this review. 

32 Shea has a great intimate feeling with a great shaded patio and smaller indoor dinning area. Had the perfect burrito coupled with the best Mocha Latte ever! This place has great service as well! Give this place a try, just look for the one place that's not like the others on the corner of 32nd St. and Shea!!
