Have you ever just gotten a good feeling about a restaurant? Even before you walk in?
That's how Joe's Midnight Run felt, when we pulled up we knew something good was cooking because we could smell it and we could see it - the staff was hauling piles of wood to the kitchen with 90's hip hop music blasting and a huge pink "Break dance" sign at the entrance. While the kitchen does not have a smoker, it does have a wood stove and stacks on stacks of of mini cast irons piled high. We were SO excited to order.
We came here for brunch and ordered the Chilaqueles and Notorious B.I.G. Burger. When our orders came out, both of our jaws dropped. The Notorious B.I.G. Burger is the most appropriate name for that burger-  HOLY MOLY the patty was a delicious concoction of beef and pork that mixed together with the coleslaw and chicharrones perfectly! And it was BIG. I'd never had Chilaqueles before, but it had nice Southwest flavors, too, and the steak paired well with the toasted tortillas and egg.
And while the food kicked butt, so did the atmosphere. I couldn't help but sing/rap to hip hop songs playing on the speakers or watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective on the TV. Needless to say, I felt right at home. I can't wait to go back.
