Nice place in the Summerlin area. I had the Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese Platter, Sausage Platter, Albondigas (Ground beef meatballs served in a spicy tomato sauce), Papas Bravas (Gold potatoes roasted and saut√©ed, served with a spicy sauce) and the Mallorcan Soup. Everything was excellent save for the Albondigas which were pretty bland. I also had a Fat Tire draft beer for $4, I believe it was a 12 oz pour but I could be wrong about that. You can also find coupons on restaurant.com for this place if you're looking to save money.
