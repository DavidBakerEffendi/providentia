Nice cocktails, great food, reasonable cost for quality, good intimate atmosphere, friendly servers.

I was feeling good after the USA Hockey triumph over Canada at the 2013 World Junior Tournament, so I honored out "neighbours to the North" with my selection of the Maple Leaf cocktail and the Maple Leaf farms duck breast. I don't care for Brussels sprouts, and I substituted baby carrots.

First, the cocktail: Knob Creek Bourbon, maple syrup, lemon wedge. I'm not sure the ratio of maple syrup, but it wasn't too sweet. There was enough syrup to get that maple flavor, especially toward the end of the drink. 

We also had some calamari, and the remoulade was a highlight. The breading was light and the firmness of the calamari was just right. Wedding soup was on special. I would have liked some parmesan on top in retrospect. It wasn't offered, but I also didn't ask.

The duck was cooked to good temperature and the skin was not too chewy or tough as I've experienced in a few other places.

I look forward to another visit next time I'm in town.
