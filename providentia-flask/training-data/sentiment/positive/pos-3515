Finally there's a Bamboo Garden in Charlotte and I don't have to the Triangle any more!!
Tried this place yesterday for lunch. The food is just as good if not better than the other location. They have really good lunch specials. I had the chicken manchurian with chicken fried rice and Hakka noodles. Lunch specials come with a spring roll, soup and kimchi. My husband had the garlic paneer. I also ordered a mango mojito (non-alcoholic) and we shared the darsaan dessert (fried noodles with sesame and honey and vanilla ice cream. I wasn't too crazy about the drink but everything else was top notch! The drinks looked phenomenal but since we went here for lunch during work hours, I decided to pass on the alcohol. But I will be having some tonight if we go again. The other location has crispy chili baby corn which I didn't think to look up but if you see it on the mit's a must-have. 
Our food arrived in a timely manner and was very well presented. Service was great and the decor is very tastefully done. They have ample parking. 
I am SO stoked to see this place finally open (the signs have been up since summer). Can't wait to go here again this weekend. Maybe I'll make this a weekly thing?
