Wow. I'm surprised at the negative comments on the service. Every time I go, they ask me how my son is doing. That's a nice touch. These girls work hard and don't sleep much. One tip: some of them put less butter on my bagels than others. So, if you're not familiar with them, ask for extra butter. The sandwiches are mean (that's meant in a good way). The prices are good for everything. Yeah, the lines are long, but that's always a positive sign. I'm from NY, and every single time I introduce this place to family, they rave about it.
