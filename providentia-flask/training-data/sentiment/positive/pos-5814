Short and sweet, like my visit this week. I'm giving them full marks on the following grounds:

a) Such a breath of fresh air in the longbranch community, this is the new wave that is coming so get used to it stodgy old business owners afraid of change. the young, ambitious business owners are coming with their sustainable, hip, cool ideas.

b) Their location is a tad hidden but a total score once you find it. Very well designed inside with a massive menu which includes smoothies, cold press juices and many other delicious noms - all good for you. I had the Piña, which was kinda like a Piña Colada except healthy and with lots of spinach in it. YUM!

c) Price point is right on par with similar businesses such as Booster Juice who claim to be as healthy but substitute concentrated fruit juices in for real fruit!

The FIX and Co is exactly that, my healthy breath of fresh air fix in an otherwise slowly changing longbranch. Check them out, just north of Lakeshore on 30th!

Eatcrest Out!
