Everything about this place was great. The view, the food, the drinks -- everything about Fishbone was perfect. I would be weary about the bees though, they do tend to fly around the delicious food. ;) 

The Ahi Tuna is a good appetizer to start. It opens the palate for everything that you're about to experience so it's a definitely must order. The bolognese was also a favourite of mine and I would definitely order it again. 

The pink mojito was also a really good choice as it was the perfect summer drink. :) 

This place is only open for the summer and it does tend to be a popular place. I can definitely see why because everything was amazing. Do note that they only take reservations for groups of 8 or more. So we went a litter later (2PM) just so we wouldn't have to wait but it definitely would have been worth it if we had to. 

I'm definitely returning this upcoming summer for another taste test!
