I love this store and could spend hours in here (actually, I think I have). Just as you would expect in Madison, this store touts liberal reading galore. I love that when you walk in you are met with a table of books preaching feminism, empowering our kids, and stories of influential people throughout history. This store has a decent sized kids section, and I often see parents there with kids reading to them. 
It is set up well, easy to navigate, and the staff is knowledgeable. If I need a gift for someone but I'm clueless, this is a great place to look around. If I'm bored and just want to get out of the house, this is great for that too.
I love that we still have a local bookstore in town. Although prices in Amazon might be cheaper, I don't mind paying a little more to support a small business in the local community.
