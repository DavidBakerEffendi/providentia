Ate here last night for dinner for the first time, and was very happy with everything. It wasn't that busy and it was a Monday night. From what I read the place can get packed and maybe even a little too cramped, so I would suggest trying it out during the week.

The turkey meatballs are very delicious.  For entree I got the chicken breast with Mac and cheese. It was really good, but the mac and cheese it came with was to die for! My boyfriend got the halibut special and a side of asparagus, and he was very pleased. Dessert we got bread pudding and added a scoop if ice cream since it only comes with whip, and we also got the night cap drink (which was very strong, but quite yummy). I was so full by the time we left I couldn't stand it, but so worth it. We were quite happy with everything we were served.

Service was flawless, and atmosphere very quaint and pretty. It can get a little spendy in regards to prices. I would compare it to Yard house pricing. I wanted to try somewhere new and I am glad we did. The menu is somewhat small, but you're sure to find something you'll love.
