Best Fried Chicken in all of Summerlin!!!!! May not be the best title, but it's worth something. You have to order the thighs lightly seasoned and you will not be disappointed. I'm not sure why they even produce tenders since Raising Cane is King in that category but this is what happens when you play to the crowd. I wish they were available via drive thru, but I guess classiness is essential for them. I'm not overly excited about the sauce other than it's a nice option to cut the greasiness. Overall, a nice beer and guilty pleasure of fried chicken is good for the soul here. Just don't share that with your cardiologist.
