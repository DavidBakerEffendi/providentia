I've been to the Bellagio buffet a couple of times. It was my favorite...until the Wynn buffet opened. There was sooooooooo much food and it was all good! I LOVE buffets and I ate a ton of food. Whatever I wanted, they had.

I plan to return to the Bellagio buffet someday. I'll update my review afterward. (Overall grade: A) 

BEST buffets:  (1) Wynn, and (2) Bellagio
