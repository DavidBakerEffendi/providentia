THE BEST Chinese in Scottsdale and Phoenix!!! Cold jellyfish salad, anything with crab, and the sharkfin soup are all 5 star dishes. If you're lucky they'll have the abalone available, its amazing.

The atmosphere is dry and boring, the service is distant and cold, but this about food and the food only. Go!!!
