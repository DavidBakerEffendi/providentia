I have been here many times for a light but hearty dinner. My go-to soup is the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque. I love the biscuit served as a side with all the soups - it is always served warm, buttery and flaky. 

There is an option to eat inside the restaurant. The back of Ravi Soups has a large wooden table with newspapers for patrons. It can be a casual place to catch up with friends while you enjoy your soup.

I would not worry about the portion sizes not being adequate for dinner. The soups are large and the biscuit is filling. If you are worried about being full, I recommend ordering one of the wraps with the soup.
