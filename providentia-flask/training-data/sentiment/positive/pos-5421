"$1.50 cheaper per dozen for the same exact cookies you could buy at the NY Bakery next to Brunk's Auction on Grand Avenue on the West side.  Excellent cookies, excellent service.  I will be returning here!  Yes, I will.  I need a little more cellulite on my thighs I guess...

PLUS, last time I was there with my son--who someday will be getting married (fingers crossed)--I looked at cakes in general.  Their prices for the same wonderful tasting cakes you get anywhere is sooooo much cheaper it was surprising.  

If I need anything from a cake to cookies, this is the place I am getting it from.
