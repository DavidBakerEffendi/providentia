I love this place. We order food their pretty consistently. I prefer the take- out experience over the dine in experience. Yummy Thai food! I want more of that coconut water. Pad se ew and Pad thai are mine and my husbands favorite dishes! I also like their tofu.They also have quick delivery and great customer service
