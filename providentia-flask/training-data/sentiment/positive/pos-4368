This place is the BOMB! Simple 3-item menu makes ordering easy! And if you bring one other person you can try all three items! The namesake baos were actually not our favourite, I think because we are so used to pan fried dumplings, these ones seemed a bit more dense, especially the bottom layer crust is thicker than we're used to. 
But the wonton soup was amazing! Unlike any other I've had before! Like other reviews mention, the broth is unique and aromatic with the addition of dried garlic and garlic and sesame oils, it's food that really warms the soul. 
And the noodles!!! I could eat a whole bowl by myself! Simple, yet packed full of flavour and also scallion oil and dried pieces that make the flavour pop! And the peanuts add a pleasant crunch! 
For sure if in the area again will go back, every item on the menu is less than $8!
