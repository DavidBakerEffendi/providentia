What an amazing little place! Typically I go to the coffee cup but since today was Easter they were closed so I decided to try this place out and I am so glad that I did. Their corned beef and hash was the best I have ever tasted and their country fried steak was amazing too. Service here was by far superb! I will definitely be coming back here all the time!
