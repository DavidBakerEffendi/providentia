I love Blue Ginger. I've been a loyal customer for over a year. My favorite menu item is Sashimi regular. The fish is always fresh and the portions are always large! Their sushi rolls and fried rice is also yummy! If you'd like to visit Blue Ginger for lunch, you're in luck! They have lunch specials that are cheaper and more tasty than all the competition in the area. If you're in the area and craving sushi stop by Blue Ginger. Your taste buds will thank you!!
