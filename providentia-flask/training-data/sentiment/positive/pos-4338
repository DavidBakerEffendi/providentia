Absolutely hands down, my most favorite Chinese restaurant in the world. Well, in the USA that I have been to. The squid and leeks in black bean sauce, the fried oysters in xoxo sauce, the crab kalhoon style, and several other dishes are so good. the Hot and sour soup is done perfectly and served at a perfect temperature. Their egg drop soup is also very very good. 

It is authentic Chinese food and they have several fresh seafood options coming directly from several tanks right in front of you. Great prices, and one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix area altogether. Recently moved from Phoenix to Oakland area of California. Wish I could have brought my Nee House.
