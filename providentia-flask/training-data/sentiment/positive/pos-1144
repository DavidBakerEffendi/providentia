My old man and I would always come here before or after shopping at the Market. The only thing that I would eat as a youngster was the hummus. The hummus is better than any of the homemade hummus that my Arab friends Mom's make. An order is around $5 w/ a few slices of fresh pita. Everything that I ate at Nate's has been good. As someone already mentioned, bring cash, no credit cards accepted.
