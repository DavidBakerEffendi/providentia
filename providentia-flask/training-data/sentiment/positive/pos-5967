Great new location! Bigger than the other Phoenix locations. As friendly as the others and same fresh delicious food. 

Greek pita with caramelized onions and a side salad is my favorite for lunch or dinner.

The fact that they have wine only endears it to my heart more. 

Keep up the great work Zoe's.
