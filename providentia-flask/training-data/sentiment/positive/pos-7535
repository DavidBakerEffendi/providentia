Huge restaurant with long lineups, but the food is worth the wait! 

The deep fried turnip patties are incredibly tasty-crispy with just the right amount of salty, spicy, and sweet. The Stir-fried seafood with Chinese broccoli was surprisingly good-- large pieces of juicy shrimp, scallop and squid. The fried rice noodle with egg and shrimp was mouthwatering thanks to the generous portion of eggy sauce. The sweet and sour fish was on point, too--multiple fillets of crispy, deep-fried fish served with the classic sauce. 

Yum.
