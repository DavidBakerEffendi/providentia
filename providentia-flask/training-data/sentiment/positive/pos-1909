Inhaled my first Jimmy John's sub this past Wednesday and not only did it taste great but the price point was lower than any sandwich in Downtown. 

I opted for the tuna, added cheese for 75 cents and *still* escaped having paid about $5.50 for an 8-inch sandwich. Great value.

What I like best about Jimmy John's is the bread. Growing up in Minnesota my favorite sandwich shop was a place called Erbert and Gerbert's and Jimmy John's bread is almost an exact match. In fact, their subs are a perfect hybrid of E&G and Cousins.

Beyond the tasty sandwich I thought the staff was incredibly friendly and the music was surprisingly bangin'. Might have been Taylor Dayne on the stereo, I can't quite recall. Seating inside the shop is a little tight but if you head outside you can chill out with Five Guys Burgers & Fries patrons and enjoy the hustle and bustle of Washington Street.
