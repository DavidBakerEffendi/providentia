Holy Moly, now that was some good stuff!!  Checked this placed out because of all the awesome reviews.  And it exceeded what we "thought" might be good.

Thai Tea - on point
Crying Tiger Salad - WoAh!  Excellent!  I know you're probably asking, how can a salad be that awesome?  Well, try it and you'll see...ask for some water because you're going to need it.  SPICY!
Massaman Curry w/chicken - a bit sweet for me but still decent (never had it before either).
Beef Rice Noodles Soup "PHO" - I requested bok choy be added to the soup.  Owner, David added it with no problem.  Nummy num.
Gyoza - yummy
Tempura Cheesecake with an order of Fried Ice Cream!!  Yikes!  I think I felt my thighs expanding as I gobbled those down.

All in all this was an excellent choice for our dinner night out and well worth the drive.  We came from Nellis AFB which is on the north end.  It took us about 25 minutes to get there.

We'll be back again!
