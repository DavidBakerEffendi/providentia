So it's 2am, you're hungry, and liquored up...Where to go? Happy dog it is! 
I've been here on many occasions that dealt with the scenario above. But don't get me wrong, it's always the happy choice! I don't know if it's knowing that you can get a delicious hot dog creation 2 in the morning or you're just happy to have some food in your stomach after a night of drinking; but this place is DAMNED good! 

So you start off by taking a Happy Dog scantron sheet and fill in the circles (yes I order like I'm taking the SATs) with any of the 50 toppings you want on your $5 hot dog (I suggest getting the sunny side up fired egg). If it's your first time here, you might want to fill in as many circles as you can, but don't over do it, otherwise you'll be left with a messy gulp on top of your dog with confusing flavors! You then flip the scantron over and definitely fill in the circle that says "Tatter Tots", trust me you want this. Don't forget to pick your sauces; beware that the Monocho's habanero sauce is pretty damn spicy. 

Once your creation arrives (along with your tots), dig in and enjoy it with fork and knife! If it doesn't taste good, blame yourself for being too greedy on the toppings and cut back next time!

Oh yeah, there's a great selection of beer as well. From local brews to micro brews all over the country. I usually wash down the dog with a glass of LH milk stout :)
