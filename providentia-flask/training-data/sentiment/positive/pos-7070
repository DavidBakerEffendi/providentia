Food was great. Most importantly, quality of service was amazing. Kaley, our server was super attentive, great personality, not just to us but every table she was serving. Our drinks were refilled and never saw the bottom of the glass. She made sure our order of food was to our satisfaction. Checked on our table periodically. Great service!!! Ask for kaley when you go there.
