The staff today get a 5 star for their service.  There was some complications in the kitchen with our order which delayed our food and timing of all the entrees arriving at the same time.  The waiter and manager personally apologized and then comped our children's meals.  I felt like they truly wanted to make sure we still had a great visit and would not hinder our return.  Well done and noted!
Our family's visit today was great and the ice cream at the end was delicious!
