Fantastic!

Tucked away - it's tough to just randomly wander into unless you know it's there.

ATMOSPHERE: Quiet, quaint, and lovely. Ideal place for a romantic meal, or ladies brunch.

SERVICE: Very chill, and friendly. Some may think they're not fast. But I like to come here to slow down and enjoy my meal and slower pace anyway.

PRICE: Very reasonable. 

FOOD: Delish! I came here for dinner. Appetizer, entree and dessert - all were perfect. Knowing that this place is famous for breakfast - I was not expecting as good food for dinner. But I was proven wrong, and food was great!

Can't wait to come back for their famous breakfast and brunch!
