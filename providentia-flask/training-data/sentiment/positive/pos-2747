Great food! Great atmosphere! Very clean! Everyone should stop in. I highly recommend this place! We had the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer (Best). Shared the Chicken Avocado club (Fantastic). And the kids had steak bites and grilled cheese sandwich.  Both kids had a side of strawberries (a large bowl in you). Evenly price and definitely filling. TV ' S everywhere and an extremely clean restroom! MUST visit!
