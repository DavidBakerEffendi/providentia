Have to give this place 5 stars. My husband and I went bike riding this morning along the green belt and it is our ritual to stop for coffee. We chose Coffee Bean this morning. The place is very nicely presented and clean. The staff are friendly and very kind. I say very kind because my husband and I both thought that the other had brought money. No so. lol. We managed to find some change floating around but were 20 cents short. They gave us coffee anyway. So 5 stars for sure!
