All I can say is this place is Exceptional!!! The best customer service my fiance and I have ever had in this town! Staff is very friendly and attentive. The smell when you pull up to this restaurant is AMAZING!! The food is fantastic! We couldn't ask for a better experience! We had the steak and shrimp fajitas and the steak is so tender, definitely not tough to eat and the shrimp was also great. My daughter got a vegetarian enchilada plate and she loved it!!!  We give Juan's Flaming Fajitas 5 stars in quality of food, customer service and just being super awesome! All of you rock!!!!
