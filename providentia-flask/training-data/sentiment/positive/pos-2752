5 Stars for "Old School"   Americanized Chinese food, in an authentic  funky retro Chinese restaurant environment.  Fresh, flavorful, and priced right.  

My husband and I were sans children, and wanted something close to home, but different than our usual haunts.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Dragon Palace a try.  

What a great find!  I have seen this place before, when at the Quiltz shop at the end of the little strip center.  I am glad to try any hole in the wall or oddball place, but having had too much bad Chinese in the past, will usually not try one unless it comes with a recommendation by someone.  

Hot tea and ice water arrived immediately.  We ordered 2 Dragon Dinner Specials- I the Almond Chicken, my husband the Mongolian Beef.  Evil, delicious little crunchy fried wonton strips showed up after we placed the order.

The Wor-Wonton soup arrived first- hot, and delicious. Beautiful clean shrimp were so flavorful, and the veggies and wontons were perfect.  

The eggrolls were crisp and fresh.  The chicken drumette was crisp and flavorful. 

Our entrees were so good, reminding me of the old fashioned Chinese restaurants I went to with my parents in late 60's-early 70's.  (Anyone remember Toy's Shangri La??)     

Service was pleasant and non-obtrusive.

Here's an observation I made:  there was NO HINT of anything that had been frozen and added back into any dish.  I hate it when places do this!

The only downside was that we got NO banana wonton desserts!  I think it was because we arrived around 8:15 and they closed at 9, and were closing up the kitchen.  Now we HAVE to go back so we can try some other entrees and those little sweet morsels.
