This review is for the casino service and casino because we did not stay at the hotel. We definitely favored gambling at the Venetian! It was clean, bright, and last but not least, had SUPERB service for cocktails. We sat down at a slot and had servers come around at least every 10 minutes. They were all very nice! We definitely will stay at the hotel due to the service we received on the casino floor level!
