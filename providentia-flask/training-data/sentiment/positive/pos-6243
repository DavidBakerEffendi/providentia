Changing my previous 4 stars to 5. This place is just unbeatable. I've tried brickx, pizza fusion, and others. No one makes pizza like these guys. My typical order is garlic knots (awesome), Greek salad, (awesome), specialty pizza, (BBQ and pepperoni supreme are redic), and a local tap while we wait. This is a once a month treat where I go crazy at the public market. There's no other organic pizza place like pure pizza.
