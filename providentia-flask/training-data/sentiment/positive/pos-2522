BEST burritos EVER!!!! Tried this place one day and haven't been able to stop going, I'm addicted!!! Everything is taste so fresh and their watermelon juice is amazing!! Nothing bad to say about this place at all from the customer services to the food no where compares. I actually have everyone in my office hooked on this place as well. I swear they recognize us when we come thru the drive thru because we eat here so much... it's almost embarrassing lol Thanks Super B's We love you! :-)
