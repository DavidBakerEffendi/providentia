As a Coronado resident, I appreciate how this renewed space treats its neighbors: free cup of coffee. (They couponed my door earlier this week.)

Today, though, I paid for my scone and macchiato since I'd left the coupon at home. Totally worth it. The espresso is up there with Giant. And the dark chocolate and cherry scone was appropriately sized, not a big box bakery Goliath. Perhaps too much raw sugar on top. I brushed a bit off. 

The space offers a better feel than Coronado Cafe and Urban Vine (terrible name) did. Decor is Lux meets Cartel,  and the wood floor homifies it warmly. 

Though no demitasse cups yet, the super-friendly and accommodating barista offered me the macchiato in a tiny glass jar. Worked for me. 

$2 off signature cocktails during happy hour. A very intriguing lunch and dinner menu with nearly all entries vegan. Can't wait to go for weekend breakfast. 

Welcome to the neighborhood. 

UPDATE: Finally had lunch here. Just awesome. The server brought us some gratis potato tacos. Savory and delicious, but the double corn tortilla likely unnecessary. One will do. 

I had the Monte Vista torta and the standout components were the salty zucchini and buoyant focaccia. A bit pricey at $11 but a solid lunch. 

We had the back room for five of us. A bit echoey but cozy and private. 

Can't wait to try the cocktails.
