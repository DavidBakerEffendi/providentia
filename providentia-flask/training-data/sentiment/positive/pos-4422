Haven't been here in at least 10 years. Crazy I know.

When a friend who was coming into town suggested to meet up here, I was abit giddy. Yes, I love dessert that much.

We were seated promptly. Since it was mid afternoon, it wasn't very busy, just steady with customers.

Our waitress was very bubbly and sweet. We Ordered some wine and dessert, since it was that awkward time of day, after lunch and way too early for dinner. Mid afternoon snack is what we will call it.

Order wine, 1 turtle cheesecake and my friend ordered a raspberry delight? I think that is what it was called? Do note, we ordered a piece each, not a whole cake. Lol. The turtle dessert was amazing. So creamy and rich. The portions are big. I could have ate the whole cake if they put it in front of me....tempting! My friend raved about her dessert, but didnt offer me any so can't state how it was. It looked really good. Wine was good, your typical house wine.

A small group of 5 were seated next to us and they were telling us how great their weekend brunch was. That we needed to check it out since it was fabulous. Everything from your typical brunch food to things like butter chicken? Since I love Indian food and breakfast, I know I will need to check this out. It's now on my radar for brunch very soon.

Service was excellent. Dessert was fabulous. Reasonably priced.

Will be back to try the brunch that I received rave reviews about.
