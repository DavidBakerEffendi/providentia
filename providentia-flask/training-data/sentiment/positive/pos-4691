I am a HUGE foodie. I love foods of all cultures and I loving finding new gems and trying out different places. I actually found Woodland's through a coworker. She would frequent Woodland's for lunch and I tagged along for what would be one of the best life decisions ever. I've been back close to 10 times and they are CONSISTENTLY amazing! I've gone several times for the lunch special, which comes with 2 curries, samosas, naan and some sort of dessert. It's about $9 and TOTALLY worth it. I've also   been to the lunch buffet about 4 times! It's SO MUCH food for both the lunch special and buffet and I honestly, can't believe I'm saying this, DO NOT MISS THE MEAT! The buffet is constantly changing but there are always a variety of curry, soup and some sort of dessert, among other amazing yummies. If it's your first time, I recommend trying the buffet. It is only on the weekends and for about $11. You'll get to try a variety of food and you'll definitely find something you love!
