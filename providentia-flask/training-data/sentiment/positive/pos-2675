A place to be well dressed and meet with a business associate or the like. The steak and all sides are delicious but fair warning- they WILL continuously refill your complimentary garlic bread basket so you should come in with the strong will to say no more. Otherwise you end up like me and nibble on your steak because you have destroyed 2 bread baskets singlehandedly.

Look out for their twice baked potato that comes with a man and a tray with all of your potato dream garnishes to follow. 

P.s I hear they make a killer banana foster

EDIT: They DO make a mouthwatering, drool worthy Banana Foster
