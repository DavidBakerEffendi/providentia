So, we had a not so great experience here earlier this year, and when I posted my not so good review, I received a message from Michael Lawson, the General Manager of The Thumb, asking me to please give him and the restaurant a chance for a do-over - which we were able to do last week during a pop-in lunch while visiting our childhood "home" - AZ.  

Words can't fully expresses how impressed I am by Michael's passion and respect for his staff and restaurant, and the value he places on satisfying his customers.  This level of excellence is far too rare in the service industry today, and I commend him for his outreach and professionalism.  

Our meal, the service, the genuine care shown to us (my wife, son, daughter-in-law, and grandkids) by the staff was, across the board, exceptional.  

We had a full rack of ribs, a pulled chicken sand, pork sliders, chile, BBQ tacos, soft drinks and beers, and several orders of fries.

Perfectly prepared, promptly served, and as we had children with us, very very kid "smart."

We will be back and I highly recommend that if you love BBQ, love good food, that you and yours visit The Thumb at your earliest opportunity,

Puns be darned... The Thumb gets enthusiastic THUMBS UP!

Thank you Michael.
