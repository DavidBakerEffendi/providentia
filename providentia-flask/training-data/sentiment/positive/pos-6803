I'm sorry, but I liked this place.  Maybe it's because I came here to drink, not eat.  That's what a bar is for, at least it is to me.  If you wanted food, maybe you should have stayed downstairs, jus' sayin'.

This is a great little place up in here.  Yes, I do mean up in here, you need to go upstairs, hence the name.  To me, it seems to be a perfect space for a bar, and they used the space the best they could.  The bar is perfect, enough seats for any bar dweller that enters.  A couple of high tops complete that area.  A few steps (up, that is) to the left as you enter is another area for seating, this area also houses the two dart boards.

When I was here, the place was kind of dead, perfect for a low key night when all you want to do is get a drink and stare at whatever they chose to be on the TV.  The bartender was polite and on top of her game.  She never missed a beat when a patron asked for a drink.  I also found that the other bar goers were just as nice as someone you bump into on the street.  Ironically my friend and I struck up a conversation with two people we bumped into outside.  There appears to be no judgments being made here.

Drink specials every night of the week, and they are open every night of the week.  Credit cards accepted.  Six packs to go.  And the most awesome thing to me, they will put together a 'Mystery Craft Sixer' for you to take for an extremely reasonable price.
