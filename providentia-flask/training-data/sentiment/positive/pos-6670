I stopped in for lunch today, drawn in finally by the sidewalk sandwich board that I always walk past. Today the board advertised a turkey on baguette special of the day. 

The bread was delicious and in and of itself added a lot of value to the sandwich. It had a thin, but crispy crust covering a nice thick layer of bread. Between the baguette was turkey, smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and a nicely chosen ingredient - cream cheese.

The pastries in the case all looked overwhelmingly delicious. I've previously tried the pecan bar. It was gooey, delicious and the portion was generous.  

The interior is comfortable. There's a small seating area on the main level. On the lower level, with access to the Huntington Building, there's a fireplace, tables and a window high top table. It's very nice to have another downtown spot to use as a work space away from home - especially one that is not just open on weekdays.
