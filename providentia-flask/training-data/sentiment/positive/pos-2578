After my first good experience, I've been back at least 5 times.  Each time, the food has been awesome.  The Friday special 'goat curry' is great, and the saturday special beef stew is also great.  The rice and naan are always perfect, and the condiment they bring out with the papadums ( a ginger based pickle) is fabulous.  

The service one night was laughably bad - really, really bad, and other nights, not perfect. But - the atmosphere, decor, and FOOD make it a real discovery.
