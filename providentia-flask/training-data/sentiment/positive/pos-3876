Love coming to place during happy hour and getting oysters.  We come in enough that the owner knows my son always wants them on the halfshell.  House sauce is what we always go with.  Very tasty.  Didn't really like the elote fritters.  Too much bread for me but soft shell crab basket is good.  Sweet potatoes fries are on point.  Live crawfish depends on whether they are in season or not.  I prefer the Louisiana over the Sacramento ones.  Service is good.  Love coming here.   Not sure why hot & juicy felt threatened enough to mess with this small biz and make them change their name.  There must be a reason!  Maybe because their food is that good!!
