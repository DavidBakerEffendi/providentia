I remember my parents talking about this place when I was little. I also remember it was out in the middle of nowhere. 

Well now that Vegas has expanded, I live my adult life fairly close to Bob Taylor's. And my husband took me there on a date recently and I was NOT disappointed. We went a little early in the day so the prime rib wasn't ready yet, but the pork chop was perfect and the ribeye was amazing and the chicken wings were crispy and flavorful. They make an awesome old fashion and are one of the only supper clubs that I know of in town. 

The service is great, attentive friendly staff, we were taken care of from the moment we arrived. We will definitely go back and make our way through the menu!
