I don't know why I waited so long to try Avenue B. It's a shame that I spent such a large portion of my time in Pittsburgh without ever eating there. Anyway, I have now seen the light and fallen in love with Avenue B (on Valentine's Day!)

Why do I like Avenue B? The ambiance is great, the servers are on point, it's clean, and of course, THE FOOD. 

We had:
-A lobster bisque which was unique and very flavorful. It did not have lobster pieces in it, but it did have very delicious roasted cauliflower.
-Crispy oysters with two amazing sauces. The only issue I had was that there were three pieces (maybe with multiple oysters) and the cost was $13. It was a great dish and I'm glad I ordered it, but I don't know if I believe it should have been more than $8. 
-Grilled swordfish that was also very unique and had distinctive curry flavors that were not overwhelming. 
-Dayboat scallops and shrimp in a chowder. Holy moly these were phenomenal. My boyfriend and I always split and try each other's food and I seriously did not want to give this one up. It took all of my will to not devour the entire plate. Please go to Avenue B and order it. Please.
-Croissant Bread pudding with buttered popcorn ice cream. The bread pudding was good but the ice cream was way better.
-Chocolate sea salt caramel bar. I'm still having fantasies about eating it. It was a combination of a candy bar and brownie and it also came with an interesting olive oil ice cream and a side of marmalade. 



It's also BYOB so bring a bottle of wine when you go. And go ASAP.
