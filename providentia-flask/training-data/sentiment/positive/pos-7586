This one was easy. Five star, hands down. I just had one of the best meals in Vegas. The Ahi (ask for nearly raw), on a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes, drizzle of some amazing unctuous glaze that made me want to lick the plate, topped with the most spicy pea shoots - nice spicy counterpoint to the variety of flavors and textures underneath. Absolutely incredible. Wouldn't change a thing, and I need to return soon for a repeat. Service was fantastic. I hear the lobster mac'n'cheese was to die for. It looked very rich and like something you may want to share - it was huge. Don't miss the angel fluff tater tots. They're like nothing you've ever had. And hello, tomato jam? Oh yeah.

I love giving 5 stars when its embarrassingly amazing.
