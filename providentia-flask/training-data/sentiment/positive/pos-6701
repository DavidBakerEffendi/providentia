5 stars for a fast food burger joint? Yep!

I've been a big fan of this chain for years and was thrilled Vegas had them when I moved here from Cali. Was never lucky enough to have one anywhere near where I lived so this is extra exciting because it's a 5 min drive from my house now! It's so pretty and new now and I hope that lasts for a long time. 

The menu is simple and and I love their cheeseburger with grilled onions and ketchup & mustard instead of the house sauce. Fries are good but eat them quickly because they don't taste great after they've cooled. Also love their strawberry shake! 

You can customize to your liking and everyone is nice about it. Sometimes they're so nice (especially the drive thru girls) that it forces me to perk up after a shitty day. Hands down one of the best fast food chains out there!
