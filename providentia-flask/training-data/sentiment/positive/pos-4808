Been to fuku burger at least 4 times now and it should show you how much I really enjoy eating here. The burger is very unique incorporating Asian flavors. The patty is seasoned very well and everything blend well together. I have not been disappointed with their food and service. I will try to eat everything off their menu. 
Another was their fries with their speciality sauce and gravy. I like to ask them to have the sauces on the sides separately so I can dip the fries into them, but it usually comes to you with the fries covered in the sauces. 
Another thing I like is how they ask for a nickname to call you when your order is ready. So try to come up with a funny and cool name!
