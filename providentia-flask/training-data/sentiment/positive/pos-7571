Fox restaurants typically are delicious, but people like myself and other Yelpers are weary of chain restaurants and although this is the only arrogant butcher and not a chain like Sauce or True Food its easy to lump it together into a "chain restaurant motif" being a Fox restaurant.  Fact of the matter is that's not fair, this unlike a quick in and out concept like Sauce, its a sit down restaurant that turns out to be excellent.   I've read reviews where people were disappointed with the quality, I think those people just drove out of there way maybe living in the west valley or something and amp'ed it up too highly, kinda like when you see a movie and it sucks then its better the next time.  Either way I've been here 3 times and every time had a delicious meal every time.  One thing that's really cool about this restaurant is that they give you an "antipasto" menu that looks like a sushi bar menu (single sheet of papter you can mark on with a pencil) full of various cheeses, meats and extras (grilled asparagus, olives, elephant garlic, $1 mussels, etc.) this allows you to get your appetizers going right away.  Whats great about this is not only the concept but the meats and cheeses are high quality and come with bread and jam that's honestly to die for, so delicious!  I could go for the antipasto menu alone.  To eat I've tried the turkey sloppy joe, which sounds dumb, in defense of the sandwich first off it was lunch and it came with a grilled poblano chili on top, it was amazing.  I've also for dinner tried the sweet baked potato tortellini (excellent) and my favorite thing so far which I will re order is the beef short rib stew with green chiles, fried egg, cornbread.  The flavor with the egg is mindbogglingly awesome and the cornbread is fresh, moist and delicious.  I've never had a bad meal and/or experience here, after here (as far as other bars @ citiscape) is a different story because I have an alcohol problem :)
