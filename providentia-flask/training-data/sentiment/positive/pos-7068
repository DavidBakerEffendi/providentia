I am not a breakfast person at all. So for me to be raving about breakfast is a funny. My sister took me here cause they loved it. It is by far the best place in Phoenix to have breakfast. The biscuits and gravy was out of this world and the cinnamon french toast was heavenly. It's a little hard to find. Once you find the farm you have to travel down the long dirt driveway to get to the cafe (to find no parking). Just park out front and take the nice walk through the beautiful farm on the way in. It's worth it!
