Delicious! Met an old friend for lunch and we both ordered from the special lunch menu. I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai (sp?) spicy. It was SO good! The sweet and sour soup was just ok. Service was excellent, prompt and friendly. Interior was nicely decorated and clean. Need to return with my hubby and the kids.
