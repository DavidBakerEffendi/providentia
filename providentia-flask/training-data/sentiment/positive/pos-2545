I was so happy to find this place! They have The same hot dogs I grew up with in New York. And the atmosphere is great. The staff was friendly and my hot dog was delicious. We also got tots and fries and both were crispy and yummy. Parking was a bit hard once it was busy but if you come on an off hour there's tons of parking.
