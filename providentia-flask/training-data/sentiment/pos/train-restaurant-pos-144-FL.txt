FOODIES Come one come all This place has such a great modern industrial feel inside I love that you can enjoy your food at a table with friends and family or all gather on the couches eat your food and play some board games

The service was great you find your own seat and when you are ready to order you make your way up to the register Youre given a number and the food comes out really fast I mean really fast They about put Jimmy Johns to shame 

I got the Hummazing Vegan Ive been vegetarian for about to years now and I really miss my big meaty sandwiches This sandwich really blew my socks off Its really hard to make every bit great when it come to a sandwich but these guys have figured it out 

My wife got the JP grilled cheese you better believe a snagged a bit of that I really couldnt believe that that sandwich was just as good as the one I chose Maybe we got lucky and ordered the  best things 

If you are looking for a great sandwich with a great cause I would stop over to Even Stevens Sandwiches You buy a sandwich and they give one to those in need This place is a stand up sandwich joint
