Holy heavenly sandwiches The sandwiches available here are amazing There was live music when we stumbled upon this place Its a cool vibe We like that they give back to the community The setup is a little weird  ordering and paying without much service other than bringing your sandwiches to you If youre planning on more than one mimosa beer or nonfountain beverage the prices will lure you in but getting the additional refill seems a little tough This also applies to the all you can eat french toast Id vote they stick to the sandwiches Ill be back for more tasty sandwiches in the future
