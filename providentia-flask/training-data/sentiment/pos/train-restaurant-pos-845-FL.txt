Great place the chips and salsa are always delicious so that can be counted on  
I ordered the Mesquite Grilled Chicken breast served with a side of Spanish Rice and fried zucchini
The zucchini was absolutely perfect Piping hot but still crisp and flavorful the Spanish rice was good not special but the Chicken breast made up for that  Besides being deliciously juicy and packed with smoky flavour it was cooked to perfection I desire a chicken breast to be cooked just long enough to be done without losing any juiciness or flavor and that was exactly what I got
The wait staff is lighthearted and easy to get along with and very accommodating as well  Thanks Cantina Laredo
