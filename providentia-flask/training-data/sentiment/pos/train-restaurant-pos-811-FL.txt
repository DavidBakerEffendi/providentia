This is one of my top favorite restaurants Maybe its the margaritas Or perhaps its the chips and salsa Or the chipotle chicken fajitas 
I always get the Pineapple margarita Be careful they arent stingy in terms of alcohol They are made with high quality ingredients so you can expect to pay  to  for one of these babies I cant drink more than  or I would be on the floor upon walking out 
Service is always excellent The bar is sometimes a bit held up BUT remember what I said about those top shelf margs 
I dont like the smokey salsa They offer two and I generally dislike smokey flavors so its nothing against Cantina Laredo specifically The other salsa is another story My dad and I munch on it and usually get seconds 
I always order the chipotle fajitas They are absolutely delicious and served with warm tortillas rice and beans 
Overall the ambiance is intimate the food and drink is unrivaled and the service is exceptional 

Also the desserts always smell really really good My margaritas are considered my desserts however so I have not had the chance to try any sweets I think you should though yelper Listen to your nose Or just follow my lead and order another margarita
