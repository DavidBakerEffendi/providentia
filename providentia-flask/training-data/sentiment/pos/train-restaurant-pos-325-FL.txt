I love this place  Its not a  star restaurant its not on a beach or anything special but its one of the best places in Gilbert Food is reliably fresh clean properly cooked and always tastes great 

As good as the food is the wait staff is the absolute best To name a few Josh Kyle Alison and Natalie are some of the friendliest and most prompt servers Ive ever had Seriously we come here because of how great the people are

My recommendation Chicken and Avocado Club with Blackened Chicken
