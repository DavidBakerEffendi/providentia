Went here the other night with a friend and service was impeccable The pizza didnt come out quite how we had ordered it the first time but they quickly made us a new one that we could both eat
Simply another amazing Sauce location
And shout out to Jordan who took our order for checking on us and making sure we were taken care of all night
