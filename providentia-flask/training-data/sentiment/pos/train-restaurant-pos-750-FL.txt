Had an excellent meal last night with my daughter and husband   Our first visit wont be or last  From the warm greeting when entered  to server who was very sweet professional and personable onto the chef at the grill that was enjoyable to watch and chat with right to leaving with another warm comment the staff was great  Now the food  WOW My husband had steak and said it melted in his mouth  I had seafood combo cooked to perfection and flavourful  It all treasured so fresh  

I debated yelping because if more people go then I may not get in  Ha  Go go go
