Incredible food and environment I always love sushi but am leery of trying new places for it My roommate recommended this place and I tried it I was so happy I did the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive the sushi bar is so fresh and they will make whatever you want If you are looking for good sushi or entertaining teppanyaki then this is the place to go I will defiantly go back
