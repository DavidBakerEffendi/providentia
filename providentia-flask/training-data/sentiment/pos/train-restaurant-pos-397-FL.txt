Best chicken this side of the Mississippi I Grew up with KFC and churches chicken Then along came Popeyes chicken over here  with a Cajun spice Was mighty good for a while However they were all over cooked and to salty too greasyThen I seen a post about this new outfit called Bushs Cicken coming to Gilbert I thought it was another run of the mill deep fried greasy chicken outfit Needless to say Bushs chicken does it right each and every day Cooked to perfection not too salty not too greasy and super tender
 Anyone out there that eats KFC often or any other fried chicken fast food joint
 Please give Bushs a try and you will not be disappointed They even have baked chicken for those who dont want the high cholesterol fried option And believe me the baked option is Good as Gold
