This place was really great  I know all Teppanyaki places are very similar and the show was typical  But the food here really was fantastic  Great fresh veggies and meat  They also had a sauted spinach that was part of the meal  Never seen that before but it was delicious  Very reasonable and large portions  Their Sake Bombers were also pretty cheap  Will return for sure
