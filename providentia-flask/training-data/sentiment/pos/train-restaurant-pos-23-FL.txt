I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food  Growing up in San Francisco most of my life  I was spoiled with great prices and great food I moved to southern California and I could not find a good Chinese restaurant for an entire year of living there I mean not even good  now I live in Arizona and Yaos is the most amazing Chinese Ive had since my childhood   Great portions service with a smile  cleanest restaurant for Chinese food Ive been to in years and the food was just excellent Big portions and great tastes and friendly staff you cant go wrong I already made a date with the wife to come back jn two days and Im still eating as I write this
