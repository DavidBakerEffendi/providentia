Ive gone several times with friends and weve never had a bad time and none of us even particularly enjoy golfing In fact I feel like part of the fun is watching people make fools of themselves trying to do something that seems so simple Fortunately the holes are quite large and theres close ones (close enough you can just throw the ball into if youre so inclined) so theres a decent chance of getting a points in spite of yourself Getting another ball is fast and easy so its easy to just keep trying until you have success (unless youre trying to actually play the game correctly that is)

Service has never been a problem  the server kept our waters full even though we almost never buy food The few times we did get food it was acceptable  nothing amazing but I dont think anybody goes there just for the food Everyones nice and seem genuinely interested in making sure you have a good time 

TopGolf can definitely be expensive so its best to have at least a few people (although that would be true even disregarding the cost) Also  go before  if possible to avoid the rate increase
