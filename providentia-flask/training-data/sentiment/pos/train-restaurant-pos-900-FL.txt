I could probably go on about Cantina Laredo forever I love several of their servers Nigel Theresa and Jodi (sp) I am obsessed with there guacamole which they make table side right in front of you so you can control how mild or spicy you would like it They have a great margarita selection my favorite being the skinny peach margarita you cant tell that its skinny at all Theyve always been accommodating when having events or large groups here I would highly recommend this place to anyone
