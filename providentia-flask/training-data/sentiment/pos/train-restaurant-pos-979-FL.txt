I love this place Its got delicious food pretty healthy overall and my whole family loves it here They redid the kids menu a while ago and that really saved the day for us My girls love choosing their protein their carb option and their veggie They have nothing that isnt delicious but Im partial to the Chicken Lavosh Shwarma wrap  ridiculously delicious My husband swears the basil pesto wrap (with chicken instead of turkey) is the best I even love the broiled chicken salad Not sure what they do the chicken (the marinade and wood stove must help) but its fabulous Theyre pepsi servers too so I can enjoy diet pepsi here too There can be a wait at busy times of days but come at off peak times if you dont want to wait The servers are great too
