Very peaceful and beautiful venue Cute veggie and fruit themed pillows bring a spark of color 

We ordered the Bacon Truffle Mac  Cheese and the Cauliflower Tacos 

Cauliflower Tacos  tacos and a slice of lemon The Tacos were deliciously overloaded with cabbage and avocado The southwestern bite from the cauliflower brought everything together I opted out of using the lemon but postmeal wish i had tried it Think the citrus wouldve added a nice touch 

Mac  Cheese Cheese flavor was good Did not enjoy the bacon bits I would ask for those on the side Probably wont order again just not what Im looking for in a Mac  Cheese Texture was creamy and warm
