I love watching football at sports bars Went last week for MNF and was happy with my choice 

Yes it was packed Yes it was loud But its Monday Football What do you expect 

Our server was friendly and helpful Got our happy hour orders in quickly Beer was yummy and cold perfect 

For food we ordered lots of different apps I agree this is better than average bar food Chips and queso were deelish We had  orders Also had calamari buffalo shrimp fries sweet potato fries and a salad I feel like we had something else but I dont remember That is a result of the cold yummy beer haha 

All really really good Ill go back and maybe sit in the bar part Fun place If I have one gripe its that they dont have one main tv screen But there are so many that basically anywhere you sit has a view of any game 
Good times
