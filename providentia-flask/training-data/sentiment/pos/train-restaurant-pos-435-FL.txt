This place is awesome My husband and I are not vegetarian or vegan we just enjoy trying different kinds of food And this place was great  the food was delicious even for nonvegans 

We got the beet burger and the rainbow tofu vermicelli The tofu was deep fried to perfection the noodles were really flavorful and had cabbage and carrot in it The sweet potato fries were awesome  I highly recommend them And the beet burger was very different but very tasty as well with guacamole and hummus 


If youre wanting something healthy delicious and different definitely check out this place
