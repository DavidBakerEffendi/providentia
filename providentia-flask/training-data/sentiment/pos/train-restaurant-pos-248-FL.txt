We totally love this place Our only complaint is that its so popular its always packed  Ultimately thats a good thing though and says a lot about the business

If you sit at the bar the bartenders are awesome  If you get a table their servers are awesome  Their drinks are strong and reasonably priced even if theyre not on happy hour  My girlfriend is low carb and asked about customizing a steak entree to include broccoli and shrimp instead of what was included on the menu  They totally hooked it up for her without even batting an eye  THE SHRIMP WAS SO GOOD too

Its a fun place to take in a game (or two)  They also offer a cool option where you can do callahead seating if theres a wait or they can text you when your table is ready  You can even text back if your plans change which is so convenient 

Keep it up Blue
