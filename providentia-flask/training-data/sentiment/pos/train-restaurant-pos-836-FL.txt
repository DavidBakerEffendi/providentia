I was a little apprehensive about this place when the wife mentioned wanting to go  Shopping center Mexican food seems to be frequently overpriced and sub standard  I was pleasantly surprised by this place  We rolled in Friday at happy hour and it was busy but we still found a spot at the bar pretty easily  The staff was laid back and anticipated needs well  I was really impressed by the food on the happy hour menu  Their margarita game is outstanding  We had a few drinks and a few apps and got out for a reasonable price  I will be back for sure
