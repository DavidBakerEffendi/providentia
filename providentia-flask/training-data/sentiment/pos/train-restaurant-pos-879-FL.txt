Cantina hosted our first charity Bunco event for Nobodys Perfect today and they did an amazing job  The food was outstanding and the service was exceptional  The manager RJ and his staff went above  beyond to make our event a huge success and we hope to make this an annual event at Cantina Big thanks to Mickey for helping us prepare and making it happen  If you havent eaten there yet be sure to do so
