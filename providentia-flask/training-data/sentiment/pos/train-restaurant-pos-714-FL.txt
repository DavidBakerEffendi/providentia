This place is amazing

Our teppan chief was Vincent and he was hilarious Not only do you get dinner but he also puts on a show for you as well Definitely will request him again next time

Got a double order of fried rice with steak and scallop Yummy They scallops were juicy tender and BIG pieces Definitely worth the price Double fried rice was a lot of rice but I got to take some home and it definitely taste good the next day ( 

Will definitely come back Cause Im dreaming of them scallops drools
