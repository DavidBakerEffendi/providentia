Amazing junky bar food  I got the nachos which came with an awesome cheese sauce and the onion rings which were battered to flakey perfection  The restaurant itself is sort of like a Buffalo Wild Wings and can get very loud during peak times  I wouldnt recommend for an intimate dinner but great if you want to grab some good food and hangout
