My partner suggested we go to Topgolf as he recently attended a corporate event there which he enjoyed I was a bit apprehensive being that I had not played golf in over twenty years but Im glad I gave it a try  The facility itself is beautiful especially compared to the old school driving range I knew back East  The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful  Although we didnt eat or drinks were delivered quickly and the server was attentive even assisting us with purchasing extra time via the kiosk

Overall great experience and Ill definitely be back
