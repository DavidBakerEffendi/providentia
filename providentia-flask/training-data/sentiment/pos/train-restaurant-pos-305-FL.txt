First time weve been here 
Amazing menu  service
Brittany was our server she was attentive and great
Started with the Edamame presentation nice stemmed  salted served with a sweet soy ginger dipping sauce 
Wings were okay weve had better
Bar drinks vodka tonic were made well  worth the price
Shrimp Poboy was wonderful Had tons of fried shrimp and it was a huge sandwich
Turkey bacon club (wrapped in a flour tortilla) was good
A great addition was on the kids menu they offer a kids steak bites which was cooked to perdition and our daughter ate it all 
Great menu with lots to offer We will be back
