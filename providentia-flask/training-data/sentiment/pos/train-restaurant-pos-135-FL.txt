Cool sandwich shop  I had the Cuban Sandwich and my wife the BLT  Both were excellent  We also had the tomato bisque which was delicious  Service was fast and friendly  We will definitely be going back to try some more menu items  I think my next sandwich will be the Reuben  Well done Even Stevens an awesome break from the ordinary
