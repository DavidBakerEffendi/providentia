Enjoyed an evening catching up with a friend  We sat at the bar  The bartender was attentive but allowed us to sip and gab  Noticed that most of the tables with food had the calamari  Decided it was a good indication they would be good and since our first visit I went for those  Happy to say I was not disappointed  My friend wanted to get something a little healthier and asked about salad selections  The bartender steered her towards the salmon salad  I am not a fan of salmon but I can say she said it was delicious
