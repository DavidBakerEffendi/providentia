As a NYCQueens native I have been longing for some good Chinese food I hit the jackpot with King Wok The food is just so good Portions are large so lots of leftovers They catered my sons birthdsy party and threw n lots of freebies  Lunch specials are super inexpensive and so much food it literally falls off the plate Spicy chicken and broccoli you gotta try it
