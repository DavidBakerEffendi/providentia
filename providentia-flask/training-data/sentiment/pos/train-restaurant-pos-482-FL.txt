I decided to stop in during lunch and Im glad I did

The lady at the register greeted me and walked over to me as soon as I walked in the restaurant 
the place was definitely clean and the music was relaxing Definitely a laid back vide

Their menu is not too crazy but theres enough to keep you happy and satisfied It is a little on the pricy end but its understandable for the type of food that they are providing 

I ordered the Black Bean Burger and a Passion Fruit Green Tea (unsweetened) 

Omg let me tell you it tasted amazing 
The black bean patty did not taste dry or brittle
The lemon tahini was not over powering and mixed in very good with the whole thing 
Omg The sweet potato fries were so good and I just wanted more and more 
The drink in itself was yummy and very thirst quenching and Im glad I went with it Actually did not taste like it was unsweetened but oh well Haha 

The only down side to this place is the cost but I mean its kinda understandable 

I would definitely recommend this place to people in the area Ill be returning at some point to try out some other things on their menu 
A guys

Oh also their to go box was very nicely backed in my opinion
