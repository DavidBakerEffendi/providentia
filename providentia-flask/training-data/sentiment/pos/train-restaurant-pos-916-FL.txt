Hands down the best Mexican food in town The queso dip with ground beef is to die for Their salsas are also delicious Their margaritas are so strong with a lot of tequila and NOT sweet at all My favorite dish is the cheese enchilada with mole sauce on top  Their black beans as a side dish are excellent The only item they need to add to the menu would be a taco salad
