Had a great dinner at Blue  last night Ive been a few times and had a great experience each time The place was pretty slow on a Sunday night which allowed us to get a seat right away The past couple times were more busy Either way the food and service are great I have loved their wings ribs and buffalo chicken sandwich The staff are friendly and quick The place has typically had a pretty loud volume level but I think a lot of that is the quantity of people there I would definitely recommend giving it a try
