TopGolf is always fun and this location is no exception  We picked this location instead of Scottsdale assuming it would be less crowded and I am sure we were right  The staff was nice and the facility was in great shape  I dont love how you always have a server as I come to hit balls and not to eat but that is just how it is  I usually tip a little for all the water fill ups but I would rather just be left alone  Come before noon for the best pricing ( per hour)
