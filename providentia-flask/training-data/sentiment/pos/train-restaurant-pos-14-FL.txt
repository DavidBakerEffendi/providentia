We went with our family on Christmas Eve Apparently the entire city of Gilbert thought they would go too So the wait to get out table was long and once we were sat it took a long time to give our order 
However once we got our food it was yummy  Mongolian beef was spicy but not too spicy It was light on the beef though The chicken fried rice was great Huge platter Egg rolls were huge Others in our party got moogoo guipan happy family coconut shrimp and egg flower soup They all said they were good too 
Well have to go some other nonholiday weekend to see how the service is
   
Weve been since on any regular day many times We also went back for Christmas Eve (with a reservation this time) service has been awesome and the food never fails to be delicious
