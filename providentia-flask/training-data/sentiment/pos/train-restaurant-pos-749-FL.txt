First time visiting Ryu and we were blown away The Teppan was so delicious Excellent service with nice friendly staff 

The miso soup was vibrant and delicious The ginger salad was average it was bagged iceberg Nothing special 

Ordered the Gyoza for an appetizer and was not at all disappointed Homemade dipping sauce had just enough bite 

I ordered the NY Strip with Chilean Sea Bass and everything was cooked perfectly  The Sea Bass melted in my mouth and popped with flavor Excellent sear 

Overall dinner was much better than expected and everything was flavorful and delicious The Sea food options here are the allstars
