Top Golf is an experience everyone (whether you likeplay golf or not) must have 

Golf You are going to be spending between hr for a bay which can accommodate  golfers So if you are with others that total is split not per person Depending on if you are there for actual practice and competition or just for fun hrs is good for parties of  where hrs will be sufficient for parties of  What usually ends up happening is youre having such a great time you want to stay longer Targets are  accurate I would say Every now and then you will get a ball that you see go in a target and you are not awarded points for it As far as clubs go you can bring your own (minus driverswoods) or use the clubs provided which are sufficient unless you are serious about golf

Food This is the biggest surprise to everyone but the food here is fantastic Everything we have had has been great From turkey club sandwiches burgers wings nachos queso and buffalo chicken sliders  We have yet to order something we have not thought we would order again Food is also pretty pricey Id say with appetizer meal and drink you are looking to spend around bucks a person just on food

Total experience is worth it but know you are going to be spending more than you would at a bowling alley movie theater or driving range Butit is worth it
