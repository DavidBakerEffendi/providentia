My wife is veganSo that inspires me to find a good vegan restaurant for her

Touch down we found one of the best
Pretty impressed with the interior decor
We ordered bean burger mac and cheese and fries
 We liked the burger a lotwith crunchy onion and vegetables in the middle
The mac and cheese is to die forI am not a fan of it but when i sampled oneI loved it

The onlt con was we ordered buffalo cauliflower and it was rawsince they baked it

Other than that for their reasonable pricing i would give  star
