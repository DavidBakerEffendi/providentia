So I got my normal philly cheese steak that is pretty good and pretty close to the one back home in philly My wife on the other hand went out of the box and got something she never got before After taking a bite from it she realized it wasnt for her With out charge they made her any sandwich she wanted and went back into the comfort box Thank you for understanding and letting her get something else
