Eat a sandwich  Give a sandwich

When I started to write up the review this morning Even Stevens located in Gilbert was just about to hit their  sandwich donated and theyve been open less than a week Even Stevens might be a bit of a youngster in the sub shop world having opened their first spot in  but clearly these sandwich artisans are on to something 

Being a good neighbor is an important part for each Even Stevens store so each location gives back to the local community The local nonprofit partners for this location are Open Arms Care Center United Food Bank Boys  Girls Clubs of The East Valley and A New Leaf 

But thats not the only good thing about Even Stevens They also offer tasty food with friendly service that you can feel great about supporting because you are helping give back locally Their sandwiches are full of flavor too Probably due to the fact that they use local bread and ingredients that are additive free and san artificial flavors Plus their veggies are prepped in house daily so you know what you get is fresh

But the standout menu item is the Stuffed French Toast It is packed full of a banana sweet cream and topped with a warm berry compote The price point of  is great for the amount you get Hoping to try their Sunday Brunch sometime soon Unlimited French toast and  mimosa Sounds delicious filling and wallet friendly 

If you stop by on a Thursday or Friday night or Sunday afternoon you can enjoy some local live music which just adds to the very chill vibes of the shop 

My only wish is for them to offer local tea options like they do for coffee But that is honestly the only tiny improvement that could make this place even better 

Kudos Even Stevens for being so awesome
