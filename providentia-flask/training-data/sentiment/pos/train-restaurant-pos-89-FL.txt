Super hip vibes and very tasty food here at Even Stevens I met the owner Michael and got to hear about Even Stevens story and mission I was very impressed with his passion for food and desire to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods I love that Even Stevens gives back to the local community More sandwiches for everyone They partner with local nonprofits to donate food to people in need (buy a sandwich give a meal) They also pride themselves in supporting small local businesses through their inventory purchases For example all bread is sourced from a nearby bakery all jamsjellies come from a familyowned operation and their coffee comes from a small coffee shop in Chandler that brings the coffee beans directly from their family farm in Brazil

The space itself is very open and airy despite being packed with a dinner rush I didnt feel crowded at all The decorations and furniture create a welcoming atmosphere and a comfortable place to kick back with a friend You can come for dinner but rush  stay awhile and play a board game on the couch

I ordered the pot roast dip sandwich It was very delicious and rich The sandwich was extra gourmet with fancy jalapeo jelly on top and dipping juice on the side My boyfriend got the banh belly and really enjoyed that as well We are excited for our next visit so we can try some other creations All the sandwiches on the menu are unique and AFFORDABLE In this day and age of  burgers it is refreshing to find a great sandwich place where I can eat well under 

Affordable philanthropic and delicious Cant top that
