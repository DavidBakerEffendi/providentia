We always love coming here and havent had a bad experience that has made us not want to come back Their menu is so diverse that everyone is able to find something that they will love Their environment is family friendly but also has a bar area and there are plenty of TVs so that everyone has a great view of any games that are on  My husband and I love the buffalo chicken salad and it is large enough to share Other favorites of ours are the ribs the country fried chicken and many of their appetizers Their fries I think are battered and fried to perfection and I love them One of my favorite restaurants and we come here often
