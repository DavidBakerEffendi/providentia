I will say I wish Even Stevens had more vegan options I thoroughly enjoyed this place 

The ambience will make you want to stay and relax for hours they have board games and comfy chairs It reminds me of bohemian shops around the valley with a Tempe atmosphere 

Everyone working was exceptionally friendly and we came in  minutes before closing 

I hope they offer more vegan options in the future 
I got the Jackfruit Torta which has a kick to it Nevertheless delicious
