Usually come here on Saturday days and the bartender is Dalice I sit and watch her work  She greets customers even when shes busy  tells them she will be right with them  That in my opinion is great customer service  Shes efficient and friendly  That makes a great bar  Obviously the food was good and drinks even better  Great service  keep up the good work
