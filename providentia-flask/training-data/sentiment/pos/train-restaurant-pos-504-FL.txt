LOVE LOVE LOVE this place Got here and greeted promptly was placed in a bay quickly and the servers who took our orders were tentative
I was expecting bar food but to my surprise the food was great We had the Sunshine burger and tots The burger was so yummy and the tots not greasy and they served it with some sauce that was tasty
Great place for some fun
