I came here for a company outing There were about  of us or so and let me say Topgolfs customer service was AMAZING I was never without a drink in my hand (which could be the reason for my pounding headache) but they were so on it I was seriously impressed 

The food was of your typical fare but definitely a cut above 

The specialty drinks were amazing and many came with souvenir cups I opted for the plastic patron bottle that housed a berry Paloma cocktail Delicious and strong

In all Topgolf was just as fun as I had heard and in fact exceeded my expectations I cant wait to get one in Bakersfield
