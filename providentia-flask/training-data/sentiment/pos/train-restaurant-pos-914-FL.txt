What a great experience tonight  of us in our party  my wife and I her parents and our son  Simone our server was fantastic She did a great job explaining  the options for my wifes food allergies (egg dairy and wheat) and together they designed a tasty enchilada recipe I enjoyed the Enchilada Mole  Three others had Carnitas  braised pork shanks with chipotlewine sauce  very tasty and a bit spicy 
Weve been here a number of times and have never been disappointed
Greatly appreciate the flexibility for those with complex food allergies
