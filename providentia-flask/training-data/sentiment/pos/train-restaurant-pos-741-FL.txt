Hands down my familys favorite for Teppanyaki and Sushi  The staff is very friendly and the food and portions are generous  Prices are fairly priced and service is great  Only one downside to this place and that is parking  It is always busy and you might need to walk a little bit  But hey the food is well worth it  My family loves this place
