My wife and I always order the pitas here and they are outstanding  We live at the north end of Gilbert and this particular location is at the south end of town and its worth the drive  There is a newer location at Val Vista and Baseline however that place is a giant noisy echo chamber of a restaurant to eat in and the kitchen noise is EXCESSIVE   I like that you can order ahead and pick up  

The food tastes very fresh (try the baba ghanoush) and its actually one of the few meals we buy where the food is worth it  There is another authentic Mediterranean restaurant just a couple blocks from us however their gyros taste nowhere near as good as Pita Jungle

We always order take out  I dislike eating in restaurants these days due to all the noise  Its hard to find a quiet dining experience without screaming children
