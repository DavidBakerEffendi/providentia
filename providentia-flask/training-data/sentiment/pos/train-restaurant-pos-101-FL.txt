Is there anything better than a delicious sandwich  Fantastic ingredients dynamite bread  I would say there is not  If youre a sandwich lover like me you have to try Even Stevens  The whole vibe is awesome comfortable and casual  Even Stevens provides food to those in need  Buy one give one I love this so much Ill gladly eat here again and often and even pay a few extra dollars on the high side for a sandwich if this means Im helping others  The Bahn Mi was incredible  The pork delightful  The aioli a perfect compliment and the bread was divine  I also ordered the shishito peppers and they were very good I checked in on yelp and was given a complimentary cookie and the sugar cookie was incredible This place is so good and I cant wait to return and try more fantastic sandwiches
