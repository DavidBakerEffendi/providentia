Why dont we have one of these in San Diego  I came here with some friends when I was in town and Ill admit that I was skeptical at first Im not a golfer AT ALL but I had a really great time The nice thing is that you dont have to be good at golfing to do well here I was the least experienced golfer in my group and I didnt even get last place If you can hit your ball into  of the  targets (ranging from  to  yards) youll get points which will automatically show up on a screen at your table so you dont have to keep track manually The concept is a lot like bowling but its a driving range It might seem a little expensive but it really isnt if everyone playing chips in 

Another great feature this place has to offer is the bar More than likely there will be a wait to play golf because this place is so popular but you can go hang out in the bar and eatdrink while you wait Its no different than going to any other bar just to hang out The atmosphere is really fun and energetic (all of the employees are always dancing and being goofy) so I would probably hang out there even if there wasnt a wait to play golf Before you know it itll be your turn to hit some balls and the fun will continue
