First time here with my kids on a Saturday afternoon and we had a freeking blast
This will take the place of our get out of the heat bowling Saturday My  year old had the time of his life  Its a bit pricey an hour from Noonbut its priceless to see my kids have a blast with their dad doing something sporty and outside when its  degrees
We didnt have much to eat just some fries and I grabbed a Goose Island IPA
The service and staff was a perfect  Everyone took the time to explain how the games work and everything else I will  be back hopefully with some adults next time
