I am not a fan of the sports bar atmosphere but this place is really not the norm  The food and service there are great and there are options for everyone  It seems to attract a balanced crowd of sports fans families and couples so no need to think you will be out of place

Its like the menu will take the usually foods and but a nice spin on them  Theyve got quesadillas but they have them with shrimp and bacon  Theres buffalo chicken wings but they also have buffalo shrimp How about some fish tacos  They have those as well but also a blackened shrimp variation as well  Want some flatbread  Theres a mediterranean variation with feta olives greek peppers onions and tomatoes  A friend of mine got the monte cristo sandwich and that is not something I would usually even think about getting but I was ready to fight him for this sandwich  It was ridiculous

I mention Blue  to lots of friends (female and male) and all respond the same way  Ohhh that place is so good  If youre a world cup fan they opened super early to show all the games  Yes I ate buffalo shrimp at  am  Dont judge me Goal
