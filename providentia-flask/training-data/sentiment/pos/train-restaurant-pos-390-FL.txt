Stopped by the new Gilbert location of Bushs Chicken to try some good ol Texas Fried Chicken

I was greeted by the friendly staff the moment I walked in which made a good first impression I had a great conversation with the manager who hails from San Antonio (Hook em Babee) is up here to help launch the two locations (the other is up in Glendale) of Bushs Chicken outside of the Great State of Texas

I ordered a two piece (breast  drumstick) chicken and roll and an ice water w lemon Ill tell you what that chicken was fresh hot (burned my dang tongue) and juicy The roll was fresh and had good flavor  I took a nice chunk of the breast portion and made an impromptu chicken sandwich which was very tasty

As I was enjoying my meal I gazed around the restaurant and was impressed by the cleanliness and well lit interior I even enjoyed watching a portion of a Kentucky (too bad it wasnt my Longhorns)  college football spring game on the flat screen TV they had installed up on the south wall Fried chicken and football really compliment each other oh so well Lol Anyway

My takeaway of my first visit to a Bushs Fried Chicken Theyre spot on representing true Texas Fried Chicken (although not as good as my Moms from Kerville TX Lol) My only regret is that I should have tried out some of the sides and some of the iced tea Ill be sure to do that on my next visit as l definitely plan coming back for some more great Texas Fried Chicken Hook em Babee
