My wife and I hadnt been here in quite a while Came back for a quick Sunday night dinner out and were surprised at the quality we had been missing elsewhere Service was friendly and fast no wait and food came out quick and super hot The soup is some of the best weve ever had and the egg roll was fantastic as well The pancakes on my Moo Shu Chicken were just perfect not too thin and not too heavy or soggy Tsing Tao beers we ice cold and only  Dont miss this place for a Chinese night out
