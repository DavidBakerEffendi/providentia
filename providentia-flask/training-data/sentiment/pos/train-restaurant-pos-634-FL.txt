I always have a great time at top golf Be prepared to spend some money but if you bring  friends with you it will be quite a bit less expensive as the bays can hold up to six people to divide up the cost They have a full menu and bar too The food is usually good I will say the nachos are EXTREMELY over priced You pay for a dollar a chip for the nachos

Though some of the food is overpriced it is worth it for a great time Be prepared to get addicted to Top Golf
