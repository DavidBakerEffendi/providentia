Silver lining to having to drive across town for less than pleasant errands is finally getting to Seed Shack who I had been following on Instagram for a while  I am never in Gilbert but man this was delicious What an adorable bright gem of a vegan eatery  I had the tofu vermicelli and it was the perfect combo of flavors and textures Yummy Clean bright cheerful atmosphere and service
