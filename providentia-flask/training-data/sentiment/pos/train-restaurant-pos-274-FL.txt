Weve been here several times and its always good There have been a couple of times weve had to wait to be seated at odd times but theyve done well flipping tables while not making us feel rushed My husband always orders the Wing Burger and absolutely loves it Ive ordered several different items and have always been pleased The Chips and Queso and Bruschetta are really good as well and both have their own uniqueness They also have a bunch of beers on tap which is always nice
