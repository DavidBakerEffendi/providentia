We had read a few of the feedbacks before going here   I have eat at Kneaders in Utah several times and love the place but after reading some of the negatives on here I was wondering if this location maybe had some issues  My wife and I decided we would give it a try and make our own decision  I am glad we did  The service was speedy they were very helpful and the food was delicious  The place was rather busy and the staff seemed to handle the crowd with no problems  Superb sandwiches and delectable Deserts  I cant wait to come back for the French Toast Breakfast )
