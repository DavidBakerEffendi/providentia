Last week I went there because of the high reviews While I was waiting for my food I learned about the mission of the organization For every sandwich that is purchased they provide a sandwich to a local nonprofit I felt like crying when I learned this There is hope left in the world after all And the sandwich was freaking amazing (Turkey Roast) I went back again yesterday and got the Do Gouda Awesome again
