Seed Shack is a fantastic place for vegan foods We signed up for the special Christmas Eve dinner to try them out for the fist time We were not disappointed The food was excellent We liked it so much we came in the very next week for breakfast Seed Shack is a great East Valley vegan dining choice I would highly recommend them
