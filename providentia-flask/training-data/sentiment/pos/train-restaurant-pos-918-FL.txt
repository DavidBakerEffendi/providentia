Cantina has been a favorite since I moved to Gilbert four years ago The food is so consistent and the service is good But now Cantina is also my goto for happy hour My friends and I try other places but always come back to Cantina The vibe is just right and the food and drink are always good And Duke is seriously the best bartender ever Even if the food was soso wed go back for Duke )
