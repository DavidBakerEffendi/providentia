Amazing Took me a while to try Kneaders as my goto safety blanket has always been Panera but Im sure glad I did Service was very friendly helpful and quick They have a drive through at this location as well to make it even easier The inside is decorated very farmhouse chic and its super clean The food was so good and fresh for sure I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich with a fruit tart both superior to versions Ive had before Will be back for sure
