I went with my family for the first time to this amazing restraint This was one of the best Ive had in the Gilbert and quite honestly In all of Arizona I was so surprised on how tasty everything was and every single time I took a bite I was just like WOW this is Heavenly 

The menu meets all of my standards and beyond All of the menu items seemed so imaginative and delightful The specialty rolls I ordered were the Boo Ya Ka Roll Surf  Turf as well as the Chimichanga Everything was fresh and thoughtfully made The ingredients for their sauces they used in some of their rolls were well balanced and made it flavorsome Their sushi rolls are pretty big too so its definitely worth what youre paying for If you leave some room for dessert and try I recommend their Pizookie  Delicious

I also noticed they have great happy hour drinks or specialty drinks The customer service was beyond superior The lady owner there is super sweet and you could tell she really cares about her customers She takes the time to talk to every table and makes sure you are enjoying your experience

I highly recommend this place for sushi I am planning to be a regular here not only because I want to try everything they have on their menu but because they really truly do have great food
