SO MUCH FUN   Went with two other couples and having heard the place was typically busy we went early and planned on putting our name in for a bay and then have dinner while we waited  This worked our perfectly   We ordered our food and very shortly after we were done eating we got the text that our bay was ready  Note that each player needs to buy a  dollar players card which is good forever and is how the game play works  You load the card with money and swipe it in at your booth  Make sure what line you are in when you enter so you dont end up standing in a line that you didnt need to be in they have kiosks for the cards

So for the food surprisingly it was really good  Between the group we had a pretty good mix of plates on the table and everyone was really happy with their order  I had the basic cheeseburger but there was a cobb salad club sandwich and a few other dishes all the main dishes ran about  ish  

The wait staff was on top of all our needs the entire time and let me tell you the place was packed

Game time we were in a bay on the second floor and had a couch there are some bays that have tall tables but I think either would be comfortable for a group  They did have heaters that you control in your bay if neededwe did not 

 There are several games you can choose to play all varying around lightedcolored circles out in the range  You pay per hour and we played two hours  The price varies depending on the time of day for us it was  per hour for the bay  Again outside the waitstaff was always in the ready and drinks deserts etc  were delivered quickly and with a smile  It was so pleasant good job to TopGolf for training and customer service 

Before I sign off one quick tip order the  injectable donut holes yep creme raspberry and chocolate fun and yum
