Wow what an unbelievable place  I wasnt sure how a place like this would work in Gilbert but based on the crowds last night I think theyve found an itch that needed scratching out here in the East Valley  We went with a few friends and were greeted by some of the nicest people youll find in Phoenix  Laughing dancing getting everybody involved in the action from the get go  We had a wait (which is actually part of the fun) so we headed over to the bar for a few drinks

This place is loaded with TVs and may be my new hangout when football season comes back around  Tons of beers on tap great selection of cocktails and a drink served in a glass golf bag that requires three people to order  Watch the booze go in people youll know why

After a bit of a wait we headed to the bay for some golf  WOW  Such a cool experience and the nongolfers of the group had just as much fun as we did  Music was pumping we could watch TV right there and they brought the food right to our bay so when you werent hitting you could chat drink and eat without skipping a beat  The food was fantastic too  Not something youd expect to find but it was topnotch fare at a darn good price (places like this can sometimes be spendy but it was very reasonable for what you get)

Lets put it this way if theres a place that gets my wife to play golf and I can drink beer and watch football while doing it Im on board  Go check it out
