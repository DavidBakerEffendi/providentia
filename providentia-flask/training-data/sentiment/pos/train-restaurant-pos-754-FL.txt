Great food We love their happy hour that lasts until pm 
The owner Ann is so nice She remembers us when we visit even after a long time not coming and I noticed several other patrons come in over the course of our meal that she was so friendly and familiar with This is one of our favorite sushi and Teppan places in the valley
