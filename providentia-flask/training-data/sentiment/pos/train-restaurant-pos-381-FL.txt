I love Bushs chicken I am from Texas and when I found out they had a location near me I had to go One thing I did not lie was I pulled up and the server took someone  the order of someone who go there after me After I mentioned it to him he got my order correct and the food was hot It was so good reminds me of the Bushs in Waco TX and Missouri City 

Also the location is great and they seem to keep it clean
