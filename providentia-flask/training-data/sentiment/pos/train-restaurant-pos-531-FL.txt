I have always had positive experiences every time I have been to Top Golf The atmosphere is always fun The service may be a little bit slower but they have always been friendly and do a great job Likewise it is always busy every time I go so that is probably why service is slightly slower  I dont blame them at all 

The food menu is pretty limited but it is decent The cheese fries are to die for Avoid the calamariits not the best Ive had I have also had the chips and guac and its decent just what you would expect from chips and guac The salad with goat cheese and pecans is decent too but would be great if there wasnt so much cinnamon on the pecans Anyway just get some cheese fries to help soak up the booze and you will be good

As for the bar they have Titos so Im a happy camper They have never gotten my order wrong either so thats wonderful

In regards to golfing  this place is awesome I love how they have the TVs set up to show you which area your ball went into (when it goes into a colored area) It is easy to work and anyone can play not just those who golf regularly The staff who tends to the golfers are pretty cool and do an amazing job

All in all Top Golf is a great place to spend a Friday or Saturday night at and if you havent been I would definitely recommend you give it a try Even if you are not a golfer )
