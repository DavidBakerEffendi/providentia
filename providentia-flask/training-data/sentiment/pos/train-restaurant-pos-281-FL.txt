Back again for dinner  same fast and pleasant service and really tasty food This time tried the Rib Sampler on the appetizer menu They were meaty smoked to perfection tender and the sauce was a tasty St Louis style The five boned sampler with fries was just right for dinner Another really satisfying evening
