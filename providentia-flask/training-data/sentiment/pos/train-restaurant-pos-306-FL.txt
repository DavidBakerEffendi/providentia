Another great evening here 
Had  Date Night Saturday 
Our staff member was Regal Probably one of the BEST servers weve ever had
Such a joyful personality above  beyond with a great attitude Stellar Service  
Busser  Tres was sweet as ever  came around numerous times to see if we needed any plates cleared 
Wonderful customer service by ALL employees BOTH times we have been in
Tried the Nachos really good Cheesy Queso on it the BOMB  the next time we will ask for an extra of that Requested the Carne Asada ( instead of the ground beef) super tasty  with a side of fresh Guacamole a plus
Wings are really perfect Saucy buttery  crispy fried chicken wings Hot sauce is uniquely flavored with a hint of pepper similar to the Famous NY Buffalo Wings Taste just the way they should This is accompanied by homemade crumbled creamy blue cheese dressing   or a buttermilk ranch dressing too 
Beers on tap  all the sports games going on the many flat screens makes for an enjoyable evening
Look forward to making this place a regular dinning location  we will request Regal for sure the next time were in
