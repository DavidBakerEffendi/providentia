Yeah  stars  That is for best in this category  I love this location  They closed the one that was on Baseline and close to where I live but this isnt too far  

The Rivulon store is near a lot of auto dealers so it can get busy

If you like subs made with real meat and REAL cheese then this is your place  It is not the cheapest place to get a sub but it is well worth it  

Three favorites are  (my fav  Ham Cappacoulo and Cheese  Wife likes the  Ham and Cheese Parents both love the  Original Italian  

Another favorite (used to be off menu is the ) Cancro Special  

We like it Mikes way  But be careful if you dont like onions you will be picking them offso let them know exactly what you want

Service
Great service  You can tell when someone is new  It really slows own the line  They have a young man and a young lady there that really crank out the subs  (Unfortunately I cant remember their namesand we ask every time)

One Tip
Their service is top notch  We have sometimes had to point out that (usually after a rush) that we would prefer a new batch of tomatoes or a new batch of lettuce  I am sure that was annoying to them  But never once did anybody complained and I always got a fresh tray of veggies  

If you are looking for a subI do not know why you would not go to Jersey Mikes  Subway and Jimmy Johns are not even in the same league
