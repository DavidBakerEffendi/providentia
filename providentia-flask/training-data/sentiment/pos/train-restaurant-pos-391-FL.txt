We recently moved from Tx and one of the restaurants we had missed very much was Bushes Chicken imagine our surprise when we saw one was being built close to our home in Chandler Az We visited it tonight and we were in heaven Same great flavor as the Bushes restaurants  in San Antonio  and they also had very friendly staff Will keep going back
