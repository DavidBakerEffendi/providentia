It was a lot of fun even for someone who doesnt like golf We had about a  minute wait at around pm on a Saturday which was to be expected but the bar service was quick and watching the other people golf made the wait go by fast It isnt just a driving range since they have electronic greens that are illuminated and you choose different game types from the computer at your table and try to hit the specific targets for points You pay by the hour and there were four of us there for drinks and appetizers We paid for two hours which went by pretty quickly My suggestion is to pay for at least three hours for four or more people especially if you will be ordering more food than we did You also dont need your own clubs since they provide them there
