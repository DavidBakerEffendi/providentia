We ordered from Yao Fine the day before Thanksgiving to have something quick to eat without dirtying the kitchen We have tried our fair share of Chinese restaurants in the Gilbert area but havent found the one yet  but our search maybe over  We ordered the walnut shrimp generals chicken shrimp chow mein and hot and sour soup  we also had the egg rolls and a crab Rangoon  

Everything was tasty and the walnut shrimp egg roll (which was huge) Rangoon and generals chicken are probably the best I have ever had in Gilbert The shrimp chow mein was also good and was a huge serving but my husband would have liked more shrimp so next time we will add extra The only thing that was at all disappointing was the hot and sour soup  while tasty it didnt have a very good vegetable to broth ratio but I dont know if that was a one time occurrence or not so I will try it again sometime to see

Lastly the fact that they dont deliver makes me sad  but only because if they did I would exclusively order from here But on those days when we can order and pick up we will definitely order from Yao Fine
