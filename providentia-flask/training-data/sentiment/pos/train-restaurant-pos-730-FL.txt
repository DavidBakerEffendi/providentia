We started coming here when it FIRST opened The Owner is sooo nice and always asks how my son is because she seen me from when I was pregnant to after he was born now that we live further we do not go as often as wed like but on date nights we def go grab some sushi and chat it up with the Owner if she is in The sushi is always delish havent tried the Teppanyaki but it always looks and smells good I will say the last time we went it seemed like there was no ventilation for the smoke from the Teppanyaki
