Food is amazing and the staff is the same I go there every week and I am always satisfied The manager Josue even gave me a free take out when I got into an accident That was incredibly nice of him to pay it forward to someone who had a bad day I love it there and I will continue to go there on a weekly basis for delicious healthy food I love all of the wraps and salads The hummus is always wonderful as I buy that at home for my staple throughout the week
