My husband loves to stop by the Blue  for a BLT  He says they have great bacon  We have not been to this location before but the bacon is the same I had the chicken tortilla soup  It tasted bland with flour or corn starch thickener  I am sure he will want another BLT soon Plus we thought the fries were very good and the service friendly
