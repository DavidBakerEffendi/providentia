I was looking for some delicious Chinese food near the area that I was running some errands in and came across this place on my Google Maps I checked out the menu online to make sure it wasnt a carbon copy of Panda Express  which thankfully for my starvingChinesefoodlovingbelly it was not

I went for the Beef Chow Fun and Singapore Chicken  one dish thats very standard and one mystery dish (because I had no idea what would be inside it other than chicken)

The Chow Fun was PERFECT My face lit up upon the scent of the dish alone  I lit up even more once I took a bite I saw golden noodles dancing in front of me Could it really be this good In Arizona I felt like I had traveled instantaneously to a small momandpop noodle shop in the  

The Singapore Chicken had mushrooms which are not my fave but the dish itself was so delicious I couldnt have cared less The sauce was the key flavor to making this dish fantastic A little sweet sour tangy and spicy The chicken was perfectly cooked I could have eaten two of these Even the side of rice was good

They are fast friendly and make great dishes This restaurant has something for everyone (even that guy who thinks Panda Express is traditional Chinese food)

The dish prices are fair and the portions are generous The restaurant itself was clean and I definitely felt comfortable inside 

I will certainly come back even if it is a bit of a drive from where Im normally at This has definitely made its way into my top  Chinese nom nom spots in the Valley Definitely worth every penny and gallon of gas 

My firsttime experience was A

EDITUPDATE Still solid
