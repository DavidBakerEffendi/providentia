This place is dangerous Its very good and in no way healthy Chicken strips fries mac and cheese and jalapeo poppers were amazing The sweet tea was perfect as well My absolute favorite was the ghost sauce and jalapeo ranch Some of the best Sauce I have ever had We will be back but only on cheat days
