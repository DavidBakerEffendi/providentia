Really loved the atmosphere great service and the food was fantastic 

I got the veggie wrap which was really excellent It was also super filling and I wasnt able to finish the whole thing so you definitely get your moneys worth out of it 

We also ordered the Mahi Mahi which was also quite stunning The cilantro jalapeo hummus was amazing There could have been a bit more food for the price of this dish 

Also ordered their fresh guava lemonade which we loved

I would definitely seek out going there again
