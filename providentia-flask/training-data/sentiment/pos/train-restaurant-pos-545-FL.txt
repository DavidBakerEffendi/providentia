Great place Great Service Great Food Great time My Family and I visited from LA and had a little reunion with our Arizona Family They recommended Topgolf and they didnt disappoint My daughter had a great time swinging the clubs trying to get her targets and my wife who didnt want to play still had a great time and we all enjoyed the delicious food
