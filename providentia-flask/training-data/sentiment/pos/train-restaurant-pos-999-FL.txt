Really nice menu and service  Lots of veggie options and glutenfree choices too  It can be crowded at lunch hour but thats for a good reasonpeople like it  Try after say pm and there wont be a wait  Service is quick and they change the wall art often enough to keep it interesting  This will quickly become one of your favs  MK
