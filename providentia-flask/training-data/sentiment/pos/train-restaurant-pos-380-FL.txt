I ordered a pc gizzard and wanted to add on a drink and mashed potatoes with gravy  The guy who took my order  (I believe his name was Aaron) was super cool and hooked me up with an pc meal with several extra pcs  that was the same price as the pc alone The gizzards were awesome My wife got the chicken tenders and said that she liked them better than cains Well go back for sure
