It was my first time and we went with my family and a friend We got the middle section on the middle row was an awesome experience We went on Valentines Day too and was less busy then I thought The service was great and then didnt mind us ordering lots of fries They were also able to get me left handed clubs since a few other golf places dont acquire it Coming back for sure
