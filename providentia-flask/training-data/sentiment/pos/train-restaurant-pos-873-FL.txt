Im not big one the regular menu but Cantina Laredo is the absolute best for Happy Hour  They even have Happy Hour on Saturday which is great  The margaritas here are my favorite of all time  They arent loaded with mix and have a refreshing flavor
The fajita beef quesadilla and the pescado tacos are the most delicious items on the menu   The service here is excellent and they consistently fill the chip and salsa bowls  One very important thing to know is that if u ask your server for the warm salsa they bring it out by request only  Its perfectly spicy and full of flavor  Do not miss out on the warm salsa
