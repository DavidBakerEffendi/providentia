What Ive never left a review for my favorite spot Oh where do I start Ok the Bandera margarita Its the best marg Ive ever had Three layers like the Mexican flag madori on the bottom pomegranate in the middle and regular on top Now Im not usually one for frozen or sweet marks but this is it Even the house margs are fab 
Food chips and salsa rock Lots of shrimp entrees to love Fajitas are bomb Tacos de pescado rick the shrimp stuffed pompano is one of my faves Hubby usually gets the ribeye used to be on the menu but now a special marinated in cascabel sauce Its great Love sitting on the patio people watching Good food good margs good times
