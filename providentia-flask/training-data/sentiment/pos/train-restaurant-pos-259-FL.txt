Ill bump this place up to  stars which isnt easy for me to do We hit up a few places regularly here in Gilbert Blue  Teakwoods Buffalo Wild Wings Blue  gets it right gets it good every single time Its got the consistency of a chain with the quality and service of a local restaurant (and ask for Ashley K and Kala they are the best)

Decent selection of brews but could be better (especially now that Four Peaks went to the dark side) The burgers are awesome The fries are good but theyre the battered kind which isnt my favorite The wings are cooked perfectly and theyre not too big or too small The wing sauce is not traditional Buffalo but its good

The place is good for watching sports hanging out with the family a date whatever Just a great friendly clean neighborhood bar

Dont make me regret the  stars
