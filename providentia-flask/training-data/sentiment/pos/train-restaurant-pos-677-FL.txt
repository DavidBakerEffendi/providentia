Kneaders is simply fantastic  I love Paradise Bakery and I can say very confidently that Kneaders is even better  From the sandwiches soup and salad to their mouth watering desserts  It is impossible to not be delighted with everything on the menu here  The employees are always friendly and the service is quick as well  I also liked that the condiment area is always full and the restaurant has always been very clean when weve gone there  A new favorite for my family  The only thing I do not like is that theyre closed on Sundays
