Its bowling style golf Everyone gets  swings and rotates while the score is tracked by RFID tags in the ball on the screen 

What a fun place to go with friends It was a fun and exciting  atmosphere  I was really nervous  to go as I am a real beginner but I ended up doing pretty good You dont have to bring your clubs they provide them for free 
Also you rent the bay by the hour not by the person so after everyone has a top golf member card () its a pretty cheap evening They also give military discounts
The food and service was great Interesting options We opted for the Mexican sushi wraps mushi  and it was awesome  

We went early on a Saturday morning and there were still plenty of bays open but lots of people crowding to get in I cannot wait to come back at night and see it all lit up And maybe enjoy some beers 

Kid friendly they have kid sized clubs or a club house with shuffle board and video games
