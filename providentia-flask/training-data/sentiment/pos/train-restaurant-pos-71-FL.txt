YAY  Ive found it  OK No Its not authentic Chinese food but it is authentic American Chinese food  To be even MORE specific New York Style Chinese food I grew up on the east coast and this is what Chinese food is like  Now onto the business at hand Im Chinese and I have to say this place is SOLIDakaDEEEELISH  The  dishes I always test with are the hot and sour soup and Chicken with Garlic Sauce  These  shows alot of how the chef was trained and can pretty much tell you how the rest of the dishes will be  And both were mouth watering  The dinner portion is ginormous both hubby and I could barely finish  dish  Im sure lunch portion would be the same enough to take back to your desk and munch on to survive the rest of the work day cravings  I totally agree with reviewer  for the need to support local business owners Skip PeiWei and resist the temptation to dine at trendy Chinese eateries  EARTH TO ALL CHINESE FOOD IS NOT TRENDY  It was never intended to be either  The fancier the decor the higher score on the coolfactor the worse the food is  Ive searched and searched for a hole in the wall serving Chinese foodand Ive found it  This is one is a winner
