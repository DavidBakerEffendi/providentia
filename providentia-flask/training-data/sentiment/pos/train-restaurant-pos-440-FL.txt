Recently my girlfriend decided to become a vegetarian We have been looking for new restaurants to eat at We found Seed Shack and loved it I ordered a burger and thought theyd brought me an actual beef burger patty by mistake only to find out it was all vegetables This place is great and I dont have to feel like I killed a cow Great I cant wait to go back
