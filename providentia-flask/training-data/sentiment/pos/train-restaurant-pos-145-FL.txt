Although it has taken me a while to discover Even Stevens Sandwiches Ive completely made up for it with recent back to back visits I tried the Salmon BLT on a Monday asked to have it again on Saturday and ended up having breakfast burritos for Sunday brunch Yes this was all in a week  that should tell you something 

The sandwiches have so much flavor and provide a new creative spin on a traditional Sammies So far Ive had the Salmon BLT Jackfruit Torta and the New Morrissey All were amazing Im a meat eater but these options were so appealing and well worth trying I loved the Salmon BLT around for limited time so try it I even got it twice The New Morrissey is also very flavorful and the sauce they provide makes it even better

The inside dining area is very casual clean and inviting and the service is incredibly friendly and welcoming Sometimes they play live music and there are board games for entertainment Even Stevens also focuses on giving back which is just a plus plus to the already amazing venue
