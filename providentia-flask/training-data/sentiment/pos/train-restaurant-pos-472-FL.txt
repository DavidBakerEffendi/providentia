Ok so we have been here three different times and this place is super good  I recently have when from a good solid meat eater to fish only and it is difficult to find a place that offers good food with flavor to match  Well this I place is the best in Mesa that I have found  Next to Green in Scottsdale it might be the best in Phoenix  

I would say from a cost standpoint you going to pay for what you get its not cheap but worth every penny

No lets talk about the service its clearly a small business and they are staying frugal it might take a min to get service but they are so friendly and more that willing to stop and helpexplain the menu  So with that said dont let that deter you Im just saying if your in a rush tell them I will guess they will be more than accommodating

We will be back more and more
