I ordered a catering order for breakfast for  people  The person that helped me was named Angel and her recommendations were great  The French Toast was great and had the butter and syrup on the side so they would stay warm and delicious  I also ordered oatmeal which had the toppings on the side so people could decide what they want Everything was done very well and the catering order worked out perfectly
