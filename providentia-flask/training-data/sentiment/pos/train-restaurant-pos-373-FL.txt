They have delicious and more than reasonably priced chicken Great service too They always say hi when you walk in (all of them) like their chicken tenders The food portions are huge I highly recommend My friend and I like to joke and say that this is a fancier and better version of KFC Good hot sauces too Dont forget about tender Tuesdays
