This little gem of a place was so delicious I got the Beyond Burger with sweet potato fries and it was beyond delicious They dont have gf buns yet but the server said they were coming I didnt miss it though they gave me extra greens and the light balsamic dressing and the sauce the put on the side was so yummy It was also my first taste of cashew cheese and it was really good Portion size was just right even a few fries left on my plaFree WiFi and lots of light definitely a place to chill and eat Lots of smoothie and breakfast options served all day
