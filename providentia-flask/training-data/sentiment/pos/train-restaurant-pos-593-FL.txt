Even if your a horrible golfer this place is super fun They have a full bar with some really good cocktails If its your first time they go through everything with you and hey make it super easy I do however recommend if you have a large group to have several alleys or add more time We had a group of  and played for  hours but I could have gone all night Its super neat at night because it is all lit up too
