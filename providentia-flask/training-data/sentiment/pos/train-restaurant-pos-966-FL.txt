This is our Sunday afterchurch destination Phenomenal hummus pitas pizza and wraps We like the hummus trio with grilled chicken add extra pitas and cucumbers After that go with the mahi mahi Our kids love the lavash pizza and red lentil soup Get a half and half of the tropical and green iced tea and theyll always offer up a togo cup on the way out 

My wife and I walked to the PJ in Tempe off Apache during college and now have one within biking distance again Great vibe healthy delicious food and good service
