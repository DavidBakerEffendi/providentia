I was so excited to attend the soft opening of Even Stevens a local sandwich shop which gives back to the community with every purchased meal 

Everyone that worked here was so gracious and friendly welcoming all into their space The team is like a closeknit family and I felt right at home I learned a lot about Even Stevens aim to give back to the community  where they locally source their ingredients 

This is unlike any basic sub shop think more artisanal like Earl of Sandwich They have a multitude of delicious sandwich choices with unique names like Sprang Chicken Mihami Vice and even vegetarian options like Jackfruit Torta I had the Sprang Chicken which consisted of chicken provolone avocado bacon tomatoes cucumbers greens honey mustard on multigrain bread paired with kettle chips and a pickle It was delicious They also have salads small bites and brunch options Tonight their vendor Peixoto was also there to promote their coffee Super nutty rich and delicious We also met their other vendor Cotton Country Jams who create their marmalade and jams on the sandwiches Yum and Bravo

I definitely recommend checking this spot out and supporting an awesome cause I will be a regular as this will be one of my neighborhood favorites
