WOW  I am amazed that a sports bar can have such amazing food  I dream about the house made ranch dressing   The calamari is so fresh and cooked perfectly  We really loved the flavor of the wings and shrimp  Everything was high quality and fresh   So happy to have this place by us  Happy Hour is great here too
