Always time and money well spent Ive eaten here at least a dozen times and each time the food is delicious and the service is excellent Every time Ive visited manager has stooped by the table to make sure everything is fine The chips and salsa are excellent and each entree Ive tried was great Just has the fajita tacos last nite highly recommend them For Mexican food one of my all time favorite stops
