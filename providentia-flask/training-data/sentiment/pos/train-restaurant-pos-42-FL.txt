The food is always fresh and tastes great I really enjoy coming in for lunch in between work and my appointments I can order an entree soup wonton and spring roll for less than  during lunch time Kung Pao chicken and the sweet and sour shrimp are great Yes this is slightly americanized but it has been in business for quite some time and the staff and owners are always friendly They do not hesitate to remember your face and say hello This is by far my favorite place to take a friend for a quick bite to eat if we want chinese
