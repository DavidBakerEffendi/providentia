Just checked out sauce for the first time Love this place They have an Italian chop salad that is perfect Its savory a little sweet and a little spicy It hits all of the right textures too I tried the pizza too Pepperoni and mushroom  It was awesome Pro tip if you ask for hand stretched dough it will come to you a little thicker Otherwise it is scooper thin  Dessert was nice too Pizza cookie is where it is at Staff was super friendly and helpful All around a great place Make plans to stop by
