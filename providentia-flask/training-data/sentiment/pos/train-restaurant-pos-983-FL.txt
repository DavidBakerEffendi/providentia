I went to the one at Dana Park but I cant seem to find a page for that
So I dont like to eat out very often but this place changed my mind I love Pita Jungle and honestly feel right at home Their garlic potatoes are probably the best fries Ive ever had  our food came so fast too
The food is great everyone is so friendly and its so cheap
I cant wait to go back  )
