Just wow This place is awesome Other than being a little new and not having a packed place this shop gets our full approval It wont be empty for long though Word of mouth and this place will put a dent on every other sandwich shop around here Worth a drive as they have a fantastic mission Live music just right atmosphere awesome Downtown Gilbert needed a place like this
