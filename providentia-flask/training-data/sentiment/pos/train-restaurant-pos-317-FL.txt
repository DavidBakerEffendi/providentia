Best Shrimp PoBoy hands down I also suggest the Monte Cristo if you are looking to splurge (my husband and I split it)  I have never had a bad meal here even when we bring the kids  The salads are even tasty  We had happy hour last week and plan on coming back for more extremely well priced foods  Full bar and great draft beers perfect place to watch  game
