Whoever came up with these recipes should not be working anyplace called Pita Jungle  In Cincinnati this chef could be competing with JeanRobert Pigall who owns  chefs the best restaurants in town

That name filled me with visions of cafeteria lines and makeityourself salad bars with a few piles of thin pita maybe some stuffed tigers  pythons  fake vines hanging down  And it didnt help that this location is in a strip mall  

On the inside Pita Jungle looks better than it sounds  Its a pleasant highceilinged boxshaped space lit for dates (at least in the evening)  The art on the walls was daring and interesting and apparently changes regularly  

The first surprise was the wine  They had Sauv Blanc from Marlborough and other hardtofind gems  (Pita Jungle)  We ordered the Mediterranean platter as an appetizer with a side of some garlic cilantro hummus  When it arrived I tasted it  a few of us agreed that the chef must specialize in Mediterranean food It was the best falafel  the yummiest dolmate I had ever had  

Then the rest of the food (Italian mostly) arrived at which point we became confused  The chef didnt just do Mediterranean  Why was Pita Jungles food so amazing  Nobody wanted to share entrees  We did however share an enormous plate of pistachio ice creamcovered baklava by which time we were laughing at our own astonishment  The ice cream tasted like real roasted pistachios  It was even a tiny bit salty  And it was topped with fresh cut strawberries that drew out a totally different taste  

Amazingly this place is priced like something called Pita Jungle  You could take the kids  But dont  its a great date place
