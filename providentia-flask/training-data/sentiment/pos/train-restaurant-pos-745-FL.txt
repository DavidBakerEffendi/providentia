My boyfriend and I had a great time on Valentines day here The food was amazing and it was worth spending the money on the food here We sat in the grill area and our cheif was funny and not too crazy We ordered lobster and chicken and it was amazing What I really liked about Ryu is that you get alot of food compare to other places like these Our entree included two pieces of shimp veggies and rice We had such a good time last night we are totally coming back 

ps The staff is really nice and sweet
