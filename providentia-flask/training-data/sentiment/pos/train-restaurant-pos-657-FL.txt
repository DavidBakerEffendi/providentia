Finally got around to seeing what the hype was all about I always hear people talking about this place and Im glad I finally got the opportunity to check it out myself Although I didnt make it in for breakfast which ends at  (and the sourdough pancakes sound amazing) I did get my hands on some delicious portobello artichoke soup It was so yummy I would recommend having the rye with it so yummmm
