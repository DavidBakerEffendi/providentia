One of the best Chinese restaurants Ive ever eaten at 

Let me preface my review by saying Ive lived in several states but spent the majority of my life in the upperMidwest if you like that style of Chinese food this is the place for you 

The regional differences in AmericanChinese food is heavier than many would suspect however many of my fellow Midwesterners turned Arizonians agree that this is the place to go for eastern American Chinese food

Everything weve had so far has been above average  to excellent (well except the Hot and Sour soup which was kind of blah)  Seriously I recommend this place to everyone when they ask 

(and the driver is super friendly ) )
