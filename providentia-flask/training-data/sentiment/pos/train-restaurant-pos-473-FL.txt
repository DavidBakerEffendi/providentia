Had the house made black bean burger  it was pretty delicious Came with fresh  homemade sweet potato fries which I also enjoyed  The mixed berry smoothie is yummy too Its quaint  cozy with inviting decor I would recommend eating here  also return to try something else because there were a couple of menu items that seem to be all the rage as far as reviews are concerned Service was great as well although they werent at all busy  Look forward to trying it again
