Wonderful chef funny and engaging we went for my  year olds birthday because he wanted Benihana which I find overpriced He wanted to watch them cook in front of us This place did not disappoint and to top it off was quite a bit cheaper I call this a win win Flavors were on point atmosphere was charming and the waitstaff was attentive and fun We were seated right away and the food wasnt far behind We ordered gyoza which was delicious with just the right amount of crunch the chicken teriyaki was amazing and a sizable portion The kids had steak and although it was a kids meal the size was enough to feed an adult I will definitely be back
