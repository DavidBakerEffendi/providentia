I have been visiting Cantina Laredos for over  years  We tend to visit weekly and it is a must when out of town guests visit We also had our small wedding of  there The manager Mickey was very easy to work with and helped us pick out items to work within our budget I was very pleased and so were our guests  Their food is consistently good We tend to visit during Happy Hour which affords us the opportunity to dine there more often Their happy hour menu is excellent A variety of appetizers to choose from along with beverages I often get the tacos which are awesome You get  tacos and can mix and match Top Shelf Guacamole is made table side and from what our friends say its the best around  All the Happy Hour items are nicely sized and pair that with a Margarita and who can go wrong


When I choose to not go the Happy Hour route I often get the chicken enchiladas with Mole Sauce The enchiladas are made with all white meat you can see what you are getting when your food arrives  Food is not hidden by heavy sauces cheese and beans  The Torta de Carnitas with goat cheese apricot spread and dont forget the fried egg is another great dish The egg is meant to crack open over the sandwich and allow the yolk to add great flavor to the dish The French fries have some jalapeos in it for a little kick not to mention the seasoning is very flavorful
I am not sure if it the food or drink I crave but couple the two together and it keeps us coming back  The Margaritas are the best I have ever had whether its the house a seasonal or a flavor they taste great They use fresh limes and lemons to make their house Margarita No sweet and sour mix I often get a seasonal Magritta and they have all been great as well The bartenders wait staff and managers are all very personable and know their customers  This is my favorite restaurant in Gilbert and quite frankly out of Gilbert I like the atmosphere the food the drinks and the people that work there
