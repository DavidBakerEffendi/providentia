We love this place Usually go in for lunch on a weekend before a movie They have the best margaritas Large strong and made properly Most places will use cheap sweet and sour and dont mix the ingredients properly or the pour is off Not this place you get a perfectly made delicious Margarita every time I really hate spending the  on a margarita and the bartender gives you this cheap sweet and sour gatorade color margarita that tastes like you will get diabetes The restaurant is upscale and looks great People on here complained about the price but it really isnt expensive by any means Food is great Its a different take on Mexican but in a good way that makes it inventive and fresh on the same dishes we all know Im surprised the average vote on yelp for this place isnt a  or higher
