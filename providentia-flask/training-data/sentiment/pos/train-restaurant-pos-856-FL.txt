Super yummy  We had just about everything om the menu and it was all great Service was quick and attentive Chile rellenos were cheesy goodness the chicken enchiladas were outstanding and full of flavor their happy hour nachos with fajita beef were great and the meat was tender and to top it off the strawberry mojito was sweet and refreshing Prices were a little higher than other Mexican restaurants but we had a ton of food to take home
