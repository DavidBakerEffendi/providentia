I have been here on a few different locations in each time Ive had a blast golfing game is very fun and engaging and compared to the Scottsdale top golf I barely had to wait in line to play The service was really good to the servers kept making sure our drinks were full and exact  Besides the golf I like playing the adult size Jango and the adult size beer pong with buckets and a dodgeball
