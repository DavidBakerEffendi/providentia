We came in a few weekends ago after just relocating from Scottsdale to Gilbert We we are used to sometimes having to wait quite a while at the Scottsdale location While waiting for our bay we sat downstairs at the bar and the bartenders were extremely friendly and seemed to be enjoying their time When we got to our bay we had outstanding service from our server for the  hours we were there I wish I had hung onto the receipts so I could acknowledge their service delivery We will be back
