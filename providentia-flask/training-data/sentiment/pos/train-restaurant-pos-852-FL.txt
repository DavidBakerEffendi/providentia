Living in AZ for over  years I have been everywhere for Mexican food  It wasnt until a few years ago I found cantina Laredo  Now my fav Mexican food in AZ I find myself judging a Mexican food place by the chips and salsa well enough said Best chips salsa  and steak fajitas   On top of that the service is always perfect  Im an apple pie guy Well this is also the best sizzling apple pie ever  Special thanks to server Brandyn D Love this place
