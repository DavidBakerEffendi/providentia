Had a birthday party and rented  bays with food and drinks (I didnt pay so not  on cost ) The service was amazing our server was exclusive to our party and made she we had the food and drinks we needed Our party ranged from months  years old everyone had a good time The seating is very comfortable tv screens to watch the game and amazing technology to keep score Only bad thing was finding a parking spot Good luck with that on a weekend next time I may just use their valet service
