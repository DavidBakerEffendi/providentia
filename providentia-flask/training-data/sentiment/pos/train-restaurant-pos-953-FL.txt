Im bumping up a star  This location has a really nice atmosphere and the customer service has been very good  I think the kids menu is one of the best around  My daughter loves all the choices  Its a great idea  The Red Pepper Hummus is delish  There are so many different things to choose from and its all really healthy  I love Pita Jungle
