I love this place I found it attending a BNI meeting as a visitor Now that I am a member I get to eat there every week The salsa is off the charts The last time I ate there I had the beef quesadillas and I was floored with the flavor of the meat The staff are pleasant and provide a enjoyable dinning experience Shauna is our server and she is on point See you Thursday
