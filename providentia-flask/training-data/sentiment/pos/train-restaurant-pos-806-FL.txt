I had a wonderful lunch there today They had a  course meal special going on so I took advantage of it and loved every bite I started off with a chicken taquito appetiser had a wonderful steak and enchilada entree and ended with a delicious dessert with strawberries ice cream and cinnamon chips The server was great and very attentive We never wanted for a drink refill or more chips I will go back to Cantina Laredo soon
