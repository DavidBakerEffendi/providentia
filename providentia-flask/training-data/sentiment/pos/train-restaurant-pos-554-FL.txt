Fun times The birthday boy wanted to go to Topgolf Oh geez st time for me but not my last Truth in not into golf I had so much fun despite the long wait  total  damage It was a Saturday night so any happening place has a line No biggie We also intentionally waited for the sun to go down hoping for temps to be  or lower  There are strong fans with misters  for each bay We had the end one so our fan didnt oscillate nor did we have to share it  Even though the decks are curved we were still at a disadvantage for the huge lighted scoring holes  I did mention I dont golf right Eh So I had fun trying to wack the ball  not just have it roll of the edge to the other people on the lizard lower decks Yes there is a net at the edge for everyones safety For me I compare this to bowling  with friends Who ever is playing is up there doing hisher own thing The rest of us are drinking talking eating laughing  dancing  (DJ on Sat nights ) on the lounge couchchairs  Yes I suck at bowling too  I still have fun Maybe it was the lateness of the night or the partying of the folks in the other closer banks we rarely saw our waiter We didnt order as many drinks as wanted or any food to nosh Also restroom was far considering where we were playing at  stars from me because the concept is awesome  We had a blast Im hoping to have better experience now that I know
