We tried this place today and loved it From the welcoming staff great environment and amazing food we highly recommend going here 

We tried different sandwiches and enjoyed them both very much They offer many choices for drinks and the local San Tan Beer is also available here 

The very roomy seating open windows and comfy couch set up makes it a great place to not only eat but we enjoyed hanging out finishing our drinks while our son played with the wooden checkers 

In addition they have a amazing cause For every sandwich purchased Even Stevens donates one to a local nonprofit Now that is something I  

We will return to Even Stevens again
