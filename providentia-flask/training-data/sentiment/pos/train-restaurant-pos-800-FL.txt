Coming from a coastal city Im always skeptical of sushi here in the valley BUT THIS PLACE IS AMAZING With fresh fish delivered at least  times a week and the friendliness of the staff makes this place hands down the ONLY sushi place for me here in AZ Their rolls are delicious and the interactions with the sushi chefs (especially John) were entertaining 
Although I did not try the tappanyaki the smells wafting over to the sushi bar alone made my mouth water HIGHLY recommend this place as whole The lively atmosphere and tasty eats make it totally worth it
