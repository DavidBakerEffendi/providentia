We have never had a bad thing to eat here  Oh I take that back Over the years things cant be perfect but on that rare occasion that something wasnt right or didnt live up to our expectation apologies were made and the issue corrected   Tonight I had the pastrami sliders and a caesar salad  the pastrami was fjantastic not at all fatty I was served  sandwiches which was a surprise based on the price and past experiences I had only expected   
Glad we stopped in again and I know well be back again
