We had a birthday dinner originally at Osaka When we got there there was two huge teppan tables taken up by very young children that were constantly chanting loudly It was I bit overwhelming So we recommended ryu We all reconvened at ryu sushi and teppanyaky to find the best atmosphere and Chris our chef Had a great time and great food If you want teppanyaki and good sushi Go to ryu This place never disappoints
