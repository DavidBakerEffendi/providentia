Our first time to Topgolf was last night and we were given a  hour estimated wait time Not a big deal since we anticipated it (Saturday night) Dinner came next at a nearby restaurant and as soon as we were done with our dinner we got the text that our golfing bay was ready ahead of schedule Hooray Had a ton of fun Somehow our debit card was left behind and we got a super nice call from the manager letting us know that it was being kept safe We returned again tonight to retrieve it and decided to play some more golf We had a  minute wait which ended up being  minutes We invited a bunch of friends and ended up renting out  golfing bays We had a super great time for what ended up being several hours and a freakin awesome server Jeremy He was super personable and on top of our orders despite them being so scattered (sorry) Our food and drinks were on point and came in a super timely manner Top notch customer service tonight Definitely will be returning )
