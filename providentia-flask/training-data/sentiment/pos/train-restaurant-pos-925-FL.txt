Yesterday was our first time here We were both pleasantly surprised Yummy chips and salsa The food was served beautifully Presentation is very important to me I eat mostly clean food I was not disappointed The noise level was low enough that I didnt have to shout or have my husband repeat himself over and over We walked our after our meals very satisfied and excited that we have found a New to us favorite Mexican restaurant
