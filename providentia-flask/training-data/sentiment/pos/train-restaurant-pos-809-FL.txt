I am absolutely in heaven enjoying the enchilada veracruz right now Its light and healthy  filled with chicken and spinach with a side of grilled zucchini but it is huge in flavors and totally hits the spot It has a little kick to it which is perfect Their chips and salsa are great  the chips are light and crispy lightly salted And I still cant decide which salsa I like best of the two 

The house margarita is tasty A little sweeter than Im normally used to but it pairs well with the dish The server is fantastic and everything came out quick Definitely a spot to hit again if Im in town
