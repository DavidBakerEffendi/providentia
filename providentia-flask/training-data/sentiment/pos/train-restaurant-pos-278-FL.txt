Best so called Sport Bar in the valley  an its in my back yard thats why it gets my  star attention 

The morons that rate it any lower  stay the hell out of my bar

They have  Peaks beer on tap stiff pour drinks great service a small yet diverse menu (and get this)  grind their own angus beef  fresh dip onion rings Who does that

If you like the taste of fresh quality beef Ive found no better burgers in town Order them with no sauce and revel in there beefy goodness 

On the lighter side order the Mahi tacos If you want to taste the quality of the fish special order them with very light seasoning That means no canjun seasoning ask them for even reduced quantity of their normal salt  pepper This goes for all their seafood IMO 

You can thank me later Ill be at the bar
