This place is great We went on a Friday night and it was busy but since we were a party of  it went by fast for us Our server was really cool and sweet to us We ordered a root beer float a beer fish and chips and a oz sirloin all for  dollars Their fish and chips is super good its beer battered and has the perfect crunch to it It was served with cold slaw and French fries but I substitute it for sweet potato fries instead My bf said the steak had really good flavoring but it has a lot of gilet (which is hard pieces of meat) not the best steak ever It came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies Overall its a great place to for chow down on bar food It is a loud environment (hence bar) but there are a lot of TVs and a cool place to hang Will come again
