After  weeks of procrastinating my wife and I decided to try this place out We live about  minutes away so thats what took so long First things first the location was kind of in the middle of nowhere in this slow traffic shopping center But none the less we found it and once inside it was really quite an experience The music they were playing got us in the mood to chow down on some delicious plant based foods I had the incredible burger PBJ style and my wife had the beyond burger traditional style We both had some of the others burger and it was our first time trying these I have to admit I was kind of freaked out the whole time because of how real the texture and taste was compared to a real burger Id definitely go back again and try other things My son had the Mac and cheese and it was delicious I ordered side of seaweed salad and that was bomb I highly recommend this place to all It was a little pricey but that was you get when you eat food thats really good for you and the environment Jade the owner was awesome
