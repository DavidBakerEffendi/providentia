Over the years we have visited several of the Blue  locations its a great well known local chain The service is ALWAYS very good The food is always good Some of our favorite include the Shrimp  Applewood Bacon Quesadilla Spinach Artichoke Dip Rib appetizer or entre Buffalo Chicken Salad Chicken  Avocado Club all the burgers (my husband loves them) Grilled Shrimp (my favorite) and BE SURE TO GET THE FRESH BAKED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES (ADDICTING)  Management is always on point if there is a mistake which rarely happens The only item I wish Blue  would improve on is the wine selection This IS a LOCAL favorite and is busy most days even when other places are not On Thursday Friday Saturday you may want to call ahead to put your name on this list We have a child so we try to eat here early to avoid the rush or call ahead This is a family friendly sports bar the bar is separated from the main restaurant seating area and each location has at least  TVs  a sports watchers dream (my husband)
