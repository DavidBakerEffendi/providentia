We moved close to Ryu about two months ago and we could not be happier with the food the service or the experience  You can tell that John and the group that manages this restaurant truly care about the experience you have  The sushi is some of the best I have ever had which is not something I say lightly  Having grown up in the bay area I was exposed to some of the best fish the world has to offer  Sitting down in Ryu for one of their masterfully created sushi dishes it is hard not to imagine that you arent in downtown San Fran They are truly amazing artists

The Teppanyaki experience is really amazing  Whether its just for your family or you want to bring in business guests for something unique you wont be disappointed  The chefs are masters and your food will be as fresh succulent as you could ever ask for  You may have to wait sometimes for a seat but sometimes the best things come with a little patience
