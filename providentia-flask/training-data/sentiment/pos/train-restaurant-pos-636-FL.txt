Pleasantly surprised tonight

My buddy has a Platinum membership and I will say that after seeing how Top Golf treated us as Platinum members and their guests that is definitely the only way to go

First they drove us in a limo up to the rd floor at least they might as well had They were extremely welcoming from the moment we walked in I did lack direction when I first showed up I was a newbie and the Top Golf veterans had already started Luckily my buddy came and got me and showed me what to do

We went to our place in the Platinum area and our server Ryan was rad Super helpful Management also made sure to stop by often to check on us and make sure we were doing well

The food and drinks were brought out promptly and were delicious They just have it all figured out

The games were fun I love to golf and I love hitting up the range but this was a whole new experience Super fun Not Star Wars role play fun but still very entertaining

Ill be recommending this place to everyone Touch Top Golf
