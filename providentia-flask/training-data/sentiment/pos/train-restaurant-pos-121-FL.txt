My wife and I stopped in for a late lunch between pm  There was one or her couple  we ordered and seated ourselves  I ordered the Cuban sandwic and a side of vegetables and my wife ordered a chicken salad  Food cane quickly and we were both satisfied with the taste of our food  Place is decorated nicely with a cool casual vibe  We borh recommend this place
