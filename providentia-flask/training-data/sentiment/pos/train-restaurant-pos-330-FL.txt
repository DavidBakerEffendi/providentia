I have been to this restaurants location in Scottsdale and the one in Gilbert and have absolutely loved their food both times  Service was great also  They have so many great things on their menu I will be back to try many more dishes  I wasnt very hungry the nd time I went and had the Chicken Tortilla soup and ordered loaded fries  A huge plate of fries came out piled with cheese green onions bacon sour cream  To die for  I had so much left over I took the fries home and the next morning chopped them up put them on my grill warmed them up and put some scrambled eggs with them and put them in a tortilla and made fantastic breakfast burritos  (had no idea if that would work but they came out really well)  My husband tried one of the pasta dishes and absolute loved it  We will definitely be back  Service was good both locations prices are reasonable for all the food you get
