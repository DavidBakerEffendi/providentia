Finally tried Top Golf A few friends and I went last night for some food and golf Its a neat place and we had a blast

Our server Jesse was great He took good care of us
The menu was big but we settled on the fetapecancranberryspinach salad with chickenyum And Dh got the sunrise burger with bacon and fried egg on it on a gluten free bun too bonus Fries are too too )

Golfing was coolwere terrible but still enjoyed it Clubs are provided and the chips in the balls track where they go Really enjoyed the lit targets as it got dark Misters and fans kept us quite comfortable while we golfed 

Cant wait to go back A fun night with good friends and good food
