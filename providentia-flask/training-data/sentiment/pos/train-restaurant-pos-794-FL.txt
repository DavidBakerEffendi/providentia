I dont dole praise for sushi restaurants easily My husband and I are our selfproclaimed sushi snobs and we are so grateful that we have Ryu so close to home for a quick and tasty sushi fix 

Specifically we really enjoy the barbecued salmon roll spicy tuna roll veggie roll and sashimi The spicy tuna roll is what we use as a litmus test to judge if a sushi restaurant is good and worth a return visit It is and we continue to come back 

The staff is great Really great We can put away a lot of sushi and so were grateful when the waitstaff doesnt make us feel bad for having good appetites The Ryu staff has always treated us respectfully and were glad to see them when we stop by or pick up 

I highly recommend Ryu especially for their sushi
