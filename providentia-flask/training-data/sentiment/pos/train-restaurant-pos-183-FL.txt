Lady on the street told me to try the breakfast food here(I was on my bike) Elizbeth and I decided to try it (Elizbeth likes the breakfast burritos at the Original Burrito Company in Awatukee just to far to drive) This place is hidden behind the restaurant row on Gilbert road 

Make this your next breakfast adventure
I had the breakfast sandwich medium eggs with ham Omg The ham was the star of the show Great sandwich
I guess you should expect great sandwiches from a sandwich shop but these guys are going all out
E had the grad breakfast burrito and really liked it With a little arm twisting this might be her local replacement for the Awatukee burrito she loves I tried it and Im sold 

Enjoy breakfast here youll be happy
