This place is amazing I love it so much 

Atmosphere fresh hip casual easy going 

Food friendly for all types of diets

Staff helpful pleasant and quick

I came in here on a Saturday after going to the market in Gilbert with my mom  son We skimmed the huge menu boards but if you really wanna know the food descriptions there are menus next to the counter to read We chose the Hummazing and the New Morrisey and of course Brava Tots (sauce on the side) We try and eat a mostly vegan diet so it is refreshing to not have to change ANYTHING on a menu item for once I always love that 

So I cant describe how delicious everything was My moms hummus sandwich was so good Fresh veggies and yummy sauce ughhh I could eat that every day My breakfast wrap was amazing as well Loaded with tots soyrizo tofu and veggies YUM A side of tots is also a must (The brava sauce is not vegan We got it on the side tho) YUM A MILLION TIMES YUM 

Ive been back here twice since then Equally great experiences each time

I love the giving back to the community part and the support they give local businesses Really an amazing place I cant wait to bring my friendsfamily to when they visit
