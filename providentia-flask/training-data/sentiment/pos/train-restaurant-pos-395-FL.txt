Ok I come to Bushs quite a bit and let me tell you this The food is incredible They have the best chicken fingers So crispy Their sweet tea is off the charts The jalapeo ranch sauce I could seriously eat with everything As mentioned in other posts the restaurant is not the most efficient but the employees are all very nice Its just a small quirk to put up with to get the best dang food around Worth the wait trust me
