Ive never had a pita with a pickle in it before but I like it

Awesome kids menu  the little ones can choose one each of a veggie a grain a protein and a fruit for   And their meal includes a drink  Last time I went I mentioned to the waitress that I didnt want to order a whole kids meal for my daughter and that I was considering just getting a side of something for her and the waitress informed me that I could order anything off of the kids menu a la carte  Sweet

The place is packed at lunch time but the wait is not usually too long  The food and friendly service are worth it
