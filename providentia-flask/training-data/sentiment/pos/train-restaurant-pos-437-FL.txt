I cannot say enough about this place
My husband booked the Valentines dinner last night and OMG how amazing everything was
Dim lights with candles   they gave us a warm infused tea tree oil towel to use as some food was finger food
The food was amazingwith a delicate taste and plated like a gourmet restauranti believe whoever works in the kitchen knows their job and put heart and soul in it
The ladies who were running the food were great smiling and knowledgeable about food 
This is The Place to goVegan or notfor great food and great atmosphere 
Finaly a real Vegan place in the valley 

 stars are not enough for this place
