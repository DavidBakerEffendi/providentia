First of all this is a sports bar and you should expect as much going in That said as sports bars go this one earns all  stars My husband and I come here pretty often and we are never disappointed The service is always excellent and the food is consistent and good Lately Ive been having a love affair with fish tacos and the Mahi tacos here are awesome My husband usually gets a burger or the buffalo chicken flatbread and he is always happy
One thing I really appreciate about this place is that as far as I can tell the food tastes like it was made from scratch Its not like typical bar food that moved right from the freezer to fryer They put a little more effort than most into the food and you can taste the difference
Is it crowded Sometimes Is it loud Usually Is it worth a try Absolutely
