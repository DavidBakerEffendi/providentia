We had never heard of Cantina Laredo  We were out bike shopping yesterday in Gilbert and it was lunch time and we wanted to try this restaurant  Being vegans makes it difficult to eat out  The Manager RJ was very accommodating to our diet needs and our waiter Jon brought out two delicious nutritious meals for my husband and myself  Cruelty and cholesterol free No dairy and no meat  We had a spinach artichoke enchilada with a side of rice and zucchini and we also had a chili relleno with fresh mushrooms and other roasted veggies  It was a hearty and fresh meal The ambiance is very nice too even cloth napkins which you dont find much anymore  Id recommend this restaurant to vegans especially with the employees willingness to cater to our dietary wants
