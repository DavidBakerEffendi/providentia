Great spot Not particularly the place I would have taken two toddlers but they rolled with the punches and allowed us a good meal out of the house despite the small mess our munchkins made Thank you Im always leary when dining out because I have chosen an alternative glutendairyfree lifestyle but was pleasantly impressed that they were so accommodating It was no bother to remove the cheese or sauce from my fish tacos (and removing or not eating the shells myself at the table was obviously a breeze) Yum Though eating the chips was difficult a small spoonful of salsa every so often still made me feel like part of the experience Great Now im hungry
