Love LoLos place is in a great atmosphere and it makes you feel right at home The service is awesome they give you what you ask them and so friendly too Everything on the menu is amazing especially when I order my smothered fried chicken lost for words just talking about it Anyway this is a place to go to if you like southern culture and it brings you into that mood I would recommend to bring your family or your friends its that good
