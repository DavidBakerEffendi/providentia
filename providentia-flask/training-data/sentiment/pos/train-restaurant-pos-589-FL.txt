So I learned something new about myself tonight I am terrible at golf Thats ok though because to play Top Golf you dont really have to be very good at all My husband and I havent been out to do something fun in awhile so we stopped by to share a pitcher of beer and play a few games and it was so much fun It kind of reminds me of bowling but not really because its golf It keeps score depending on which circle you get your ball in so maybe thats why I kept thinking of bowling ) either way its a lot of fun They have a pretty cool bar the menu is great and the view of the mountains is beautiful I cant wait to go back
