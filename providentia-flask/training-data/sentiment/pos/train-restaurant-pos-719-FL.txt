Seriously awesome Half the price of any other teppanyaki joint around Went with my friend for dinner and the chef was really awesome and nice Had a really engaging experience and the food was fresh and delicious The waitress forgot that we ordered gyozo but I overlooked that since they really give you you moneys worth We will be back
