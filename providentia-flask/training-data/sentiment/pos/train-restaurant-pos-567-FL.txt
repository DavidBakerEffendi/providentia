Best Top Golf in the valley   Got the membership and my wife and I use it  to  times a week and always enjoy it   The wait staff is great and do an outstanding job   Because of its popularity we do avoid it on Friday and Saturday nights  but always enjoy it during the week especially in the morning  Have had a recent negative issue with the Scottsdale location and will not go back there  but I love the Gilbert Top Golf   Keep up the good work
