Love it Love it love it 
Ive gone to this restaurant three or four times now and each time I try something different and each time I enjoyed the food and experience

My friend and I went to the restaurant a few Saturdays go for lunch they had four largescreen TVs on so we were able to watch the game The food was good our waitress had a great personality we enjoyed ourselves I found out last week he took his wife back for dinner he liked it just that much
