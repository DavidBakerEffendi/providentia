Its great food much better than the average Chinese restaurant of the Phoenix area  The only one in Arizona that is better is Luckys in Tucson but thats as much for location and atmosphere as it is for food  

The other commenter about the soup nazi staff was right on and I was so amused by this that I will go back again and again  I had my order in a message on my phone  I was looking at my phone when I was ordering at the counter  She told me I was too busy  that I shouldnt be texting  I tried really hard not to laugh because she was dead serious  It nearly took me back to the s and Goffs restaurant in Dallas  

Four stars for the Snow Hill Chicken and an extra star for the admonition over texting
