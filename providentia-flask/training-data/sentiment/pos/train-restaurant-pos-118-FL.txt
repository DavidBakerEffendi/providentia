This place was phenomenal Exceeded my expectations leaps and bounds I wanna eat the whole menu I look forward to brunches here

I had the jackfruit torta and I was impressed Even a friend of mine thought it was chicken The salsa is house made and the avocado was very fresh The owner was very sweet and I am super excited that he works with local businesses to help build his amazing menu Like Peixoto coffee They serve it I love getting two good things in one place 

Overall the atmosphere was super hip they had a really wonderful DJ playing all my favorite classic hits of s I would come back I am already telling all my friendscoworkersfamily members about Guess a found a Bday brunch spot thanks for having us
