Ill be the first to admit itI rarely give a place a second chance especially when our first experience has been so poor However after seeing more and more positive reviews for the teppanyaki we decided to give RYU one more shot

We had the calamari and the scallops  both of which were cooked perfectly The fried rice was great and so where there veggies )

Our cook also kept us entertained 

We will definitely return for teppanyaki )
