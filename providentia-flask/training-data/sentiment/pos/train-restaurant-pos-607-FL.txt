Super fun atmosphere for families groups of friends or parties The waitstaff is very friendly and make it a great experience We went on a Thursday night and it wasnt very crowded at all We will definitely bring friends with us to split the cost of a bay next time but we still had fun just my husband and I ) it could be a cool couples date night spot
