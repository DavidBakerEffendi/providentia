We stopped in before a movie My husband ordered the mozzarella fontina  Basil pizza The crust is very thin in crispy which I prefer but many dont If youre s thick crust person this is probably not the place for you  I had the turkey feta salad and green tea The salad was HEAVEN Absolutely delicious I couldnt finish it and since salads dont save I literally mourned not being able to finish the salad It was a very sad moment Needless to say the salad was a decent size Ill be back with a hunger large enough to devour the salad Its myvgoal Lol
