Really great gluten free sub using Udis loaf Sandwiches are simple which I like although a bit over priced even without the gf bun charge Employees were well informed on the companys gf policy They changed gloves had a separate cutting board and knife and even wiped down the meat and cheese slice all without me even requesting The two guys working in the morning I went were very friendly and you can tel they enjoy their jobs
