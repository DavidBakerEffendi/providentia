Met for lunch here last Sunday The place has a coffeehouse vibe A young woman played guitar and sang She was good The service was very good and friendly Made us feel welcome
I had the grilled cheese with jalapeos and a side salad The sandwich was GREAT and the Salad was surprisingly fresh There were  of us and everything was fresh and tasty Definitely recommend it and going back again Food was delicious and music too
