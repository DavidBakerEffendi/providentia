First let me chuckle at the reviews that rate it low because its busy or loud  FolksREALLY  Seriously you rate this place low because you cant sit right down on a weekend night you have some issues If an empty quiet place is what you are looking for Burger King and Harveys right next door to Blue may be the spot for you 

Okay first service is always top notch   The servers are great friendly attentive and most importantly  knowledgeable on ALL of the menu items 

Is the food gourmet  Nope it is a sports bar but personally I have not found a place that compares the quality and taste of the food at this place  I am not kidding there is not one menu item that I have tried that I havent enjoyed  My personal favorites boneless wings grilled mahi tacos buffalo chicken flat bread pizza and pasta alfredo  

This is by far my families and my favorite dinner spot and it seems by the crowds many agree with me
