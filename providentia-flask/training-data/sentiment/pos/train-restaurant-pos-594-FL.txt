My employer took our management team here to celebrate the end of the fiscal year The food was pretty good They put out a nice buffet with buffalo chicken wings and sliders beef sliders a couple other flavors of wings and a veggie tray The game itself was pretty fun The best part was the staff They were all energetic and helpful They definitely contributed to the party atmosphere
