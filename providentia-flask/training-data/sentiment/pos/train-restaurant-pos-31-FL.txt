Walking in the restaurant it looks super cute and diner like I love the friendly staff that greets me when I walk in It always smells good and the atmosphere of the place is casual and comfortable Theres a cute little Buddha watching you on the front counter as you pick up your togo order that I always love to see 
   Ive been coming Yao since I moved to Chandler and its my favorite Chinese food place My go to order is the Singapore rice noodles it has so many fresh ingredients in the actual entree things like shrimp pork egg bell pepper carrots and more The noodles are super thin and delicate and I love them 
   I tell my friends about this place all the time and I beg them to go because I love it here Ive never once had a bad experience and I think everyone should try this restaurant at least once if they live in the chandlergilbert area The food is always prepared fast and fresh and you get a lot for a low price overall Yao has good quality food and great customer service
