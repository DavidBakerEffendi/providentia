Hubby and I love this place When we decided to move to Gilbert last year our first priority was finding a sushi joint in the area After a few misses we found Ryu conveniently less than  minutes from our house 

The decor is great Very tasteful and cool not over the top like a lot of sushi places tend to be 

The owner is seriously the sweetest person the planet Whenever we come in she comes over and hugs us asks how my parents are doing (theyre snowbirds) Shes always happy to recommend things for us to try and so far weve loved everything shes suggested 

Anyway onto what you really care about the food Their fish is always fresh and the rolls are always tight I cant stand when my roll falls apart after I dip it in soy sauce If you like salmon you MUST try the rainbow trout and salmon belly theyre seriously to die for We always order a sour roll (without lemon juice as sometimes they put way too much on) and the BBQ salmon roll along with sashimi Weve tried a few of their other rolls hubby and friends more than me as most of their special rolls are spicy and I dont do spicy So far everythings been delicious 

Their Teriyaki chicken and salmon is also really good according to my parents 

Our only complaint is that they dont have much in the way of specials or happy hour so its a bit expensive Definitely worth every penny though
