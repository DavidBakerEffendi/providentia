AMAZING Such a fun experience for any age or any time of day The prices may seem high for the hourly rate but its split among all players in that cell (up to  I think) There are several games to choose from and I would recommend the TopGolf if its your first time think of it like bowling The service is great and the food is even better The do it yourself donut holes are a must try If you do have people in your group who choose not to participate in the golfing there is so much more to do Xbox Kinect Giant Jenga Bear Ball foosball tables pool tables etc The best part is they serve great beers to wash down the experience
