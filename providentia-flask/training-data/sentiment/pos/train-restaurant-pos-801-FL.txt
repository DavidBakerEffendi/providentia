Does this restaurant get five stars because of its ambiance food or great service  No  Dont get me wrong it was great food at a decent price but this review is slightly biased

Since work sent me out to Arizona for the weekend I got to see my brother who I only see a few times a year  Its weird as you get older the family that you wanted to get away from to become an individual is the one that you want to get closer and closer to  

Though I had to fly out to Phoenix Saturday morning do some work then drive out to Sierra Vista early Sunday do some work and drive back to Phoenix the same day (Sierra Vista is about  hours away from Phoenix) I would do it all over again just to spend some time with him

I did remind him that he gave me dog poop and told me it was chocolate when I was a kid though  That Ill never forget
