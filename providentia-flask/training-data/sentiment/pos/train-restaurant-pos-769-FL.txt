We stopped in on a Sunday for dinner  We ate at the tappenyaki grill with the kids and it was fun  We had chef Chris  The food was good and the chef was entertaining  The service was great add the waitress was on top of our drinks and keeping the foods coming  I would recommend this place for both good and service
