This is THE BEST sub place in the valley Ive eaten at the original Jersey Mikes restaurant down the Jersey shore and can testify this is the real deal Everything they make is great but the Italian subs with all the trimmings make my mouth water just thinking about them MUCH better than Subway Firehouse or Jimmy Johns (particularly the JJs on Germann by the Home Depot They are a disgrace to the Jimmy Johns franchise) There is an awful lot of FAKE NYC NJ and Chicago style food in Arizona but Jersey Mikes subs are authentic to their origins Tony Soprano and his family would eat here I will probably eat here at least weekly
