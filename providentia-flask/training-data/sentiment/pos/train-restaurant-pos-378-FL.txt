We visited Bushs Chicken today at about  in the afternoon on a Saturday Super friendly staff all seem to be enthused with a manager leading them around he was also enthused We both ordered the two piece chicken meal we both enjoyed dark meat my husband had macaroni and cheese I had the french fries both came with a roll and a large drink yum yum and yum reminds me of our chicken place back home crispy crust with the right around of seasoning and the chicken was juicy and wellcooked we have been hoping something like this would move into the area we will be back and tell everyone about this great new restaurant
