Wow Very impressed I was looking for a simple breakfast sandwich and was blown away Took some driving around to find as its behind the parking garage in Downtown Gilbert We went early on Saturday morning The place is very hipster and laid back I ordered a breakfast sandwich with sausage and scrambled eggs Wow this thing was massive Two sausage patties and two layers of egg On a perfect toasty brioche bun Oh and it had maple syrup on it To my surprise it came with tator tots So good Next time I want to try it with a medium cooked egg 

Cant wait to go back and try other sandwiches
