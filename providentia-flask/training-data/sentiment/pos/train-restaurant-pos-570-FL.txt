This is an additional update to my previous reviews Someone from corporate reached out to help resolve the issues with my initial review and I appreciate them for that

She invited me back in and I brought my brother for his birthday and we had a great time The service was excellent and the manager made sure to stop by our bay and check in on us It was a great second experience Thank you
