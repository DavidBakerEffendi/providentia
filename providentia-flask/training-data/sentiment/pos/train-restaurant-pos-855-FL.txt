Only experience was happy hour but it was fabulous and inexpensive We sat at the bar and received great service and stiff drinks Great prices on their house margaritas and the chips and salsa are tasty We love that you have other areas in the mall to walk around to when you are done with your festivities We will definitely back for actual dinner at some point
