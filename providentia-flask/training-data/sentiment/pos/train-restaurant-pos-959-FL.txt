I have never been to Pita this was my first memorable visit there during my lunch hour I thought since it was very crowded that it would take forever to get my food but it took less than  minutes I ordered their broiled chicken pita and it was very tasty The only thing is that I should have told them without the garlic sauce since it makes my pita a little soggy but besides that I enjoyed it and will definitely go back to explore more on the menu Atmosphere is noisy and busy the employees are very helpful and professional
