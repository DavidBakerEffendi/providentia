I feel so lucky to have the Seed Shack so close to my home I have visited several times and have been impressed with everything Ive ordered All of of the dishes are so flavorful creative healthy and delicious That combination is rare Some of my favorites are the beet burger with sweet potato fries jackfruit pita with lentils and cauliflower chickpea tacos Also the ambiance and decor is great and the owner Jade is just the sweetest It doesnt matter if youre an omnivore vegetarian or vegan because I think anyone would enjoy their experience at Seed Shack
