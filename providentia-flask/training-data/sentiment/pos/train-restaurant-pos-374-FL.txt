I came here because of a post I saw on a Facebook page and Im super happy I did I dont eat fried chicken  to often but this place may change that The chicken isnt greasy it has plenty of actual meat and the skin is so crispy that it was hard to not eat it all The dinner roll was buttery soft and delicious The mashed potatoes were creamy and the perfect amount to accompany my meal

The drive through isnt your typical drive through You are face to face with a person and the girl who took my order was incredibly friendly I ordered and within a couple of minutes she was back with our food

Bottom line is this is an awesome place friendly staff quick service with amazing chicken  I will definitely go back
