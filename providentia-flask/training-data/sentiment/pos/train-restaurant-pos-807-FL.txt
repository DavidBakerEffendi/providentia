I honestly dont know how anyone (who ate what I ate at least) could give this place anything BUT  stars  I am giving it  stars even though I did not like the salty chips or salsa  thats how good the main course was  I had the special  course meal thing they had  started off with some nacho things that were AMAZING  SO GOOD  pork ones by far were my favorite  then onto the main course which was a steak and enchilada  the meat was so flavorful on this it was crazy and it was ended with flan for dessert  very tasty  I cant wait to go back and try other things on the menu  This is probably  my new favorite spot for Mexican food in the east valley from now on  GO TRY IT
