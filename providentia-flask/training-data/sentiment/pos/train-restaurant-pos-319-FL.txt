Classy clean sports bar with great food and great service I have been here many times and was just there again this past weekend We had about  people in our party and we were seated right away Our waitress Dalice was very friendly and didnt miss a thing Drinks were brought out quickly and the refills just kept coming All the food orders came out in a decent time frame and not one person had anything bad to say about the food I had the buffalo chicken wrap The chicken was cooked perfectly and it had just the right amount of sauce on it I am not a sports fan so I dont care about the TVs and the set up but I did notice that no matter where you sat you had a view of multiple TVs 
Another great experience at Blue
