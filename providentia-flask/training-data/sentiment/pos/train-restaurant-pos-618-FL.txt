So much fun Im no golf enthusiast but the atmosphere the music the food and the drinks make this place such a dynamic place to come with friends and family Ive done a couple corporate outings here as well Despite my lack of interest in becoming the next pro golfer the driving range itself is a blast Definitely recommend for any type of outing from date to team building exercise
