I love this place been going since it opened and I am so happy it has survived and thrived mama san is the best person and truly cares for everyone and the food is great the best sushi I have ever had and that is counting from my world travels the only sushi I have ever had that is so good soy sauce would be an injustice thank you so much mama san PS dont put soy sauce on anything until you have tried it first I learned that from mama san after she yelled at me for it ) and she was right and just so you know this is the cleanest sushi place I have ever been to
