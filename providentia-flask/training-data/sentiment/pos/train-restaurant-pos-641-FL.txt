I love this top golf My company got to experience the platinum experience tonight Brad Abby and Ross made this an exceptional experience We are a luxury car dealership in north Phoenix and we were discussing tonight how its worth passing the other location to come out here The environment for company meetings holiday parties and celebrations just makes sense in Gilbert Its the right type of busy to be fun but doesnt feel like theres too many people here My team had a blast tonight and you made me look like a hero for getting this booked in my bosses eyes If youre considering Membership I highly recommend Gilbert
