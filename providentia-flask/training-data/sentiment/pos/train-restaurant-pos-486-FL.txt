Ummmmmm yeah So from what I know there are  Top Golfs in the city one in Scottsdale and one in Gilbert I never had a chance to make it out to the Scottsdale one but if its like the one in Gilbert I finally understand what all the hype is about This place is so much fun whether you like to golf or not There are  stories full of bays to golf from that are set up for single players or large group of players They have a barseating area inside if you dont want to play golf or if you have to wait for a bay you have something else to do They also have an outside barseating area on the rd floor If the place is packed like it was the night we went they open up their banquet hall so people have more room to sit and eat

Food  They have a really decent menu Lots to chose from Pizza burgers wings tacos salads yummy I had their nachos and their buffalo chicken sliders The nachos are delicious large chips layered in your choice of meat cheese bean puree this chimichurri sauce it was delicious The buffalo chicken sliders were also very tasty Spicy wing sauce served with lettuce tomato and ranch

Atmosphere  Very fun laid back good for dates singles and families

Service  Great service The night we went a pro football player rented out the entire rd floor for a Gopro special so it was packed Not only was there enough staff to take care of peoples golfing needs there was enough to greet people when we entered exited for valet parking servers bar tenders everyone was on the ball and all smiles

Overall we had a great time Cant wait to go back

Good side note  You do have to purchase a one time golf card for  when you first go you pay by the hour for your games Each game is about  swings per person If its your first time a concierge will walk you to your bay and help set you up
