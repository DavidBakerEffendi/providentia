I have to admit I was definitely the biggest naysayer when it came to trying out Topgolf For some reason I just assumed it would be like every other mini golfdriving range sports bar and I always declined invitations to attend How wrong I was It should be notedthat I am reviewing top golf during a beautiful spring day on a Sunday afternoon I have no idea how crowded it is in the evenings for the rest of the week  

First off the place is incredibly well organized and has plenty of staff to assist in all your needs albeit most of them are only about years old  After paying a nominal card fee you are taken to your assigned driving range area complete with private booths TV and semi personal waiters  The food is really good and pretty clever  We ordered taters chicken fingers sliders pizza waffles and chicken Mexican sushi roll   Nothing was greasy everything was high quality tasty and served with care  The presentation of the food was also very creative   ( see all the pictures)

I definitely will be coming back not only for the driving range but for the food
