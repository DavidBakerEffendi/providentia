My wife and I decided to try this place a few months ago and WOW The food is always fantastic and fresh and the prices are much lower than others Whether we pick up to go or eat in we are always treated amazing Wouldnt trade the service or food for anything I am about to move in a couple weeks but will still make the extra drive to keep coming back to this place Check it out folks
