Highly recommend for big groups and team builders The food is ok Mostly bar food I didnt drink so Im not sure what the beer selection looks like I mostly enjoyed the golfing and watching where my ball landed The balls have chips in them and your scored according to where your ball lands So you can compete or just play for fun
