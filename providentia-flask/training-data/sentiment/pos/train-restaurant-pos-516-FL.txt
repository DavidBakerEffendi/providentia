Extremely courteous staff Clearly a result of excellent management Delicious food and tasty beer available Easy system to use for all ages We had ages  through  and all had a great time Came back the next day to enjoy a few more hours before heading back home to San Diego 

A complaint I see often on here is the machine not scoring properly 

If the machine does not score your hit properly you can move the ball to where it should have been It only happened once to me and this was an easy fix

This place gets an easy  stars from our group We had so much fun here and we definitely plan on coming back when we visit Gilbert again
