Top golf is amazing for what you pay for A  membership  per person playing and  for the host of however many you like for one hour it doesnt get much better than that 

Customer service was great they explained how everything worked around there and everyone had enthusiastic smiles along with it 

If you came for golfing they gave many ways if doing so You could either practice like any other driving range or you could play games along with its extremely accurate ball tracker 

If you had a long and fun time of golfing you could do even more they have a bar that you can go to and relax or use the Xbox kinect they have in the upstairs area 

The main reason this top golf has gotten a star rating is because they not only excell in golfing but they cater to those who dont want to golf by providing other fun things to do other than golf
