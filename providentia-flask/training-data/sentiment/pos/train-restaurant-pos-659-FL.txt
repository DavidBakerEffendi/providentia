I feel like I could write essays about Kneaders with the number of times Ive been here (both in Utah and Arizona) but Ill try to keep it concise 

If you come here for breakfast get the french toast Also be prepared to consume a ton of calories They make their french toast on a chunky cinnamon bread which is essentially cinnamon roll bread  frosting and all  and then top it with strawberries cream and a homemade syrup And its amazing Youll love every bite and regret it afterwards I wouldnt know about their other breakfast dishes (there are few) because this one is so good Ive never felt the need to try anything else You can buy the chunky cinnamon bread in loaves as well but I kind of think that adds insult to injury so Ive personally never bothered taking a loaf home

For lunch theres a few things I love most but Ive come with a variety of people and everyone orders something different As far as I know no one has been disappointed by what theyve tried I personally love the turkey and artichoke panini on the asiago cheese bread This is one of the only places Ill get artichoke on something and that combined with the sauce they use on it and the bread itself is just superb They have a huge variety of breads to choose from (this is a bakery after all) and all the ones Ive had so far have been great though my favorites are the asiago cheese and the country sourdough Recently they also started serving a southwest bbq chicken salad which is my new favorite item The chicken is always cooked perfectly and again their sauces are fantastic 

If you still have room they have a plethora of different pastries and other goodies you can get after your meal In the fall they have pumpkin chocolate chip cookies which are a must buy The rest of the year I really love their sugar cookies and cream cheese brownies Yum

The service can be a little slow but overall its a fantastic place Im sure Ill frequent for years to come
