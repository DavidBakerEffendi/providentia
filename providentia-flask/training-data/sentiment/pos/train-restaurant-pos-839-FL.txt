Seriously AWESOME

First time here and it was GOURMET MEXICAN just as advertised

Everything was fresh spiced in unique and thoughtful ways and presented very well

I had the RIBEYE  If you are a carnivore please eat this  And thank me

Oh my dear wonderful god it was tasty  I ordered it medium rare and it was PERFECTION

They really have taken some time and energy to make each dish distinctive

My friend had the Ensalada with Cilantro y Pollo and it was such a surprising blend of so many different tastes  The chicken had a GREAT chargrilled flavor and blended with all the other veggies

We totally got suckered into ordering the sizzling ice cream dessert (I think its just called apple pie on the menu but my name is The Ice Cream SIZZLER

We watched the table next to us get presented with this hot stone dish with some pastry  ice cream and then the waiter poured some delicious sauce all over it and that damn ice cream SIZZLED

So sweet but ohsotasty and even the after dinner coffee was really soothing

I was so utterly satisfied by every aspect of this dining experience I just hope they keep delivering
