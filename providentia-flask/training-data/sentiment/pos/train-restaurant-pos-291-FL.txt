We finally went here for the first time a month ago and we loved it We took the kiddos (which is always risky) and they loved it too The prices are right where they should be TVs at every angle for my husband the sports fan and really good service 

My husband and I went back there again just this Sunday and we were pleasantly surprised to get seated right away (even though it was somewhat crowded) had great service and loved the food 

The biggest shock  try the strawberries candied nuts and goat cheese salad You wont believe how good it is and totally unexpected at a Sports BarRestuarant The wings are awesome too
