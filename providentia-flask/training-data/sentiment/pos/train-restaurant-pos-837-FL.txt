Love this place  Which means a lot being a California native  Dont expect true California Mexican food but do expect yummy Mexican food with a twist at reasonable prices  By far the best chips and salsa crackin We come here at least once a week and they never mind if only order a drink and eat about  bowls of chips  Truly a gem Dont miss out  Happy Hour is the best as well Steve the bartender is the man always the best customer service
