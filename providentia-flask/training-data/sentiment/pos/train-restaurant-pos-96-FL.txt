I visited Even Stevens tonight to redeem a coupon for one free side that I had claimed on Facebook The time I was here before I ordered the salmon BLT to go and it was so delicious I almost cried So I ordered a salmon BLT this time too My coupon was for one free side and the cashier (a super sweet woman whose name was Karyn I think) recommended the seasonal vegetable which happened to be maple bacon brussels sprouts Ohh my word They were the cherry on top of another wonderful dinner The bread is so crunchy and fluffy and perfect The flavors of the lettuce and tomatoes are awesome with the seasoned and perfectly cooked salmon which is capped with slices of thick crispy bacon It was delicious this time around too The brussels sprouts had a bit of a vinegar taste to them and as I was eating I tried to remember if she said maple vinaigrette Hmm Either way everything was scrumptious I look forward to my next visit
