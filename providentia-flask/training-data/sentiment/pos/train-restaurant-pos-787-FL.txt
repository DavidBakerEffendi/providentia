Best Sushi in the East Valley  Great service and sushi is fresh  We have been here many many times and never disappointed  We typically eat at the Sushi bar but the Tepanyaki is fun too when with the kids or a larger group  The calamari steaks are awesome  Just ask and they will prepare whatever you want
