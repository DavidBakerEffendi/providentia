We visited Cantina Laredo quite a few times while we lived in Phoenix and we were never disappointed 

If you are coming during peak dinner hours on a Friday or Saturday expect a wait We usually try to plan to come early or late to avoid the rush The bar area is really nice for people wanting to come in for happy hour and enjoy some drinks with friends The ambiance of the rest of the restaurant is nice romantic and low lit Great place to come for a date 

Service has always been great and the last time we visited my server was very familiar with gluten free allergy needs and went out of his way to check on things for me Wait time for food is normal and you can keep yourself busy with their nom nom chips and salsas (one of their salsas is gluten free so ask if you have an allergy)

I was pleased to find a good amount of the menu can be made or is naturally gluten free While I couldnt have what I used to get (which is awesome and everyone should try it if you arent allergic to wheat) the spinach enchilada with cream sauce the avocado enchilada I had was very good The table side guac was awesome and the mixed drinks are always amazing Weve also tried their fajitas and grilled shrimp salad which are super nom I was sad I couldnt have the brownie anymore but if youre going to Cantina Laredo definitely save room for it its amazing

Price is very affordable and I usually leave with extras for the next day 

Definitely recommend stopping by Cantina Laredo for some awesome Mexican cuisine
