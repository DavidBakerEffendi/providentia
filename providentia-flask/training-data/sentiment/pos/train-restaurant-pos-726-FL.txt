Kind of found this place by mistake and we are really glad that it happened 

We got there when it opened for lunch and were greeted right away and served fast The owner which we believe she came out to say hi to us and explain how she made some minor twists to what she ordered and we were perfectly fine with that 

The first think that came was the poki salad and it was phenomenal the flavor was spot on and for my girl to eat in when its not to much her thing means that it was amazing Then the rolls started coming and just as expected after the first item we were not let down loved the twist of the sour roll with the lemon on top The only complaint if there is one is that the edamame was to salty  Other then that this spot will be revisited many times
