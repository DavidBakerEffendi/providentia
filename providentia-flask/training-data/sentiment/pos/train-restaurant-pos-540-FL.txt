I have to compliment the staff for being reactive to a mistake 

We arrived on a Sunday after pm (the price changes after )  were told it would be a  minute or so wait for a bay  we would get a text when it was ready Great We figured we would get the bay before the price hike We went to the bar but after  minutes my husband went to check on our bay  we werent even in the queue They gave us priority on the next bay that opened  we got it after pm

The staff was very apologetic  we got the lower price plus a free half hour of bay time

We had fun playing the games  the fooddrink service was great
