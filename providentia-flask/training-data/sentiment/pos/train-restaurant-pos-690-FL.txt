Ohmygoodness such delicious food and baked goods Every time I go there the workers are polite and attentive and theyve yet to get my order wrong even when Ive gone through the drive through numerous times (it happens all too often haha) And mine is a complicated order I love love love their turkey bacon avocado sandwich but I get it on sour dough bread instead and I always ask for an extra sauce on the side as well And I have to order a cream cheese brownie with my delicious sammie because it is also to die for Ive also tried their caramel apples pumpkin breads cinnamon rolls eclairs cookies and cannolis and Ive yet to eat anything of theirs that wasnt absolutely delicious And their workers are seriously so kind a friend of mine had a Kneaders kick one month and went like  times in  weeks haha and when we returned a couple months later they recognized us and told us they hadnt seen us in a while too funny ) And theres also always a bunch of boutique items (a lot of home decor some jewelry a ribbon section) for sale as well It gives Kneadwers a very fun vibe I personally never buy any of that because Im a poor college student but its great to look for ideas there I would pin almost all of those boutique items to my Pinterest boards if I saw pictures of them online haha Overall such a fun and delish sandwich and baked goods restaurant Would (and do) recommend to anyone
