In town visiting family and got a flyer in the mail I couldnt believe that the lunch special list was so extensive and only  a person Taking into consideration the medium size popcorn at the Gilbert Movie theater was  it just didnt make sense We decieded to take a chance and go eat in the place was bustling with take out orders and so I knew it was not going to disappoint I had the Kung Pao Chicken with fried rice and my Mother had the Shrimp Lo Mein Im from Seattle and was pleasently surprised to see that they used fresh yes fresh not frozen vegtables There was even cucumber in my dish and you could really taste it They also had a big screen tv playing court shows which provided some good entertainment as well Hope that others will try this little gem the other place I tried here in town for Chinese was inedible and I dont know why its in buisness other then the guy who owns it everyone seems to love PRINCIPLES OVER PERSONALITY when it comes to food and King Wok is the overall winner here
