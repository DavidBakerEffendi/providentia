We stopped in for a late lunch and everything was perfect Service was excellent and friendly Sushi rolls were delicious but the sashimi was beyond expectations Its been years since Ive had salmon that was that good Im going to be craving that for awhile The lunch specials are perfectly both priced and portioned too 
Update went back for dinner and the rolls were fantastic Gorgeous ramen Great service And the wasabi is better than most places Excellent quality in everything which is important in sushi
