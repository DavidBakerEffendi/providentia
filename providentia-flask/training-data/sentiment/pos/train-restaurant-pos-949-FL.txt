Excellent takeout and ordering Always fast and ready at the counter within  minutes quick counter service and out the door ) I dont like eating in much kids etc So I order for pick up a lot Theyre just very consistant and the food is always stellar and I continue to come back time and time again

I want to tell a story about once I forgot my wallet at home and later when driving home from the office I wanted dinner called ahead ordered food got in and realized I didnt have my wallet I felt like an idiot In my stupor I assumed I had to drive home and return later to grab my cold food or reorder again There was a manager sitting close by at the end of the counter and realized what I forgot He asked if Ive been there before and I said yeah all the time actually not like he was really concerned but he ended up telling me dont worry about it and to take the food wo paying I made sure he was serious and I thanked him a few times and went home  I ate got my wallet and drove back He wasnt around (in back somewhere) but I told the girl what I ordered and she was a little shocked that I came back Anyways I paid and went back home
I know  or so for the meal wasnt a massive hit to the biz if I never came back but  the point is he hooked a brother up in need Its just a cool mentality to have as a manager  biz owner and I appreciated it and I wont ever forget it

Thanks manager guy youve got a customer for good
