We were headed to the Chicago pizza joint up the street frankly because Mexican style reviews were so all over the place around town and neighboring h areas Its fairly a personal taste preference with that style of good But with pizza is pretty well established  It was a long wait time for their pizza We had originally wanted Mexican food New to the area my only experience with San Tan Village was the Sketchers store but we like the stores layout 

We entered Cantinos and were immediately greeted me yes were handed to a gal who seated us No wait time at all The ambience was pleasant Friendly chatter but not too loud Music we ant blaring as a distraction Our showed up within a minute greeted us tons us welcome and came ba
back with water Then he brought our drink orders Returned again and took our food orders My wife orders the pomegranate margarita she said it was more like coolaid No real pop I had a draft which I enjoyed 

She ordered chicken enchiladas and I the chicken fiesta burrito Both were really tasty and not just sauce covered boiled meat in a wrapper The chicken in both were seasoned and cooked like on a stove top Move was actually grilled The sauces were very tasty as well and not smothering the dishes

The rice was crazy tasty Never had SpanishMexican rice quite like this And the retried beans were still partially whole None of the ingredients in any of the articles were salty or over seasoned 

I have never had salsa flavored like this with the chips It was extremely different while not being just chopped or blended tomatoes and onions with garnish in a bowl I couldnt desert the ingredients though Very very enjoyable And not all hot peppers either 

We went home full and happy We found a nice Mexican restaurant but well have to teach that bartender to make a decent margarita Put some booze in it for gods sake for
