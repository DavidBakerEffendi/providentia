My first time here was a great experience The girl at the counter was so friendly and patient with me I recently discovered how amazing the Beyond Burger is and I was so excited to see they have it here I got it with their homemade rice bacon (a little crunchy for my taste but that doesnt change how I feel about my experience)  the Burger itself is HUGE You have an option of regular potato or sweet potato fries so I just went with original and yuuuum Also I only had to wait about ten minutes and my food was fresh  hot )

I ended up leaving stuffed and with a peachy matcha smoothie in hand (also delicious) Im so happy that there is a vegan restaurant that is so close to home Ill definitely be back and would recommend anyone and everyone to come here at least once ) Thank you for being so kind as well
