This is my first time here It is tucked back in a shopping center that if you do not know it is here you wont see it  so seek it out This little vegan place is cute and comfortable and inviting The owners are there and doing all the work  they need support to keep up this growing business We had the Impossible Burger and OMG it was amazing The Burger itself is not homemade by the restaurant but they created an epic flavoring for the burger to be topped with I did not want it to end I was sad when I took the last bite because it was over The complimenting sweet potato fries were delicious too This little place is not to be missed You do not have to be vegan to enjoy this healthy alternative
