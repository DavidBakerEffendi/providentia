We come for the healthy food and the laid back atmosphere  Truthfully I find that servers in these types of restaurants rely on their hip attitude and youth versus their actual skills as a server  But this vibe is almost impossible to escape these days What a refreshing experience we had today Yes Gwendolyn is hip and young but she is an AMAZING server with awesome people skills as well She checked on us and kept our drinks full made suggestions and was just genuinely pleasant and inviting I believe establishments have lost sight of the fact that guests dont just want a robotic server who thinks their were presences demands twenty five percent  She understood that hard work and demeanor with your guests still matter  Gwendolyn  you rock  Give this girl a raise
