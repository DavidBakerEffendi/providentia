I ordered the lunch special online which made it awesome because I hate the language barrier on the phone For reference their website isnt easily located Its kingwokmenucom order online there Whatever site I used charges the business She kindly informed me this when I picked up with ZERO attitude The reviews of rude service are not accurate 

Cheap cheap 
 bucks for two lunch specials 
Both were delicious sesame chicken and general tsos Not soggy and had plenty of sauce 

Bonus just like east coast Chinese
