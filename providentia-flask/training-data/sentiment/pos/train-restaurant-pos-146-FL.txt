A surprise find with a great mission Food was delicious  had the Turkey Day with cranpea ( yes  cranberry  jalapeo) sauce on super good sourdough bread comes with a salad that has homemade dressing and cherry tomatoes sliced on a mandolin My husband had a pot roast dip sandwich that was huge and it was actually was TURKEY  yet tasted like beef   Also enjoyed a lot
Their mission of working with three main charity organizations for assistance is touted and obvious inside the restaurant Great people work who are warm and very helpful Going back
