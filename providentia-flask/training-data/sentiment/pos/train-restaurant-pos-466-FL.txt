Not many healthy eateries around but this one is worth a try  Our service was excellent food tasted great and the menu had a decent variety of plant based choices  The buffalo cauliflower appetizer was something you could easily make at home but who wants to do that when you can come here and have an entire meal of other yummy items as well  They are not visible from the street and are in the back of a commercial area but well worth the trip  I know other reviews had some negative things to say about service but we did not encounter that at all
