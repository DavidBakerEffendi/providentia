I am usually very picky about eating dinner at a sports grill However Blue  has great food good appetizers timely service during games and a balanced environment 
Usually in a sports bar on a Saturday night the service is slow and the food takes forever to make it to the table Blue  was the opposite Salad came out right after I ordered and the food was out before I finished my salad Ive been here a few times and every time has been a great experience
