This place is awesome  
The sesame chicken is made just like back home on Long Island  

So this has now become our go to spot for Chinese my only issue is with the white rice I wish it was more wet and sticky  But it was still good and the serving sizes are just right for the price  

If your around the neighborhood definitely try this place if you are craving good Chinese food
