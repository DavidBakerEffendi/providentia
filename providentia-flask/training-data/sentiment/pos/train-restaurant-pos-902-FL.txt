A great experience My wife ordered fish tacos and I had the enchiladas They started off with a generous bowl of chips and  hot (temp) and cold dishes  of salsa Loved the salsas especially the warm one Our dishes were well presented and generous and were both delicious

The waitstaff was exceptional and when our leftover boxes were prepared our waiter made sure there were some chips and warm salsa bagged to go  Cantina Laredo is now our favorite
