If you arent a fan of the hustle and bustle of the main Gilbert Road strip than this is definitely the place for you In a tiny parking lot about  feet behind ZinBurger and all the other places is where this shop is located 

I went in and was literally the only person in there who wasnt staff until about halfway through my sandwich which I wasnt complaining about at all Its a great spot Very casual Seems like a place where you and some friends could just hang out for awhile 

I had a sandwich and some chips which were absolutely delicious No complaints what so ever They also gave me a free cookie for checking in and the cookie was amazing 

The only negative about the location is that there is no name indicators on the sidewalk or on the glass And the sign above the restaurant is hidden by the awning The only recommendation for the business is to find a sign to put on the sidewalk cause I definitely walked straight past 

All in all a fantastic experience  would reccomend
