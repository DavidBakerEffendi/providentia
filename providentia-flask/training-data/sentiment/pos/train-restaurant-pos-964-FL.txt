Ive been to  locations across the valley and honestly this one stood out for me Of course the food is standard across any of the locations However we walked in  minutes until close and I was a little concerned theyd be visibly upset Not only did they not seem upset in the least but our waitress was on point She was tentative and patient since it took us a minute to figure out what we wanted to order 

I recently had a friend in the industry complain about the aholes who show up  minutes until close I was interested this evening being the ahole this time Well not only did a couple come in after us but I heard the kitchen at  pm They said last ticket is in and the kitchen is officially closed As it should be they dont serve until  and close at  they take orders until  Way to go Pita Jungle kudos to you
