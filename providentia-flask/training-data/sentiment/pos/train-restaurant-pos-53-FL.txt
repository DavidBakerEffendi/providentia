Great find in Gilbert for authentic Chinese food My family and I went here on a whim and it was definitely worth it Looks a lot bigger and nicer on the inside and the owners bring the Cantonese influence to their plates 

I feel like their speciality is noodles We got a Seafood combination chow mein beef chow fun and some kind of spicier curry influence dish seafood combo style Wow the plates were huge Such big portions for such a cheap price  The noodles were all so yummy Are they hand made Probably not cause that would be super difficult to do on a day to day basis but still good The flavor of the chow mein was awesome Good amount of seafood on the plate too The beef chow fun is excellent as well The currystyle chow mein would not be for everyone though It has more of a grimy dry taste to it but its supposed to be that way I thought it was good

So it wasnt the best Chinese food Ive had but its so great for the location Who would think that there awesome Chinese food in Gilbert thats literally  minutes away from my house Not only that their service is sooo good It feels like a mom and pop restaurant and my advice is if you speak to the owner shes really nice and shell probably throw in some crab puffs for you at least in my case )
