We tried Seed Shack for the first time tonight It was great Clean well lit and nicely decorated restaurant pleasant peaceful music The staff was very friendly and helpful Prices are reasonable My Wife and I loved the Macaroni and cheese Everything is vegan so the cheese was nondairy We also shared an order of Avocado toast which was also very good served with a couple of slices of Bacon I had the  Beyond Meat Beyond Burger served with cheese and very good big french fries made inhouse You can also switch to Sweet Potato fries which my Wife had with the Beet Burger Everything was wonderful we will make this a stop whenever were in the area
