Ive been to TopGolf twice now and both times were a blast They have a great setup with multiple floors to drive from Im not a big golfer so I really enjoyed the aspect of an expanded hole with weighted points the closer you get to the center I equate it to a combination between a driving range and darts The fooddrinks are also on point here and the staff is attentivehelpful Its a great place to hold a party or get together with some friends

To play you need to purchase a  card but its for lifetime membership so its a total steal They also have numerous contests and prizes based on how well you score

Take it from me You dont have to love golf to love TopGolf
