We had an absolute blast here There were  of us and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Arizona The men are avid golfers and enjoyed it Us women are not frequent golfers and had just as much fun Conceptually this place has it allpersonal bays for your group different activities or competitions for the golfing part and super yummy food We had great service and everyone was very friendly I thought the prices were really good I really wish Michigan had this
