This story doesnt start out great but it ends really well so I have to give them  stars Sick and unable to cook or drive I ordered food for my son I from Cantina Laredo through Postmates An hour after I placed the order I get a knock on the door and take the food Upon opening it I discover that it isnt my order Making matters worse there was nothing in the bag that we could eat due to a dairy allergy

So I call the restaurant Thirty minutes and a very angry me later I spoke with the manager Mickey I was so upset at this point especially because of the thirty minutes on the phone What I didnt realize until I spoke with Mickey is that while I was on hold they were trying every way they could to figure out what happened including contacting Postmates to get another driver unsuccessfully (during dinner rush on a Saturday) It turns out the order from Postmates never made it to the restaurant so the driver just walked in and picked up somebody elses order (without verifying what was in the bag) and left Obviously this was not the restaurants fault

I just wanted my food delivered to me as fast as possible but since they couldnt get a hold of Postmates and the restaurant does not have its own delivery service that was looking like it wasnt going to happen Again I was upset by this but said fine just refund my card Of course I was also thinking and I wont order from here again

But when I talked to Mickey and he realized what had happened and that I was sick and unable to drive he decided to get me my food however he could I told him what I had ordered but I did have to change one thing because it was something that wasnt even on their menu anymore again Postmates fault He asked if there was anything else he could add to the order free of charge which I thought was super nice I declined anything extra though because all I really wanted the whole time was the food we ordered Still I appreciate the gesture

A shockingly fast  minutes later Mickey was at my door with my food This is during the  oclock hour on a Saturday Im sure they were slammed

The food was excellent I got chicken enchiladas with verde sauce and my son got tacos The verde sauce was delicious It has a spicy kick but not overwhelmingly so Their salsa is also incredible One of my favorite salsas Im not sure why a lot of people slam their food I think its fantastic Its not traditional so expect something with a twist and you shouldnt be disappointed

Ive ordered from here before though so I know I like the food But the way Mickey went way above and beyond to fix this situation for me was just astounding Im not sure any other restaurant would have done that If they dont have delivery drivers they dont have them Even though I had resigned myself to not eating dinner and warming up some leftover pizza for my son I was very happy that we got to eat the warm fresh delicious Mexican food that we had decided we wanted 

Thank you Mickey You almost lost a customer through no fault of your own but because of your actions I will probably be a pain in your butt in the future )
