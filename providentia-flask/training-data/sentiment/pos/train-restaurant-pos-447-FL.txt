This place is a gem So happy to see something open like this near Dana Park The food was great We had the truffle bacon mac and cheese A guy below said something along the lines of the bacon not being bacon not sure if he realizes this is a vegan place or not BUT I think they do a great job with texture and taste matching We left full and happy
