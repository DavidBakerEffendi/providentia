The Atmosphere Dark modern but welcoming There are about ninety elevated flat screens with every game and the omnipresent SportsCenter The bar area is spaced out very well so everyone is not right on top of one another The bar is a good size wrap around type

The Service Excellent Each time Ive been in Ive received personal service from friendly wait staff or bartenders The managers greet customers as well and the staff seems to be a great team

The Food Good Nothing mind blowing but above average Fresh meat good sauces and good veggies You dont come here for a culinary experience anyway but youll leave full and happy 

The Drinks Good prices even outside of happy hour Small tap selection but this is Gilbert They have chilled mugs which is cool 

Overall Blue  exceeds my expectations whenever I go in All in all it provides a cool sports bar contrast to the pub next door
