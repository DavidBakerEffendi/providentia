We had a blast here Sort of unusual circumstance Family gathering from all over the country after a death in the family Well we have all been together grieving since Tuesday and by Friday we decided we needed a fun thing to dojust needed to get out of the house 

Got here around  and were brought to a bay on floor  Server came right away and he was very attentive Golf was fun for our family members from ages  

Food was good beer was cold It was fun The only thing I would suggest was someone to explain the computer system Luckily people in our party had been there before so they knew what to do 

Even with our circumstances it was a fun night Fore
