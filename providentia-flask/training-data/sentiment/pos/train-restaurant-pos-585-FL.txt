We visited this location on Labor Day evening and had a great time My wife had given me a gift card for Fathers Day and we had tried to use it in June however it was really busy In buying the membership the girl helping me said my gift card would be added for future use Unfortunately when we arrived this was not the case however the manager Bob took great care of us and gave us credit to cover our visit Excellent service Thank you Bob
