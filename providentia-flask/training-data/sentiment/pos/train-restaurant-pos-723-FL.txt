Really delicious food and I cant wait to go back  Im surprised to see negative reviews on the service our waitress couldnt have been nicer  The only downside is the small parking lot  It was completely full when we arrived yet the restaurant was probably  empty  Not a huge deal because the strip malls surrounding parking lots offer plenty of spaces you just have to walk a bit

The nigiri was soft and buttery  The rolls were good but were not rolled tightly enough so they fell apart when trying to eat them and I lost a lot of rice in my dish of soy sauce

The gyoza was steamed and probably the best Ive had in Gilbert  (Interestingly though the gyoza that came with the kids meal was fried and not nearly as good)  The edamame was served salty and piping hot  just like I like it

At  the kids meals are probably the priciest kids meals Ive ever seen but they included salad miso soup your choice of entree and ice cream so theyre still a pretty good value
