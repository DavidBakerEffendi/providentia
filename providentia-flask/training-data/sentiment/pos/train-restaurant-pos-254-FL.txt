This place is great for football  they have plenty of screens and give you a TV layout of which games are on which TV If you get there early enough youve got your pick of tables so that you can watch whatever game you want

The morning games are easier to get a table then the afternoon ones  when we left there was a line out the door and people were pouncing on you to see if you were staying for the afternoon games or leaving

The food was good too and they serve a breakfast menu till
