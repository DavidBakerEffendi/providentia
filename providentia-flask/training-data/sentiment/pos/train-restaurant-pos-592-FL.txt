Lots of fun I was steered here by a friend and so I brought my two boys on a day that I wanted to get them off of their video game playing behinds

We rented a stall for  hours (because I wanted them out and there was some withdrawal symptoms from the video games) Started in the morning so it was only hr We had a stall right away didnt have to wait but as I understand it there is a long wait on the weekends

The golfing was a lot of fun and I prefer it to bowling honestly Once I got my groove back I was hitting  yard balls I really need to get my own clubs though

We had Mushi which was a mexican twist on sushi and a queso appetizer dish Both were excellent I was really surprised by the quality of the food It was fancy restaurant good honestly and not overpriced The boys had sodas which they kept frequently filled I dont know how it goes when theyre busy but they were definitely on top of it while we were there

In any casegood entertainment excellent food perfect service from our attendant We were extremely pleased and will be coming back
