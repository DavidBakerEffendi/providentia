My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the sidebut the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely Fantastic timewe will definitely visit this restaurant again by the way  I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahimahi tacos so good
