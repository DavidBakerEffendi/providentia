Always a great spot for Teppanyaki  I also really enjoy the sushi here  I typically get a roll that has spicy crab mix shrimp tempura and lucky sauce on it so delicious  Filet and shrimp is my go to  Definitely get the fried rice well worth the up charge  Great place to bring a group and one of the few places I know that will pair you up if you dont have a group  Last time I was here it was just me and my little brother but they were happy to cook for us  Definitely a great spot and well worth a shot
