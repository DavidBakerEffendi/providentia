I have to give a shout out to an employee named Madelyn She was working the togos  bar She was working her ass off with phone calls  always greeting people with a smile no matter how hectic it got She ran back  forth from the kitchen  worked as quick  efficiently as possible Im so impressed with her attitude  work ethic It was a super busy thurs night all the employees were rushed but seemed to stay positive Besides the awesome service the food is always amazing  healthy Id definitely recommend coming  (If its a busy frisat night expect to wait for a lil ) also a lot of people seem to call in for pick up orders be patient If you saw how many people order within minutes youd understand
