Wow Get your delivery on We had a wonderful family meal tonight brought right to our door piping hot and mouthwateringly fragrant Trying to keep with non glutinous selections we chose the House Pad Thai Reece noodle and Beef with Black Bean Sauce Both were flavorful and retained a firm fresh texture The meat was tender the sauce was just right and the fresh vegetables were still nice and crisply cooked Our beef dish came with a side of fried rice which was generous we scarfed it up but it easily could have been a serving on its own Our family loves House Won Ton soup with all four meats (chicken pork shrimp beef) so we ordered that too and it was a big success  The textures colors aroma temperature and flavor were five stars Plus our delivery guy was one of the nicest people we encountered all day A great dining experience all around
