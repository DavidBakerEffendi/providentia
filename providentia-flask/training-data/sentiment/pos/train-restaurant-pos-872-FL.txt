On the list of types of food I like Mexican is absolutely last I almost hate it But after I went to Cantina Laredo it changed my mind  The fajitas are the best I have ever tasted The chips and salsa are awesome  We didnt get the guacamole  for a dip is a little pricey but whatev For those who order seafood at a mexican resturant in AZ you must be out of your minds ) Save yourself and money and just stick to beef chicken and pork and save your ordering seafood for your vacation to the coast
