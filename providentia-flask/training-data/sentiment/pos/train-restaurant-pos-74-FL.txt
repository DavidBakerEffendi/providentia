LOVE this place From the minute we walk in we are welcomed usually by the manager or one of the two common waitresses They make sure they remember their regulars I often get their egg soup on the house and its great Food comes out hot and fast Everything I have had has come out great but I love the Beef Chow mein in particular The only bad thing I have to say is that its  miles from my house but worth the trip
