This is the best spot for sashimi and rolls You cannot go wrong with the Lovers roll and the Lollipop roll The cucumber wrap on the lollipop is refreshing on a hot day and the environment is completely laid back We love coming here for for these two rolls and the small sashimi platter Yum

Wanted to update my review to say the Tuna Poke was abso fab I could not love this place more if I tried
