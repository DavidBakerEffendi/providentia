A place I have never heard of before until this afternoon popped up on my Yelp search list of Restaurants in my area and after reviewing others experiences Im glad I had the opportunity to stop over to Even Stevens Gilbert

Upon walking in youre going to be greeted by a very hipster and open area Dont let it scare you it is welcoming once you step in more The aroma of the Tomato Bisque will have you drooling You order at the counter and take a seat As you anxiously await for your food you have some time to appreciate the atmosphere one that you wont find anywhere else Hipster fun very edgy but not an awkward CaliforniaSurferDudeEdgy a good edgy

Then the food comes

I had the Sprang Chicken Tomato Basil Bisque and a free cookie compliments of my Yelp checkin The Sprang Chicken was incredible Not too overpowering of flavors just a perfect combination of chicken to cheese to avocados to tomatoes It was incredible The Tomato Basil Bisque was some of the best Ive ever had Not too Tomatoy and not bland it was a different kind of different most definitely worth the  price tag that soup was made by God himself it seemed like

The place was clean the service was extremely friendly and helpful and the food was great All in all a great firsttime experience Ill most certainly be back when Im nearby

Thank you Mr Even Steven Thank you
