Awesome time and great food Although I came here in October I have been here during the summer and they have powerful fans to cool their guests down The chips with queso is awesome as is all of their chicken wing varieties The tater tots are great too Prices are decent and they have a nice bar inside that serves practically all popular alcoholic beverages Staff is very friendly and prompt
