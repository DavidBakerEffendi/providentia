This is delicious New York Styled Chinese takeout  The food has excellent flavor and the dishes are inexpensive and loaded with veggies 

My husband and I spent  years looking for a New York style Chinese restaurant We had so many disappointing meals all over the valley  Then we found this place in our neighborhood It was so wonderful

This is not a place to sit and eat unless youre looking for a fast meal Its a great takeout place I cant recommend it highly enough 

The owners are very friendly  go there a few times and theyll remember you
