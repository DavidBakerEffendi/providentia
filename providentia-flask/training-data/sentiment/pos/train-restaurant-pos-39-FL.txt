I love this place Best Chinese food in the east valley BY FAR I literally have been coming here since day  when they opened  years ago I lived across the street and would walk here with my best friend every week after we got our allowance 

The atmosphere hasnt really changed in the last  years (which is completely fine because its nostalgic) but i dont go somewhere for atmosphere 

Now the food amazing I read a review about salt overload youre getting Chinese food Why are you so shocked that you feel bloated Go eat a Thai salad if you dont want to feel like that And for anyone hesitant no it does not taste extremely salty Its perfect

Anyways I have not once had something that i was disappointed in Never Ever Im pretty sure Ive had everything on their menu too My go to is the pork egg fu young lunch special For  you get a HUGE portion two egg patties a ton of assorted veggies a bowl of soup (dine in only) fried rice crab puff and spring roll Way better than nasty Panda Express and half the price Love their won ton soup So much flavor in the broth Mongolian beef is awesome Spicy but in a good way Beef and broccoli is good I also had their kung pao chicken Just so you know I cant stand KPC but I definitely like theirs 

Service is friendly even if you arent a regular Theyre insanely quick during lunch hour I can be in and out within  minutes even if its packed 

I can go on and on about this place I absolutely love it and always bring my friends here I definitely do not go to any other Chinese restaurant Love you Yaos
