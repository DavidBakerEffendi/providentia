This place has the best food for a sports bar I have never had anything from here that was bad The Salmon Salad is a favorite The waitresses and bar tenders always have a smile keep the drinks flowing and quick to bring out my food Never wait very long at all to have my order taken All managers are walking around and checking the guests for their satisfaction This is my go to bar and have no desire to go anywhere else
