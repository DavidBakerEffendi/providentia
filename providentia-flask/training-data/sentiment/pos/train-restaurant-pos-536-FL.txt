First time at Topgolf in Gilbert Came in on a Friday night with no reservations and they looked very busy As we were walking in there was  large buses unloading people But still it didnt take much time to get all signed up for a lifetime membership  hours seem to fly by Lots of fun Even though Im not very good at it  The staff were very friendly and helpful We had the nachos and drinks Our waitress was very busy and kept us served I should have gotten her name It was a great time with good friends 
Thank you Topgolf we will be back soon
