I was totally surprised at how good this restaurant is  I agree with everyone else on the service decor and margaritas  The guacamole made table side was really good and fresh  However I really enjoyed my meal as did my dining companion We had cerviche and Tacos Pescado  Both were execellent  i would highly reccomend this restuarant to anyone in the area
