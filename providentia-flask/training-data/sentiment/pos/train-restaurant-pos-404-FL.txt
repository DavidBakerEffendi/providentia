The food is very good  My daughter and I ordered the classic Caesar salad and chicken pesto pizza (hand stretched) The chicken on the pizza was tossed with pesto instead of pesto on the pizza itself I ordered a glass of One Hope wine which donates  to help children with autism We ended our meal with the Nutella trifle All the food was excellent The dessert was probably the best trifle Ive ever had The only downside was we had to wait a little long than other customers for our food The manager did come by and ask what our order was and the food came out quickly after Since the food was excellent the longer wait time wasnt a big deal
