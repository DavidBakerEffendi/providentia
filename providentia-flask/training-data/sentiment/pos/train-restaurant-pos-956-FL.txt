I love Pita Jungle sooo much  I go for the hummus alone but everything else Ive ordered has been fabulous  The lentil fatoosh salad is my favorite menu item (besides the hummus trio) but the last three times Ive had a specialthe red quinoa salad  OMG  Best Salad Ever  I crave this salad  I wish theyd add it to their regular menu
