Even Stevens soft opening was a blast  Just a quick background Even Stevens started out in Utah with several locations and even Boise IDNow have hit the ground running here in Gilbert  Love the aesthetic on the their interior design  Huge space thats like quirky vintage chic with a modern hipster flair  Now onto the food

I went with the pot roast dip  The really nice employee recommended it saying if you closed your eyes and ate it you might not even know it was turkey  That got my attention so I jumped on it  Great recommendation  Jalapeo Jam gave it just enough sweetness to balance the  well seasoned roasted turkey and the jus for dipping was supreme as well  I wouldve subbed out the raw onions for pickled onions which I didnt realize are available until looking over the entire menu after I had ordered  A  star sandwich cause that dark turkey meat couldve given any pot roast from a traditional French Dip a run for its money  

For any peeps on a celiac dietChef Brandon who previously had worked in fine dining in UT had mentioned that its not officially on their menu yet but they they are now offering GF bread from local AZ bakery Gluten Free Creations  So it is available to sub out for the breads on all their sandwiches  

The highlight for me during this event was meeting wo passionate ladies who were on hand promoting their products  The small batch jams from Cotton Country Farms which can be found in three of Even Stevens sandwiches like my pot roast dip   Amanda was quick to educate me on the differences between jam and jelly  All their products are jams  On their menu at Even Stevens they were listed as a jalapeo jelly or even a onion marmalade which should be corrected on their menu since they are jams dare I say Jam Oh Jam  Im copping some of that onion jam for sure at a future farmers market or the Phx Public Market

Julia from Peixoto Coffee was on hand with complimentary bags of their freshest single origin roasted on  in Chandler  I cant wait to brew this with my aeropress and chemex to compare the body of the chocolatey notes  Always inspiring to meet someone that left Corporate America to continue the family legacy   Definitely wouldve considered featuring them in my past life in the Coffee Sub Box Space  Cant wait to visit their coffee bar now that I know about they are a player amongst other third wave roasters  

Overall a very well thought out and organized sneak peek by Michael and the rest of the Even Stevens management team  A
