On a rare rainy day I entered the restaurant craving some soup and a sandwich I could have gone through the drive thru but since this was my first time I wanted to go inside and get the full experience At the entrance cute home dcor items were displayed for sale A fire was roaring in the middle of the restaurant and felt very cozy inside Before ordering the pastry display is right there with all these beautiful desserts staring at you screaming eat me Oh I will dont you worry

There wasnt a line when I came in but then again it was around pm on a rainy day Samples of their bread were available on the counter in which I grabbed a slice of the asiago cheese bread So good I then asked the cashier for recommendations and he said the turkey bacon and avocado sandwich was the best seller I ordered it as a whole sandwich a cup of corn chowder and a couple desserts (a mint chocolate brownie and a chocolate mousse dessert) All this and a beverage for  not pricey at all If we are comparing it to paradise bakery as many of the other reviews do this is WAY cheaper 

I wait a few minutes for my food togo and continued to look around at the items for sale I waited maybe  minutes and everything was ready to go The sandwich was HUGE and looked so yummy I couldnt wait to get home and eat When I got home I zapped the soup for  seconds just to heat it up again The corn chowder was very good it had sweet corn which gave it a sweet yet savory flavor The sandwich was amazingthe focaccia bread was so soft and amazing The sandwich contents kept falling out but still a great sandwich and was very filling I actually had to wait many hours before trying the desserts 

The mint chocolate brownie was incredible I also got the chocolate mousse dessert which was good but not as good as the brownie They have lots of other desserts to choose from as well and am excited to come back and try more

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Kneaders I am so excited this is not too far away from me and cheaper than other bakeries I cant say this place really compares to Paradise Bakery anyways the food and variety of desserts and concept are very different Would totally recommend and will be back
