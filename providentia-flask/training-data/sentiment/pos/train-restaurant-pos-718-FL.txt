I called and they made the time for my reservation even though they closed at  to prep for dinner Absolutely the best TEPPANYAKI I have ever had Raul our chef was AMAAAAZING AND SO CARING The owner was the sweetest and she hugged me and wished me a happy birthday many times I was given a freee birthday drink and an ice cream at the end I cant express how amazing my experience was and I will be going back many many more times I love this place and I recommend it to anyone
