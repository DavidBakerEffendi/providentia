Vegetarian Friendly

At least half of the sandwiches on their menu are vegetarian I love that their menu indicates what is vegetarian or vegan

I tasted the Capreezy sandwich from my friend and that was just as delicious You could taste the basil from the pesto

Entree Hummazing Vegan

I will be back for brunch Unlimited french toasthow can anyone say no
