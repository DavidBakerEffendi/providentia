This place was awesome Lots of fun Very cheap too Came before  and it was only  an hour for the whole group Food was actually really good as well and priced well The fried chicken sandwich wasnt greasy and had pretty good flavor for  bucks Would recommend to anyone who golfs but the balls are made to not go as far with the  woods and such My  iron would go  and the  wood maybe  but at that point youll have overshot all the targets Still great place Would recommend
