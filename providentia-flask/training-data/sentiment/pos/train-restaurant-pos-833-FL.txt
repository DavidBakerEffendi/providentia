I have been here a handful of times and never had a poor experience If you want to splurge a little bit on an appetizer try the guacamole dish They come to your table and make it all right in front of you and is quite a spectacle to watch I have had The enchiladas steak burritos carne Asada tamales and the chips with salsa and Guacamole and have enjoyed everything Ive ordered They have several glutenfree options if you have dietary restrictions like my wife and I are very accommodating in that respect The service is always good in time to receive our food is satisfactory We always have a good and relaxing meal each time we visit and will definitely return
