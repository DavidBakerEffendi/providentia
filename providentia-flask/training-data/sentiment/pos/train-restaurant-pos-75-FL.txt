My wife and I had a real need for some spicy Chinese food so we thought we would give Yaos a try since it was close to home and our previous goto Chinese restaurant had closed  We were really impressed by the dinein experience  HUMONGOUS portions mean any one meal will definitely serve as a well balanced meal for two  Egg rolls were fantastic  Crab Puffsrangoons were amazing Egg Foo young was the best Ive ever had Fried rice again scored right at the top  Attentive staff was there to insure you were satisfied  Gilbert has some of the best restaurants in the Valley and now weve found another gem just a few miles from home  Large dining room insures little to no wait (at least during the week we visited on a Thursday)  If you like Chinese youll love Yaos
