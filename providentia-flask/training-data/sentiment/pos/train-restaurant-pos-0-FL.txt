We used to come here a lot when my family lived in Gilbert so Im surprised I never wrote a review for this place It definitely gets five stars because the food is delicious and staff are all really nice and the place looks great Ive never had a bad experience here The servers are all warm and friendly They greet us when we come in and often stop by during the meal to check on us Portions here are nice and filling and you get a lot for a great price I still often come here for lunch or dinner whenever I am stopping by in Gilbert
