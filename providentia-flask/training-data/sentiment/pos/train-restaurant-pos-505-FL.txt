Dropped by today spontaneously with my two boys Didnt expect much because my boys are young AND have never golfed before AND because I dont know jack about golf to teach them Figured wed see what they offered and at minimum just hang out a bit I could never have expected the kindheartedness of their employee Bryson that fortunately ventured over our way When the greeter explained our situation to him he tried explaining to us that their Pro didnt start until  that day (it was about  at that point) and that regardless  he was booked when he arrived until close I told him I didnt mind since we were going to do something there regardless but to just point me in the direction of the least challenging things he could come up with He smiled and said that hed put us in a cube (not the official term  I just cant recall what its called) and hed come over and instruct the boys himself for a little bit on proper golf posture swing and bladibla but he wouldnt charge me since he wasnt an official Golf Pro himself He directed me to the sign in and got us all registered and such After we were properly routed to whatever you call it he joined us with a set of kid clubs and proceeded to spend at least TWENTY MINUTES personally instructing my two children ( and  no less) on how to hold and swing a golf club God bless him for his patience but our trip to the driving range was transformed from a hot mess into a life changing event Both of my boys immediately took to Bryson and followed him with wide eyed interest like Ive never seen before The two of them are NOT the sports type so watching them suck this up like sponges made me very happy and when the hour was over hearing them beg for more was a dream come true Bryson was smiling happy and truly a gentleman for the entire time he spent voluntarily with us This kid is going to have a very successful future if he commits to a career like he committed to us today  and let me tell you I was one hot sweaty stinky disgusting mess of a woman today I surely wasnt expecting the royal treatment from anyone  but I really couldnt have been bothered because I was on my way to the gym after that I say this only to point out that this kid DID give me and the kids the royal treatment  in spite of the gigantic mess I presented For him  at that age  to be so honestly nice and make my kids feel so special is a rare thing Everyone else at Topgolf treated me very well also but they treated me the way I wouldve expected  very nice but kind of from a distance And I get that There is nothing wrong with that I understand  you totally get out of life what you put into it And that is my point precisely This kid is exactly who you want to work with if you get to this place  he will work with you because its what hes there to do and its what he wants to do And hes going to be absolutely fabulous as hes doing it And hes going to make you and your family feel the same way as hes doing it I know that my boys came home and were bragging to their dad about how awesome they did today and my husband was so pleased to see this excitement over a sport We have ordered some golf equipment to put up in the backyard and are planning on making a future out of this All from one day involving this gem of a kid )
