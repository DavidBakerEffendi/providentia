This place is sooo good Probably the best Vegan place in Gilbert Be careful though because once you try it you will be addicted I went  times in one week  My favorite so far is the Cauliflower Tacos and the Fried Plantains  My husband who is a definite meat lover was surprised that the Beyond Burger was not real meat He kept looking at it and asking if we were SURE it wasnt meat Haha I am also not Vegan but Seed Shack really has some yummy food I definitely will be backmaybe for lunch today
