Absolutely delicious food I ordered the artichoke and mushroom omelette which was huge and delicious (I recommend adding chicken) I wasnt a fan of the cheesy potatoes though and heads up a TON of green peppers in the omelette The omelette came with a complimentary mimosa because of brunch so that was cool Chipssalsa were tasty We also had the chicken tacos which were good as well Our servers name was Juan and he gave us absolutely exceptional service I was certainly impressed with his demeanor and how he catered to us so I thank him for that Definitely coming back for more soon
