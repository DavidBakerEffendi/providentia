Great entertainment and food We had the chicken and steak combo with fried rice and it was better than the wellknown teppanyaki places They serve garlic grilled spinach plus the vegetables which was unusual but very good They also offer roasted garlic bits for your meal that add extra flavour The teppanyaki was a lot of fun and a great place for special occasions and families
