I LOVED the customer service I got here You cant beat it I chose Yao because of its Yelp and the fact that they were still open and willing to serve me a to go order at  pm As I waited for my food the women were both super friendly and genuinely interested in who I was I felt like my  minute wait just flew by The food was pretty dang good and definitely decently priced I will for sure be going back to Yao
