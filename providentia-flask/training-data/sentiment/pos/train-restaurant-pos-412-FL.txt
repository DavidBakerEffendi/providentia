Sauce is one of my favorite restaurants Ive been going to Sauce at the Happy Valley location for years and it was my first time going to this specific location in ChandlerC but this is no doubt still a favorite I highly recommend their macaroni and cheese  it is delicious and probably the best macaroni  cheese Ive ever had (Sorry Kraft) Ive also enjoyed their beet  arugula salad it has goat cheese and its super tasty Even if you dont like beets theyll put some on the side and the salad is still worth it Thank you Sauce for always providing me an enjoyable meal  stars easily
