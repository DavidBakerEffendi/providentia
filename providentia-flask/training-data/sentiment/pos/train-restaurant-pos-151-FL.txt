Such a simple but satisfying meal For only  you get unlimited French toast on Sundays They always have really awesome live music too 

My husband and I went there to end our staycation after staying in downtown Phoenix and honestly it was probably the highlight of the weekend The musician playing was perfect and all the people working were super kind and attentive Im just in love with the vibe of this place

You also cant beat the price We got two unlimited French toasts and an order of Party Tots for less than  including a  tip 

I also checked in on Yelp and I got a free cookie which Im super jazzed about
