Really awesome place Ive been here a few times and got the bay I wanted right away Reasonably priced especially considering you bring a few buddies so you split the price The nachos are out of this world They have people always walking around so you can always get help Good music and tv its just a great atmosphere Nice to go relax for a couple hours
