First time here and our experience was amazing The customer service was awesome the food was great anddrinks We brought our own clubs but actually used several of the provided Topgolf clubs because they hit really well Cant wait until the Topgolf in Columbus is completed so we can make this a regular thing Oh and they give a military police and fire discount
