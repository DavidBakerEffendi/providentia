First time coming to Top Golf and all I have to say isWOW I will most likely be making the  hour drive from San Diego to Gilbert AZ just to play drink and eat at this establishment Lets just say this I joined the golf team in high school for two weeksand then quit Why Because I was terrible and had to walk the course Top Golf had me entertained for HOURS It was an absolute blast and so innovative I suggest going at night in order to get the full experience with the light up holesnets Our waitress was on top of it and always made sure my friends and I had a cold one in our hands
