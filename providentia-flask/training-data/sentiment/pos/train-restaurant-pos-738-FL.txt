Went to Ryu for the second time tonight and I have to say that this place is legit The kids and I had Teppanyaki and the wife had sushi Tonight was probably the best experience I have had at a Teppanyaki joint ever outside of the one in Tokyo where the chef was I assume an actual ninja Anyhow the chef tonight was awesome He did all the usual gags that the kids love ie The onion volcano and the beating fried rice heart but he also displayed some excellent knife skills Way above and beyond anything I have seen here in the states My kids really enjoyed him throwing shrimp into their mouths from across the table So the entertainment was really good but what about the food Food was amazing too seriously it was much more flavorful than my average experience at a Teppanyaki place which is usually Benihana in Chandler  The veggies were way more than the typical cucumbers mushrooms and onions Those were there but also broccoli potatoes and a nice helping of spinach cooked on the grill in sesame oil I had the filet and chicken combo The filet was cooked to a perfect mediumrare just as I requested The kids meals were plentiful and neither of them could finish The wife had a couple of different kinds of sushi and said they were excellent I had one piece of some roll that had jalapeo avocado and some other stuff I thought it was good and I dont ever eat sushi As I said before this is the second time we have gone to Ryu First time was fine but it was also right after the place opened This time all my expectations for this experience were definitely exceeded Will be choosing Ryu over Benihana in the future
