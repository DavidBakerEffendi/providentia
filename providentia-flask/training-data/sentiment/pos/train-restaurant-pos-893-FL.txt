Service was fantastic Had the tableside Guacamole and Enchiladas My wife had the Chicken tacos and the kids shared a chicken fingers meal And we finished everything with the Mexican Brownie Great food Every bit was bursting with flavor You can definitely tell that they make everything fresh For those that say it is bland they definitely have no palate Again Fantastic Service Ask for Ella She was awesome The menu is priced appropriately as well Located at San Tan Village and rightfully so I will be heading back again this week
