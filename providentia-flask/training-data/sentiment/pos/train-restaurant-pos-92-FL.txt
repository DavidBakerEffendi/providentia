Ok lets talk about this place Its bomb com I got the breakfast sandwich Instead of it having ham on it I switched it out for turkey and I had them substitute whole egg for egg whites The sandwich has like a sweet maple glaze that they brush the bun with and it was soooooo good It was like a sweet and savory sandwich The sandwich also came along with tater tots and who doesnt like those They also donate food to local communities what an amazing concept they have here Id definitely come back
