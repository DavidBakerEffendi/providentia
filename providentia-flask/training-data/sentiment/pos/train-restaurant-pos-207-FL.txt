I love this place for chinese food I am from the East coast and I was always trying to find a place that even compares to what you get in Boston or New YorkThis place is as close as you will get and they are so fast with deliveryI always get my food within  minutes and it is steaming hot They are always friendlyI have never had a problem and my order is always correct
I had given up on chinese food in this areaand then I found them and so happy that i did
They are as close to New York and Boston as i will get in this area
