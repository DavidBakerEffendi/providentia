Really terrific family Chinese food  Very friendly and hospitable staff  I stop by for lunch a couple of times a month and have never been disappointed  For about  you get soup egg roll crab puff fried rice and your choice of entry  I usually opt for the egg foo young decent egg foo young is surprisingly hard to find in the Valley  Very tasty sauce crisp snow peas mushrooms carrots water chestnuts and tender chicken  Two good sized patties  Really good food at a really good price
