We finally decided to try this place and it was soooo delicious I think a lot of people are trying to compare it to Raising Canes because it is right across the street but it is COMPLETELY different Its very southern style food and I liked that they had so many sides to choose from The chicken tenders were super juicy and I liked that they served it with gravy on the side The ordering is a little confusing especially if you had never been here before But we will definitely be back
