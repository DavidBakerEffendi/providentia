I first had dinner at Cantina Laredo in downtown Ft Worth Texas years ago Ive been hooked ever since So I was pretty excited to see that they had a location in Gilbert Arizona  of all places

Food is excellent drinks are strong and delicious and Jaqueline our server was oustanding She made our entire night enjoyable

Will return as often as possible Thanks for bringing a little Texas with me to Arizona
