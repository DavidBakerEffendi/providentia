My first experience was very pleasing I was seated accordingly and our server was awesome I just wish I could remember her name so that I could consciously acknowledge her My Tenppanyaki dish was absolutely delicious (I had ordered in regular seating not the Teppanyaki table) When I have my last meal in this Earth I hope it can taste similar to the dish I had their (Maybe I was just really hungry when I visited)
