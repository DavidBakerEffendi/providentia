My family loves this place  My favorite is the Chilean Sea Bass  Even on a busy Friday night the service was excellent  Weve been here a few other times and its been great every time  We had  in our party and they were very accommodating  I came here for lunch a few months ago and had their steak fajitas  The seasoning and texture of the steak was perfect  We will definitely be back
