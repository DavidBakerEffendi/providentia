I have been looking for a good NY style Chinese place since we moved here I FOUND IT This place is so good the rice is fantastic the food is very good I got it to go so I dont care about the service or that there were kids in the dining room doing their homework its a family place get over it The prices are great and the portions are great as well  This is my new spot for takeout
