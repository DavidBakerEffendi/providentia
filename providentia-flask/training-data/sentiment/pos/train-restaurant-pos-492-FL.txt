Theres clearly a reason why Topgolf is always so crowded even though theres three levels of sidebyside bays Let me start by saying that I am by no means a decent golferor even a golfer at all in fact I dont think Ive ever actually been golfing (aside from minigolf) That being said I absolutely love Topgolf Every time Im in town I make it a point to come here because the driving range is a blast the food and drinks are delicious and everyone has a great time no matter who I go with

The obvious place to start is the driving range The way its set up is a regular driving range but with targets that you try to hit with golf balls that have sensors in them There are different games you can play based on your skill level ranging from just trying to hit any target to getting more points for hitting farther away targets to having to hit specific targets Topgolf supplies all the clubs and balls that youll need for any of these and thats all included in the price of the bay (but I only use the driver because Im going for distance you feel me) Ive seen people bring their own clubs in as well so feel free to do that if you have a set but Im not that legit

The food and drinks at Topgolf are also great and they have a pretty big selection on the menu I never eat a full meal here but Ive had a number of the appetizers and theyve all been delicious You can also order drinks in a light up golf bagshaped souvenir cup that you get to keep so thats a great deal The waiters who come to your bay will make sure youre set on food and drinks during your whole visit

Whether youre a progolfer or this is your first time at a driving range Topgolf is the perfect place to have a good time perfecting your skills
