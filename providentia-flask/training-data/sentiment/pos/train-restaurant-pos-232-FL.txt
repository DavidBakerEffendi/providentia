If you have never been to Blue you have never had the Best Burger in Gilbertoh Hell in the Southeast Valley Im not talking about a burger with all the fixings or smothered in mouth watering sauces Im talking about the taste and flavor of the burger alone To me a Burger is Good when it doesnt need anything to make it better Aside from my homemade burgers these burgers are the BEST around Tired of hearing about the Burgers Blue is just a casual great place to watch a game have a Beer (or a few) and eat some delicious appetizers The Hot Wings Sliders Chicken Quesadillas Ahi Tuna Calamari and Onion Rings are all great to name a few The Tacos Al Carbon leave you wanting more and the Prime Rib Special (not on menu) was to die for All in All Blue is a great Sports Bar and Grill that specializes in serving quality food with friendly service Two Thumbs UpWAY UP )
