Had dinner here for the first time last night Sat in the bar area
Our server was Mo she was professional knowledgeable  attentive Pleasant staff which also included two young men who delivered our food  bussed the surrounding tables 
We started with the  count wings Offered up to three flavors Did the Asian Sesame BBQ  Hot These wings are quality size Superb Seem to have a light batter on them generously sauced  cooked to perfection Crispy  tasty Our favorite was the Hot Asian were really good too
Tried the Mushi Top Golfs signature dish  well known for this delight Its like a burrito and sushi united into one Really unique and a must have here
Kids meal ( burger) comes with a ton of fries well worth the  
Recommend if you get a salad to try the Champagne Vinaigrette 
The flatbread highly suggest Thin savory dough shaped into a large rectangal with the classic toppings added Cut into  slices of mouthwatering pieces
Had the Pepperoni  Sausage next time I plan to try the Prosciutto Artichoke  Olive
Fabulous Food Stellar Service  A Fantastic Fun Atmosphere
Not surprised that this place is always packed
Note the music was still louder than our likinghave seen other reviews with the same complaint Please turn it down a notch
