I have had a great experience my past two visits here Service is great and so is the food The lunch specials are also amazing they are such a good price for a huge amount of food The orange chicken is the best orange chicken I have ever had It has such a thin coating and I love the orange sauce on it Also the soups are very good I love the hot and sour and my boyfriend loves the egg drop I even love the crab puffs and usually I wont touch any kind of seafood I will be back and will keep supporting this place )
