Boy oh boy my opinion on Blue  has changed since my review  years ago I love this place Im there at least xmonth and NOT just because its so close to my house Their nachos are my favorite yes my favorite anywhere The ground beef has so much frickin flavor Nom 

Another favorite is the boneless wings If they had a Boneless Wings Anonymous I think Id be forced to attend The wings at Blue  live up to my standards 

The service has always been great as well It gets busy during happy hour and all sports games so come early if you dont want to wait awhile for a table The bar area is open seating so stalk those tables when you walk in
