Having lived in the NY  NJ area for  years Ive become spoiled with good Chinese food Last night my girlfriend and I decided to try this place in Gilbert The menu was extensive and the prices looked great We were shocked when I went to pick it up as to the large portions  The General Chicken was soft and not over cooked and the potstickers were hot and tasty 
Definitely the best Chinese Food Ive tasted since Ive been here I cant wait to order again
