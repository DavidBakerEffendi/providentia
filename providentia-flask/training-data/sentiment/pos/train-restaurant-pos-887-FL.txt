First off our waiter Dan was exceptional  He made guacamole right in front of us for an appetizer delicious  The Fajitas Tres were very good hard to go wrong there  I ordered a side tamale might just get a plate of those next time And finally the sizzling apple pie with cinnamon icecream was a fantastic ending  The margarita wasnt watered downabsolutely perfect  A bit overpriced for Mexican food but well be back regardless
