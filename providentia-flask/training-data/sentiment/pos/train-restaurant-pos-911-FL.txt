Ive not dined here but enjoyed their catered food at a dinner party last weekend Two kinds of fajitas warm chips fresh guacamole queso everything was DELICIOUS 

The serving staff appeared professional and pleasant making the dinner party both elegant and enjoyable for everyone including the hosts We had a great time 
Will definitely make the drive outside of our regular dining areas to enjoy this food again
