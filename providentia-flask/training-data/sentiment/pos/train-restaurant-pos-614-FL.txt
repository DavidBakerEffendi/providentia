I really enjoy coming here its fun and relaxing They have great food actually too and you pay just as much as you would at a restaurant so Idk why people complain And yes its busy on weekends because it the only thing to do in San Tan Valley Queen Creek and Gilbert other than going to the mall so dont be to impatient because its worth it Go before  on a week day if you want to just try it out without paying the most per hour The waitorswaitress arent the best on filling drinks or checking up on you but I dont mind Im trying to golf )
