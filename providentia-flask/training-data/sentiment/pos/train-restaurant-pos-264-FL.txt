I just moved to Gilbert from Snobsdale  Yes I said Snobsdale  I was pleasantly surprised by Blue   This place would even do great is Snobsdale  (the people in Scottsdale are quite critical hence one of the reasons I am in Gilbert raising my family now)  This was so unexpected  Great food great decor price was MUCH cheaper than comprable place in Scottsdale  My wife couldnt believe it either  PLeasantly surprisedI lived in gilbert from  and there was no decent eateries sports bars or anything that wast a chain  Glad to be back folks and I will be coming back to Blue  often  My  and  year old boys were even talking about our hot waitresLOL  GREAT SPOT
