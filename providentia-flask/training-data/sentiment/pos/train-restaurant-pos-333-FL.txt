We noticed this sports bar open a couple of weeks ago so we decided to try it out  When you walk in the place is very impressive  They have TVs everywhere  It seemed like the worst seat in house would have at least  tvs to watch  They had a pretty good beer selection and they carry many more beers on draft than just light beers   

My wife ordered the coconut shrimp for her entre (an appetizer) and the edamame for an appetizer  I got the Philly Cheesesteak   The food was pretty good  I really liked the fries that came with the Philly Cheesesteak  

Another thing I really liked was that if an employee walked by and noticed you had an empty plate or if it looked like you needed something they would help you out  The waitress was not the only person who seemed to care about how you were doing  I really hope they keep this up  

Overall I definitely will be a repeat customer  Gilbert needed a place that was nice laid back good food and good beer
