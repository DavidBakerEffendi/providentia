This Chinese restaurant was amazing The service was exceptional as well I brought my dad for his birthday and our family here Our favorite Chinese restaurant closed  years ago and have yet to find one that is just as good but now we did Portions were great and the service was great and happy Food only took like  minutes to get out I recommend the coconut shrimp and orange flavored chicken and Kung pao shrimp But it was all so good We will definitely be back )
