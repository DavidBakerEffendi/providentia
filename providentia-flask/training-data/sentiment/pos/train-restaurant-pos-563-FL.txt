How amazing is this place Our friends brought us here the first night we arrived in Gilbert  What an awesome concept The staff is SO friendly and clearly in love with their jobs  They dance around the whole place with smiles on their faces as if they were on vacation  It truly exudes a positive entertaining energy to their customers 

There were  of us who got a bay on the rd floor  Our waitress explained the game to us and told us how the golf balls have microchips and knows who is hitting the ball while also calculating which colored circle it lands inon 

We all had a great time playing while ordering drinks and apps  The food  the entire smorgasbord we ordered was delish We were in town during the Superbowl and even happened to run into some Buffalo Bills players at a bay a couple spots down from us (disclaimer  this was exciting we are fans from Buffalo)

We were lucky enough to return one more time during our trip this time in daylight  The view is even better during the day with the beautiful mountains as the backdrop
