I have been here twice now (tried to another time but they were closing between lunch and dinner I guess) both times have been pretty awesome Weve only had two rolls because Im allergic to fish and they have been amazing the Futomaki and California 

We came for the first time for my boyfriends birthday and did the Teppanyaki It was so fun to watch and everyone is super nice The entree had fried rice veggies two pieces of shrimp and I got chicken he got steak You get a good helping of food and the sauces are good too
