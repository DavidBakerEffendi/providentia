Never thought vegan food would taste so good Makes me feel like its so easy to be healthy 
I tried their bacon thats made out of rice paper and honestly it tastes better than real bacon 
My boyfriend who loves to eat meat also enjoyed the food because how great the flavor is
Also the avocado smoothie is the best 
Its a family owned place and they are passionate about making healthy and flavorful food everyone could enjoy
