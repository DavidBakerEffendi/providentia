Tried Blue  for the first time because of the positive Yelp reviews So glad I did  Fun atmosphere  Great for couples or families Had the Salmon salad  it was delicious  Also the loaded French fries are so good Mixed drinks were very good also  Our server was friendly and very attentive  I will be going back for sure
