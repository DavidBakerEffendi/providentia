OK i did a review for this place when it was called Way Sushi and that place SUCKED
Nowthis place is called RYU Sushi with new ownership and needless to say my sushi experience there was one of the best Ive had in the Gilbert area I went with a few of my girlfriends for GNO (girls night out) night and I was so surprised on how tasty everything was and every single time I took a bite I was just like WOW this is so goodddd

Their specialty menu is what got to me All of them seemed so creative and delish The specialty rolls I ordered was the Boo Ya Ka Roll (My favorite) Surf  Turf Chimichanga Basil and their Spicy Tuna Pokie Salad Everything was fresh and thoughtfully made The ingredients for some of their special sauces they used in some of their rolls were well balanced and made it flavorsome Their sushi rolls are pretty big too so its definitely worth what youre paying for Oh make sure to leave some room for dessert and try their Pizookie YesI said Pizookie I was surprised too when I heard this My girls and I killed it and when I went there again the nd time I took my bf and ordered the Pizookie as well and we devoured the deliciousness 

Ryu also has great happy hour drinks or specialty drinks So that is also a plus
Their customer service was beyond superior The lady owner there is super sweet and you could tell she really cares about her customers She takes the time to talk to every table and makes sure you are enjoying your experience at Ryu ( I love customer service like this) 

By the end of the night after  hours Our GNO night ended up to be a Food Coma nightLOL We were so full but happy full )

I highly recommend this place for sushi I am planning to be a regular here not only bc I want try everything they have on their menu but because they really truly do have great food Go see for yourself P
