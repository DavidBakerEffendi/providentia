Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first  shots holy cow I want to build one of these for myself 

Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific 

  The wait staff was hired yesterday Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions 

  Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out 

  Computer systems down There were more error screens than you could imagine here One of the staff even said the app has never worked here Thats pathetic Get someone on it 

My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon) which doesnt at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had 

 Our waitress Michelle was amazing It looks like she only had two tables so you cant beat a ratio of  She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table 

 The music varies a ton A good thing I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music 

 OMG The food The food was top quality Worth twice what it costs No joke 



It is blatantly obvious Im a bulletlist reviewer so here are my key points 
Technology  train staff and hire an IT person 
 Staff  Some of the most friendly and eager staff Ive seen around Keep it up 
 Food  Id come here just to eat Period 
 Overall experience  This place was a blast I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area It is totally worth every penny
