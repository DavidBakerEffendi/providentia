Stopped in to Topgolf twice in a few days with out of town guests This place is pricey but hey awesome things sometimes are I dont know that I will ever be able to go back to a regular range again To start the view is tough to beat with the Superstitions in the background The service from the front counter to the wait staff was very friendly The first time I went was late afternoon (hr) for the bay The second was Sunday AM (hr) for the bay great deal The cost would really not be too bad if you had  people splitting it over a few hours We played the regular game Topgolf It was easy to learn the procedures to play and I felt we hit a ton of balls over the course of the hour My son () was there for one of the times and he had a blast What I really like is how no matter your skill level age etcyou can find Topgolf fun and challenging My only complaint would be that once in awhile the shot did not seem to score accurately If you were being competitive about it not that you have to this would obviously be a problem We did not eat but had a few reasonably priced local brews Great recommendation on the Otra Vez with salt and lime Topgolf is appropriate for so many occasions family time corporate outing adult fun and my son wants his next bday party here (SWEET) So cool to have this place  minutes from home I will be backoften
