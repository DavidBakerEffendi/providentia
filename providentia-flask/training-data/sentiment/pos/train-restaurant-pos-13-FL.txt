Yaos is excellent  I go there  times a month and have been for almost two years and I live  miles away  It is a pleasant atmosphere not too loud or too crammed and the owner is usually there talking to customers  She or the waitress (if shes not there) always make time to chat with me  Food is pretty good and theres a lot of it especially on the combo meal  Crab puffs are great plus good soups and great shrimp dishes
