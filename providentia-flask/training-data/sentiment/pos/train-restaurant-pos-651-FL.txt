Pockets is the nicest bowling alley lounge evah

My date and I went out the night before the th of July and we stopped at three other bars before coming here they were all packed  I remembered how large this bar was and how it seemed to be dead so I suggested we come here  It turned out to be an excellent spot for a date  Great selection of beers on tap  Our bartender was solid  She overheard us talking about frickles (fried pickles) and said they were her favorite thing on the menu so we tried them they were surprisingly delicious  We split a pitcher and then headed to the game room  we laughed the entire time  So much fun
