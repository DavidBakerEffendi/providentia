Came for a few meetings over breakfast This place is super friendly with its staff and serves great food Had the sausage breakfast sandwich that came with tater tots The tots were the perfect throwback addition to the well made breakfast sandwich Free wifi and ample electrical outlets AND free flowing diet coke will make this place my new client meeting place for downtown Gilbert
