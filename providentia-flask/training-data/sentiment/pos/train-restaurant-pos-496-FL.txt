Very nice location Busy on weekend nights and has a good crowd For  you can get the Topgolf card to play I got a boca burger sandwich that was surprisingly good They keep it cool outside with misting fans throughout There is something to do for everyone They also have accommodations for those who are left handed Nice play to check out even if youre new to golf
