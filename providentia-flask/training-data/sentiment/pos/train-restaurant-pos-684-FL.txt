Kneaders has been on my radar for awhile and today was the day I finally got to experience it for myself  My understanding is that it is based in Utah and is somehow affiliated with the Mormon church which is all I needed to know Im not Mormon but some of my best friends are and I trust their brand  Basically if it has to do with food and Mormons are involved Im there  
So today I met my (Mormon) friend at Kneaders for lunch  Heres the problem  I had my wisdom teeth extracted less than a week ago and today is day two of trying to eat solid foods  Because of this I order the soup and sandwich combo and got a chicken salad sandwich which comes on a big beautiful fresh croissant otherwise I never ever would have ordered chicken salad (boring bland) when there are so many amazing choices  
Much to my surprise this was THE tastiest chicken salad sandwich I have had in my LIFE  Honestly  The turkey dumpling soup was also delish and tasted homemade  It also came with a little side salad but my jaw was not up to trying to deal with that   
I could go on and on but I have a large selection of assorted pastries on my kitchen counter to sample  So far I can tell you the chocolate dome cake is moist and extremely chocolatey and meant to be shared and the eclair is top notch filled with plenty of creamy nottastinglikeitwasfromapowdermix custard
I will be back with my friends and family in tow  You should go too and you dont even need a Mormon friend to get in
