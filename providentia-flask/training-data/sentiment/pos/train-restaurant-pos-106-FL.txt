Great atmosphere fantastic sandwiches full of flavor The meats are all incredibly tender and the sauces are succulent and unique When you walk in youll notice the staff are smiling and full of life Very happy with this place Wish there was one in SoCal This particular location has a fitting farm theme that matched this history of the surrounding area One of the coolest things about this restaurants is that they donate one sandwich to a charity for every sandwich that is sold You can see the amount of sandwiches sold on the wall for this store as well as nationally across all of their stores Giving back is great but giving back while eating a delicious sandwich is much more rewarding This branch has been open a few months and donated over  sandwiches to charity Nationally they have donate almost a million in  years Im in love Even Stevens sandwiches
