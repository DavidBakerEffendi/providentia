Cant believe I havent written a review for this place yet I go here all the time not for the bar or for the drinks but for the buffalo chicken salad Its my absolute favorite dish in this joints I tried some other stuff like the burgers theyre pretty good and the calamari is usually a good call Im personally not too fond of the super nachos but people seem to really like it Taste buds is what well blame that one on Servers are always friendly and they do a pretty decent job at keeping us topped off with refreshments Its a good place to grab a bite to eat and if you havent been there Id recommend trying the buffalo chicken salad heck get it with an extra piece of chicken and be just like me
