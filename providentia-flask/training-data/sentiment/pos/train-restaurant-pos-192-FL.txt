Best Chinese food in all of Arizona How do I know this

) I am full  Asian
) I grew up in LA and San Francisco
) I have eaten at almost every Chinese place in AZ

Ok the last one is not entirely true but after eating at King Wok I dont need to try another Chinese joint Its a hole in the wall in a GoodWill strip mall but it is incredibly delicious

If u know anything about Chinese food u know that NY and SF have the best Chinese King Wok brings that to AZ and I couldnt be happier

No more Panda Express or Pei Wei or PF Changs for this gal its all about King Wok
