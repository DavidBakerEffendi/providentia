We held our annual teacher and staff appreciation banquet at Top Golf (Gilbert) on Saturday May  from ampm I was blown away by the hospitality that we received I was literally greeted on the stairs walking in by one of the employees who offered to help me carry the box I was holding The room was set up exactly how we talked about and looked better than I had envisioned Melissa Marvel was great to work with from booking the event to the very last minute of our event Camria was so friendly and checked to see if I needed anything about every  hour  The staff was attentive and went out of their way to make sure everyone had a great time Thank you for making this a wonderful day for my hard working and deserving teachers and staff Super impressed and very grateful )
