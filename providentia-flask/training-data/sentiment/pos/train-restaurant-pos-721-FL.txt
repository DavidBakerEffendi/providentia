Our favorite teppanyaki in the East Valley We love the food the owner is fabulous and when we make reservations we always get seated within  min 

Update  This is still our go to restaurant hands down We come here for every occasion we are still thoroughly impressed with the owner service and quality of food If you havent been here youre missing out
