My SO took me out for a date night at Seed Shack Immediately upon walking in I fell in love with the clean fresh vibe and bright decor Its a small restaurant tucked into the back of a promenade Its definitely difficult to find but so worth the drive from the West Valley

The staff consisted of two adults in their late s that were more than happy to explain the menu and what some of the menu items were As a vegan of many years I loved how understanding and aware they were 

We shared the truffle mac  cheese a beyond meat bacon cheeseburger and caramelized plantains with yam nice cream Everything had a mens unique flavor and beautiful plating We went on a weeknight and it was very quiet I bet its busier on the weekends This place is relatively new and is definitely on the up and up Excellent job
