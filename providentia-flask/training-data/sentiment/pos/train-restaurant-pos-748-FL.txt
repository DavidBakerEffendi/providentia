Very similar to Benihana where you can sit at a table with other people and have a chef cook in front of you teppanyaki style You also have the option to sit at the sushi bar or a standard table with your own party without a chef We sat at a table since we were not ordering off the teppanyaki menu

My boyfriend and I shared the BBQ Salmon Roll the Golden California Roll and the Boston Roll All three were quite appetizing but my favorite was the BBQ Salmon Roll Its basically just a Crunchy California Roll with crab mix and salmon baked in lava sauce Not really sure what lava sauce is (my guess would be Sriracha mayo and some other jazz) but it looked like lava 

The service was fast though we did eat on the later side so Im not sure how it is regularly Either way Im a fan of their food and affordable prices Im glad this place is located near my friends house in AZ as I would definitely request this restaurant again next time Im in town
