In love with this concept coming from SLCbased Even Stevens of eattogive The space is beautiful the sandwiches are made fresh with honestly sourced ingredients and the passion of the people who started this business and work here is tangible As far as food I tried their pot roast sprang chicken cubano and their breakfast burrito and they are all exceptional The portions are big the fillings are generous and they have have a unique twist in each of their offerings For instance pot roast sandwich takes a jalapeno jam made by a local company (Cotton Country Jams) which was unexpected and gave just the right kick to the sandwich I am still thinking about their food that is how good it is The proverbial cherry on top is the price which is very reasonable (dont think I saw anything above  dollars) Last but not least you can be sure to feel good about this meal knowing that Even Stevens donates to local charities (list displayed conspicuously on their wall) with every sandwich sold What is not to like about this place
