My family went here a couple of weeks ago We wished we had tried it out sooner The frozen and rocks margaritas were strong and refreshing We order a bowl of queso first and it was tasty The children ordered off the childrens menu and got mini sliders wfries and a quesadilla with rice Both were very content with their dishes My husband ordered the tres fajitas and I cant tell you which protein was best The bacon wrapped shrimp were amazing the beef was so tender that my son started in on dads plate  The chicken was moist and cooked to perfection I ordered chicken tacos Another great dish We will be back for sure It was more expensive than typical Mexican food but I would say it was far superior than most typical Mexican food Keep doing what your doing
