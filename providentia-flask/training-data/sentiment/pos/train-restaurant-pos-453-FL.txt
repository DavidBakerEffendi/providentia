Absolutely loved this restaurant  The food was great the service was outstanding and the environment was really relaxed  I loved the little pillows on the benches that looked like slices of food

Im not in the neighborhood often but I will definitely stop back by and try something else wonderful from the menu  I had the beet burger and the golden milk on this last visit

So glad they are in business
