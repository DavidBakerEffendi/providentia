I am so happy they finally built a Top Golf in the east valley The one in Scottsdale is a little far from me Its nice to have more to do in town This place is awesome for any type of event or gathering You have the option to play golf  or just eat relax and watch They have a separate place for the kids to play games and an upstairs bar for the adults The food is amazing and service is wonderful This is a place for all ages Definitely recommend to ANYONE
