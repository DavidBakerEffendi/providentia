Just love this place It is a top notch facility It is a great place to go with family and friends You dont have to be a golf pro to have fun here I come here with my kids all the time and they have a blast as well 

Also the food and drinks are great too Lots of good deals depending on the day or time   The staff is very helpful and extremely friendly 

If you get a chance sign up for one of their tournaments they are a blast and a great deal 

Sonif you are looking for something fun to do as well as a place to get some good food and drinks you should head over to Topgolf
