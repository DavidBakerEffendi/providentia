Pita Jungle in Gilbert has been our goto lunch spot in the area for the last couple of years Its always packed whenever we go and the laidback hipster servers are always friendly on point and attentive in their own ways Their menu has a wide range of mediterranean and some middle eastern healthy dishes and I dont think weve ever had something we dont like Today we had the mahi mahi with pita chips and some type of healthy veggiepizza on a flat bread () Both were excellent Well continue to go as long as it keeps rockin Im surprised there are only a few locations in the valley
