Singapore rice noodles was ridiculously flavorful Spicy to the point where you could still taste all of the masterfully assembled ingredients I had it to go and it was packed into the box to the point of barely closing 

Also had the beef Chow fun which was also top notch Plenty of veggies savory beef that was cut to the right portions and also packed until the box could barely close

Friendly staff that helped me with my custom order

Food did not take long and was a seamless process for checkout 

Definitely coming back by far my favorite in the
