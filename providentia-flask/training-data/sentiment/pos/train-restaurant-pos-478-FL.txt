I have to confess I am not a vegan but decided to go to lunch here with the vegan side of the family 
The food here was AMAZING We all ordered something different for our lunch and then we all shared 
We ordered buffalo cauliflower (if you like the sauce HOT then try this) chili ( lovely sweet and savory blend)
And the most fabulous  burger I have ever eaten  I will definitely be ordering the beyond burger again

We also indulged in a dessert plantain and ice cream The dessert was out of this world I could live on this ice cream and probably loose a few pounds along the way
