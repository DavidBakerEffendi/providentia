I love everything here Ive tried the glazed chicken lavosh pizza the chicken shwarma lavosh wrap broiled chicken pita chicken shwarma pita and possibly my new favorite the spicy chicken wrap The wrap is huge and easily worked out to two meals Prices are reasonable and wait times after ordering are always quick We try to make this a weekly visit
