Thankfully the yelp hours of operation was wrong  They are open on Sundays  

We were seated and greeted by our server promptly They easily accommodated the changes to my order and our food was brought out before we knew it

As always the food was plentiful and delicious Our server did a great job keeping our drinks full and offered togo cups  

Get the hummus Its so smooth and flavorful you will crave it
