Our first visit was last night  Staff is wonderful never needed water and they were all very attentive  Food was well priced  We had the Kung pao chicken sesame chicken orange chicken and another dish  Everybody loved their meals and I loved the hot and sour soup  Very clean inside and easy to make plans for another visit  very soon
