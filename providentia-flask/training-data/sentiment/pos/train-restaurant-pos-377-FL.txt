Delicious fresh chicken we used the drivethru where a order person actually comes out to your car takes your order which is kind of more personal I think
Staff is friendly and we love the food we are so glad that this chicken place moved into our neighborhood yummy mac and cheese jalapeno poppers and french fries were among our sides they also have very good iced tea according to my husband who loves his unsweetened tea We will be regulars at this new hotspot
