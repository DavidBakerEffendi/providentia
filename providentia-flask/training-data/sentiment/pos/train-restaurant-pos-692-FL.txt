I have loved eating at Kneaders every time we go to Utah now Im so happy to have them local My only complaint is that they arent closer to me 

I went for lunch during the first week they opened the staff was amazing and helpful and the food was great My kids both had kids combos my eldest literally drank every last drop of his chicken noodle soup I ordered the Chicken Ala Mondo salad and my Mom (st trip for her) ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia We were all impressed the kids sugar cookies were so good we had to go back and get more 

Next trip there will be for breakfast cant wait for the french toast
