My go to for Chinese takeout in the east valley I cant say much about the service for dine in Bc I always get my food to go but they really do an amazing job Portions are HUGE Family of three  we will order two entrees and an appetizer and easily have enough for lunch and dinner for the next day Favorites are the Singapore rice noodle combo chow mein Kung pao three flavor and you cannot go wrong with the crab puffs or egg rolls Great food always friendly when I come in highly recommend
