I dined with a friend who is vegan  Neither of us had ever tried this restaurant so we had lunch  She had the macaroni and cheese and I had the hamburger  I have not had such delicious food in a long time  I am suspect of vegan burgers as they have been blandbut this was excellenthand cut sweet potato fries and the cucumber water is simply wonderful and refreshing  Dessert was fried plantains and every bite fantastic  We had excellent service and I will be a frequent customer This establishment could convince me to eat vegan forever
