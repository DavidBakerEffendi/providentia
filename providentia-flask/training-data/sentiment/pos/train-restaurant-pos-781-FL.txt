Came here for my husbands birthday Food was very good service very good and our a Teppanyaki chef was very entertaining and talented
Customer service was top notch As we had a  and  year old in our party we asked if they had any crayons They went next door to Dollar Tree and bought some Then they brought the birthday guy an ice cream sundae with a candle along with mini sundaes for my girls Very nice above and beyond service in my book
