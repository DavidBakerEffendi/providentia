Wow  I finally got out to visit Even Stevens  My Aunt  Uncle were here for a visit from Illinois  I decided to take them to a local eatery  We were not disappointed  
The staff were all very friendly and very welcoming
We went in on Thursday last week  I should have the greeters and staff names to give props due to them but I dont   In any case they were great reps to Gilbert and the kind of friendliness I experience on the regular in my new town   Props to Gilbert and the infectious nature of kindness that is one of the things I absolutely love about living here   
I ordered the Mihami Vice (Cubano) It was one of the best sandwiches I have had anywhere  The baguette was fresh and crusty on the outside  The flavors were fresh and the meat very tasty  Price for sandwich with choice of salad or chips   
Even Stevens donates and partners with  different organizations for every sandwich sold which is a very cool bees  knees biz to do  They give to community organizations to help feed individuals  and children that have fallen on difficult times  (See pic) the  organizations are in the pic attached 
My Aunt and Uncle split the Reuben and raves about it  
We all enjoyed our visit immensely  
Btw love the logo  This is a great restaurant and community support concept that other restaurants could follow suit to support people in need
