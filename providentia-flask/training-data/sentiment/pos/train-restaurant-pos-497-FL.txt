I love Top Golf and wrote a lengthy review for the Scottsdale location Just the same idea over in Gilbert We ended up meeting family here and had the MacDaddy burger which is the man n cheese burger Wow its really good and was reasonably priced Yes TopGolf can be expensive during the peak hours but if you share with your friends then its not too bad Plus its a blast if you bring your own irons to practice Not much more to say so if you are looking for a fun time with your friendsfamily then add this to your list As I mentioned in my Scottsdale review you dont even have to be into golf to enjoy TopGolf Just bagged with your friends and whack the little white ball down the range
