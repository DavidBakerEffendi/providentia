baconwrapped shrimp fajitas  thats all you need to know fucking delicious

server Jackie was great guacamole was a little spicy which was a neat surprise we managed to come on the evening of some high schools home coming and according to my wife modern homecoming dresses are way too hoochy for decency I guess it is a little unusual to see  year old gash in public the happy hour specials are amazing
