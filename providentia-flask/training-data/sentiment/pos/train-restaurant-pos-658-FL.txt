One of my favorite places that I can get a delicious and light breakfast lunch or dinner is kneaders I just love that they have a drivethrough as well Their French toast is to die for And you cant be a soup salad  sandwich combo for lunch It is a little bit busy during the peak meal time hours so plan ahead and go early Its a great place for group gatherings And has nice outdoor seating if the weather is agreeable The desserts are pretty amazing too  love the cute decor  gift items available for purchase
