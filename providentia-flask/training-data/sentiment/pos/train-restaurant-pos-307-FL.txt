I love this sports bar and restaurant The food was GREAT  Happy hour was sooooo good
The Mgr Josh is such a good guy and really professional He has a great work ethic I told him one little incident that happened and he took care of it It was a miscommunication on both our parts
Our martini was perfect Atmosphere was amazing Met new friends Kinda like Cheers
We are from Lagyna Niguel wish this place was next to us So long until next year for Spring Training
