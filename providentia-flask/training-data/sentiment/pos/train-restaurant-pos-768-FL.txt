My husband and I went the night after Valentines Day and made a reservation the night before for the teppanyaki table We had never been there never heard anything about it and didnt even look it up online It just happened to be near our house They were really busy and it was taking a little time to get things going But to our surprise the manager stopped by and asked myself and the couple next to us if she could get us another drink on her to say sorry for the wait It was unexpected and very nice of her to make sure we were happy and aware that we were seen She stopped by as we were leaving to say sorry again and explain a bit more that it was just one of those crazy nights but she had tried her best to keep it together and keep everyone happy and SHE DID JUST THAT ) She also reminded us to cover our  month old up cause it might be chilly out I will def be back OhI forgot to mention if the great survive wasnt enough my drinks were yummy my Philly roll was AWESOME and my shrimp teppanyaki was DEVINE Fan for life now
