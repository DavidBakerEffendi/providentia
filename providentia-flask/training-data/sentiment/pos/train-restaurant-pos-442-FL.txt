Try Seed Shack Its off of Baseline and ValVista They have THE BEST impossible burger I have had in the valley Love their take on it 

My review
My wife and I have been here twice The second time we brought our son We tried the tornados mac n cheese cauliflower tacos ginger carrot soup beet burger chicken sandwish  the impossible burger 

In short it was all amazing We actually went there twice yesterday  back again today 

The tornados are lightly battered and fried spiraled either potato or zucchini Both were amazing They had a nice seasoning too 

The mac and cheese was light with crispy bacon bits Very delicious 

The cauliflower tacos with chickpeas were incredible I have never eaten chickpeas that tasted so good 

My wife had the soup today and loved it It was creamy and tasty 

I had the beet burger yesterday It was hearty and full of beet flavor If you love beets youll like it My wife wasnt a fan but she doesnt like earthy stuff like that I loved it 

Now Their impossible burger was the best I have had yet Ive had a couple in the valley and this one was way better It was a misopeanut butter crispy wonton with a hint of spice jam Holy hell It was insane The patty was cooked perfect The combo of flavors was off the charts 

The chicken sandwish did not disappoint either It was insane and I would definitely get this again as well 

Overall all of their food was amazing I am so excited my family has a wonderful place to go on the east valley You gotta check it out 

Oh yeah  we also had the golden milk It was super delicious
