I had the opportunity to sample some items from Even Stevens last year Since then I have been wanting to go back Especially after learning about them giving a sandwich to someone in need for every sandwich purchased 

I do recall tasting bites of sandwiches however I do not recall it tasting so delicious I am not big on sandwiches these days but in trying to figure where to eat I suggested we check it out I am SO glad we did I was surprised that it wasnt busier although we were a while after lunch time I was stoked they had some beers to choose from I decided to try the Bahn mi sandwich on a whim the dude got the Gouda and the lil one had a pb and j We were all happy with out selections I was so impressed with mine that I was only willing to share how good I though it was I wasnt about to share any bites because I wanted it all I was a bit worried I wouldnt like the pork because it appeared to be a bit under but not was I wrong It was smokey it was cooked and it was delicious 

One note their house dressing is a bit pungent for my taste and though it was delicious I did find it slightly overpowering Not enough to lose any star rating though 

I will be back I like that they also display the sandwiches given back to the community inside I felt that helps to give an idea of their impact Super great concept super great food
