I got my vegan Thanksgiving preordered from Seed Shack and was very thankful during the whole meal I didnt feel left out from the family dinner like I normally do Plus it is so hard to find a genuinely GOOD vegan Mac  cheese and their whole menu is just great (as Ive tried so far) 
The owner Jade is such a dear and works way too hard to make this vegan restaurant a reality for all of us in the east valley Definitely recommend Im very excited to try the oriental twist theyre doing on the Impossible Burger
