Weve been ordering from this place for the past five years The food is the closest to Chinese takeout that I grew up with in NJNY Those who have criticized the food probably grew up with the fake bland franchised Chinese food Ive found out here on the west coast 

The woman who answers the phone can be a bit abrupt but again this is typical of authentic familyowned east coast Chinese restaurants Authentic and familyowned are both rarities here in Arizona At this point my husband and I find it kind of endearing 

Ive picked up my order once when my best friend from NJ was here visiting and she came back out to the car and commented on how clean it was inside 

Anyhow after five years I wanted to give them our good review
