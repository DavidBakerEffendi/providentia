Fresh hand made tastyChinese food
Every dish in the restaurant is freshly prepared and made daily I was particularly impressed in the honey walnut shrimp normally its rare to find quality shrimp in Arizona this fresh peeled hand battered jumbo shrimp dish beats its sea side competitors The chicken lettuce wraps were well seasoned and aromatic making a pleasant and fulfilling appetizer They had the most composed and fresh fried rice Ive ever tasted The steamed chicken  vegetables is a rare combination of both healthy and tasty 

Highly recommend visiting this place
