Weve been to this restaurant three times now and three times weve had an exceptional experience I absolutely love this place My vegetarian daughter from several options to choose from as well Some of the roles are very unique and tasted fantastic I think the best part is the exceptional service Each time our server has been outstanding and on one occasion the owner and Asian female sat down and talked with us extensively about the restaurant and its offerings She was super super friendly and we thought she was great This place goes on our regular rotation
