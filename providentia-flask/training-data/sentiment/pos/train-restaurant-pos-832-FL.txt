Carnitas a signature dish was perfect Anyone looking for typical retried beans Mexican food will want to look elsewhere This place is billed as gourmet and in my opinion it is My friends had the Tampico chicken sauted with artichoke and the spinach enchiladas This was a fantastic dining experience Even their salsa recipes were unique not ordinary and smokey delicious
