Way cool new place to eat in Downtown Gilbert I had a little trouble finding it its a little bit off of Gilbert Road behind other restaurants in a square Loved the decor and met the Manager (very nice guy) they have a great selection of unique and delicious subs and sandwiches and even Breakfast Burritos The staff was very helpful and I love their mission of every sub you buy they give one to charity I had the Pot Roast Dip it was great and cant wait to try others on the menu
