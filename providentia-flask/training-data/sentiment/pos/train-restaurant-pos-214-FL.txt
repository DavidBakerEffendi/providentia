King Wok delivers a tasty treat any day  including Christmas The cooks and delivery staff DID IT AGAIN We tried a few new items this time around very good the cold sesame noodle is a fave east coast dish a mound of perfectly cooked rice noodles delicately tossed with a sesame nutty spicy sauce Excellent served cold as leftovers but we could hardly stop eating them piping hot as they were delivered to our door Another family fave we tried is Orange Chicken wow The best this expert taster has ever had  Then Szechuan Beef with its nutty savory sauce and veggies studded with peanuts for added crunch fantastic  We will probably always have the House Won Ton soup and the House Pad Thai noodles because we cant live without those and again tonight they were top notch Thanks King Wok for a great job and expertly delivered right on time as always
