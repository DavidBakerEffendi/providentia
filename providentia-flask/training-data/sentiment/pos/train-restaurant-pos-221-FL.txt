Cannot believe my last review was  years ago  They are just as good today and always consistent  I picked up Shrimp Moo Shi my first time trying this dish  So delicious  I like taking food home so I can eat a little at a time  They packaged it in such away that makes it easy to heat up a small amount at a time  I just love this family run business  They really do quality dishes and reasonably priced
