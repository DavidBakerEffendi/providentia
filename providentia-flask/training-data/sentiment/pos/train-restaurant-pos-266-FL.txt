There is nothing about this place that I dont like The food is soooo good I ordered the chicken enchilada soup to start with which was very good I also ordered the nachos (with chicken instead of ground beef) and it was fantastic  My husband ordered the chicken tenders and fries Even the honey mustard was good The music was on point TVs are visible from anywhere you sit Our server was attentive and friendly even when it was real busy I read the happy hour menu and prices and cant wait to come back in during those times
