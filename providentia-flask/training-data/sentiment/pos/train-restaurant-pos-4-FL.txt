First time here with my husband since weve moved to Arizona weve been trying to find a good Chinese restaurant and we came across this one on the way to go eat somewhere else it was a really great experience food was great came out hot staff was very welcoming and nice The owner greeted us came to our table and helped us with the menu and also gave my husband a complementary egg flower soup on the house we highly recommend this Chinese restaurant and we will definitely be coming again
