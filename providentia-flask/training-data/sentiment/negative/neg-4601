Oh this place!  I wanted to like it, I really did! I had heard good things from a few friends.  I also felt guilty I hadn't been there since I lived so close to it!  Me and a group of friend went there.  At the very beginning of the meal they pretty much tell you service will be VERY slow.  They weren't kidding! I assume that maybe just meant a long wait for food.  It wasn't just food we waited for though!  We waited for drinks, bread an even silverware!  The server was no where to be found at times.

I would have forgiven all this if my food was amazing BUT it was far from it!  I'm very judgmental of Italian being that I am a proud Italian myself!  I ordered past vodka.  It was not the creamy delish sauce I expected, it was runny tastelessness!  My friend tried the regular spaghetti and the sauce tasted like it was from a spaghetti-o can.  Everyone agreed their meals left much to be desired.  Again, I really wanted to like this place, but after a 3 1/2 hour overpriced unappetizing meal I could no longer like the place!
