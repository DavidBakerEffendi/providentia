Saturday 10/22/17 came in to the restaurant with my son thinking since the ambiance looks great food might be awesome but don't that fool you we sat Dow. Did not take long ordered our food but damn ordering the food took almost an hour no manager can assist you or not even the waiter who took your order will say sorry it's taking a while had my soup it don't even taste how I expected it on top of that it is salty we need to ask them to box it but our check came in faster than we expected 
Awful food Awful service I don't recommend it at all
