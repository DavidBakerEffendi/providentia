I don't know what the hype is about. Seriously.

We made reservations for 7pm and were promptly seated immediately in front of the stage. We asked for a different seat in the room left of the stage as we didn't want to be deafened.

Food is not even worth mentioning. We got chicken rice soup (soup du jour) and buffalo wings and potato skin combo. Both seemed straight out of the package. Soup was peppery and better. We then waited. And waited. And waited an hour for our entrees to arrive. The waitress eventually acknowledged us (after my long stare downs) that the kitchen (and not the service) lost the paper and our ordered were lost. By then, it was already 930pm. We were starving and wolfed down our entrees by 950pm. Was the food good? No. The ribs were wayy to sweet. My filet was not bad. Was it worth the 27 and 33 CAD$ respectively? No.

I'm from NY. I've been to my fair share of Jazz clubs. Was this place phenomenon? No. Was it pricey as if it should have been? Yes. 

I'd rather not return and not recommend it to others. Save your 140 CAD$ and go elsewhere.
