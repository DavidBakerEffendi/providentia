Probably the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at. We were the only ones there, which should have been a red flag. I'm used to eating at Brazilian steakhouses like Via Brasil and Texas de Brazil. We were served one-bite sized portions of flavorless, overcooked meat. We all felt a little sick after eating and the next day. Disgusting, can't believe we paid $30 each for that poor excuse for Brazilian food.
