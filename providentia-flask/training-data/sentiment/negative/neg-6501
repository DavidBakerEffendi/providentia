What is this restaurant wanting to be when the designer finishes it? Or did they just run out of money? The d√©cor is Hodge podge at best.
But then there's the food. Also the cooks need recipes or at least some training. Nothing is more shocking than the poor attempt at flourless chocolate cake. Not just a complete fail, but something that doesn't even resemble the classic dish. Every meal we had was missing something. Chinese salad, was not very Chinese. Eggs Benedict was a betrayal on the original. Meatball appetizer was so salty and fried so hard as not to be edible. Skip this place until real cooks take back the kitchen.
