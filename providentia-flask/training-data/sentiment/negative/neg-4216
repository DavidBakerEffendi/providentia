I had high hopes for this place after seeing it on the food network and hearing good reviews from coworkers.

What we ate:
1. machaca burrito-according to my son this was one of the best burritos he has had in a while..it was $3.50 and he ate it in like 4 bites..a bit small.

2. Jade red pork quesadilla, jerk chicken, white rice- the rice was fine, the quesadilla only had a few pieces of pork and the chunks were huge and very very dry and tough. That jerk chicken was the most awful thing I have ever tasted !!!! that was not jerk chicken...it was soaked, dredged in nothing but black pepper, I almost choked. Jerk should be spicy and I am a fan of the spice, this was not edible in any way.

3. carnitas burrito, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice-the chicken was average, tasted like sweet and sour chicken, the jerk fried rice was almost as overpowering as the chicken, but edible. the carnitas was like no other we have ever seen...shredded beyond belief and a weird spinach flavor to it. we asked if spinach was in it and was told it was cilantro. The cilantro may have taken on a bitter flavor from being cooked for so long...whatever the case ...the flavor was just odd and had a horrible after taste for hours.

The staff were very nice and accomadating. 
i dont think i will venture here again...ever.
