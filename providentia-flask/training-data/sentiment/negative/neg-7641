If I could give zero stars I would. They can have one star for having clean glasses, but the rest of the night brings it back to zero. Took a couple minutes to get seated with practically no one in the restaurant. Go to order and they don't have the beef ribs that are on their menu, but you can get the pork "because they taste the same." Tell him to come back in a couple minutes and closer to ten minutes later our waiter comes back for my order. Food comes out and mine is miraculously with it, but whose is missing, none other than the toddler. He asks if he can get us anything else and I ask what about my daughter's food. Then he says oh yeah, it was burnt and it would be two or three minutes. Ten minutes later while keeping her entertained and  her mini pizza is still not out, we ask what's up and he says it is in the oven still. Husband has time to talk to the manager and come back without her pizza still being brought to the table bBy the time she gets her food, my food is barely warm, and it wasn't like I missed out on anything because the potato cakes were dripping grease and my chicken was beyond char-grilled; it was burnt, which they tried to hide by putting the burnt side down. No apologies from the waiter; no trying to fix it by him either. Manager offered to remake my food but I didn't want everyone waiting on me. Only slight fix on the night was the manager giving us half off and removing my daughter's pizza. That made our meals about the price of going to Applebee's, which is about the quality of the food we received. Plus who knows what the hell that smell coming from under out table that resembled rotting food. Now I get to go home and make myself something to eat since my food was swimming in grease and burnt. So much for a nice family dinner.  Won't be back ever. Should have taken not having what I wanted as a sign and left.
