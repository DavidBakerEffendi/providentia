Gosh darn it last nights meal sucked!!!  My sis came in from out of town to celebrate Mother's day with me.  She brought my little niece who we were also celebrating her birthday.

We told server upon getting our drinks that it was my nieces birthday and would like dessert for her after dinner. 
My sis had actually been to a Red Lobster the night before across town with some other family.  It was so enjoyable, she decided to order the same thing.  The mussel appetizer as an entree and shrimp cocktail.  She found the night before that she enjoyed dipping the bread in the delish broth of the mussels, as well as the mussels.  There was no broth.  She asked if she could get some more broth and instead the server brought her a bowl of garlic butter...My sis doctored it up by ordering extra lemon wedges, salt and pepper...it was edible then.
When the orders came, my nieces and my sisters came.  I waited patiently for mine and after about 10 minutes and their food was getting cold waiting on me, I chose to call the server, who, btw was very sweet.  I didn't even have to say anything and she saw I had no meal.  She said that she would go and find my lost meal.  About another 10 minutes and she brought it.  Let me mention that this was a Saturday night about 7pm...and it was not very busy (maybe shoulda been a sign)  All of my food (I ordered the $26 Ultimate Feast) was cold.  Ugh...My ceasar salad was disgusting...
They brought bill but forgot her bday dessert...we mentioned it (we were trying to be sneaky so it would be a surprise)  anyway, I'm rambling...we were forgotten often, and food was cold by the time we ate...Really wished it had been better
