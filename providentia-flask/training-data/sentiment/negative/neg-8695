Loved the concept, unfortunately the culinary execution left a lot to be desired.  Vegetarian / Vegan food can be great but their flavors and textures were unimaginative.  Service was good but sadly this was probably the worst meal I've had in a restaurant in 2 years.  Like others we found ourselves eating at another restaurant after dropping $250 for dinner.  Hoping honest feedback allows BLACKOUT the opportunity to make the right adjustments before its too late.
