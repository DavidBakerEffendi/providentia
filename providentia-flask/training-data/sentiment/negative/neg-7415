I feel like my reviews are going downhill since the first. This will be my last, as it's my last time at this place. Their lunch was always bad, but their dinner was incredible. We came here weekly and really enjoyed this as "our spot". 

The new chef that you just hired is terrible. The bruschetta had so much garlic I didn't even eat it (and I love garlic), the pasta was bad and it didn't have the ingredients it was supposed to (the waitress said he forgot the scallops in the pasta, but they didn't forget to charge me), and my husbands pasta was disgusting. We didn't finish our meals, told the server it was not good and that we would not be back (she knew we were regulars), and were told "see you around". This is not how to run a business. 

I would not recommend. If you are regulars, watch out for the changes. If you are the owner, be careful of your future and fix the issues. If you do fix them, write to me as I will come back; I really loved your place and I am so sad that my long term venture with your restaurant is over.
