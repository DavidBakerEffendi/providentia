The food was very very bland. I don't know if they just looked at me and saw that I wasn't an authority on Mexican food but I've definitely eaten at enough places to tell the difference. The beans had absolutely no flavor and the rice would've been better if made from a box. Really wanted to like this place but, alas, I should've just gone to a big chain for the money I spent here.
