I get that it's Peter Piper. So the expectations are kind of on the lower end. But this time they let a bum sit inside the restaurant.  I get it, it's hot out side. And if I was home less I would want an air conditioned place to relax and well.  But eating a salami out of a Chik fila bag and then sleeping in a booth. Sorry
Not when my children are running around.
Never again.
Sorry
