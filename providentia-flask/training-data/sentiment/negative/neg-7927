We placed an order for pick up.  We got home only to discover the pizza was made wrong.  Because the pizzas are over priced I felt we should get what we paid for.  I was REALLY disappointed in the customer service.  I knew our family dinner plans were going to be delayed another hour because it takes so long for the pizzas to be ready.  When I called they told me that I had to bring back the bad pizza BEFORE they would begin making it the way we ordered it.  So they messed up our order and I am inconvenienced by having the whole family waiting an hour to eat, I had to drive back down to the store and THEN I had to wait all over.  Not exactly the best way to treat customers.
