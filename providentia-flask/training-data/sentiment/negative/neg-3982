Screaming at me at the counter and how many cookies I wanted so he knew the proper box to put it in just take my order dude and then you could put it in whatever size box. 
I drove all the way from the strip to come here because of this the reviews reputations never again and the food was just okay former Jewish New Yorker just okay.
