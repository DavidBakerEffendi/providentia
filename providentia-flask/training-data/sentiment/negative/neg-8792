So disappointing. My friends and I have been going here for a long time (as one of them lives within walking distance). 

On a Saturday night we walked over thirsty and excited for the weekend. God's honest truth, not one us the six of us had a sip of alcohol prior to our arrival yet we were greeted with, "I'm sorry one of you appears to be swaying and I can't let you in." 

When we spoke to the manager, he didn't offer ANY SOLUTION what-so-ever! Big mistake. We won't be returning. PS. Check out the Social Box much nicer atmosphere for a classy Saturday night. Drinks are excellent!
