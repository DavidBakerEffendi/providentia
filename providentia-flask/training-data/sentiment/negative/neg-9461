Holy Salty Soup! I literally JUST went there over my lunch break and I can't even eat the chicken noodle soup because its so salty...it almost burns. I am HIGHLY disappointed that a deli cannot do yummy chicken noodle soup properly. Its like I poured 2 salt packets into my mouth. I got the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo and for $7.75 you would think the sandwich (the Symphony) would be a lot bigger than what I got. It's basically the size of a half of a ham and cheese I make at home. Although the sandwich was kinda tasty, for a half, it's still TINY and not worth it for $7.75 and a cup of a salt. I don't think I'll go back. I am disappointed.  There just isn't a good sandwich shop around here, I guess. Boo.
