Dumbest place ever! Tried to order sweet and sour chicken with shrimp fried rice. I was told i couldn't replace the flavorless steamed rice for shrimp fried rice I'd have to order a separate 6 dollar order of fried rice. You've got to be joking. No way in hell. And then when i said well screw the meal give me an order of shrimp fried rice and a side of sweet and sour chicken she cant speak English so well...after trying to order for 15 mins ..needless to say i will not be going back....
