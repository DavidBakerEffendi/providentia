HUGE disappointment. We had an extremely poor experience on Sun 10/15. Our server forgot our bread, did not bring us appetizer plates for our appetizer, then my husband's beef was very undercooked. When reported to the server she replied that "they won't do anything because there's less than half left" She, herself realized this was a ridiculous statement as demonstrated when she nervously glanced at the plate which was 95% full and only a couple of bites taken. She had already passed by the table a couple of times, glanced at his plate and never once asked if his meal was ok. I ordered the same entree and also had undercooked meat but less so than my husband, however even though there was also a good portion of my meal remaining she did not ask how mine was and if I was satisfied. She proceeded to ask if we wanted dessert, then brought the dessert before clearing the dinner plates, and without fresh utensils or napkins. 
We'd have requested a manager on the spot but we were in with our daughter who is only home for the weekend and we chose to try and enjoy the remainder of the meal with her. Katelyn was our server and her service was awful and she should be coached. I will be contacting a manager tomorrow, Monday. 
What a wasted of time and money.
