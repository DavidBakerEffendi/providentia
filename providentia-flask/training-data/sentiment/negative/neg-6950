This place is nasty. Their pizza is shit. It sits out all day and is very dry. I bet some of those pizzas are a few days old. Nothing there is fresh. And when you "order" a pizza slice they just give you an old nasty dry piece of pizza thats been sitting out all day. I will never be back. I rather go to nypd pizza. Hell even dominos and pizza hut has better pizzas than this shit hole.
