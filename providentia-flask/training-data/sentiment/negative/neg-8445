The Bellagio buffet is a meer shadow of its former self. My wife and I were big fans before this weekend. If you want to try a good buffet do not go to the Bellagio for one. Honestly I'd rather have gone to Home Town Buffet then to have to sit through the Bellagio buffet. The service is nonexistent and the quality of the food has gone down the drain and into the refinement holding tanks. 

The only reason I can justify one star is because there is food there.
