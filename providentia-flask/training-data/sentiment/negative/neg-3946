I wish I could give them 0 stars!!! This place is the worst dining experience at Downtown Summerlin.

To begin with, the menu is impossible to understand... They give funny names but no description of what exactly you're ordering. 

I purchased a Groupon, had to go in 3 times before using it, because every time I went in, they were out of something... How can a Southwest Grill run out of such things as Rice, Beans, or veggies?

I finally went in on a Monday, they run a special that any burrito you buy is $5.99... I advised them that we had a Groupon... I was advised they don't accept those on discounted food, I found that acceptable. My wife ordered a bowl and I ordered a smaller burrito. 

Once we got up to pay, I handed the young punk my phone, and he was baffled and told me they can't accept the Groupon I paid for.... He kept insisting that he had to give me the discount price because, "It's Company Policy!" 

I've eaten there a few times during day hours, and it was fine, but as time has gone by, things have changed.  I will never go back. 

Quality of food I rate 2 Stars, Zabas is better, and a cool restaurant called Panchos is within walking distance. 

I should've known that Moes is horrible, because every other restaurant at Downtown Summerlin is always packed... This place, not so much!

I wanted to call and speak to the GM, but figured "What good will that do?" They'll offer me a free meal I don't want! 

I wouldn't recommend this establishment to even my worst enemy!
