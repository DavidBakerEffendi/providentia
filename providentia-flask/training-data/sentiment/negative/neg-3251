Horrible service.  Had to return eggs (snotty). Had to return bacon (wimpy and slimy).  Never came back to refill coffee.  Waitress was Sabrina.  I was holding the coffee cup up in the air.  A guy asked if we wanted more coffee.  We said yes, but he never came.  My husband got up and got his own and then another customer followed suit.  My niece was asked 3 times if she wanted more coffee and so far nothing.  Oops it just came.  Said the manager would come over but he didn't.  They took one breakfast off but no manager.
