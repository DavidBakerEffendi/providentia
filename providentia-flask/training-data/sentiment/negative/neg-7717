Not sure what the hype of this place is. 

This is the subway of pizza.  You pick a crust, I chose the thin which had no taste.  

Then you pick a sauce.  Not sure why the call crushed tomato sauce that when it's a liquified catsup. 

They put a hint of cheese and the toppings.  They treat the topping as if they are going broke. Scarcely putting any toppings on this tasteless, bland "pizza".  

And for $15.....this is one place I'll never visit again. 

And to compliment this tasteless product the 9 people behind the counter act like they are working on a chain gang. No smiling or interactions with customers or each other.  They all look pissed off for being there. 

And a bad attitude pairs will with lousy food.
