Ordered a burger and fries, they were old and burger was pink.  Took it back and no apology, just questioned about the time I got it and brought it back.  I was on break when I bought it...came back 2 hours after my shift.  I can't readily leave work.  Bar tender snatches my debit card out of my hand then re-charges me.  I guess he didn't expect me to ask for a receipt.  Never again!
