We wanted to have a quick drink and food. The guy next to us took two bites of his chicken  wings and left the rest there. The other table's food looked really bad so we just ordered 2 shots of Don Julio BLANCO cause they didn't have AÃ±ejo. No biggie. We were offered a double for 3 bucks more each. Ok cool. That double was not a double but we thought, ok.   I even mentioned to the waitress that didn't look like a double but she didn't respond. Whatever...till we got the bill. 34 bucks for 2 shots. Like really?????  We travel ALOT and that is way too much for what we got (AT an AIRPORT). I paid it and when I left, I told the hostess that that was mega expensive and I was gonna YELP them. As I was walking away, she said, Do IT!!!  Wow!  So we went next door to  Noca sandwich shop. The air vents and light fixture right above the tables hadn't  been cleaned in YEARS!  Wow. PHOENIX!!!  Y'all should be embarrassed!!!  I will spare you the pictures. Don't wanna ruin YOUR lunch!!!!!
