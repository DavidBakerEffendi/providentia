Starving on the way home and Bojangles is the only option coming from uptown. It was 10:26 and tried to order something. "We're out of chicken." Um, what? Whether you didn't want to make more or you aren't capable of ordering food it doesn't really matter. Unacceptable. The last time I was there I was waiting for my food for over 20 minutes and swore I'd never go back. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.
