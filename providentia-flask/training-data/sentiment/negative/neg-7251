The downsides: overpriced food, limited menu, very slow and inconsistent shoddy customer service. THE MOST RECENT TIME I WENT, I, TOO, NEVER RECEIVED A TEXT FROM THE HOSTESS (just like another fellow yelper). Disappointed- I wanted this gig to be wonderful and exciting for my hood. 
The plusses: Great decor, prime location...I want to compliment more, but it would be a stretch
