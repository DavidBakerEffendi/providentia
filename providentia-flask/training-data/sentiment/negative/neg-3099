I would rather give 0 stars!
It's 12:08am and both my 4 year old daughter and I are still awake with food poisoning after eating at this establishment! We ate chicken fingers (and that's the only thing we ate after 2pm, so I know that's what caused this!)
My daughter is vomiting in excess and I can't get off the toilet!
We are healthy people, this isn't a coincidental 24 hour bug, this is a direct result from eating here!
I have never reviewed a restaurant or any other business for that matter, so don't think this is some ploy for free food! I wouldn't eat it for free or even if you paid me!
My first time, and definitely my last at this place!
You can delete this to protect your image, but I will post this everywhere I can as I sit here on the toilet all night you son of a bitches!
NO EXCUSE FOR THIS!
