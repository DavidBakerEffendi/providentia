7+ dollars from some horrible orange chicks.  Only went down because of the sause.   Chicken was dry and mostly bread.      Very lose cause the food is always good until today.  Normally it's meaty much and flavoryful.  Today it was dry orange flavoured bread.   Probably w9nt order that again. Not worth risking the loss in money.
