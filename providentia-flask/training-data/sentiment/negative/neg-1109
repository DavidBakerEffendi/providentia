On my first visit here I found a hair in my salad.  It spoiled it for me forever.  However I must say the salad looked great before I found the hair, and I also tried my friend's French toast which was marvelous. But for me, I don't care how good the food is, if you're dirty I can't come back and never will.  Too bad
