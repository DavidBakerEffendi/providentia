Strike Out- Not much good to take away here. Not the food. 
Server was poorly trained, food on the menu - X
Salty Fajita bowl had about 3 oz of chicken - X
Bland and watery RF beans and canned Enchilada Sauce - X

Maybe if you drink enough at Pattie's you won't notice the high prices and lousy food...
