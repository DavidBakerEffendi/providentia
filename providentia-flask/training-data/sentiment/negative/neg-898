I came here to use a Living Social deal for a Manicure and Pedicure. The two people who did my manicure and pedicure were very nice and friendly, despite the conversations feeling forced. The salon is clean and I really liked how the pedicure spa station was set up (a comfortable bench filled with dozens of pillows). Unfortunately, compared to other places, this is what I didn't like:

-No base coat was used on either my hand or toenails.
-An actual nail tech did not do my pedicure. She is a hair stylist and this definitely showed when she didn't use anything to separate my toes, so a few of my toes were messed up before the top coat was even applied
-...AND she only put 1 coat of polish
-The entire appointment felt rushed.
-It was unnecessarily difficult to get an appointment. Just to book a mani-pedi, the receptionist advised me to call at least 2 days in advance. When I did call, it went to voicemail and I left a message specifically asking for Friday (3 days advance). I did not get a call back until the next day and when I did call back, they said they couldn't fit me in. I had to bring up the fact that someone from the salon called and left me a message to finalize a time for Friday. Only after that did they schedule me.

I would be really upset if I had to pay the original price ($60) for the experience that I got. A salon like this, one that touts itself as a classy salon, should not have service like this. I've had better mani-pedis at  hole-in-the-wall places and for less than half their price.

I'm not sure if this experience is due to the fact that I was a coupon client. If it is, then that's a damn shame. If it wasn't, then DEFINITELY do NOT go here. There are tons of other places in town that you can go to get a good manicure and pedicure for a good price.
