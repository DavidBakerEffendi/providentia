Bar none the absolute worst Asian food I have ever had coupled with bad service. I did not tip because I was dissatisfied with my service and experience and the fact that they do not take American Express. The server then argues with me and says I should tip him even though I am not satisfied. It is the worst etiquette to solicit a tip from a customer. I will never return to this place and I would highly recommend that no one else does either.
