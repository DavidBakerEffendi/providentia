Customer service was sub par. Employees seemed bored and miserable. Very skimpy on the meat. Appears that they don't put the regular amount of meat like other subways. Also very skimpy on the cheese. 

Asked for soup on two separate occasions and the first time they had not placed the order. The second time I was told they didn't have any made. 

The veggies appear to be not fresh. Yellow tomatoes. Wilted spinach. Mushy pickles. 

Probably won't return to this location.
