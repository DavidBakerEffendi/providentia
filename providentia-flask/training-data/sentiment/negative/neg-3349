Terrible Terrible!!! Went her last week. Food was stale and old.  Tasted terrible. Told the server. He ignored my comment. I think he went to the owner and he ignored it. I have been coming here and have good experiences before. Very sad state of affairs. No apology , no credit no discount offered. Avoid at all costs!!

I visited the restaurant on March 10th around 8:30 pm. I don't remember the server name. I would expect some sort of credit for the inconvenience and poor quality of food.

I did complain to the server. He did not do anything. This shows how much you value your customer. 

Update : 
Owner has refuse to refund and saying that I didn't complain to the server which is not true. This shows how much tandoori times value their customers. Will never go there again!! 0 stars !!
