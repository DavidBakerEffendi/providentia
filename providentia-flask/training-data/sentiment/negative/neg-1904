Wow.

Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in my life.

Definitely the worst potuguese chicken I've ever had. 

Where to start.

Chicken tasteless despite asking for spicy, no seasoning present whatsoever.

Potatoes weren't even cooked properly, I've never been served uncooked potatoes ever.

Salad no dressing.

No piri piri with chicken.

Hard skip guys. Don't fall for the litany of reviewers with less than 10 total reviews I actually walked to the garbage can and threw out more than half of this travesty.

I can't believe it was this bad.
