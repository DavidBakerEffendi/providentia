I received your solicitation for the Cooking Class on Saturday 2/11/2017.  I signed my wife and sister in-law up for the class.  Based on your words in your ad, I told them that they will actually be involved in preparing the meal.
 Here are your words "for an exclusive HANDS-ON cooking class."   I was shocked when my wife called a few minutes ago and told me that they did not have any "HANDS ON". I have frequented Roy's numerous times over the past 20+ years at various locations and shocked about this misrepresentation
