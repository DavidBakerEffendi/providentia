My server wasn't good.  The coffee wasn't the best.  My fresh toast wasn't even cooked all the way. The eggs that they dipped the bread in to make it French toast was still runny!!!! I couldn't even eat it so I asked for a fruit platter but my waitress wasn't even paying attention to the table so I had to ask someone else who was just a bus boy.  She brought it out and then brought out the dip ten minutes later saying it was the cooks first day..... what ?!
