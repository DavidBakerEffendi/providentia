I came and drove miles away to use a gift certificate. They did not honor it. Guadalupe was the managers name. She was a pleasant lady but still couldn't provide a solution to the problem.  They all looked like seers with headlights. They specifically said they knew nothing of the coupon and did not honor it. The certificate had the location name and address.  I'm sure their food was delicious but they're marketing on the other hand.....
