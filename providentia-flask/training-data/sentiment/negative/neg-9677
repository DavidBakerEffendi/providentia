I don't think I've ever left a negative review but this place can be described by three words. Terrible. Service was awful, offered happy hour prices to then find out we would t get them and the happy hour items we were given as recommendations were not on happy hour regardless. In addition to this the sushi was not good. This place makes fry's sushi sound amazing. They did have some bomb ice-cream for my birthday so u would advise to stick with with the free ice-cream and water unless something changes.
