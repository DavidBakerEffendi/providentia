I love eating at Capriotti's but the last couple of visits have been bad. I ordered asandwich on the phone, came home and had a  totally different sandwich. Okay mistakes happen I understand. Today I came in order sandwich on the phone and they told me to be ready in 15-20 minutes. I show up and I pay but for some unknown reason my sandwich that I just paid for it grew legs and walked out of the restaurant!! Two people working there. A young lady started looking at the guy she writes with and said where's the sandwich? I know I made it. Then she says maybe the delivery driver took it. The young man responded and said the driver has been gone for 45 minutes. She frantically started to make me a sandwich immediately even though I called ahead of time. She could have said let me upgrade you to a bigger sandwich or the next one is on us or something! Point is go somewhere else. It just seems it's a mistake upon mistake upon mistake. If you're okay with it then this is your place to eat!! I'm going to search a different Capriotti's.
