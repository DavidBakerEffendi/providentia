Wayyyy overpriced for the quality of food. And very small selection to choose from. Best thing I had was the fries, and that's just sad for that to be the case. The Shepard's pie was not that tasty. Kind of tasted frozen and heated up to serve. Wish I would have stuck with the flying biscuit instead of trying to venture over to a new place.
