I work in the office park where this place is located. I will eat there only out of desperation. In fact, this past Friday, I was short on time and skipped lunch rather than going there. Their food is mediocre at best. I think it changed hands in the Spring of 2008 and since then, portions are smaller, prices are higher, and I think the woman who appears to be the owner is irritating.   They charge you to pay with a debit/credit card. Also, their ventilation is not good, so you will leave there smelling like fried food.

The old owners were very nice people and very fair. My only complaint with them was that the coffee was Douwe Egberts and was terrible.
