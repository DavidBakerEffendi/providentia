Walked in at 5:30pm on a Thursday night. Not busy at all; asked bartender if we could sit wherever, said yes. We sat there in a booth for FIFTEEN MINUTES! No one came by ever and we were right in view of the bar! We ended up walking out! We always go to the Madison location and thought we'd try this one since we enjoy their food and service. Sun Prairie location= Never again.
