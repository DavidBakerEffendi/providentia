Is there any way to put 0 stars ?!?

It was great to have an all you can eat sushi spot right down the street from home until we were having lunch and got an uninvited visitor to our table (cockroach). Needless to say we got up and left. Still was charged and the "manager" that was going to call me back never did. So yeah.... Never again.
