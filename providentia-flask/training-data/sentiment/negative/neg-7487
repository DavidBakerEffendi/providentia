Chinese food should not be expensive. If you want Chinese food, save your money and get it from China town.

People who say this is authentic, you need to look in a mirror and check your skin color. Because unless you are yellow, you don't know what authentic Chinese food is. 

I got the pot stickers and although I liked how they fried the bad boy all the way around. It lacked flavor so the soy sauce was necessary to down these guys. 

Now I got the Dan Dan Noodles (spicy peanut noodle) and this shit was disgusting. It tasted as if they mixed greasy oil with old ass peanut butter. Like the peanut butter was spooned from the jar and sat in the the sun for days. I took a few bites thinking it would improve but it just got worst $15 wasted for sure.  I got serious number 4's the following day. Number 4 is explosive diarrhea, like that shit was shotgunned. Please save your time and money and do not eat here.
