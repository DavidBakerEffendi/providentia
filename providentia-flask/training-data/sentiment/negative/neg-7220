This place is the worst place I have been to in a while. It seems like the guy that was handling cash was trying to make money off of us for every little thing. The signs all on the strip and everywhere in the front clearly has a meal that includes rice and salad in the picture for 6.99 but the guy said that they don't do that any more. And on top of the that they added an extra dollar charge inside. So why do you guys still have the sign up?! The meals on the menu have "all the kabobs come with sides" and yet the guy wants to charge us more for sides. They have a outdated menu which they do not honor. The customer service is horrible. It's pretty much no service or the bare minimum to get the customers money. I do no recommend coming to this place at all.
