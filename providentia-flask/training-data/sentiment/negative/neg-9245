Went in for a simple McChicken plain. Like I always get.
Nobody knew what it was. The girl at the counter was so rude to me as well as the manager. The one gentleman offered to ask the manager and was very polite. When the manager didn't know what I was talking about the girl at the counter replied with "told ya" Really? Ya'll don't know what a damn McChicken is? Don't go there!
