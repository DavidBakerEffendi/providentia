My husband and I were victims of theft/robbery during the day while at the pool.  Someone came into our room and stole several belongings.  The privacy sign was on the door and someone came in anyway.  The door was shut, someone had another key.  We are currently waiting for our investigation to go through however, beware of your valuables!  Put them away. I thought at a five star hotel we would be safe of such theft.  My husband and I were wrong!
