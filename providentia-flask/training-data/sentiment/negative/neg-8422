Getting a quick breakfast on "The Strip" can be a bit challenging if you aren't looking for a full-service restaurant. That's why I was excited to learn about La Creperie.

I ordered the Bayonne with "imported prosciutto, mozzarella, fresh basil, top with bechamel." After a surprisingly long wait, out came a folded crepe with HUGE chunks of incredibly, overpoweringly salty prosciutto inside, a small amount of melted cheese, and a few sprinkles of shredded basil on top.

I love salty food, but I could barely handle the massive amount of salty prosciutto in the crepe, especially compared with the mere token amount of barely basil. And the bechamel was just an added layer of gross.

Epic fail.
