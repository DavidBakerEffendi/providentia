Worse than pei Wei.  That's saying a lot.  I had it awhile again and tried Ling and Louie's again hoping it would be different. Nope. Food came out like a mush and was bland.   The honey Walnut shrimp was like honey Walmart shrimp.  Tastes like it had been microwaved. I had two bites of my wife's evil princess whatever and spit it out. Even the crab rangoons were oily.   Never again. And for comparison sake it was worse than last time.
