First time there and it was pretty ridiculous. Ordered certain food because of allergies.. They brought out something nasty instead that was deep fried..  Sent it back because it looked like it was freezer burned. The person I was with ordered nachos and they forgot the chicken on hers. She sent it back and they returned with a pile of dry microwaved chicken they just threw on top of the original nachos. We ended up leaving and not eating anything there. Not sure about the other location but wouldn't recommend this place to anyone
