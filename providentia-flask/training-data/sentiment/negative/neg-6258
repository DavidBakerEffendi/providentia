Worst experience ever.  Food was just not good.  I asked if I could have the double boss burger cooked med rare.  They told me that the burgers are only cooked one way.  Apparently that way is well done/burnt cause I thought I was chewing a rubber hockey puck.  The service was awful.  It took a good 15 minutes to take my order on a slow day.  The burger came without bacon like it was supposed to.  And the burger was one of those too big to actually bite into deals and no extra napkins were provided. After not being able to flag down the waitress, I resorted to stealing napkins off the surrounding tables.   
It was cool that they had all the nfl games there, but the one I wanted to watch didn't come in right and would blank out on ever play.  Very frustrating watching a food all game that blacks out as soon as the ball is snapped and then comes back in at the end of the play. 
I asked to talk to the manager cause of my burnt burger, the game not working right, and the chip in my glass that cut my lip.  I ask the waitress in the 1st quarter.  Then asked another waitress at grab the manager in the 2nd quarter.  Apparently he was busy cause after asking a 3rd waitress to speak to the manager in the 3rd quarter he still never showed.  By the time the 4th quarter came around, I was so frustrated I left.  I was trying to post this review while I was there but their wi-fi is so shoty, the post wouldn't go through.
