I don't want to give it any stars, it's a trick! the lobster isn't lobster it's mushy and gross.  It wasn't worth the price at all.  I really wish I hadn't insisted on coming here and paying more for less. The crab legs were the only thing I had that was good but you can't really mess that up. Next time I'm in town I'll pass on the buffet scene.
