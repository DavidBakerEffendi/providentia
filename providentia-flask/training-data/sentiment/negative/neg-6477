Worst food I have had. Do not go. Service was bad. Long wait for food.  Rice was mediocre. Chicken not flavorful.  It tasted like the frozen general tsao chicken you buy frozen at the store.  Spring roll appetizer was ok.  Also very expensive being vegas.  For the same price I could have taken a taxi to and from lotus of Siam which is the best Asian restaurant Ever and had a full meal.  If you don't want to leave the casino just go to the burger place in the mall. Much better
