I hear the banjos playing.  This is where the characters from the movie "Deliverance" come to work and to shop.  Having been to the newest addition in the Giant Eagle portfolio, I was somewhat stymied by the fact that this store had the same name.  When I entered, I apparently went the wrong way through the entire store.  Well, who laid at the store in that bass-ackwards way it was?  No one is going to walk past the cashiers dodging all of the out-going shoppers to get to the supposed beginning of the route you are "supposed" to take.  Someone needs to rethink the circulation.

Then, the lack of fresh produce (read as wilted and moldy) and the lack of any true selection...well, I won't be returning.
