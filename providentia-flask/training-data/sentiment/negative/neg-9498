I am a master BBQ kcbs judge. I had heard this place was good so off we go.
No parking spaces open so looked around and finally parked by the car wash. Long line with one register open. When I got up to order the lady informed me she was fairly new. She took my order and had to re enter it six, yes six times. Two brisket sandwiches and side with drinks 36 bucks.
Went to table and stopped off for sauces. Took 4 kinds and tasted them before food came. They were either to hot or to bland. Food comes and did not do sweet fries did regular one. They were good though. Mac was very plain the metal bowl was the best part, no cheese or flavor. Beans were watery and no flavor. Slaw was plain. Brisket with pickles and onions on toasted bread it in half. Tried without sauce but found way over cooked and totally dry. No wood smoke or flavor. Put some sauce on but really could not help this poor excuse of BBQ. Place if it was good at one tine has lost its way.
Real BBQ can be found at miss Peggy's BBQ or Brian's black mt. BBQ.
I would tell you if you want real BBQ and not car wash food go to one of these I promise you you'll be easily able to tell the difference. Maybe a good car wash but certainly not a BBQ pit.
