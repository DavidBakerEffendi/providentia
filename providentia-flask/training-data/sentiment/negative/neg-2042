Stopped by here today since I knew there were some slots I wanted to try since I watch a lot of YouTubers post their live play videos. I was excited to try a slot called Toki Doki and 1 minute or so into my video I was approached by security and this guy asks me if I'm recording so I say yes and he tells me that I'm not allowed to record. I proceed to explain that it's good advertisement for people that wanna see certain games and make them wanna come spend money here. NOPE. He says that recording slots will somehow give me and other people an advantage on how to win and i tell him thats a stupid statement and that slots are run by computers so there's no advantage for players. He didn't care and told me it's their policy of no videos and makes me delete it. This is absolute bs on Venetian's part and I will never gamble here again. Screw you Venetian management.
