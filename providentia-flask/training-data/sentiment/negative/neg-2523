Pros: Awesome ambience. Best in the fast food business.

Cons: Wish taste of the food was Indian. I had chicken biryani bowl and mango lassi. It was the worst biryani I have ever had. It wasn't spicy and chicken pieces lacked flavor. Mango lassi wasn't great either and lacked sweetness.

Advice: If you like real Indian food, avoid this place. And on second thought...if you like good food, avoid this place.
