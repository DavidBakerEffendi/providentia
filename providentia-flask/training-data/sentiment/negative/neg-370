How do people eat at this restaurant. The interior is dirty and filthy. The outside of the restaurant looks like it's about to collapse any moment and it hasn't been renovated since 1935. 

Dined here twice and won't be coming back again. The employees are clueless, management is clearly lacking and refuses to invest money on renovations when their only profit is from $6 roti orders. Please improve your food, the customer service and the cleanliness before the   Government inspectors comes in to find all the expired frozen food and mold you got in your restaurant. 

The food was very suspicious and tasted below mediocre. I assume most people rate this place cause of the price. I love Indian roti house and their butter chicken roti is $16 and well worth the money. You get enough chicken in the roti that you can't even finish.

I guess you get what you pay for here.
