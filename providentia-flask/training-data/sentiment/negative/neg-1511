the worst location in las vegas- avoid at all costs.
this place is always filthy and equipped  with incompetent, rude staff. ordered a wet burrito, was given a box of fries. are you serious? can't even trust these people with a very simple order which took over 20 minutes. do not waste your time and money on this b/s establishment.
