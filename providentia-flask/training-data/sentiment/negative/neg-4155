We went here over Memorial weekend for brunch after church. We wanted to go to Harbor Palace, because that's where we usually go...but it had a long wait. Sam Woo was our second stop. It was pretty crowded, as expected. When we walked in the hostess station was empty, so we made our way to the cashier and asked to be put on the waiting list. She rudely told us to go back to the hostess station and wait for her there. We were given a ticket with the number 1 on it, so I was pretty hopeful. After about 20 minutes of waiting, we noticed that people that arrived after us were being seated. We got even more suspicious when the hostess asked us again how many were in our party & gave us a ticket with the number 8 on it. Things were obviously very disorganized.

My mom then caught the hostess' attention and asked her exactly how their seating was conducted, because we had been waiting awhile, parties were being seated before us that arrived after, and she wasn't calling any numbers. Her reply was, and I kid you not "You know, don't worry about it. They have the bigger party and their table became available first. You just have to wait for a smaller table, so don't worry about it."

It was so rude. I think she realized she said something wrong, because as were were leaving (didn't want to patronize a place like that) she said "I have your table ready for you now." My mother turned around, handed her the ticket back and said "You know, don't worry about it."

The look on that hostess' face was priceless :)
