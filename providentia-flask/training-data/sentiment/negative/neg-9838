The wait staff was really good, two of the meals were ok but not put together correctly the third meal was straight out of a microwave. The plate was so hot you couldn't touch it the food was slimy and cold. The manager on duty came to talk with me and apologized and offered different food which I declined after knowing she didn't truly understand the problem. Oh and it's my first visit to any red lobster in 18 months and it's my birthday.  $65 for this?
