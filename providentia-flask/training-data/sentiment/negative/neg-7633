the most terrible servie EVER!  took 18 min to get water, and our waiter never came with our appetizers... after looking around for 31 min i think a manager got a feeling something was wrong... he came up and i explained we had been waiting almost 35 min and never got our appetizers, took 20 min for our drinks... and then all of the sudden there was ALL of our food. minus the ONE THING WE WANTED.... i wish i would have left and not paid them for the meal.
