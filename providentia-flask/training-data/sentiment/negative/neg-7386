The workers are really nice and it is a big, open restaurant with lotz of different burger flavours.

I did not enjoy the food. 

The Apple butter BBQ sauce hamburger didn't have any flavour and the fries tasted kind of bitter and earthy.

Plus he gave the girls next to me a bigger portion of fries than I got *grrrrrr.

I will not be returning.

P.s. cash only
