I was visting Charlotte for Easter weekend.  My nieces, sister and I had a relaxing day planned.  Lunch first and then a facial.  Girls day out.  My niece had purchased a Living Social promotion with a value of $50.  Our bill amounted to 58$ and some change.  When we presented it to our server he came back with it and said he could not honor it.  We asked to speak to the owner.  An older Italian woman with red hair came out and told us that because there were 4 of us at the table that we could not use the coupon.    She told us that we should read the fine print.  My niece tried to explain why we thought the coupon was valid, but the owner would not hear any of it.  She walked away yelling at us.  The real shame is that the food was good, but that owner is a nightmare.
