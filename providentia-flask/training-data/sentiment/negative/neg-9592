I don't understand the concept of faking meat and chicken and seafood. That's the main problem with this failed culinary approach. There's some great vegan food in the world, but this food sucks. 

The unchicken and waffles are a disaster. The waffles are like cardboard. Absolutely flavorless and probably frozen. The syrup is like yellow water. The greens were good, honestly, but overall, this dish makes for one ugly plate.

Started with chips and guacamole and pico de gallo. EVERYTHING was bland. The pico de gallo was as spicy as jicama (ie not at all) and watery. You have to work hard to offer bland chips and guacamole. 

At least they have beer, so you can drink a lot and forget you ate here.
