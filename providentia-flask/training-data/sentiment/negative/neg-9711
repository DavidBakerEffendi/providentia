Huge chunk of fat in my pork, which I was told was was the Lean one between  pork and brisket. Potato  salad was cold cold but full of red onion. The beans were still hard, undercooked,  but tasted ok. The pulled chicken  was not hot!  The tops of the bottles on every table table were filty! New place, won't  go back!
