Long time customer BUT, Not Now!  The lady at the front Argued with me because I wanted a Booth by myself instead of sitting at the bar!?!   There were booths available, I know! I can see them!  I told her several times I wanted a booth.  She continued to argue with me..   I said Forget it!  I'm going to another restaurant!   I WILL NEVER BE BACK!
