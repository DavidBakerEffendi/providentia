My family and I had been here before and the experience was good, so we decided to go back. 

This experience was horrible and we will never be going back again. 

We went in on a Friday night and there was only one other table of people. Looking back on this, I should have taken that as a sign of things to come. 

We order our food and 45 minutes goes by. We see the other table receiving their food and we watch as 3 other "to go" orders walk in and pick up their orders. I stop the waitress to ask her what is going on and she tells me that they had to get the other table fed first. I'm thinking to myself, they can only make one tables worth of food at a time? What would they do if 10 tables filled up?

She tells me it'll only be 10 more minutes. 

10 minutes goes by and my 3 year old is fit to be tied and my wife has had enough. We get up to leave and they say "oh please it's just about out" and I say, no thank you we're going to go to Subway. 

They have the nerve to charge me for the 4 drinks (ice tea) and the soup. $14.00. I was so pissed and hungry I just paid it, but in retrospect I should have told them to go screw themselves. 

Horrible service, they could care less about their customers and absolutely no remorse about the situation at all. 

Never going back.
