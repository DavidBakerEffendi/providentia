This location has 4+ signs advertising "BREAKFAST ALL DAY!". I pulled up to the drive thru at 11am today to order an egg McMuffin and was promptly told by the voice in the box "we are on to lunch" so, wait, this location does NOT sell breakfast all day? Is this a case of false advertising that I smell?

Or is it just a problem with an as*hole employee again?
