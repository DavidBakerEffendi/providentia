I look up and see waitress petting a dog. Thank God we got our food first. Then I see the owner and a child feeding the dog with the same hand they are eating with. The waitress ask is there anything else she can get us my grand girl said she wanted a refill on her drink. I said no thank you and can we get that other waitress. I have no problem about you being a dog lover but don't force me to be one
