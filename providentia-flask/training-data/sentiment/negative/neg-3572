A strong underperformer in many categories. The restaurant is clean, that's the one positive. I had to shut off the supposed free wifi in order to access internet. The fries were undercooked, which is amazing, considering how thin they are. Normally this fries are my fave, but these are served a pale yellow, no golden brown you would expect. The hamburger was crispy around the edge and unpleasant. I guess the quality of the food is what keeps the dining room less than half full even during the lunch "this". I hadn't eaten here in years, because of a bad performance last time. Unfortunately I heard many people gush on about Steak n Shake that I thought I'd give it another shot. I should have stayed away. I was right to avoid this place.
