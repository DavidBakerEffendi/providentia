Overrated.  

We had been referred to this place by a student at the university but we wished we hadn't even asked.  

We each ordered the brats.  The red and white.  Both were dry and tasted as though they were reheated.  Nothing juicy or delicious about them.  If we hadn't added any toppings on them I think I wouldn't have been able to distinguish the taste or consistency from the bun that it came in.  

The fries that were ordered certainly weren't made-to-order.   Should've noticed the row of heating lamps they had behind the bar.  When we did get the order the fries were cold.  I went up to the bartender and asked that she get me some hot fries.  She hands the basket off to some weird guy that just sits in the back eyeing his female staff while they work up front.  He takes the basket and then throws on some fries that had been sitting directly underneath a heat lamp. What I had really meant was for them to cook their food 'made to order'.  What the hell is this place?  

I'll tell you what it isn't.  It is not a restaurant.  It's more like a cafeteria with a bar.  And then you have to go up to the bar to chase down a bar tender for an order while these dudes just stand behind them and do nothing but look around.  

Don't know why there's so much hype behind this place.  Beer has a way of confusing people.
