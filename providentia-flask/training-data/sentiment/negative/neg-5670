I had the Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich, in which I don't recommend. The chicken itself along with the breading felt like it's the type that comes frozen and pre fried and all the restaurant does is kinda re fry it or just heat it up. When you take the breading away from the chicken it's mushy in between. Either not fried long enough or back to my original theory of frozen pre fried chicken. The slaw that comes with the sandwich is bland. No flavor whatsoever. The creamy sauce is more like colored mayonnaise. Overall the sandwich sucked. Good thing ketchup was invented! Fries sucked too! And it took like 15 minutes before I was acknowledged. I had to walk to the register to ask if that's is where I'm supposed to order. Thumbs down!
