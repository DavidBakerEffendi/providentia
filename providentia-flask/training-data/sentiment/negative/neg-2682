We ate here and got food poison with my entire family. We were hospitalized. I tried calling the manager several times today to let him to check the food, but he NEVER came on the phone. A black girl took the call around 4:30pm and refused to give the managers last name. After the 5th call a girl took the call and said she was a manager and her name was Shawna. She refused to give her last name. She told me that Tom is the other manager and she spelled his last name, Wozniak, Tom Wozniak. Finally Shawna said her last name was Shawna Caper. She then laughed in my face and said she does not care that we got food poison from Olive Garden food. I asked the name of the General Manager, then Shawna slammed the phone in my face. RUDE! I will NEVER eat at Olive Garden again.
