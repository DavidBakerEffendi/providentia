One of the worst place I ever been the owner is very rude no class at all, I took some friends there last weekend and one of my friend start talking to one girl then the owner came really upset and told him he needed to leave the bar, then my friend asked him why and he replied I'm the owner so I don't own you any explanation just leave, so my friend told him you know how much money we expend? $300 he said he didn't care well I told my friend let's go, we will never recommend that place again.
