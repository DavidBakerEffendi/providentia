Look, I have no illusion about the quality of Chinese Food in Las Vegas, nor am I expecting high end Chinese food from SW. 

But the food at this location was down right nasty.

I've been on the road for several weeks now and I just needed a Chinese food fix.  So I came here for a very basic, simple Won Ton noodle and BBQ Pork.  Simple stuff - I can do this at home if I'm ever there!  But oh man the Won Ton was nasty.  It tasted like broiled ground pork - there was no flavor and the texture of the meat was all wrong. *shivering*  The BBQ port was okay, but it sat in the broth for too long and it was starting to get stringy.

This simple fare is a staple for Sam Woo man! How the hell did this joint nuke it this bad?

You know, I was so tired of hotel food that I was willing to take a few bite of this and move on.  But I'm never coming back to this place.  Amazing how this place managed to embarrass the already mediocre reputation that is Sam Woo...
