This place is so inconsistent with its food and wait staff went there once and the food was excellent then the next 3 times I wouldn't feed it to my dogs last time we were there we left after trying to order our food when the waitress walked away yelling about how I ordered my food how it was stated on the menu. we left money to cover our drinks and a tip and left will not be going back there for sure. I have never been treated that horrible in any food establishment ever not even at a fast food place if you are planning on going here for the first time you will get better food and service at Wendy's it's in the same parking lot
