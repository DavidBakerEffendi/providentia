the burgers are honestly on par with any and every other burger king i've eaten at. what i don't like specifically about this location that makes me give them 1 star is on 3 separate occasions in the past i was served re-fried fries. 1 of the times i saw them actually rescoop  my fries up from where they sit to get packaged and thrown back into the fryer so they would be warm... anyone that has had re-fried fries before knows exactly how they look and taste. disgusting and unacceptable.

Edit : these experiences i had were before they actually revamped and updated this location. i do not know if they still do practice this since then, nor do i plan to ever find out.
