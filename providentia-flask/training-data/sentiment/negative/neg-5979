I went there a few weeks ago for a family dinner. My hubby and I got there early to have a drink before the rest arrived, so we got to experience a little more of the place. 

First, I've gotta say that the front desk staff and the lounge's bartender were 5 star quality. So friendly, quick, very professional. You get your parking reimbursed if you ask, by the way.

We ordered the family dinner prime rib special, which was the most reasonable price on the menu at $25 per person for 4 people. Here's where the issues start. The older lady server was rude and seemed more 'small town biker diner' attitude than 'fine dining'. She was downright awful. She threw plates onto our table, stepped on my husband twice (without apologizing), shoved through us to give and take menus, interrupted conversation rudely and seemed generally oblivious to how awful she was. There were only a few other tables, so it's not as if she was rushed. Having been in the service industry, I was APALLED that this woman had a job there. I'm not sure what else was going on because 2 other people came to our table to see how we were doing and they were both very polite and pleasant. I was outraged.

Next, the prime rib arrives. We also get asparagus, mashed potatoes and ceasar salad. The salad was the ONLY thing with flavour. Nothing else had any seasoning at all. I mean, nothing. I spent half of my dinner trying to cut away fat and grisle. $25 for this travesty of a "meal"? Ridiculous. I could spend half the money and enjoy a perfect steak with fixings at home. Without being stepped on or interrupted or accidentally slapped with a menu. 

Now, the atmosphere was STUNNING and I'm curious about whether the usual menu items are good. It just seems weird to me that the steaks are $40/plate and the atmosphere is so posh, while they allow that kind of crap "food" to leave their kitchen and that kind of "service" to work there.
