Sushi was awful.  It's not run or made by real Japanese.  They are Chinese and know nothing about making sushi or sashimi.  Staff was rude.  We couldn't eat the awful sushi so we threw it away and they wanted to charge us extra because we didn't finish it.  How are we supposed to eat something that taste like crap?  They told us if we couldn't finish it, that we couldn't just thrash it.  What are they going to do with it?  Give it to the next customer?  Service was horrible.  They all run around with an attitude on their faces.  We sat by where they made the sushi and it just looked awful the way they were making it.  If you've ever sat and watched a real sushi chef, you would know how awful these guys were.  They barely gave us any wasabi or ginger.  We keep having to ask several time. They only have water and they didn't even want to give us more water when we finished ours glass.  The food was salty to make you drink and get bloated. You also have to bring your own drinks/alcohol.   I will never go back to this place again!
