I'm definitely giving them 1 stars now because I just found out they charged an extra $8 to my credit card after i've checked out.
It was not on my bill at check out, I was not informed about it at a check out and I definitely did not authorize this. 

I know $8 it's not outrageous, but it's shady that they charge shit to your card without your authorization, without letting you know what it's for, and after you've checked out.  once i find out what it's for, I will update. but WTF!
