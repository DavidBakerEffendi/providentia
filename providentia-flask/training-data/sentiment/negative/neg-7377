They should rename this place Yucky Yucky! Nasty ass food, restaurant looks as if they live there. The lady that took our order was rude, she texted on her phone while she took our order, we had to ask where the utensils were, and as we ate the poorly cooked dog they mopped (Normally not a big deal) except it stunk of bleach. Man I'm not sure what people in this part of the state consider good Chinese food, but it's sure as fuck not this dumpster. You'll get better Chinese at your kids school cafeteria.
