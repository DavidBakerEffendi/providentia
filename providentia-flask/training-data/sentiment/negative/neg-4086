NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!!!!!! 

One. My chimichanga was so dry, had literally 8 lettuce on the plate. Id ask for more lettuce,  they wanted to CHARGE me EXTRA! for lettuce?  Really? Where it came with the mealllllll. Then it was suppose to come with avocado and sour cream. Didn't have that either. Once again, I asked. They wanted to charge me. Whatttt? It was suppose to come with it.

Ask for the manager, i talked to her, her name is Jenny. She is the owner, i spoke her about our DISAPPOINTING entr√©es. She did not care what so ever. She said we messed up the order.  Are you kidding me?  My family and I end up eating our food poorly and very unhappy.  Honestly, if I did not pay for my food already. I would have just left. no lie.. Never ever have I've been treated this way.

horrible customer service,  no accommodations. Very aggravated. 

JUST LOST CUSTOMERS!!!!!!!
NEVER AGAIN.

Not mexican here!!!!!!
