First of all, turn on the air conditioning in the front. That's probably why the girls that work here are miserable. Anyways my aunt and I came here because she had never eaten at a tropical smoothie. After spending $39 we informed the person now manning the register that one wrap was buffalo chicken and one was a king Cesar. And they had 2 Buffalos down. The owner threw a fit "I already made it " yada yada. She was so rude walking away as we tried to tell her what the order should be. I was really embarrassed for my aunt after telling her to try this place, this is by far the worst owned tropical smoothie there is. We will continue to drive to the farther location on Ann for our orders.
