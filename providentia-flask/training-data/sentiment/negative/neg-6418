With words of mouth , I expected the food  are great. The line was long, so I thought that I was choosing great place to eat. Unfortunately, that was not the story. From crab legs, smoked salmon and some mussels they are very SALTY. The kind of saltiness when you soaked the food in salt overnight. So seafood lovers.. BEWARE of disappointment. Dining room were not that clean. Service could be better,  I was lucky that my server were attentive to my table.
So that one star goes for him .
For weekend Dinner $40/person, this buffet is NOT worth trying for.
