Extremely bad service and no knowledge of the beer menu. The guy literally didn't know what IPA's they had on draft. Oh did I mention our server didn't check on us for 45 mins and they had no clue they had my credit card even though I mentioned it twice????

The place has potential but with this type of service and lack of detail it will fail. This is my 2nd time in and it's the same bad service.... Too bad.
