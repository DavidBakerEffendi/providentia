For those people giving it 4-5 stars - have you been to another concert?...like a professionally coordinated, big boy event?  What are you comparing it against?

This place is a train wreck.  I saw Foster the People, a sold out show.  The doors opened at 7PM so I showed up around 9PM.  Despite arriving a whole 2 hours after the doors opened, I still waited 15 min in line to get into the place.

The acoustics are awful and if you're not within 50 feet of the stage, you're not going to see the act.

I wouldn't come back here if Foster the People were giving out free hand jobs.
