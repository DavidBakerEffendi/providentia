This place has been around a while it amazes me that it still is there.  The Steaks are less than average or worse, I would say that a Mcdonald hamburger is leaner and the place is not inexpensive. The atmosphere is tacky not a place for a romantic or fine dining experience, that would be OK if the steaks were good but as I said they are not.
My suggestion go somewhere else, say North Beach Bistro if you want a good steak, locally.
