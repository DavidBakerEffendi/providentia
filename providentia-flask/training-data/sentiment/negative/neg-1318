There was only one customer in front of me and one at the drive thru and the employees were stressed! But the best was when I placed my order they told me they were out of bananas (it was only10AM!). What the heck, that means you can't make one of your most popular smoothies! Ummm, Target is in the same parking lot and they sell bananas  and Smith's is a 5 minute drive. There is too much competition in the area..... management please get your act together or we will be looking at another empty store which would be devastating. I will stop in for one more try.
