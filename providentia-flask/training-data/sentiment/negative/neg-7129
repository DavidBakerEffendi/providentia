DO NOT EAT HERE! I wish I had read the yelp reviews before hand because it was the worst service I've ever had. We were seated right away but we ended up waiting 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by our server, all the while other parties who came in after us were greeted, given their drinks and had their orders taken. Finally our server came to take our order. We ended up waiting 40 minutes for our food! Remember that this is in an AIRPORT. After waiting 30 minutes we were getting ready to leave when our server came back to tell us that "the kitchen was really backed up". I found this hard to believe when people who were seated AFTER us were served their meals. Some of the food were the same food that we ordered! We had to ask another server to check on our food and she brought it out to us right away. We were obviously upset and all our server did was ask if he could refill our drinks after we were already done with our meal. My boyfriend ordered a flatbread and I ordered a burger. I could have gotten a better burger at Burger King at a much cheaper price. The flatbread that my boyfriend got was burnt on the bottom. Our food was definitely not worth the price and not worth the 40 minute wait. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT EAT HERE!
