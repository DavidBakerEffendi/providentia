The address lead us to Festival Russian Restaurant. We looked at the sign "seat yourself," walked in and there was no one working. Waited for good 5 minutes, not a soul walked out from the back to greet us. We left. Based on others' reviews sounds like the food is great, but did I have to go back there myself and make it?
