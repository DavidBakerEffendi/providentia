Just had dinner here and we were really disappointed. We waited an hour for our food. The milkshakes came out 45 minutes before our food. I still don't see why it took an hour to get fast food. Now to the good part, the only hot dish we ordered came out cold. The rest of us had BLT's.  When we brought it to their attention they offered nothing but a refund which showed no regard to the fact that we waited an hour for food that came out cold and we were starving.
