It was 9:50pm on Friday.  The restaurant was not full, we were standing there waited for 15 mins with no greeting no service.  

I understood there was only 2 servers on the floor.  Obviously the service was really slow, most tables haven't been cleaned up yet, but some tables were available.  

They could have sat us down first but no one care enough to do it.  After standing there for 15 mins, we decided to take off.  We kinda lost the trust to dine there coz who know how much longer we gonna wait for food & drinks.

Maybe next time will be a better experience.
