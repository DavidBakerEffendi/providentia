They changed the fricken recipes! the crepes used to be much better until the menu change after October 2012.

My favorite crepe used to be the apple crepe and they used to caramelize the apples and it would be warm. Now they have raw, sour, cold granny smith apples with the skins still on smothered in some cold caramel sauce. i guess they changed it because its quicker and cheaper.I actually returned the crepe and told them the new menu change sucks. Why do places always have to mess with a good thing?
