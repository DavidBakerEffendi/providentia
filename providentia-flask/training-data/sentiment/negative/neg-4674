Egh.
This is supposed to be a "nicer" version of PT's, when actually it's probably better described as the "dirty ass basement of PT's, but large!"
My beer was warm and our waitress was a total rude ass. The place was messy and there was food and crap all on the floor, it made me lose my appetite so we didn't even bother ordering anything. Which was a good call, cause even though it was happy hour, the waitress charged us full price for our drinks, so we would of for everything else too I'm sure. Not coming here again.
