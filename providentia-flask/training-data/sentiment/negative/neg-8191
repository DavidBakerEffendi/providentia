So I have been going to this McDonalds since the day it opened.  I was in high school and it was a big deal because it had a drive-through and they closed down the McDonalds a few blocks away because it lacked said feature.

Tonight's experience at this drive-through was very frustrating and thank goodness for the screen that shows my order so I could see how many mistakes were made.  I wanted a hamburger and somehow the first variation on my order was a chicken sandwich.  I was trying to see if they had a single patty version of the Big Mac (since it was late in the evening) and the attendant suggested some other hamburger with the "(like Mac)" Option.  I asked what that meant in terms of making the burger and he could not explain.  So I ordered a Big Mac combo with a salad (the line behind me was building).  The attendant rang up Caesar dressing without asking which dressing I wanted.

Next I asked for a manager and he lied and told me he was the manager.

If you like getting your order screwed up and lied to - this might be a good restaurant to try!
