Alright food bad service. Waited 40 minutes for my waitress to come around so I could get my bill. I could see her. She was busy vaping behind a wall by the kitchen entrance. I finally flagged down a different waitress and got my bill. The whole time my waitress/ bartender was busy huffing flavored water vapor. No one ever checked on me the whole time. I won't be back. I hope you won't go there either. Next time I'll listen to my coworkers and go to Rocknes.
