2nd time ordering online and both times late late late.....  they say 30-40 min.....  what a joke....  cold pizza and waiting way too long!  More like cold pizza an hour or more later.  Gave them a 2nd chance and what a joke...  maybe the prepaid tip wasn't good enough even though more than 25% each time!  Maybe no prepaid tip would make them faster!  Ha!  maybe not.  Whatever!  10 minutes in the oven to make the pizza edible... chicken wings luke warm too...  :(    Take n bake here I come!
