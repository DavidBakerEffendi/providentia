Ordered a large 1 topping pizza and wings through grubhub and got an email saying delivery time was about an hour. Fine, we're  a busy packing to move anyway. An hour's cool. When they didn't show up, I called grubhub, who called Geno's, and then texted me saying they'd been advised it would be another HOUR wait for our pizza. Now, grubhub has their own customer service issues, which have nothing to do with Geno's. But a TWO HOUR wait for a pizza and wings is ridiculous.
