We did the Buffet of Buffets and paid an extra $15/person for this seafood buffet. The seafood was not fresh at all. Everything tasted frozen. I couldn't eat the lobster tail at all and I had to throw it away. The seafood I could eat was the stuff I could have eaten at the Rio's Carnival Buffet like the shrimp cocktail, mussels, crab legs, etc. It was not worth it at all and I should have known it was too good to be true.
However, I would have to say though that the dessert was probably better than the Carnival. They had a better selection of gelato and more choices of cake, pastries, pies, etc. But it was definitely not worth the extra $15. 
Our server was awesome and very attentive. She came by often to refill our drinks and made sure our table was clean.
