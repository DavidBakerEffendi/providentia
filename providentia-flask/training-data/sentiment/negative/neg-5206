Market. Where? Circles. What? Grill. Pasta? No calamari. No zucchini. No cheese on chicken parmesan. The mussels on the house are excellent. Not sure why they serve you a different gravy with chicken. Ravioli was not fresh. Disappointed. Sauce was good. Will we come back? Sadly no. Too pricey for meh.
