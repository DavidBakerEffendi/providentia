Not good in the neighborhood at this place!  With the restaurant half empty , were told we had a 15 minute wait.  A large party that arrived after our group was seated, which was fine as they had reservations.  After waiting and waiting, asked manager Ron if we could at least sit at one the five or six empty tables available to wait and have a drink, but he was not seating anybody right now!  Our group could have at least sat, watched the Cavs game, and ordered some drinks.  PATHETIC.  Will not waste my time going there....they obviously did not want our business!
