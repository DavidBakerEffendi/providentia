I love cafe rio but this location was very disappointing. The staff was very rude and the salad that I ordered comes with cheese but the guy only gave me a pinch and told me if I wanted more than that it would cost $1 more. The other locations give you cheese and don't argue with their customers over it. Then I asked for limes and they gave me lemons instead and when I told then, he rolled his eyes at me, like really. This location is very stingy with their ingredients and the staff have poor attitudes. I Will NEVER be back to this location EVER again and I have advised several others to go to a different location so they don't go through the same hassle I did. Lack of customer service is prevalent here.
FYI: If you hate your job that much that you treat your customers like shit, then quit your job. Management shouldn't allow this to happen, PERIOD!!!!!!!
