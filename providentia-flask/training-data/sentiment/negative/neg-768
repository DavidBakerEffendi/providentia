Went here yesterday (7/10/11) with my two sisters to grab some lunch. When we walked in, a waitress told us to sit anywhere. We grabbed a booth by the front door. We were handed menus and that was that. A girl was sweeping around the tables but didn't say anything to us. She then went on to bus tables. After 10 minutes, I told my sister, "If somebody doesn't come by in 2 minutes, we're leaving." Two minutes later, we left. 

I wish I could tell you how the food was, but I would have had to have had my order taken by somebody. There was a table of two girls, probably in their late teens, that were also just sitting there, also without drinks, waiting for somebody to come wait on them. An older couple was looking around frantically for somebody to take their order, but they did have drinks. Ridiculous.

They definitely get one star because I ended up eating at that P.O.S. restaurant Big Horn on Arizona Ave. when I wanted to eat here.
