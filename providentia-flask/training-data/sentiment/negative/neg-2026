I really wanted this to be better, but this place, of ALL OTHER places of this concept, is the worst at how they do their toppings! The picture is of my pizza after asking 3x for more pepperoni, and it's only one example of several bad trips there. It's close to my work, so I end up there again, hoping it's going to be better, but it seems to be getting worse! People there seem to be getting even more rude when I ask for toppings.

Dang, I wanted this to be better.
