One of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten at. I would give zero stars but yelp makes you choose one. The hamburgers were bland and overcooked. The shrimp salad was dry and had to ask for more dressing. The kitchen forgot how we ordered different entrees or maybe it was Brian the server. He was horrible. He  actually said to us that the kitchen sometimes modifies dishes but it depends how busy they were. We asked to modify the Cuban sandwich with no onions. He said he couldn't because the sandwich was made the day before and everything was already inside - gross .....glad I didn't have an allergy. Then I asked for a plain cheese pizza for a child. He delivered a margarita pizza. Not the same especially with all the green stuff on top and garlic. Needless to say all of us were done eating by the time the 7 year old got this plain cheese pizza. No apology, no refund. Managers were never around. No one stopped by our table. Stay away of you can. Too many good restaurants in Vegas to choose from. Plus we booked thru open table. I didn't get credit for the dine. Put in a special occasion of a birthday and nothing was recognized. We booked reservations at 4:30pm for a 6:45pm dinner. The place was empty..... we should of known ...........
