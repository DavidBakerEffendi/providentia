This has to be the worst thai food I've ever tasted (we ordered delivery). I am the type of person who will eat anything on my plate even if I am far too full, however I could not eat this. 
My boyfriend got a piece of chicken with a weird grey fuzzy thing on it. The mango from the mango chicken has skin on it still. The noodles were plain and in a brick, while the rice came wrapped in plastic. 
Not to mention it took over an hour to come. Very dissappointed. 

DO NOT EAT HERE!!
