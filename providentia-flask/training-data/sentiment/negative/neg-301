If possible avoid this place! The ideas of it seem great!!! But the service and food was below standard. They forgot something we ordered and served us dry pulled in pork. When we asked for sauce, it tasted spoiled and they waitress asked how it tasted and I said sour in not a good way. She didn't offer to bring us any other sauces. 

They also forgot to bring our bill cleared the table and left us waiting for 15-20 minutes for the bill. We finally got up to pay at the bar and they just said have a good night. Should have Ran then! But the honest people we are we said what is it free and asked for the bill.
