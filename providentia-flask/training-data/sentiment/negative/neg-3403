I ordered a lot of food and it was really great, so I came back today! But this time I had a problem with THE OWNER. How freaking rude was the owner?? ASF. 

I came in with my son and he can't have any drink with too much sugar or caffeine! So he has his own little drink that he brings with him all the time.
So after we order, we sit down and my son opens his drink. The owner walks over to us YELLING??? "HEY HEY HEY!!! YOU CANNOT HAVE THAT IN HERE, YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED ME BEFORE YOU OPENED THAT!!!"

Have some shame. Both me and my husband ordered a drink. What does it matter my 6y/o son has his own!?

Wow. Just wow. Such a great way to approach a customer who appreciated your food, enough to come back.

Don't believe me? Ask the owner yourself. 
It's a shame you have no professionalism.

So yeah, ordered 50$+ worth of food and left without touchig our food (we had some more coming too). I don't even care, keep my money. :-)
