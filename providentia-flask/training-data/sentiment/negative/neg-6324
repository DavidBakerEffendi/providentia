I thought this was going to be a great new addition to the neighborhood. I was incredibly disappointed. My friend had the wings and I had the short ribs.   Both disappointed.  Mine was full of gristle and bone and she was very disappointed with hers. And sitting at the bar looking through a sneeze guard was not my idea of ambiance. My friends went the night before and said their drinks were strong and the night we were there they were very weak. So I guess I need to give the place another try since so many people are giving it high ratings but I think they need to really up their  game if they want to compete the better restaurants in this area.
