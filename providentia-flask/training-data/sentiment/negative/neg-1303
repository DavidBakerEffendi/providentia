There was a dead cockroach nestled in our kale caesar salad. Do not order from here. We don't know if there were more as the cockroach was smothered in dressing at the bottom of the dish. Took 1.5 hours to have this and our cold pizza delivered to us. We complained and were told by the manager (Tony) that we would get a $50 gift card for this incident. We received a $25 card in the mail 3 weeks later- not that we'd ever go back or use it. Health Canada needs to pay this place a visit.
