Review coming from a black man. I find it disrespectful a lot of you are claiming they have the best tortas, best Cubana and that it's authentic I feel sorry for you claiming this is the best "authentic" place cause it's not all. The meat taste like it was frozen than thawed out tasteless food I can't cook but my al pastor taste better than this shit. it's like they got food out of a tv dinner and put it on display to serve.
