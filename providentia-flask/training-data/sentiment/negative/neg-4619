I went to Mimis Cafe with a couple of girlfriends thinking I would give in another chance after my last bad experience there over a year ago, and unfortunatly nothing has changed.  I ordered the French Dip, it was so salty I think I drank 3 glasses of water while I was eatting.  You have a choice of fries, fruit, or salad as a side.  I ordered the fries because the picture in the menu made them look amazing, this was not the case.  They were the worst fries I think I have ever had they were limp and soggy.  I wish I could say the service made everything better but it didn't.
