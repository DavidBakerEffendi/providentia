The service here is awful! No silverware on the tables when we arrived. I had to ask the waitress 3 separate times for silverware. Even after she was holding the silverware in her hand looking confused AND I pointed at the 3 other people that needed silverware the lady just walked away. We were a party of 12, the restaurant knew ahead of time we were coming and customized a menu for our table with only 3 choices: 1)cheese enchiladas 2) chicken tacos 3) bean tostadas. Even then they couldn't get it right. We all ordered together and our food came out 2 at a time and over a span of 2 1/2 hours. Our food arrived cold, the cheese was hard, the chicken bland and beans were cold. The place was empty so they had no excuse. There were only 2 small tables there and they had already been served when they were taking our order. Needless to say this place was a great disappointment and not worth a second visit. If you're in the area you are better off going any other place for Mexican food than here. May I recommend, Filibertos? At least their food is cheap and usually hot!
