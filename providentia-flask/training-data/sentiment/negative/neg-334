Updated. After another nice night here with friends we noticed we were charged twice and coincidentally picked up another's persons bill....without ever authorizing or signing. We figured, no biggie we will just call and ask them to reverse it. My husband spoke to the manager and they were very nice and promised it would be handled. Well many emails and several phones calls (and about 2 weeks of this ) I grew tired of wasting my time (and $80) and called my bank to take care of it. It turns out they NEVER even attempted to reverse my charge. I was LIVID. They basically thought they would get away with charging me twice and then never fixing it...I wonder how many people they do this to? Thieves! I will never ever spend a fine of my money there ever again.

And the food and service isn't that great anyway. Good luck people.
