he worst, the worst ever.  The menu is changed to the worst menu.  SCRAMBLED eggs is LEATHER, and, it does not look like 3 eggs, no one knows how to scramble eggs at all.  SAUSAGES were microwaved and hard, they do not give a bread basket, so, they gave us carrot bread slice and it was hard, PANCAKES were not cooked all the way, it was gross, COFFEE was never hot at all.  POTATOES were not normal slice, they were big, not appropriate for breakfast and not country potatoes with peppers and onions.  JUICES does not come with the breakfast, no substitutions at all.   WILL never ever go here again, neither will my guests.
