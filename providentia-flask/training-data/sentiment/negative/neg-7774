The waiter was the most condescending jerk I've ever encountered. My girlfriend and I went there a few nights ago to try them out. We ordered a seafood pancake, which we have had at several other Korean owned restaurants in multiple states, as well as in Asian countries. It came out soggy and slimy, and when the waiter saw we only had two bites, asked us if everything was alright. We very sheepishly and politely told him it was a little soggy, and he dismissively retorted, "Oh it must be the SEAFOOD in there." I asked if I could get a vegetable tempura instead and write off the price difference. He said that was fine, and ended up charging us $19 each for two little bottles of nigori sake, while most places charge 8-10 dollars. Obviously gouging us to make up for the pancake. When I tried to talk to him about it, he laughed in my face and said that's the retail price. I found it on my phone from bevmo for nine bucks but he wasn't hearing it. My little story here just doesn't do justice to how amazingly rude he was. Never going back. As we walked out after paying the ridiculous bill, he had to toss one last comment to my back, "Have a good night at retail price." What a dick.
