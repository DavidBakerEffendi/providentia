The food is really good but the service is really inconsistent. I like the workers, just not the manager who I think might be the owner too. I came on my birthday because I got a email saying I get a free item I can't remember what it was and I told the cashier she checked my hot head card and it did indeed say I get a free item. She accidentally did something on the pos and she lost it she said she would honor it but needed to get her manager to override it. I thought cool no big deal. The manager came over. Didn't acknowledge me he then accused cashier and me of basically lying saying to her "Are you sure? People been lying about this". I wanted to throat punch him so bad. If it was so bad I would have gladly shown my ID with my birthday. This happened in June and I thought well I'll give him a chance maybe he's just had a bad day. Well I go in today and I was told I can't get 1 of each salsa for my 2 pack anymore I guess the manager told them not to do it anymore. I just don't like the inconsistency.
