My husband surprised me with making plans for dinner for VDAY. We were both pretty excited because the reviews all seemed great. I honestly don't understand how this place has this many 4-5 stars. 

Our appetizers were terrible. The portions were extremely tiny, the tortellini was a weird lukewarm at best and cold on the inside. This.. fish salad didn't mesh well and had zero flavor. 

The main course - lobster risotto was bad. The risotto part was wayyyy over salted, I needed water after every bite (which our waiter kept forgetting to bring us). The lobster that was on top was so tiny and when we did have a bite of it lacked... All flavor. I'm from New England originally. That is not what lobster should taste like. 

The other main course was Rib Eye and is the only reason this is getting a star. Meat was cooked well and veggies were good. 

The two desserts were also lacking any flavor. The red velvet bread pudding, if it wasn't for the raspberry on top would have been like eating sponge air. 

The drinks were fine. Nothing you can't get anywhere else. This place seems completely overrated. If you want a place to come that makes your Instagram look cool because of food presentation, fine. But what you eat after you snap a photo isn't good.
