Well, Armadillo Grill, I'm not a fan.

We came here on Wednesday night for an NBA playoff game after reading the reviews touting the great food and the plethora of TVs. I was disappointed with the food and really disappointed with the service. I won't be back. 

Our server clearly did not want to be there; she seemed annoyed that we were sat in her section. She didn't know the menu very well, and kept having to (unapologetically) leave the table to run our questions by the other staff.

My boyfriend had the stroganoff and I had a veggie burger. Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger. Everything was below average, except for the music, which was just about average.

They played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.

They do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy. I ended up watching the game from a TV that was half way across the room, the only one in our section of the restaurant with a decent picture.
