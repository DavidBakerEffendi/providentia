**UPDATE: WHY I WOULD NEVER GO BACK!
Old review:
The buffet for a weekday lunch is around $14. You get a decent selection of rolls, sushi, tempura, terriyaki etc. There are no premium rolls included in the lunch buffet (e.g. Philadelphia roll) and there are no sashimi. The quality is average but ultimately it's worth what you pay for.

**NEW REVIEW:
My old review remains true for all parts. What I didn't talk about was service, which is the reason I would never go back there again. We usually went in groups of 2 or 3 people, and we always wondered if we got all of the orders we wrote or not. In most cases they just got away with it. Last time we went in a group of 6, and I am 100% sure they didn't bring half of what we ordered. We kept bringing this to their attention, and they told us to order again. I NEVER GOT MY RED DRAGON AND SALMON HAND ROLL, among many other orders. 

When I spoke to the supervisor, she said the waitresses had brought all of orders, but we can order more if we want to. If it wasn't for my 1-hour lunch break limit, I would have stayed there until I got everything I had ordered. 

We offered to pay half of the bill, since we received half of the order. Of course my offer was declined. Last time for me. You folks enjoy the nasty service (despite the good-quality-for-money-you-pay).
