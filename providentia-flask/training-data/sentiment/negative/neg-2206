My daughter and her boyfriend were very excited to go here. They paid almost $200 for 2 Buffet of Buffet 24 hour passes . They had crab sushi shrimp and oysters. 
Then about 2 hours later she started feeling very Sick . For the next 2 days she could barely move , vomiting , diarrhea cold sweats . Her whole vacation was ruined. 
We returned to the Rio seafood buffet talked to manager MIKE . 
Filled out the security forms  with the EMT .   
Mike tells us that even though she got food poisoning from there seafood . And could not use the 24 hour pass . He could not give a refund. But He offered a free buffet if she wanted to eat there again... Really ???  
Good luck eating here!!!!
You go to a casino to gamble money ,not your health!
