Tonight I ordered a kids char with no onions, my brother ordered a double char with bacon, I got his burger & he got a kids char with onions. Luckily we were going to the same place so we were able to correct our orders on our own. After scraping all onions off (and unfortunately most the cheese) I started to eat my burger...2 bites in I spit it out. THE BURGER WAS COVERED IN GRILL SCRAPINGS! You know the nastiness that they scrape off the grill, yeah, I got a mouth full of that! Nastiest thing ever!
