Came in here today to try out a new place. We sad down and the place seemed pretty hot.We waited 30 minutes with the waitress not checking up on us. We saw a nearby table, that came in 10 minutes after us, get served food. We asked the waitress what happened to our food, because we already waited 20 minutes and not even an appetizer. We finally get our food and our drinks were empty. She didn't even ask if we wanted a refill. Thankfully the other waitress on staff came and asked us or we probably would still be waiting. I should have known when I smelled the fishy water.
We definitely will not be back.
