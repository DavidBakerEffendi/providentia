Very mediocre at best. Ordered spicy friend rice. Tripple thai hot.  The rice looks like it was untouched by any spice at all. (Still on the journey of finding a genuine authentic spicy thai fried rice)
Also got the potstickers.  BURNT. Tasteless.  

Waste of money in my opinion.  One star because it was edible.
