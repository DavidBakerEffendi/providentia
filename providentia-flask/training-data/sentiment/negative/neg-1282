The place is dirty.  Everything.  From the floors to the counters to the restroom.  I ordered my food hesitantly but I was starving and was there.  I went to the restroom and went back out and cancelled my order.  There was no way I was eating something from back in the back where I couldn't see when they didn't care if the restroom that I could see looked like that. There were 2 employees standing around.  My word....get to work.   The place was empty and plenty to do but evidently they weren't up for it.  I will never go back.  Its also very run down.  When there is places like FAME and LUX,  you don't need to patronize places that maybe had their day but now they are just done, or look like they should be.
