Thought for a brief second I had found my new local coffee spot. Lots of drink choices . decent food menu and even serves beer and liquor ... Has comfy couches and cool seating options.... But no Wi-Fi? This explains why at a time when other coffee shops are super busy this place only had 1 person in it. You can not run a shoo like this without Wi-Fi and frankly its sends the wrong signal to would be customers .
