This restaurant has potential. However, the managers are rude, petty, racist, biased, and indifferent. I invited my family to this restaurant to celebrate three family birthdays. To my dismay, one family member was completely disrespected due to the fact that he could not eat the sushi that he mistakenly ordered. The manger tried to force him to pay for food he could not eat. She didn't offer to prepare an alternative dish for him. She was rude and obnoxious toward him and said, "don't ever come here again."
