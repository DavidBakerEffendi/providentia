Not good. Clearly a copy cat of Panda Express. Many empty pans so I wasn't sure what I could order.  Once our orders were half fixed a call for a take out order was called in. The owner took the call while our food sat there. What happened to taking care of the money in front of your face? The copy of orange chicken is bad. The "chop chop chicken" is a chicken breast that had been sitting under a cover for too long. The crab Rangoon are a joke, only cream cheese at best. Spider webs under chairs should of been our clue. We are really in a loosing stretch lately.  We will stick to Panda Express when we are seeking Chinese fast food.
