I love this place. The food is reasonably priced and delicious but the service IS THE WORST! It took 40 min for my shrimp tampura to come out and when I asked if she had put my order in she said she forgot with a quick "sorry!" Before walking away. The food line doesn't have as much variety as it used to ! I order ebi's that are rarely added to the rotation. They no longer serve taco's The whole place gives the overall impression of not being organized. Basically any time we need anything it's a hassle to get without waving someone down and waiting an extra 10-15 min. The person who sits you down isn't the waiter don't be fooled! They won't come check on you or refill your beverages. But besides the big negative the food is amazing and such a great price.
