the waiter was the worst waiter i have ever had anywhere
and because of him the food was cold
i also ordered a bottle of water that he never brought but as he was bringing the bill said "oh do you want me to bring you your bottle of water now" and it was on the bill
I will never go back espically with Marcellos Pizzeria a few doors down
