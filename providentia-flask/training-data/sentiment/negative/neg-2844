Where do I begin? There were 3 in my party. When we arrived I was told there will only take 15 to 20 minutes to be seated. So my grandson husband and I waited. 15 goes by. 20 goes by.  30 mins go by. Ok so at this point I go up to the hostess. And wouldn't you know they had tables and a booth available. The hostess was a little mouthy and rolling her eyes. At that point I should have left. My husband ordered a beer and they forgot to bring it. I order my burger well done and it was pink. I'm the type of customer that does not send anything back. My grandson loved his sloppy joe. Our waiter was great. It was our first and last time.
