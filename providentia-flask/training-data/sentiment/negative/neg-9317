I gave this buffet one star only because the manager was nice enough to give me my full money refund back! 
To start off the lobster bisque was cold, the bread that came with it for dipping was hard and what really pushed me over the edge was their fried rice was under done and over fried!
my husband tried the sushi and the rice was bland along with the filling and the kitchen staff was more about talking about the football game then actually helping us reach the very hard to reach sushi rolls!
 I read the reviews and even $30 for a buffet was way too much for the quality of food! But I guess you get what you pay for in Vegas!
