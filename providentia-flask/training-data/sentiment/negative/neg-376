Burger was the worst dry never asked how I wanted it you kno well done medium, it was supposed too be between to grill cheese sandwiches it was more like 4 pcs of dry sandpaper like toast with the thinist pc of cheese on it came with bacon but i had to ask for tomatoes and onion very sad for a place that's supposed too be known for its burgers, wings were good & sloppy Joe tots were flavorless! You want a good burger try fatheads
