Last night 05/20/17 Me and two friends came in to enjoy our night with some 90's hip hop and drinks  the waitress was the rudest waitress we have ever encountered first off someone in our party asked the waitress about the beer and she told him to read the menu. First off what if he truly couldn't read the waitress should know how to push their beer sales by knowing the menu. Not telling someone to read the menu. Then it took forever to get our order of drinks  like almost 20 minutes after that she never checked on us for another 20 minutes she tended to others skipped us stayed in the back finally we had to ask someone else to get our check then that took forever she just dropped it and went away. 15 minutes later she comes back at this point we're all irritated and ask for the manager from another waiter he told him then the manager just sat there looked at us several times even came around pushed in chairs never came to us we just at that point paid and left. Never again will we step foot in this place it was like we weren't apart of hipster crowed that was there and they ignored us for that. This was one of my friends first time coming and he will never come again. We all work in customer service and know how patrons should be treated and this establishment last night proved to us that people truly don't know the meaning of treating customers fairly and waitresses with attitudes should not be working in this industry this what makes establishments like this lose business. So this place will never get our business again and it's sad we liked this place the first time we came.
