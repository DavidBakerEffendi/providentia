Was here with a few friends on 12-21 for an annual dinner tradition we've been keeping up with. 

If the kitchen had a manager, it was certainly not evident as the place was not even half full and we waited well over an hour for our food. Part of the wait was due them running out of entrees and the server coming out suggesting substitutions. 

I ordered the chicken which wasn't even made yet when the rest of the party was nearly done eating. The server offered to box it up but at that point I was no longer interested. 

While kitchen screw ups on such a light night is difficult to explain, how it was handled by the restaurant manager was even more inexplicable. 

It was good that my wife's meal was comped and I didn't need to pay for my coffee and the gumbo That came with the food I didn't get, but it is the  managers responsibility to come out to address issues like this with the customer. Doing so would have motivated me to come back another time , but instead the server was thrown under the bus to address and apologize for issues that were not her fault but that of  the kitchen. The manager never showed his or her face. 

Making this very point was that on the receipt under refund was "server error" when it was the kitchen screwing everything up. I brought this up to the server and assured her none that of what happened was her fault and gave her a ten for her troubles. 

The manager taking 5 minutes to come out and explain things and at least shaking our hands would have redeemed this evening but instead he or she hid in the back. It's a pity because now they lost customers over being discourteous.
