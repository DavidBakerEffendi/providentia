I would give 0 stars on this visit if I could sadly. My friend looked up online for dog friendly restaurants and we were both excited that Sir Eds popped up pretty high on the list.  We had both eaten there numerous times and forgotten about it because we live in uptown. We arrived at 2:30 my friend went inside to request a table for two on the patio explaining we had a dog. The staff member working said that she was not serving the patio. We were confused because there was not one customer in the whole place. I went inside to ask the hours of the patio.  She replied it is the same as the dining room????? We both have been in the restaurant business for over 20 years.  I just really don't understand how this level of service can happen.  Would really love to experience their amazing food again but after this customer service experience its definitely not worth going out of our way with so many closer options.
