Two years later and the food experience is not improved.  Three of us, $250
And no one had even a decent meal.  My wife's trout was inedible with greasy potatoes,  my stroganoff had tons of noodles, almost no beef and was cold.  My draft beer was luke warm.  The space is a five,  the food is a minus five, so I guess a one is the only choice.
Why would anyone waste this great place to serve such below average food?
Get a chef who is not lazy and serve a better than average menu and fare.
Also, at your prices, bring back the relish dish.
By the way, we had an 8:00 reservation and were not seated til almost 8:30,
Cooling our heels in the lobby.
