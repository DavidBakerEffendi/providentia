Let's get straight to the point! Walked in, they said it was a 30 min wait no big deal. Fast forward an hour and a half we get a table after my wife went to the hostess and asked where we were on the list, and she replied"i can just sit you here"  got a table and sat there for 20 min before a server came over to us. The server takes our order, and my wife asked for the salad with thousand island dressing and he says "our thousand island dressing is amazing" food comes out about 15 min later and my wife tried the salad and stops eating because the dressing is too spicy. She tells the server I don't think this is thousand island it's too spicy and he said oh ya we don't have thousand island so I brought you the closest thing to it. Smh this is the worst place on Indian school and isn't anything special, so don't waste your time or money. I truly don't expect much when a place is opening for the first time, but this was the worst customer experience from start to finish.
