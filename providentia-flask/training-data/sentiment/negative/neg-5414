We had the worst experience at this location . My taco salad shell was stale and when I mentioned it to the staff they didn't offer to get me another salad shell nor did they discount my bill. The salad was absolutely terrible and cost 21 dollars and the server was rude and walked away from me when I questioned the bill. I get the servers are supposed to be rude to put on a show for their guests but when a guest has bad food the staff needs to drop the act, do their job and correct the issue with what was served. Will never go there again.
