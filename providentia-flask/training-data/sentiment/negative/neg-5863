We ordered the mandoo soup and tofu soup soon doo boo. Everything was pretty salty. The tofu soup was especially salty to the point we couldn't eat much of it. They have a ban Chan bar with various items. They only served us 4 out of 8-10 available. We asked the waitress if we could try some other ban Chan. She curtly asked what do you want giving us a "what's wrong with you look"?  I assumed she just has a rough demeanor so I told my gf to go point out which she would like.  We came in about 45 min before close so they may have been more concerned about going home as they turned off the open sign 8:45. A couple tried to come in but was promptly times away. Also no barley tea.
