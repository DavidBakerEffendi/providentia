Horrible customer service I felt bad for even eating here the cashier and waitress were horrible they were so rude i didn't know if they were mad about life or mad at my family and I for eating there the cashier was just flat out rude and the waitress threw one of the plates on the table after she had already handed me every plate instead of putting them on the table but when i asked her to put the fourth one down she threw it on the table then the entire time we got constant dirty looks by the 3 employee women absolutely crazy we will definitely not be coming back the owner should consider hiring new employees with better Customer service
