Just ate here for lunch and I'm getting more and more mad as the day goes on - best way to get over that is to let others know about my experience!  Dropped by at opening time, another family was just behind us.  Everyone orders and sits down.  Their pizza comes out first and I thought it was strange, but was sure ours would be right behind.  About 5 minutes later, the waitress/counter person goes to their table, takes the pizza and brings it to ours.  She apologized and explained what happened - there were 2 pieces missing.  Then she goes back to their table and brings over 2 slices that have already been served and assures me again that "they didn't touch them".  I'm kind of in shock and look down at mine and the cheese is drizzled on top -  you know that first slice when the cheese is still really melted and makes a string and you pull it off then pop it on your piece?  Like that!  So I say "no, these pieces HAVE been touched".  She takes my one slice and goes back to replace it.  I put the other slice aside and told my kids not to eat it.  I wasn't very happy and didn't stand up for myself and should have.  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure how anyone can NOT touch a pizza slice during serving - I'm now absolutely disgusted that I didn't return the whole thing and just get a refund.  Going to call management on Monday and let them know what happened.  I can't imagine that this didn't violate food service rules!  So bottom line, what's happening behind the counter when this is happening in front of it?  Expensive pizza.  Needless to say, we won't be back and will be sharing our experience.  Hate to do this to a non-chain but this shouldn't be happening anywhere.
