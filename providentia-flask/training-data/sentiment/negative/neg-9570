Worst place ever!, they advertise on a banner inside townsquare "kids eat free" what you can barely read is that its between certain hours in fine print, went on a Monday afternoon, townsquare was busy, not a soul in this place, greeted with a smile by the hostess then she was casting racial aspersions under her breath through her smile as we sat down (my family &I include. My 5 yr old son) we looked through the menu, the waiter greeted us and kept addressing me as " boss" (we counted 4 times), other than that he was polite, and spoke with manners leaving me to realize he was disrespectful purposefully, upon waiting for our entrees we noticed a tall black guy who appeared to be the manager behaving very inappropriately with the female staff, it was shocking! food was late, we waited there  at what seemed like an eternity as the inmates ran the asylum around us, The food arrived and it was horrible, the burgers were cold the fries were cold, we looked at each other like we were in the "Twilight Zone" never again...avoid that place like the plague...p.s. only left a star because I had too, to process this review...
