Worst service ever! I just got out from there ans I was not given my food 
after like 20 minutes. I had order a salad... How can someone take so long to make a salad? Plus y was given my ticket and took other 15 minutes just to ring me... Shift manager was never checking on guest. There was people before that were waiting for their food... I felt bad eating my food... They were way too busy closing the register... When they should of be taking care of guest ... I'm never going there ever again ...
