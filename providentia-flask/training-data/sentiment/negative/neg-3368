Quite literally the worst dining experience I've ever had. I was really excited to try this place. It had been on my list for a long time and I finally took a group of friends and headed over. For a casual dining atmosphere, we were really surprised that it took us about 25 minutes just to order at the counter. We probably should have just left at that point since clearly something was wrong. But then the night just got worse. We waited 90 minutes and NEVER got our food!!!! We went up there twice to check on it and the second time they said they hadn't started cooking it and it had already been 90 minutes. Plus we kept seeing other customers come back up saying their food was wrong. No way in hell were we going to wait another half hour just to get the wrong entree. This was literally absurd by any restaurant standards but even worse for a casual dining restaurant where we should have gotten our food in a reasonable timeframe. We got our refunds and it was close to 11 at this point and we were all just pissed and starving.
