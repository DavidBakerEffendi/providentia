Came here for Father's Day. They had live music which was great. It took about 15 mins to get my drink from the bar. It was not crowded and shouldnt of taken that long. Then we waited about an hour for our food. We got wings, a burger, fries and a grilled chicken salad. When we finally got the food, the chicken was cold. Had to ask the server if it come hot or cold and she said hot. Mine was cold like straight out of the fridge. Also if you ask for fries, they bring out chips. Have to ask for the long fries. The entire meal was compt but still wouldn't go back.
