Service was horrible along with the tasteless and over priced won ton mein at $13.50 per bowl with 4 won tons and few sprigs of bok choy.  Small portion.  Waitress was cleaning off tables, resetting them rather than taking care of her customers seated at the tables.  They are too cheap to hire a bus boy.  We tried flagging her down to get some Chinese mustard.  We waited forever to get our bill.  Will never go here again.
