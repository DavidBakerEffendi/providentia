Ordered bistro shrimp for lunch.  Horrible.com.  Here for team meeting and 4 of us ordered it.  Apparently the chef dropped the noodles in the boiling water and took it right out .  Pasta was very undercooked.  Waiters response was "well pasta is not supposed to be mushy".  Smh sir.... pasta is not supposed to be hard either.  Requested to speak with manager.  Manager was friendly but only offered  to have the food remade.  Were on a lunch break.  Limited time. For this price, very disappointing to receive inedible food.
