This was the most depressing casino I'd ever been in in my life. The place looks like it's ready to die. Half of the tv's and machines at the bar were turned off. The tables were covered and dusty and the beer on tap tasted skunky and old. The woman at the cashier was in to her book and and there was no excitement or energy in the place. If you've dealt with tragedy and adversity and need to feel better about yourself go to the Klondike and be reminded that it could always be worse.
