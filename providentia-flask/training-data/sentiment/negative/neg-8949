I went to Tusca on a great recommendation, and was sorely disappointed. The sangria was great, and a definite highlight. 

The service was okay, I guess. Our server was trying to be funny, nice, and was trying waaay too hard. He didn't seem to get that we weren't "that kind" of table. 

I totally could have overlooked all of that, but the food was awful! We ordered the olives, which came covered in powdered Parmesan cheese. The Gorgonzola mashed potatoes had zilch for flavor. And this isn't a a cheap restaurant. I'm all about fusion, and will happily pay for quality, but Tusca totally failed!

I agree with the Julie D. who said they seem to put the same garlic EVOO on everything. Honestly? It seemed a little like Olive Garden, or Cheesecake Fac. Overpriced, poor service, and fake foodies (the staff, not the customers - side note, the table next to us sent at least two dishes back). 

I would definately go back for sangria and outdoor seating (it was cold when I went), but would eat before I go!
