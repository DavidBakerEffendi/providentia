This one star is no reflection upon the one server or the one cook in the kitchen. No dishwasher, and no other staff. This has to do with the fact that this restaurant never has product in house and is always understaffed! The management or owners set no one up for success. Back in the day, me and friends always went to this Denny's and always left well fed. There is no reason why the server must rattle off a list of things that they are out of before she takes the order. She was embarrassed and felt set-up for failure. I've been in this business for 30 years and I would be embarrassed if this was my establishment! Left the server a 100% tip for her frustration, plus she had 2 tables of very non-understanding drunks to deal with.
