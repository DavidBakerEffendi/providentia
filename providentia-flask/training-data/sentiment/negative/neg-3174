I was craving Korean BBq and my friend told me about this place, it was horrible! I am half korean, growing up in Southern California and eating korean food for 30 years I think I know my korean..lol for starters the meats were bland, and not fresh looking. The selection at lunch was a few mystery potato salads, mystery noodles, and some other fried items. There was only one kimchee, no cucumber kimchee or bean sprouts. I will say that the bulgogi was ok so I ended up eating lettuce wraps with bean paste and bulgogi. I went during lunch so I don't know if dinner is better, but if you like bland meat and potato salad..this is for you...
