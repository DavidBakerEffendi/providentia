Decided to try this restaurant with my lunch buddy after few geoupon's ads. I walked in first, sit down with 3 different Menu, waitress asked me if we going to use coupon? I told her my friend may have groupon, I'm not quite sure. Right away she took "lunch menu" and "happy hour menu" away from me. I asked her to give back the menu, cuz I'm not sure which one we going to choice from. She looked at me and gave the menu back, but keep remind me, you can't choice these menu if you use coupon. I really not happy with that kind of attitude as my server, somehow I think she is the only server  who works there today.
We ordered 808 sushi roll, fried tofu, and friend shrimp salad. First 2 dishes were wonderful, shrimp salad were so so.
After we almost finished the food, lady came by try to take the empty plate. This time she grabbed my friend's cell phone wallet and put it on the side to reach the paper underneath. My friend got really upset, she told the lady please ask first  if she wants to touch customer's personal item. The lady didn't apologize but argue she just touch a little, not grabbing it........ Bluh bluh bluh
Anyhow, food was great, service need lots of improvement!!!!!!
