Pathetic service.The lady at the reception was completely clueless and was overwhelmed due to rush. I visited this place on April 11th. orderd a bejavada boneless and after waiting for 50 min I got a gobhi biryani. I immidiately told her about the incorrect order.  I had to remind her at least 4-5 time about this. Later after waiting for another 30 min I got the biryani. And guess what ..i again got Gobi ..  finally I had to leave without food even after waiting for one and half hour .. That lady didn't had the courtsy to even apologize. Really bad experience.
