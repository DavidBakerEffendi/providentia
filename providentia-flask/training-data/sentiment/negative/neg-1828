Upon entering you see a restaurant that desperately needs renovations. Furniture is beat up, decor is a mess and it's pretty dirty. Flies are on the wall and you can smell an odor... All signals to go somewhere else.

Seeing as there were decent reviews, we still decided to give this place a chance but we regret staying.

Food isn't cheap here, it came out to $22 for two people to have breakfast items. The taste was also less than mediocre. All having this strange taste probably from old oil. 

The service was also nothing special. Our server just left mid seating with a loud "OK Bye!" and we were left to be served by the kitchen staff... The only other table at the restaurant was also equally confused lol.

I currently feel disgusting after eating here. I think my toilet is expecting me later.
