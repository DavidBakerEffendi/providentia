Was up in the area and despite friends telling me not to bother with this place, I decided to give it a try. I really wish I would've listened to them and will not be going back. The employees weren't really friendly, barely spoke any English and when I asked for the slice to go, it was almost an inconvenience for them to do so. They heated up the slice for a few seconds in the oven and it was maybe room temperature when I ate it a couple minutes later. The sauce was really bland and didn't have any flavor at all. I've never had such a bland slice of pizza and the price for what you get is ridiculous. I'm not sure what to rate lower, the pizza or the service.
