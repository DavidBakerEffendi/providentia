Based on our personal experience, here are a few tips on how NOT to get verbally abused at Sienna Mercato:

- DO NOT USE MORE CHAIRS THAN THAT ALLOTED TO YOUR PARTY
o You may unapologetically be berated just loud and dramatic enough for everyone to stare at you in horror (GM, Chris Clark, was kind enough to put on this performance for our party)
- DO NOT STEP MORE THAN 2 IN. AWAY FROM WALL WHILST IN LINE FOR ELEVATOR
o You may be physically pushed (female, or not) if you step out of line
o Member of staff may not hesitate to demean and degrade you with terribly inappropriate language
(Jarvis... here's to you.)

If you're still interested, try the tater tots. They're actually pretty good. But don't even bother getting a drink upstairs... if you haven't noticed yet. The service sucks.
