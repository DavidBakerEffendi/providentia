Came here for dinner expecting it to be a good sushi spot from reading all the yelp reviews.  However was very disappointed.  It's a sushi/Brazilian place.  The sushi was horrible .  To get a sashimi each tiny piece of fish was $5.  Horrible .  At least for that price the size should be normal.  Fish tasted old and fishy.  The food took forever.  The edamame was to dry and tasted store brought.  Definitely won't be coming back.  Waste of money.
