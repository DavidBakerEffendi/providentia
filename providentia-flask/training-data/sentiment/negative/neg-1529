We got a groupon for this restaurant and called ahead to make a reservation, but it didn't seem like we needed it cause they just said ok and didn't ask for my name or number. After we were seated, I told them we had a groupon and the waitress took my phone to show it to their manager at the front desk. It looks like they don't like people using groupons because the manager kept glaring at us the whole meal and I felt very uncomfortable. I checked in on Yelp and saw the dessert offer, so I showed that to the waitress as well and she got it for us. When we went up to pay, they charged us for the dessert and I had to explain that we got it using the Yelp offer but they said it was for lunch but it clearly says available for dinner as well. I don't know why they would have such offers if they give us such a hard time redeeming it. Also there were a lot of fruit flies, so if you don't like them taking a pit stop on your plate then avoid coming here during the summer. Overall, the food was good but it was the most uncomfortable dining experience I've ever had and I will not be going back.
