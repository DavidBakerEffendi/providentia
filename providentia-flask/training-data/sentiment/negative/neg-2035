We didn't have the best experience when dining here.  We received breakfast vouchers because we stayed at The Clarendon and our service was horribly slow.  They seemed frantic and understaffed.  Our breakfasts took 49 minutes to come. Our server never asked how we were except to bring the check.  He was aloof.  The flatware and cups were dirty.  Our table was sticky.  My flapjacks were doughy in the middle.
