I was very excited to try this establishment out and left very disappointed. It was very busy with all indoor seating full. The patio was open so we sat there and waited and waited and waited and waited. No greeting, no server, no busser to clear the dirty table. As I looked to see if I was missing something, a couple girls sat at the next table informed us we had to order at the bar. There was no service on the patio. So my friend and I went to the bar leaving our ladies to hold the table. After waiting a good 15 min to order a drink and not even being acknowledged by the bar staff, we said screw it and left.

Easily wasted 45 min here and got nothing out of it. Went next door to the Ship and got a table, got beers and lunch all inside an hour.

I guess I will likely give National a try again but WOW what a let down! !
