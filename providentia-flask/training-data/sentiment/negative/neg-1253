Bad food. Bad service. 

My Brother and buddy went to Half Moon to watch Monday Night Football. We arrived right around the end of the 1st quarter and the place wasn't all that busy. 

All of our rounds were ordered within the Happy Hour time frame, i even looked at the time when we ordered out last round at 650pm. That round of beers didn't get to us until 710pm and my buddy joked i bet these get charged full price. and when the bill came he was right. 

My brother and I ordered wings when we first got there which took 30min to show up. When they finally did come we ordered 2 hamburgers and my buddy ordered wings. 40 min later my burger showed up completely wrong. wings and the other burger no where. When the waitress came over she was shocked the other food hadn't come out. when the other items did come out there were cold. All the food except for the wings was terrible very greasy.

The place has some nice TV's but one of the TV's is constantly running an awful and tacky slide show of photos from the bar and random specials. 

We wont be going back and wouldn't recommend to anyone going to this bar.
