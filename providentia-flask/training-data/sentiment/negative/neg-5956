The first time and only time I've experienced this food was as take out. Clearly that wasn't the best idea, but I can't imagine eating inside would have salvaged an ounce of what my boyfriend and I had. We both ordered vegetarian ramen. The amount and salt and oil completely ruined the taste and flavor. After a few bites, and then a few more, we threw them away.
