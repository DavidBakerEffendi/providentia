Will not be revisiting.....went for the live band they advertised on their site, no live band was there! Read some reviews about the food..... it was not good (and overpriced).  Waitress said the best item on the menu was the Eggs Benedict (so I ordered it) FAIL. No taste, mushy and deli ham, REALLY??!  Selve serve Coffee, Tea and Lemonade for $2.25 and no splenda! It was a beautiful day but due to the enormous amount of flys  we were unable to enjoy the weather.  Overall this place could be much beter with just a little effort but I am afraid this will not happen sorry to the Farm but I will not be returning anytime soon.
