Very disappointing experience at tandoori express. Will probably never come back to this place.

I've ordered take out many times before but the last two times when I ordered and picked my order, the guy with the beard served me. First, he told me he put the receipt in the bag. I got home and found no receipt in the bag. He's done it twice and each time he told me the receipt is in the bag. A place that does not give a receipt tells you something about the owners integrity and practices...

Now comes the food quality, Each time o ordered kebab wraps, they're were very tasty and had a full kebab skewers. This last time, I started eating and could not get to the meat. So I decided to open the wrap I was eating and the other two I ordered and I was shocked to find out that there is only half skewers in the wraps and the rest was cucumber and onions. Half skewer in a full size wrap!!!

Sorry to say that I will never come back to this place...next time, I will order from tandoori palace, the place I've been to many many times over the years.

I'm posting a photo of the wrap that made me write this review. Will never ever come back to this place.
