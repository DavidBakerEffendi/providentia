Oh Lord, where do I start with this one?

I knew the experience was going to be bad when I was too late in recovering my comp card during the transaction.  I thought I had forgotten my card to give me a $2 discount, but after a quick check of the side pocket in my wallet, I realized that I had my card with me all along.  

"Oh, here it is", I smiled at the cashier, handing her to the card.  She looked the height of annoyed at me and said "I've already rung it up", as she processed the last of my credit card.  Did she cancel the order?  Oh, heavens no!  That would take what, 2-3 button presses to adjust?  Don't want to tire out the fragile lamb.  Did I mention that there was no one behind me, so she would have had more than enough time to adjust my order?  It wasn't happening, and she let me know it.

The "Feast" is more like a "Fe".  It's small.  Surprisingly so.  I've been to small buffets, but the selection was really limited.  But it's the food that matters, right?

If you like fried chicken jerky masterfully placed on a chicken bone, and other freeze-dried foods, you'll feel like you're eating either the best camping or astronaut food around.  I walked around in hopes of finding some sort of culinary salvation, but the best I got was a bad stomach ache after the meal.

The desserts, however, weren't bad, and the dispenser iced tea was okay.  They did a fairly decent job of clearing the table.

And so chronicles the first and last time I'll eat there.  I might have endured the mummified food if not for the rude service.
