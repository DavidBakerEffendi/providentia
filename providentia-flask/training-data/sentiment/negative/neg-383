DO NOT EAT HERE!!!....
     I'm so disappointed...we really worked ourselves up for this place and just couldn't believe we were served elementary school sized cafeteria food! 
Hubs ordered a ref Philly cheesesteak $7.95 I ordered the second one down on the menu $8.95....I didn't want a meal so hubs ordered a small fries and small drink on the side...all totaling about $21 (1 meal and 1 sandwich...smh..First off the meat is ridiculous!...they look like left over pieces of meat shreds from a slicer! The sandwiches were less than 6" each and were bland and so were the fries...the drink was pathetic sized and filled with ice...two slurps and you were done drinking it!!! We were completely offended that they would serve this food at such a high price! The serving sizes were just itty bitty!!! I never wanted to cuss out my food as much as I wanted to that day! F bombs all over!!! That's food court food for you I guess...I repeat...DO NOT EAT HERE...you're better off getting a foot long steak sandwich from Subway with a meal...and it would be cheaper, have some damn flavor and you leave with a full tummy! We went to robertos after having this pathetic-@$$ meal.
