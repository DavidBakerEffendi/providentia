First time ordering here and will never order again. Ordered basic large pizza with toppings and they did not make it right.  I live literally 1 minute from the pizza shop and it was delivered cold. Delivery person was nice and went back to get another pizza (this time made right) but not worth the hassle or money (was very expensive, over $30 for a large pizza and 2 drinks...and the pizza didn't even taste that great)  Defonitely will not be a return customer.
