Finally thought we'd try this place, but after about 5 minutes or so it was time to leave. After walking up to the bar, there being no one at the entryway, where the bartender kept himself busy cleaning some glassware and chatting with the attractive blonde at the bar, we glanced at the drink menu waiting for a "hello" or some acknowledgement. Still nothing. Gave it another minute or so, then the bartender simply walked away...  Oh well. No loss, I suppose, but based on this experience I definitely won't be back. Can't comment on the food or drinks, obviously. Not recommended.
