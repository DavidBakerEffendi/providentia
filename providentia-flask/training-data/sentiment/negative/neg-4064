This place is really bad. The only thing good about it is the poutine, however the way they make it is really gross. They don't even wash their hands before making something; like you should at least wear gloves. 
I once paid for a poutine which is 6 dollars, i paid them 20 dollars and they give me 8 dollars back, like can you guys do simple math? 
They take so long to make the food and their service is horrible. 

ALSO they don't even have garbage cans to throw stuff out. And their washroom look like it was not renovated.
Lastly they keep bribing us to come back for business. An example of that would be like "one dollar milkshakes this Friday, come and we will give you". 
They also keep asking us why aren't the kids from school coming to their restaurant anymore because everyone does not come here anymore
Also there is dirty stuff all over the forks, cups, tissues and etc. 
No air conditioning and plus the doors always open so bugs keep coming in. And they increase their price because know one wants to come because their unsanitary.
They touch money with their dirty hands and their attitude is not welcoming.

Plus on their website (oldevillagebistro.com/about-us.php) they say that "oldevillage bistro has been in business for over 20 years which i respect however it is not true that "we prepare our food with care each time." Also they say that 96% of our customers are returning customers.
