Arrived straight from airport checked in used Valet Parking thinking my New Mimi Cooper would be safe only to have it delivered to me the next day with 5, yes five big door dings wow so amazing they made a report but could care less. Instead of a 5 star hotel should be 5 dent. Seriously though want your car jacked up give it to the Valet, god dam amazing they could be so careless i am in total disbelief.  If you have a nice car do yourself a favor and park it yourself the Valet is free and now i know why. I will never ever stay here again and if i didn't have a package deal would check out today. This type of vandalism simply there is no excuse for none zip nada. The repair will cost hundreds to fix and now it will be a civil action more crap to deal with. 
The rooms are nice the food is good but they lack in quality control with customer owned property and to say I am disappointed in their actions would be an understatement.  My 14yr old son knows better so I wonder what else they did,  I never checked the mileage when I gave my vehicle to them. We simply will never return and I certainly hope anyone with a nice auto takes my advice and park it yourself. The Hotel was proactive to make a security report but this type of headache I didn't need and normally when you give your vehicle to valet you get the best care well was sadly mistaking and have never had a valet experience like this before 5 dents were not created by one person this is their whole valet team and I would fire all of them if I had any say in this matter. When the vehicle was delivered there was not one dent or scratch. We won't return they have no respect for customers property.
