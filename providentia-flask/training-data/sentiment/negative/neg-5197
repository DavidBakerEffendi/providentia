I'm not saying the food is bad, I just never received it. Who ever is manning online orders didn't see the order for two hours. So I'm not giving them this low score for the food, I'm giving them the low score because they didn't pay attention. I was starving waiting for two hours for an order that was never started. I think that is total bull crap. They asked me if I wanted to the order still and it would take 60 minutes for the order, They were basically telling me that I have to wait three hours for my food.  They also said they'd make it up to me if I ordered again. How do I know someone will see it this time. I'm probably not going to order from their again. I wound up getting Jimmy Johns, that took 10 minutes from when i submitted my order.
