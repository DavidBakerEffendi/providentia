I wondered why there was no one in the place when I walked in today at 12:30. After what was possibly the WORST meal I've had in years, I no longer wonder. Salsarita's has nose-dived in the last 2 years. While it's never been known for great food, up until about a year or so ago, it was pretty reliable fast-food Tex-Mex. Not great but not bad. Now...it's just bad. I got the quesadilla and EVERYTHING about it tasted stale and bad-flavored. The queso was just awful. And most insulting was the price. $10+ for one lousy meal. Shame on this sham of a chain. I hope to hear that Salsarita's goes out of business. Soon.
