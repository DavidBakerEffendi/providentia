We showed up last night to Top golf Scottsdale and it was an hour and a half wait.   No problem,  we get it BUT, We were told to buy a membership card and to come back tonight and with that card they would "get us right in!!" That's what she said!! We show up tonight and the guy says 2hrs!  We told him, but it's not on him,  i get it.  Don't have her name but, liar! Must make commission off all the phony cards you sell.  First time we had been and only because we had our kids in from out of town.
