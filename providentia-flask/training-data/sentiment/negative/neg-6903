Really bad customer service. No smiles no positive attitudes. Kid in the grill area bluntly ignored the cashier when she asked for a side of Mac sauce after rolling his eyes so she had to have the other side do it. Then got an attitude becuz I asked for another side when I clearly asked for two in the beginning. I offered to pay for them and everything. And this bullshit where u have to buy a Big Mac to get the sauce is pissing me off. And it's only with the Akron locations. The Youngstown locations and Cleveland ones are not like that it's bullshit. If I want mac sauce for my fries and I pay the .30 for it there shouldn't be a problem. I am over these childish rude make things complicated for no reason owners. I won't be back to this one. Thanks.
