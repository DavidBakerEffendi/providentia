Don't even bother. If I could give 0 stars I would. The place wasn't too packed of  Friday night around 9, and my group of 4 took a seat at a table. Waitress came over in a huff, took drink orders and left. Drinks took about 15 mins to get to us (we only ordered beer and wine), and then we never saw our Waitress again. Seriously. We sat there for 45 mins (talking and catching up, but still our Waitress should have returned at some point). I finally have to go try and get her from talking to her coworker at the bar. It was absolutely ridiculous. She then seemed mad that we were ready to leave after not being seen or spoken to by her for FORTY FIVE MINUTES. Yes, I'd love to stay in such a welcoming, friendly and continue to receive such great service (sarcasm, for those we missed it). 

Save your time, and over expensive drinks (6 bucks for a short blue moon, dream on friend).
