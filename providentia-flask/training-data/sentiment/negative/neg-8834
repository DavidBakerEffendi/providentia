Pretty disappointed with my visit this evening. I'm a frequent customer of the Barros in goodyear on Estrella and McDowell and always have a great visit and the management ROCKS. Tonight we were on the other side of town and I ordered a pickup order and was quoted 20 minutes. My order took 42 minutes- and the manager realized that my food had been ready the entire time I was in the lobby waiting but none of the girls bothered calling my name or were paying attention. When I called the manager. After getting home to find my wings cold he said there was absolutely nothing he could do for me unless I wanted to bring the wings back to swap them - because it is "against their policy."  So I could wait another 40 minutes? On top of driving through i17 Rush hour traffic? No thanks. I have family that work for Barros so I know their policy well. I feel ripped off and am disappointed that I just paid 10 bucks for cold wings, but more discouraged with the lack of customer service that I received from the management and counter girls.  I'll stick to the goodyear location.
