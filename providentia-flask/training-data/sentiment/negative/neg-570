Went here several times, gave it many chances. Every time it's something different! I pay, I tip and the bar tender Wanda likes to talk junk about me a paying customer and (I'm a married man with a child) calls me GAY because I have stopped in after work with an old guy friend. Terrible customer service, from WANDA! Old Vegas Tavern is right across the street, save yourself the drama and low life bar tender has and the complaining about how miserable her life is and how she doesn't have money and her car is always being repaired etc. time to grow up Wanda, get a clue! Customer Service RUNS THIS TOWN!! 
Never Again!
