Came here on a Tuesday because I had a craving for wings and it was close to home. I think we arrived around 8:45pm. Two servers on the floor with someone I assume is the owner/manager watching the happenings of his restaurant. No host/hostess to seat us. We had to wait for a server to free up. 

The restaurant wasn't busy, but there were a few tables enjoying the Tuesday night wing deal. We weren't greeted or anything, but was able to place our order in one go when we got the attention of our/a server. 

While we waited for our food, we watched as the owner/manager tried to drop food off at the wrong tables. Constantly. Come on, your restaurant isn't big. There's no reason to mix table numbers up like that. We waited around 45 minutes for our wings, which is grossly long for a place that wasn't that busy and our food didn't require any skill - just throw everything into the deep fryer and toss it in some sauce.

When we finally got our wings, I was pretty annoyed that we had to wait that long. No utensils were given at the time of order, so we had to ask. For wings that took 45 minutes, I expected them to be piping hot, but they were only slightly warm at best. The fries had an interesting texture, like they had been frozen and defrosted a few times - they were sandy and dry on the inside, if that makes sense. No one checked on us to see how we were doing or if we needed anything else.

After all was said and done, we left the restaurant at about 10:30pm, which was much later than we would have liked, since we ate our food within half an hour. I chose this place thinking it would be a quick in and out bite, but I was very wrong. Not sure if I would ever come back.
