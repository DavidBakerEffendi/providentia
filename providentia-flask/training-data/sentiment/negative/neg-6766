Not a coffee house guy. Not sure what I wanted other than "the iced drink with the most caffeine". Was given a bunch of vapid answers and no suggestions, they served a total of 3 customers after my mate whom I ordered with. I was given the wrong size, but at that point, "oh well". If you frequent coffee shops, this is your spot. If you're a novice, stick to a chain. Tasting what I have..... not even good.
