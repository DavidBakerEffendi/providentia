Went there tonight with another couple. We wanted to go to Harrold's but they were too busy. We ordered drinks and it took forever to come out. Then we ordered dinner. After that, we asked for water all around the table. that took an hour to get to us and we had to ask 2 different people. The waitress made it a point to tell us she was new. We completely understand when someone is new but the mistakes were ridiculous. Then our dinner came out and we all had burgers. When I went to cut into my burger, it wasn't a burger, it was chicken. We asked to see a manager. He came over in 5 minutes and we explained about our water taking an hour and my. "Chicken" burger. He took the chicken back, never apologizing and we never saw him again. We definitely told him how unhappy we were with the service. He didn't seem to care. My friend and I ordered another drink and the waitress brought  them and said "these are on me". Really? When I finally got my correct burger, it was horrible. Not seasoned and it just tasted like a pile of beef. I ate a few bites and couldn't eat anymore The sweet potato fries were soggy. Then we decided to order the half baked cookie. 30 minutes went by and nothing, not even the waitress. I went to the restroom  that and on my way back, I told the hostess where we were sitting and to cancel our desert. Then the waitress came by and said "for future reference, if you order that  this desert it takes a little longer". Really? Why didn't she just tell us that? We would have happily waited if she TOLD US! Food and service terrible. Never again!
