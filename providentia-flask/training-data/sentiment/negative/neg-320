If I could put negative stars I would. 
1. The service is downright rude and horrible!!!
2. The duck is super dry and the chicken is pretty gross for $$14!!
3. The ac is horribly weak. I was sweating throughout the whole meal.
4. The icing on this horrible meal is they tack on 15% automatically even though my party was only 4 people! If you have to force your patrons to pay for tip, its not the patrons fault but your sad excuse for waiters!!!
5. This is such a sad excuse for a Sam woo I would never recommend anyone to come here NOR would I ever return here myself!!!
