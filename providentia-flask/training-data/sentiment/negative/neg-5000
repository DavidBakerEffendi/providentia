Went there for a birthday celebration and the hostess told us the wait was 15 mins..so we decided to wait for it...45 minutes later and a few other groups of people being seated before us even though we were there first, so we decided to leave and went to the other restaurant next to it. We were glad we left because who knows how much longer we had to wait. I don't mind waiting but if the hostess told us 15 minutes..I don't mind waiting 5 or 10 minutes longer but it was ridiculous that we waited over 45 minutes to almost an hour and she didn't even say anything to us. It seems that the hostess there didn't really know what she was doing..alll she was saying to people showing up was 15 minutes wait,which obviously it wasn't. I would have been glad if we were notified of our status for waiting that long but we weren't. We went there June 23rd, which was a Thursday around 6:30 pm...so whoever worked there in the front,  please work on you customer service..it sucks because we really wanted to eat there but was turned off by the front personnel attitude or lack of services.
