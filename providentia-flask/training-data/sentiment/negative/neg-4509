Such high hopes, and the food might be amazing. I couldn't tell you. 
4 of us went on a Saturday night. There were 2 tables with patrons outside and 2 inside. We were seated right away.... And then completely ignored. After 15 minutes without a word to us we left. They never told us 1 minute and we will be with you, or a glass of water. On the way out the door we passed 2 servers and still not a word.
