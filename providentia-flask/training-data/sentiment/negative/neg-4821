So let me start off by saying the food is absolutely amazing....amazing....however I will never ever go back her.  It was my sister's 21st birthday, we had a group of 12 of us.  We were a little late for our reservation but we called them and they said they were fine with us being a little late.  

We were seated in Jennifer's section, it took her ten minutes to come get our drink orders.  There were three two tops sat in our section after us, and she got their drinks out first.  We waited for our food to be brought out for 45 minutes, and no she didn't communicate what was going on in the kitchen.  A simple "I am so sorry we are slammed" or she could have brought out our salads, but of course not.  Then we finally got our dinner.  She dropped our plates and left, didn't ask us if we needed any condiments or anything else.  Thank god the bus boy was filling our waters.  We ordered another round of drinks and that took about 20 minutes to get.  Then we requested for the check..............30 minutes later still no check.  I spoke to the manager, still no check, waited another 5 minutes still no check.  Finally the check came and we split it up quickly it took her 8 minutes to run the bill, 3/4 cash the rest on ONE CARD.  8 minutes....8 minutes to close out the bill???? of course she didn't apologize for how ridiculously useless and neglecting she was.  I feel like because she got an automatic gratuity she thinks she can give us crappy service.  She doesn't deserve an 18% tip, she barely deserves a 5% tip.  Manager didn't handle it well, and it was a crappy way to start the birthday girl's night.  I hope they get a new manager and staff otherwise, no matter how wonderful their food is everyone will avoid this place like a plague.  Jennifer you seriously suck and I have no idea how you even have a serving job, you couldn't serve a horse a carrot if you wanted to.
