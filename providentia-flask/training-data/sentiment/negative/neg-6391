I hate giving a one star to restaurants because of service but this was horrible. Postino is one of my favorite spots and original location in Arcadia is great and it doesn't matter how busy they get the service is always top notch. I was so exited about Kierland location because is just few minutes from my home but I rather drive to Arcadia. 
             Postino is great place but they have to hire better people who care and they don't think that they are above their job. 
             6 of us came on Tuesday night and I understand that they are busy
      But the attitude is just unacceptable we have to flag our server all night
   And then wen we finally called the manager instead of her taking care of it
She was even worse....attitude, entitlement ...bad...bad ....bad.
        Postino sorry for one star but you should take a look in to it. I hope that you will hire better people.........!!!!!!!!!!!!
