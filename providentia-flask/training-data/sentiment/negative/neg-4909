We ate dinner here last night, and it was the last time I'll be "taken" again. I'd expect better quality food from The Mirage, but I was wrong. There were minimal meat selections, turkey or prime rib -- with plenty of gristle included. Mashed potatoes were cold and seemed to be from a box. Most food had little flavor or were overly salty. The Asian area of the buffet lacked quality and flavor. The only desert that was good was the bread pudding and the fresh fruit. The other deserts had no flavor. The gelato was gross and melted before I returned to the table. Too expense for crap.
