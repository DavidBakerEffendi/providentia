this place is gross!!! I don't know how they stay in business. The hot dogs were nothing special, i can buy hot dogs from the grocery store and they taste better! The fries were okay, a bit greasy. They only take cash and i don't carry cash so my brother had to pay for us. Out of the 4 of us that went none of us liked the food. never going here again!!
