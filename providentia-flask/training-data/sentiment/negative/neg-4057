We went here for the first time on Father's Day at 10:30a. We ordered an omelette and some sort of breakfast special- certainly nothing out of the ordinary. After 85 minutes, we asked the waitress to cancel our order, as we hadn't yet been served. The  waitress was very apologetic and comped our bill (which was only coffee) and asked us to return for a complimentary meal in the future. Very disappointing experience indeed.
