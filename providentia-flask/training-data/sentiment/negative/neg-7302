Tried this place out after seeing the other decent Yelp reviews and wanting to try a new place for lunch. Service was very friendly, but giving one star due to the big disappointment in the food and outdoor patio area. The full size salad there was $6 and definitely not something that would fill you up for lunch. It also was full of sad, almost white iceberg lettuce, with a scant few other veggies. No place to sit outside due to broken umbrellas, un-bussed tables and bird "stuff" on one of the tables. The inside seemed okay other than that it was too cold, and the news that was on the TV with one horrific story after the other -- not something you want on over lunch. Had to go to another place afterwards since I was still hungry. Won't be coming back here unfortunately. :(
