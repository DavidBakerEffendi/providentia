Don't come here planning on having their all-you-can-eat fish fry on Fridays, uless you get here early. They don't know how to plan, and run out by 6:15pm. Rediculous! Must cater to the retired community, because cleary, the working community doesn't stand a chance. Somebody PLEASE get this manager some supply management training!
