I did not enjoy my experience at this restaurant. To be fair the calamari appetizer was excellent, however both of our entrees were extremely lacking, especially considering the price. The server seemed overwhelmed despite there was only about 5 occupied tables. The busboy was not only extremely unprofessional (constantly making inappropriate jokes) but he was slimy in the way he approached my girlfriend. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and my only greater regret from eating there was not informing the manager of the poor service and food we received. I was extremely let down and confused as so many reviews of this restaurant were great, but it seemed like amateur hour to me.
