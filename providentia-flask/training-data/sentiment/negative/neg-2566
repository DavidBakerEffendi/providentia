Came here for a morning/lunch buffet and it sucked bad! My friends and I were hungover, not to mention starving, and were too lazy to walk over to Paris for their buffet so we decided to just try it here since we stayed in Bally's anyways.

I didnt enjoy the food one bit. The good thing about this place is that it has quite a lot of seating so there wasn't any waiting when we arrived, but I dont think i'll ever be back.
