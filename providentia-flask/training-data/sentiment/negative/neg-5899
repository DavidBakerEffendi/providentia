The great reviews did not live up to the experience we had. The pizza was just alright and a bit overpriced for what you get. The crust was burnt black and tasted like charcoal and the waiter seemed so pretentious and cold when I asked for a bit more bread. The bread (and dipping oil) was the best part of the meal! Overrated and underwhelming, unfortunately.
