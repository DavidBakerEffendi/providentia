This is the worst seafood buffet I have ever eaten at, and for the money, the worst buffet I've ever tried. All the white fish tasted the same no matter how they seasoned it and was dry. The seafood pasta was gross. Half the problem is the food doesn't turn over fast enough and it sits out in the buffet way to long. Probably because the food sucks and they can never get enough people at the buffet to eat it. The lobster tails sat in this weird broth and looked disgusting. They had this italian NY steak that was as tough as shoe leather....nothing was good here...nothing! I wouldn't pay $10 dollars for this buffet and would rather pay for a meal at the Red Lobster (which is almost as bad) than eat for free at this dump.
