Don't order online. I made the mistake thinking it would save me time but I showed up when at the pickup time it showed online which was about 25 mins from the time of order and then sat over 15 mins longer in the dinning area because it seemed no one had even started on my order. If I hadn't of paid online I would've walked out. And then when I spoke to the manager on the phone after I left she just told me she would address it with the staff and was not very apologetic at all. I've enjoyed driving through this place many times but I wont be fooled again.
