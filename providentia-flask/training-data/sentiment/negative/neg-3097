Average. The food is so overpriced here it's embarrassing. Frequently the fries have been undercooked. The tacos were awful so finally they're off the menu. Save your cash and head across the street or to College where at least your food will be worth the $30 price tag. Service is also hit and miss. It's a shame. It was a great place when it opened. Now it's just shitty attitude and cash grabbing.
