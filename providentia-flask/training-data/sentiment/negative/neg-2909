I was there last Friday evening with a friend. No one acknowledged us after we were seated for 10 minutes. Then water was delivered with the menu.  Waited another 10 minutes to order.   Waited another 10 minutes. Waiter came and told us he had misplaced our order. Food came out cold. Not very happy. Should have been offered our meal without charge. Not sure if I will go back.
