Run away!  The price is expensive, the service is hostile, and the food is mediocre.  The coffee is undrinkable.  Getting in requires waiting in line and after paying a fortune, passing through tight security (like crossing a border into a foreign country).  Once in, your have access to the buffet, but if you want to get a cup of coffee, you'll need to "show your papers".  We were continually harasses by the staff to "show your papers" as if I was an illegal immigrant trespassing onto foreign lands; I was worried if I didn't possess the necessary paperwork, I would be taken off to jail.  I've never quite had such a unique and hostile dining experience.
I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere.
