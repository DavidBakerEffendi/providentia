Usually a favorite of mine. This time it went from bad to worse. Ordered the fajitas. Came out semi warm and the tortillas were COLD. asked for some warm ones and they took so long the meat was cold. My girlfriends plate was the wrong meal and then they had the check completely wrong.  Probably will not be coming back.  So long and adios.
