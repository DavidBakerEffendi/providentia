I adore Korean food, This was my least favorite. For a new restaurant it was dingy and used looking.  Very sparse. The menu was deposited on the table, no drinks were offered only a lukewarm water glass.  We ordered the combo, chose the spicy pork bulgogi, and the short ribs.  What a disappointment. We always patron Takamatsu's but decided to try this as it was new and the ratings were good.  If you are not Korean, the  portions are pathetic, for 21.99 we were given what I would expect as a meager lunch portion.  I noticed that others that ordered the same dishes were given much larger portions, and also given much more personal attention.  We stated that it was our first time, but it made no difference.  What a shame as when we love a restaurant we spread the word.  The same is true for when we do not like a restaurant  only we tell more people.
