I was not going to post this but I thought people needed to know I came here from far away 30 minute drive to come eat at this famous cute restaurant with my fiancé for lunch I thought it was super cute however the music didn't match the place but that was my least of the worries. When the waiter told us specials he said it would be a ribeye I said oh that sounds good honey you should order it he did when the food came it was prime rib not ribeye the waiter didn't offer to change it or nothing he said I'll bring over desert I said ok when the check came he didn't even bother Bringing the desert and charged us for the ribeye which I know it was more we are not the ones to complain so we let it go we just thought we would never come here again. It was sad me and my fiancé never go out to eat it was $90 to be aggravated so I took it upon myself to call the manager she said to email her which I did and she never responded back to me so there you go I honestly will not go back to this restaurant they need to have servers that are more professional and know what they are doing..
