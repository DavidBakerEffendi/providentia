I have the same issues as everyone mentioned here. Menu needs description, and seriously over price! There is a sushi restaurant literally a block from here and for $26 you get an all you can eat fair, and it's actually really good. My husband ate here twice, and we ordered and same sushi, it wasn't consistent. 

I think they need to stop serving in paper plates. Step up just a little more. My husband ordered the udon soup and they served it on a drink cup! Also, staff needs to learn the menu. As a new restaurant expect everyone to ask questions (especially when there aren't any description on the menu), so  educate your staff! The girl couldn't even pronounce udon correctly... Scary!

Also I had the combination fried rice, totally burnt, AND the food was so slow to come out. I don't think they expedite the food well. Seems like they cook the food one at a time, but rush it because it was burnt ( weird right?) 

I am really rooting for them, and hoping they are reading everyone's review to make the change. They have great potential, but they need major change. 

Good luck!
