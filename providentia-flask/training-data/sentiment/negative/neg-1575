Came in on a Wednesday early afternoon for an anniversary breakfast with my wife, since we live close by. Biggest friggin mistake in a loooong time. 

Wife had eggs Benedict. Hollandaise was off. Spent anniversary night in the emergency room downtown with my wife having food poisening from the hollandaise sauce. I'm in the biz, and I know it was from that. The only thing she ate that had time to incubate long enough. An IV of zofran and morphine was the cure from the doc. Screw this place. 

Thanks so much for a great evening Candy!
