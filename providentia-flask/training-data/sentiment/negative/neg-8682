I really don't like writing bad reviews, but unfortunately we did not have a good experience here last night. When we arrived, they were very busy. We had a reservation, but had to wait 30 minutes for our table. The hostess seemed very overwhelmed and forgot about us multiple times. She even asked my name multiple times to confirm the reservation. Once we were finally seated we ordered beer and water. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. At that time we asked to put in our appetizer and dinner order to try and speed up the process (we were going to a hockey game and didn't want to be late). 45 minutes later we received our food. It was frustrating because others around us who ordered after us, ate and left before we even got our food. Some guests in our party never even received their food. We had to ask for the check and leave, because we were going to be late for the game. We asked our server to take the food we never received off of our bill. He was hesitant at first, but finally agreed. He argued with us, and then realized he made a mistake. We will stick to Shake Shack and Bruxie's from now on.
