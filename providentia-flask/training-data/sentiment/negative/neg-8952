Walked into the brewpub on a Sunday night. The brewpub while large, was mostly empty. My wife and I wanted to sample some of their beers. We walked up to the bar and the bartender -- seemingly the sole employee working at the time -- in lieu of greeting us, told us that the kitchen was closed.

We had previously eaten and merely wanted to sample some beer. We asked the bartender for a flight. Overtly annoyed, she informed us that flights were not normally served after 8 PM but that she would make an exception.

We looked over the menu and placed our order only to be informed that two of the four beers we wanted in our flight were not available even though they were written on the chalkboard menu. We modified our order and the bartender served us.

After tasting the beer, we were even more disappointed as the beers were mediocre. Two of the four beers we tasted had high levels of off flavors (DIACETYL OVERLOAD).

This is easily one of the worst breweries we have ever visited.
