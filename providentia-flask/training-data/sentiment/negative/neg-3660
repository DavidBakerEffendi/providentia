Go to the original in San Antonio instead. Vegas transplants good stuff from everywhere but this location is a poor imitation of the original. Food is just OK and too expensive like everything else on the strip. 

Our waitress wasn't surly she just spent the evening flirting with my husband. The gimmick with Dick's is they are supposed to sarcastic and insulting perpetuating a good time. Whatever, I wasn't impressed with the food, atmosphere or waitstaff. 

Typical tourist trap. Skip it.
