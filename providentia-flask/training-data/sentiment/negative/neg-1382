So I went to the drive thru on Friday and ordered a small fried rice for my dogs. I got it, no problem. I go through today and all of a sudden they don't have small anymore. I told them I just got one on Friday. They said it was a mistake. So instead I ordered a kids meal so I could get the rice for my dog who just had her teeth cleaned. They repeated the order back to me, then I get home to a tray of Chow mein. Thanks, Jennifer in drive thru!  So now I have to go back to get the rice. I will not be back at this location.
