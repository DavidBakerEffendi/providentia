Pros : clean place
Cons: lots. The service was horrible, especially when you are paying pretty high for the food and drinks. Cocktail Drinks cost about $10 and entries average about $16-$24. And when you get bad service for spending so much, that would drive me crazy. 

Drinks and food were ok. Not the quality I expected. There r lots of other restaurants on mill ave that are far better.

In short, I personally would not recommend this place to any of my friends n relatives.
