It was very busy this particular Friday night but the guy who came to greet me at the door asked how many in my party and I said 4. I was the first to arrive so was alone. Many people came in after and were seated before me. When I questioned it, he said he thought I was with those ladies, and pointed to a group at the bar, that I was no where near. When I was finally sitting at a table (that rocked as it was uneven and the booth felt like I was going to bounce into the ceiling) I waited 15 mins before flagging someone down to get me water. Our waitress was crusty! She wasn't pleasant, didn't even introduce herself and seemed like she didn't want to be there. 
Friends arrive, we order apps, description of how many of an item would be helpful on the menu. 4 of us and only 2 crabcakes. Great. Split it is. Some app. Our waitress went home and another took over - thank God. She was at least nice
Meals came, friends salmon was overcooked, another's fries way too salty and my manicotti was flavorless - needed some serious salt. The best thing about going to Remezzo was the company I held, which would've been the same wherever we went. 
Won't go back
