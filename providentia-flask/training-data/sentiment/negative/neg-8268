Pho was less than average. Not a lot of flavor, didn't bring the veggies out (until we asked for it), or the hoisin & Siracha. Service was poor! Very arrogant and rude from the 2 out of 3 people that worked there. The bun bo hue was decent, they charge $2 for pig feet, but they didn't tell me and they made it sound like it was included. 

Wouldn't come back. We enjoyed superior pho better. 
We would've came back if they weren't so rude.
