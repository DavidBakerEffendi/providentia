Went here with my wife recently and I will never return! Let me say that the fish tacos were great! The reason for my 1 star review is because of the bar!
The day we went it was around 110 outside and when I order our food I try to order 2 blended Margaritas and the guy at the restaurant counter said that they weren't on his pos menu but I could go to the bar and order directly. A little annoying but no biggie,here's where it all goes wrong.......
I walk into the bar which is separated from the restaurant by glass as people can smoke at the bar which is ok with me. The problem is when I try to order blended margaritas, the female bartender says to me "We aren't that kind of bar! We don't use blenders!"  Well I've been bartending for 20 years and if a restaurant that features fish tacos with a full bar doesn't make blended drinks it means either 1 The bartenders are lazy or 2 the owner is lazy!
It takes maybe an extra 20 seconds to make any blended drink! In the desert in summer time at a beach themed fish place,you sure as hell oughta be able to get a freakin blended drink!
Get it together!
