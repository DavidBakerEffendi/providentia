Sooooooo I realize that this is Bojangles and it's a fast food establishment....but things still need to be sanitary!  My husband wanted to stop here on the way out of town- I did not but went along with it.  Bad idea.

He got egg and cheese biscuits.  I got a plain biscuit and a boberry biscuit.  Breakfast hall of shame.  I was all ready to eat my biscuit (plain) and noticed a black thing in it.  My husband told me it was a berry.  Then I explained this was the plain- not the boberry!  Well the "berry" was a fly baked INTO my biscuit.  Really?!  I guess they really don't pay attention to what is happening at this location!  So gross.

I emailed corporate with a photo and explained how this was no acceptable.  I did get a nice voicemail- but I was really hoping for a refund as a I requested and expected since it was seriously disgusting and not sanitary at all.  But- what can you do?  I just won't visit ever again.
