I have no idea what everyone is raving about! I had the chicken tacos and really didn't like them. They were soft, grilled tortillas - like a quesadilla. Way too much cheese, and no sour cream. My rice had bits of dried rice in it-like it had been sitting too long, and the top of the rice dish got hard and then they stirred it! Feta cheese on my re fried beans.  When I asked my waiter if it was the right order, he told me this is traditional Mexican cuisine. I travelled all over Mexico and never had tacos like that. I will not be back. The only thing that I agree with about the reviews of this place is: that the staff is really friendly.  Otherwise... YECK.
