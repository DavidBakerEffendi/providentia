I order from here for lunch all the time. I absolutely love their chipotle chicken sandwich with no avocado. However EVERY time I order from here they get my order wrong, whether its the kind of bread or the toppings. I don't know WHAT kind of people they are hiring here but they are absolutely useless. Called them to explain the situation and the best they could do was offer for me to come in at that time for a free sandwich with me recipe. Sucks I am at work and spent a majority of my break waiting for my food. Just don't order from here. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time.
