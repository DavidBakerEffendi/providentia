HORRIBLE EXCUSE FOR A RESTAURANT. Honestly I don't complain much and I never write negative reviews but this was an all time low. Let me start by saying we were walked right back to the worst table in the house, the atmosphere was so cool, and the patio really nice, yet somehow we got escorted to a tiny table near the bathrooms. I got whiffs of the bathrooms every time the doors opened and closed. I asked if we could sit outside and was told "no sorry this is all we have." She didn't even offer to have us wait a few minutes while they cleared a table.

It gets worse. We were not acknowledged for about 25 minutes and once we were we ordered chips, salsa, and guac, and gacos. Over an hour later we still had not received a damn thing. Not even an apology or an acknowledgement from the server. When my husband finally asked, she said oh the kitchen is making the chips. (Really? In a Mexican restaurant?) sounds like you forgot to order them. (P.s they charge for chips, salsa and guac..not cool). Finally after about an hour and a half the food came out and I wish we would have walked out of this place. The carne asada tacos were so disgusting I had to spit them out in my napkin..pure fat..hard meat, awful. The fish tacos were decent but noting. Great and the salsa sucked, overall it could not have been a worse experience. The only thing the waitress did do was comp the 3 dollar chips at the end, Thanks.

Loud music bumping, inexperienced servers, unprofessional service, horrible food. I'll be shocked if this place survives another 6 months.
