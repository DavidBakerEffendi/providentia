Went here today for lunch with my mom, who just moved in to the adjacent condominium complex behind the restaurant. 

This. Place. Sucked. I mean really bad.

My first instinct this was going to be a rough ride was the fact they there was no appetizing aroma either outside or when opening the front doors. My second instinct? The decor... Weird looking yellow chairs, ceiling has water/mold stains and the TV is showing Slice.

We were taken to our table by a middle-aged Asian man, who seemed to have a real problem speaking any language, as he spoke like Dr. Frankenstein's monster. There were other guests who seemed to have the same difficulty. Then another manager, this time a female, approached with a cart of items and asked if we wanted the spare ribs and chicken wings. We said yes, but then realized that she was just going to reheat the ones on the actual cart, that were sitting by the front door. The ribs were lukewarm and the wings were soggy from the reheat.  

Now, as for the menu... If you eat in as opposed to takeout, there is a price hike, supposedly because you are getting more food, so don't be surprised by the $15 chicken fried rice and about the same for curry vegetables.

The rice was just plain crap. No taste or color and the cabbage was slimy and not crunchy in the rice. The vegetables were the size of my fist (exaggerated), but damn folks, could you not cut them down to a manageable size?!

All that and I'm now $40 in the hole. No tip either, since we  had to pack our own doggy bag and took home whatever was left as to not waste and/or try to shovel it off to someone else. Failing that, trying to recook it back to some forms of dignity.

Shame on whoever cooks the food there, seriously.

The only plus? The cashier was real cute.
