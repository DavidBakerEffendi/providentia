I advised people not to go here for a night out for sushi. For 27.99 with no dessert or drinks, what a waste of time!!! I would've planned to go to any other restaurant knowing the cost to eat here. Any other restaurant would have had the same quality of food and service.

However, this place does a solid one star for a nice decor, having a patio and tap on their credit card machine. It has a good higher class feel, but below average selection.

On their menu, all the food that was ordered was average at best. However, 2 thumbs up in the the calamari which would be the best item of their selection.

To conclude, food was average at best while charging premium price. Maybe it's the area, but for the veteran foodies, this does not sit well in our stomachs. Hope prices go down and I'll think of getting the another chances in my good graces.
