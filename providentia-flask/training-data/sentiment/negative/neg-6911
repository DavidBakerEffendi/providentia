Worst restaurant experience I've ever had. HORRIBLE service, the entire staff was rude, inattentive every single order was wrong. All the checks were wrong. The guacamole took 20 minutes. We weren't even greeted for 15 minutes. Then they fed us "free shots" to make up for how horrible everything was, acting like that should make up for it. THE MANAGER ended up taking over and still was getting everything wrong!!!!! And they weren't even busy. If you want an enjoyable restaurant experience, do not come here. Absolutely awful.
