Wonderful looking place. The menu looked amazing. But we were totally trolled the food was awful. It was over priced and bland. The presentation was nice, but it did not taste good at all. And the service was bad. It was just plain awkward. They didn't care, nor were they friendly. We tried smiling and being nice, and even complementing them. Nothing worked.
