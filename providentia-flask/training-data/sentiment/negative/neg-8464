Went there about 2 mornings ago with my wife... got seated and sat for about 7 minutes or more and nobody acknowledged us.. then  2 guys sat at the table next to us and within 30 sec got their drink order taken. Tried to get some attention but still nothing. About a minute later the waitress goes and takes the food order of the 2 guys next to us and we still haven't even gotten acknowledged. Another min or so passes and I'm getting pissed. We finally get some attention but by this time we are ready To leave this place. I'm from hawaii and now reside here in Vegas. My wife and I eat out alot and have never experienced this kind of treatment before. The ladies working that day were I believe Hispanic, and seems like they were probably racist of my type of people. A few friends of mine have also recieved this kind  service at this specific location on rainbow blvd. This place NEEDS to get their shit straight cause it's becoming Way too obvious and will bite them in the ass one day
