I do not like writing a terrible review due to terrible customer service at the front desk. 
However, the front desk took the position of me being rude when they cancelled my Open Table reservation stating they did not accept online reservations. Interesting how they were able to cancel the online reservation. They also made false statements about my language when they were being rude to everyone looking for a table. 
Been there in the past and enjoyed dinner. Too bad a nasty attitude loses you business and negative reviews.
