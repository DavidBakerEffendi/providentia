It was 6:30pm or so on a Thursday night, the sign clearly said the place was open at 4:00.  My friends and I walk in and there is no customers nor is there any staff.  We nervously stand around for around 10 minutes or so.  A gentleman comes out and I say hello with hope in my eyes hoping for service.  He says hi back, walks into the back and then we wait a few minutes and nothing.  It was the first time I ever felt horribly awkward going to a restaurant in my life.  Considering I didn't even get served I would give zero stars if possible.
