Gameplay is fun but horribly disorganized facility.

Bartenders are slow. We could have had 2 drinks before they even took our order.

No reservations taken unless you pay 50 dollars to skip queue, which we only found out late. 

Half the bays were open yet we were made to wait 2 and a half hours, after which we left.

Drinks were good, once we got them, food was decent except for the chips, which were disgusting. Like Doritos without flavoring.

Music was awful.

Typical Scottsdale douche baggery, except with no sense of business and lame customer service.

Prices are also on the high end making the experience even worse.
