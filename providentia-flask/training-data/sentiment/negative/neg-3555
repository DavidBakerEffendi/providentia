I am super disappointed in this place...I have bought French macarons from this place for a while now and most recently 2 weekends in a row I had never been told that if I needed to purchase more than 2 dozen I needed to give advance notice.  In fact I was in the store on 3/23 and purchased a dozen and asked if there was an issue if I came in and purchased 3 dozen and I was told no.  Now 3/24 I stop by to purchase 3 dozen and I am told that anything over 2 dozen needs to be requested at least 2 days in advance.  I am a business major and I understand having product on hand so that your case is not empty but I would never turn a customer away or even make it seem as if it were an issue because my product is being purchased instead of being thrown out.  I was told that this time I could purchase 3 dozen but for future I would have to place an order.  This isn't the type of customer service I enjoy and I can take my purchases else where this isn't the only place that sells French macarons.  I believe you need to re-evaluate what the purpose of your company is, are you wanting to make a profit or be left with inventory? Not to mention the lack of customer service, you may want to let all your staff know that any large orders need to have at least 48 hour notice because it doesn't seem to be common knowledge.
