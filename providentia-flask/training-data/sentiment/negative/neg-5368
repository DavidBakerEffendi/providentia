Overpriced meals and drinks ($8 for a beer?) plus service staff was too talkative and too slow in their actions. We also noticed the mixed drinks were watered down (twice,) and the tobacco had burned out within 20 minutes. Our friends that regularly go don't notice the high prices because they said the staff usually gives them hookups. But not tonight. My friends tobacco also burned or quickly we are not returning to this place with these prices and the quality of the tobacco. Another gripe I had was the seating, it's like a fire hazard waiting to happen.
