The food took 40 minutes to come out. The waitress messed up my order because she was talking to another waitress and giggling. When she gave me the wrong order. She put in a new order and I waited for another 40 minutes. She came to me and blamed the cooks and wanted me to know that the food taking so long is not her fault. After 2 hours, my mom asks them to give me a discount for making me wait a long. They come back and only discount $1. I wouldn't come here again. The staff is careless and slow even though they are fully staffed. The manager doesn't care much to do something about her waitresses when she sees these things go one around her
