If you get the blond waitress, run... She sucks and we had to order a water 4x because she kept forgetting. Took 30 min to get a beer. Kept giving us excuses that she got double sat... Welcome to the waitress world dip-shit. We are the customer & don't care about your problems. 

What's too bad, is the food we did receive, was actually good but we're now leaving to order Domino's; after telling her we were ready to order our dinner 3x she still forgot to come take our order.
