Well...when I've been wanting to eat here for quite a while since it has been listed as a Best of Las Vegas restaurant.  It was very busy in here as well so I had high hopes.  Let me start out by saying they have many choices for lunch which looked great.  The hot dog with Chili, Cheese and Onion spoke to me so I ordered that and it comes with French fries as well as a choice of Macaroni salad, potato salad or cucumber salad.  My husband got the Pastrami sandwich on Rye, which looks huge on the menu.  

Our food took about 25 minutes to get (something that is listed on the menu that I overlooked when ordering), unfortunately when it arrived I was highly disappointed with the first bite that I took.  When you order a hot dog with Chili you expect a hot steaming hot dog and chili.  Mine was cold.  The cheese that was put on it was a torn up cheddar cheese slice that wasn't even melted so that means when they put the hot dog together it was luke warm or cold to start out with.  The only plus was the french fries were nice and hot and crispy.  The potato salad had no flavor and unfortunately the pickle that came with the plate was sub par and kinda gross.  

My husband received his pastrami and it was dry and not nearly as big as they advertise.  

When walking out we decided to go look at the desserts and the bagels.  They look amazing but this place is all about nickel and diming you.  The menu states no sharing, there is a split plate fee of $2.00.  Also, if you want to order a bagel and cream cheese make sure you ask for a whole one other wise it is a $1.00 charge to cut it for you.  

I don't see myself going back to this place, the food wasn't all that great and I don't like having  "extra" charges for things that should come as part of the service; ex: slicing a bagel so I can eat it at the table.
