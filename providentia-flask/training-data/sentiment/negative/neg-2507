Dinner on a Wednesday night. We ordered 3 burgers and a kids grilled cheese. I had asked for a side salad with my burger. It was the best white vinaigrette salad dressing. That was the only good part of our meal. The salad was a plate of lettuce. No tomato, cucumber, not even a crouton to be found. Burgers arrived almost an HOUR later. They were dried out, and the buns were crappy and soggy from the meat siting there under the heat lamps for God knows how long (because the plates were hot... Meals weren't!). My husband ordered fries - waitress said there would be an up charge - got the bill - $6! For fries... That were super soggy and oily. Long of the short: cool, old decor. That's about it. Burgers were 12-15$ and way overpriced for the quality.
