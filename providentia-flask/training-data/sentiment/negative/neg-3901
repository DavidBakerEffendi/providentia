The restaurant is super unprofessional. The waiter didn't start the drink at the first. When we asked the drink option, he thought we just want water. I don't know if this is just laziness or the mistake. Then, the other waiter keep mess up the dishes we order. At last, the waiter didn't ask if we want separate check or together check and give us a together check for 9 people. The server is not polite at all. No please, no thank you. However, they still force us for tips. The dishes is really salty and not tasty. The overall experience is not pleasant. I don't recommend this restaurant.
