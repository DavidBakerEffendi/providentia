My son and I stopped in for a midnight breakfast last night. Three was only three women paying at the counter when we walked in so we knew the wait was short. After all, it doesn't take long to pay right? After listening to the cashier shoot the breeze with these women for about ten minutes my son asked her if we could seat ourselves, she said no, sit over there and pointed to the benches. After a couple more minutes I asked for the manager. Just then another server came up and the girl at the register told her "don't let these two guys in." Just then the manager came up, Was very polite and seated us. We explained what happen and then we ordered. Both of our short stacks of pancakes were Luke warm at best as was my meal.

Never again will I frequent this Dennys location.
