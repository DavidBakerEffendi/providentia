Stopped to eat steak and eggs at Sundance Cafe and to check out bass pro. Your people reading the menu so I went up to the counter to ask the server for a menu. She pointed and said the menus over there knowing fully well I couldn't read it because people were in front of it. I asked for a menu and she threw it at me. I asked if she had steak and eggs and she said yes can you show me she flipped open the page and through the menu back at me, then walked away. 
Her name is MJ And will probably spit in your food
