I cannot for the life of me see how this place got 4.5 stars. I have lived all over the US and this is by far the worst pizza place I have ever eaten in. I might as well get a piece of cardboard out of the trash bin and put some ketchup on it. The sauce was bland, noticeable lack of seasoning in general, cheese was not melted enough and the whole pizza fell apart when a slice was picked up. I have yet to find a go to pizza joint in Vegas! Grimaldi's I could give 3.5 stars but not one place could I even give a 4 star rating. If you know of a good pizza joint please message me. I am a pizza fanatic but suffering here in Vegas!
