I gave this place a chance to adjust, and wanted to try something different to make up for my last experience, and hope Mooyah could redeem itself. Well, it didn't do any good.

The burgers are so damn greasy it's almost criminal. You can expect your tray to be covered in grease. You can also taste it. I would bet the beef they use is more fatty, and I would think all the new employees (who seem like just kids) really have no concept of cooking skills and just ignorantly think "the more oil the better!". No. Just no.

I ordered, and made it very clear to them to not put ANY seasoning on ANYTHING. The dude cashing me out was very confused on that simple request and had a bit of apprehension as to how to do it. Not that hard, you make a note, or you turn around and tell them. Whatever.

I got the mint chocolate chip ice cream. I was really put off seeing this green clear liquid on the outside of my lid. Doesn't seem to be legit MCC ice cream if your using either green food coloring, or some kind of liquid mint. Either way it's really lame and completely ruined any credibility Mooyah has about offering quality milkshakes.

My food arrived, an item was missing, and my cheese just tasted off. Whatever. I couldn't taste very much with all that damn grease! Hoping to fix the over seasoning issue myself, it didn't help with the whole mess of a burger being either too fatty, too greasy, or a combination of both.

My stomach didn't feel good after, and not happy i spent 13$ for shit AGAIN, but, I'm sleeping better at night knowing that I am never returning to mooyah. I approached it differently and gave it another chance, and it just doesn't work.
