Service was very VERY snooty. Maybe it was just a bad day for the waiters but I would give 0 stars if it weren't for the food. Very unfortunate considering the bill came up to over 100$!!!
We were three at our table for lunch, two of us had the salmon tartare and my colleague took the steak frites.  Once we we were done our meal my colleague had a good portion leftover of fries and a little bit of her tartare left so she asked for them to pack up her food. The waiter looked at her, rolled his eyes and said alright. We stayed there for another hour so my colleague got the little chocolate tartelette and ice cream. Once we asked for the bill a different waiter came with the wireless machines, he explained to my colleague how she should cook her salmon once she got home to avoid any food poisoning (she was bringing some tartare back home). She thanked him for his advice and told him that was her intention in the first place. Let me add that he purposely spoke loud enough to make sure the tables next to us heard every word he said. Once the bill was paid, instead of handing my colleague's credit card back he literally threw it on the table, thanked us without making any eye contact and left. Let me add that restaurant had a couple of empty tables, so this wasn't a busy day or anything to rectify the service. I wouldn't go back.
