Very disappointing. Went today for lunch about an hour after they opened. Condiment selection did not look fresh, lettuce was mostly brown, pickles and tomatoes also looked quite sad. While waiting for our burgers, saw lady behind the counter 'tossing' the lettuce with tongs in an attempt to make it look fresher. Burgers had a burnt taste to them and were actually charred in places, bacon was cold. Fries were hardly warm and tasted old. They did make a fresh order of fries when we brought them back however the original order of fries we received should never have been served to us in the first place. This used to be our fav burger place, last 2 visits prior to today also disappointing and after today we will not be returning. 

We do not recommend this place something has changed.  We are rating one star and giving it 2 thumbs down.
