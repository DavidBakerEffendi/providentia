Like many reviewers, I used to love this place, and my experiences have steadily gone down hill. This used to be a place my friends and I would meet up and have a good time. However, even though the service has never been great, the last time we went, I was absolutely appalled by the conduct of our waiter.

First, the waiter did not come to our table for a very long time. Once he had, I asked him a question about the cheeses on the menu. Since this is a wine and cheese place, it seems like he should be semi-knowledgable about those two things. He said, more like snapped, "I don't know. I've never had them before." All I asked him was which cheese would be considered more mild. Then when he came back and friends of our were ordering, he started tapping his foot and his pen at us! Then he snapped, "Are you ready yet?" When my friend was trying to choose something he again snapped, "I'll just come back." This server was so incredibly rude I couldn't even believe it. We had chosen this restaurant and were spending a lot of money, and we were all so uncomfortable we couldn't even enjoy our time together. 

Finally, my husband, who never says anything to people, asked to see the manager. When the guy came out, the waiter ran over and started defending himself, and the manager did not even take care of the situation or apologize to our table or anything at all! This is really such a disappointment because this could be such a nice establishment, but it's really too much money to waste to feel nervous and uncomfortable the whole time. Too bad.
