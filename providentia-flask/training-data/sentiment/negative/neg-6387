I wish I can give a negative rating.  The WORSE service ever!  I was there for two hours for a terrible job with so call man/pedi that a five year old can do a better job!  Mani is nothing but a nail paint.  She didn't soak my hand, cut cuticles or even lotion my hand.  There're more nail polish on my fingers than on my finger nails same with my toes.  I had to walk her through the process.  At one point, I filed my own nails.  The lady was slower than snail.  I'm so angry right now!  If I was the owner I would be embarrassed!  How do you allow such horrible service?  How do you stay in business?  Are you paying attention to these reviews?  Ladies, please save your precious time and monies, DON'T GO THERE!!!!!
