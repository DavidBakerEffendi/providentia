I'm updating my previous review. In January, I rated Vintage 95 as 2 stars. I've changed my review to 1 star.

Regardless of the bad dinner experience I had on Christmas Eve, Vintage 95 has a great outdoor dining area that is very relaxed. Due to this, I decided that I'd give Vintage another chance with a large party. I wanted to host a 20 person bridal event. I submitted a request via the website to have an event coordinator get in touch with me. 5 days later, I still hadn't received a phone call or email. I decided to send a follow up email to try to get someone to contact me. At 7 pm that evening, the event coordinator finally called. I explained to her that I don't have a budget, and that I wanted my guests to have a beautiful unforgettable lunch. She said that she would send me a proposal right away the next day. 4 days went by, and I still hadn't received a proposal or any other form of communication from the event planner. This was actually pretty surprising to me, since during our phone call she told me at least 5 times that she loves to bring these types of events together and make things memorable.

At this point, I decided that I wasn't going to chase someone around to give them my money. I'd rather spend more money at a different restaurant to ensure that I'm going to be given the customer service I deserve as a patron. 

On August 8, I sent a message via Facebook to the restaurant, to explain my disappointment. I STILL haven't heard from a member of management or an owner. I know the message was read, because late the next evening the event planner left me a voicemail. She said that her boss called her to let her know I sent a message the day prior. Her exact words on my voicemail, "I know the proposal was very late but at least I got it to you today".......... Really?
