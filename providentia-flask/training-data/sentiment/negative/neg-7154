After a dinner at morels and a couple drinks on Fremont. Some friends and I went here and as we walked up to the door...the peasant doormen told me I was too drunk? I don't really know how they got that judgment...as I was nowhere near "too drunk" - I was still 100% coherent - I had my ID out ready to go. Lol. Anyways.... the poor boy door men I guess discriminate on people that look like they are having fun. Lol. Oh well...I feel bad about actually not reviewing the place itself. But when you have low life, peasants at the door that don't give a chance...it's hard. Lol. Anyway...maybe I'll get to go in one day.
