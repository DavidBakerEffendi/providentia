Quality has deteriorated significantly. First time I visited this place (year ago) , the burger was very juicy and fries were crispy and spicy!  Last weekend, I took my friends to this place saying all nice things about this burger joint. We ordered couple of burgers and fries and just after first bite, everyone looked at each other silently signalling that it was cold, bland tasteless and patty was burnt. 
Felt embarrassed.
