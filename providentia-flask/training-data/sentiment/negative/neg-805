Bought the Groupon deal and now understand why they have the Groupon. The salad bar had empty plates and no one was refilling. The items on there were cold cut and pickles. Nothing looked appetizing, soup pot was placed on a table next to salad bar. We drank ice teas instead of the wine the coupon came with but was charged for two ice teas, service taxes, groupon fee?? After buying the coupon and paying for all the fees ($90) it should have gone the Fogo or Texas de Brazil. 

All the people that gave this place a low rating, well they're true.
