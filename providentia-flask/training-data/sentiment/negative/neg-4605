The food was below average. The service is worthless. Our server didn't even care to be working at this place from my observation. She was rude, she forgot to put the order in, she didn't know the beer list. We had to wait 30 minutes for 1 sushi roll and a salad that we didn't even eat. I won't be coming back.
