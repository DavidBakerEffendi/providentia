Came in for a late dinner with my boyfriend for my birthday. Place was pretty dead for a Friday night. We were greeted and sat promptly. 
After being sat it was about a good 10min before we saw our waitress. She came and took our drink order, about another 10min and she come.back with the drinks but forgot the bring the bead so.we asked agen about another good 10min gos bye before we get out bread. 
She takes our order dosent came back not ones for the 30min wait till she brings our entry's. She forgot to put the cheese on the  broccoli and she alright out didint bring any of the things I asked for like lemons, extra butter, more water, more caramel sause ..... the list goes on. 
The food was very good. My t-bone stake was very yumi explosive taste was a little over cooked though for medium barley any pink. My server would have known this is she ever bothered to stop bye our table and ask, I guess its asking to much for  some one to do there job. I was a server not that diffucult. We also ordered a side of lobster those were pretty great, would have been greater if I got the lemons asked for several times. 

Sad you guys actually have really good food but due to the poor lack of service I definitely don't think we'll be returning customers.
