Very cool decor although it was really dark inside. I had the fire roasted chicken... Chicken on top of mashed potatoes that taste instant and diced tomatoes.. all together I think the potatoes and tomatoes were weird together and just didn't taste that great. Disappointed, maybe I should have tried something else. Not a fan of pita bread that is why i tried the chicken. Staff could have been a little more accommodating too...
