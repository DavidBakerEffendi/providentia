I visited this location today and the customer service there was horrible. No greeting or anything. I was look at the menu and didn't see the smoothies asked the cashier what flavors do they have and  she just started at me like I didn't ask her a question. She didn't ask if I was dinning in or taking out and when she brought my food she just slide it on the table and walked away. This was the worse experience ever!!
