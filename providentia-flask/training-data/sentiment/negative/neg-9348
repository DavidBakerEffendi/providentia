Literally the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to. I'm shocked this place has 3 stars. My husband enjoys buffets so I allowed him to drag me here, but I will not be returning. 

-Execution of everything was poor. Sushi was mushy. Vegetables limp and overlooked. All sauces were too sweet and most tasted the same. Some items had no flavor at all. Just mush and a colorant. 

-Nothing on the buffet was hot. Nothing. It wasn't even warm. I have no idea how this hasn't failed a health inspection. 

-The ice cream variety was nice. But the amount of kids hanging into the case and slobbering into it was disconcerting.
