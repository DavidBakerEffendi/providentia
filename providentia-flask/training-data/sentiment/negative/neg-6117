We have ordered twice from Lin & Louie's using UberEats and the first time wasn't so bad but we ordered again last night and only basing this off of the food and it was awful! We ordered the lettuce wraps, chicken fried rice and tom kha gai soup. I started my meal with the lettuce wraps and the piece of lettuce was sooooo small it only held one spoonful of mixture. I moved onto my soup and talk about mushroom overload! Once I got to a bit of chicken something tasted off. The entire time I was eating it the chicken tasted funny but thought it might be because it was in the soup broth. My boyfriend had the lettuce wraps and the fried rice. He also only had one lettuce wrap as it was so small and super salty. His fried rice was also super salty and he couldn't even finish it. Skip to a few hours later and my stomach was making all kinds of sounds....well, guess what...I got sick! My stomach has been messed up for 12 hours now and I know it was from the chicken in the soup. This was extremely disappointing and we will not be ordering again.
