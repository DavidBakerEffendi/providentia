If you enjoy Salt and Lousy Service then this is the spot for you.

Honestly, I'm not sure why people are so hype about this place.  Yes the Salsa is spicy but really has no taste to it.  it's like Spicy water.  Everybody in our party of 7 did not even eat a quarter of their meal.

The Machaca that i had must have been Marinated, Aged and Cooked in Salt using a Rock Salt Oven and to make matters worse the servers were no where to be found to refill our refreshments as our mouth dried like Cured Hides.

This place should have been called Los "Sal" Molinos and should have stayed a Funeral Home and use the large amount of Salt they use for Embalmment.

Currently competing with Morton for the #1 spot as Salt distributor in the South West Region.
