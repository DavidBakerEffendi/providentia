I've never done this before and usually brush off any bad experiences I have. This location was beautifully set up, and had an awesome happy hour and maybe it had something to do with it being busy ? I have to say I was pretty embaressed I invited some people here to have drinks and dinner I had probably the worst all around service I've ever had. They were either under staffed or the waitress we had was miserable but mmm we had three different waitresses and they were all the same miserable! Sorry to you loyal customers but I will never go back:(
