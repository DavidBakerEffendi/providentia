Used to come here all the time. Just went here this week for lunch had absolutely the worst service I've ever had. The waiter was basically throwing our food on the table no personality at all. Never got refills on drinks. Ordered pasta with chicken and the pasta came out with no chicken. 20 minutes later he decides to bring the chicken ... I told him we were done eating - didn't want the chicken alone?! Then came the bill .. Total did not have the chicken on it so I gave my card - then he ran my card for a totally different total ( charging me for the chicken I never got !!) Total thievery !i got the manager involved who did nothing but told me the reversed charge on my card would take up to 3 days to come off ?! Really ... 
Sucks ! They don't take care of their customers and don't resolve problems when the fault  is clearly theirs. I was told I would receive something by email to compensate me of course I never received it
