Decided to go here before the Zumanity show and was extremely disappointed. We came in for happy hour with the expectation of getting a decent drink and it was not the case. The margarita was extremely sour and distasteful. I ordered another drink that include a strawberry mix and it was not good at all. The waitress had the margarita remade, however it was still horrible. Unfortunately I wouldn't go back.
