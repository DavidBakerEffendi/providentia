This place has not changed at all, I gave it a second chance and it kept disappointing as bad service and food again, spending my money in some place else and real Mexican food thankfully, and the Gabriel guy send me a message trying to make me look as a mean customer, that's not how you treat your customers!!! Thankfully  I won't make business here ever again! Please Find a good place for your money and time, there's plenty of good Mexican places around Arizona. Thx.
