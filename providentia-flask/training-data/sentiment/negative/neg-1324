maybe we came in on the wrong day and time, but since reviews were so nice and this place is rated 4.5 stars we had our high hopes coming in to pick up our order. first off it was not busy maybe one table and we walked in all excited and not one person said hello. we said hi kindly and excitedly and got a 'hey' from like a bunch of workers staring at us. my bf than says here to pick up  our order? the casher goes, YEAH HOLD ON IM PUTTING SOMETHING IN. dang, sorrrrrrrrry! so we stood there just waiting and minutes later he finally goes whats your name my bf answered steven than he turns to the other faces standing around and tells them to get our order. there was an older man behind us sitting down he looked nice and was prob the owner, he than says hi to us and thanks us for coming in which was cool. but at that point we already felt the extremely rude vibe from everyone working up front. thats the service part, food part i got the antipasto with grilled chicken salad. grilled chicken was extremely overcooked. i could barely bite it very dry. salad wasn't that great either i ended up giving more than half to my dogs (no lie)... pizza wise my bf got half supreme and half pepperoni. him and baby bros said it was pretty good. i had two bites and agree it was decent but at that point the salad already had me feeling effy inside. i ended up eating cereal afters to fulfill my hunger. would not be returning here, sorry!
