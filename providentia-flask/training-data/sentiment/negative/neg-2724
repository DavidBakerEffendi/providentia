Walked in and ordered veggie fried rice.

Cashier took my $5 and gave me change.

He then proceeds to go to the kitchen and grab ingredients to cut up for the fried rice.

I yelled back to him that he shouldn't be touching food after handling money without washing his hands.

He walks back and washes his hands and then starts cutting the veggies.

I grabbed he change and told him to give me my $5 back.  He did and I left.

Kitchen full of other workers and nobody said anything.

The people in this establishment don't even have the basic common sense to keep their hands clean.

Avoid this place if you have any standards.
