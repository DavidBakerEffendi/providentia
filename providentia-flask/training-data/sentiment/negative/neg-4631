Hadn't been here in years and wanted to come back because I had good memories of this place being really good. However, we were very disappointed. The quality and taste of the food had diminished and the service was a bit odd. The server wasn't attentive and the taste of the food we ordered (chicken vindaloo- bland; samosa- disappointing; and lamb curry- bland) were not what we remembered it being. Will not be coming back here anymore. At least there's many Indian restaurants around the valley to try...
