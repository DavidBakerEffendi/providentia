It was my first time visiting the noodles & company and I couldn't decide on what I wanted right away.. the lady that was helping my friend, was giving me suggestions when a gentleman came up and was trying to rush me into making my decision. I made my decision and he told me that I wouldn't like it so I changed my mind again. The gentleman had a very rude tone with me and was pretty much yelling at me. I said that I couldn't have mushrooms when trying to make my decision on what I wanted but received mushrooms in my meal anyways. Just an all around bad experience. I didn't even enjoy my meal after the rude customer service.
