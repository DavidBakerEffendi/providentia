I normally love Denny's and was thrilled to see this one right in the parking lot of my hotel.  Perfect!  I went over the first evening of my stay.  It was later - likely 8 pm ish. There weren't many customers in the restaurant but the service was incredibly slow.  I was seated at the counter and had to wait several minutes before anyone even asked if my order had been taken.  I ordered coffee (which was never refilled after the first cup), and a build your own slam.  The food sat on the counter (heat lamps were not on) for a while before it was given to me so it was cool.  Then I had to personally reach over the counter to get my own silverware, and had to hunt someone down in order to pay.  I was in town for a week.  I never went back....
