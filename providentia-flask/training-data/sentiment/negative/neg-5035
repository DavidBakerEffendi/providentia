Waited almost 30 minutes to initially get waited on at our table outside. Gave us waters without asking. People that got seated after us got served their beers before us. Got our burger 30 mins after and still no beers.... Server blamed bartender for being "backed up". It's a Wednesday night and it's not even half way packed. Horrible service.
