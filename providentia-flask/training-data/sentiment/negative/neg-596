OK. I am in the restaurant business as I always say. Pinoy's Bisto is the worst restaurant I have dined at in at least 25 years. It will NOT make it 1 year. That is a guarantee. I totally get authentic Asian food.. I lived in San Francisco for 8 years and experienced Authentic Asian cuisine regularly. Everything from design, set up service and food is just wrong. Mark my words This is just BAD. It is doomed...I am NEVER wrong about this when I predict a failed restaurant....Never !!!!
