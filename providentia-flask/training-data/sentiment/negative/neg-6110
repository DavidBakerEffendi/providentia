I was extremely disappointed with the food... Not one item was great. I enjoyed the Asian section the most, but again, it wasn't great. All other areas were simply bad! Including the sweats area & that's hard given that I love sugar. I was truly disappointed and I feel like I waisted my money and ate things to keep trying to find something good unsuccessfully.
