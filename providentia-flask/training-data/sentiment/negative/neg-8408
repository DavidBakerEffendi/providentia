My husband and I were in the neighborhood looking for something to eat for dinner.  I saw on Yelp that Sammy's was nearby, and was also surprised that it only had three and a half stars.  We have a Sammy's by our house and love it!  Let me just say, I am not surprised anymore.  We walked in around 6:30... It should have been packed.  The one by our house always is for dinner, especially on a Saturday night.  It was dead, but we already knew we liked the food, and figured the wait wouldn't be long since they weren't busy.  WRONG.

We never got to eat the food, because we didn't even order.  We sat there, in the empty restaurant for over 10 minutes, and weren't even looked at by the four waiters and waitresses just hanging out in the kitchen.  The manager was standing off to the side of the kitchen, chatting it up with yet another waiter.  Eventually, a waiter came by once he was flagged down by another table.  He walked by us twice, without even a glance.  Granted, he may not have been assigned to our table.  Then, the manager walks the room.  She gives us a quick glance, and keeps walking back to the kitchen where all of the wait staff is having a grand time.

At this point, my husband and I are out.  The manager sees us heading toward the door, runs after us, and asks us if she can help with anything.  Uh, yeah... How about a waiter or waitress?  We tell her why we are leaving, and she asks if she can take our order, drink order.  Uh, yeah, NO.  If you think I'm exaggerating, there were three other tables occupied in the whole restaurant.  Ridiculous.
