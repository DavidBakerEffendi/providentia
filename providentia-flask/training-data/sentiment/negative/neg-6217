I've been to this Resturant couple times and they did fair job. Today, Cobb Salad came out with a dead fly. Manger took the cobb salad off the bill but it was disgusting having to look at a dead fly and having to leave to go to another Resturant for lunch was just not acceptable! Plus if your sitting outside on patio you will get attacked by so many flys as well!!! Not happy the experience will not return.
