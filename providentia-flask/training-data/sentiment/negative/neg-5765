I do NOT recommend this place at all!  I had placed an order from these people because they were the only place open early in the morning, and man do I regret it! They never confirmed my order through eat24 so I requested it to be cancelled, which to so surprise there was no response either! So guess what comes knocking at my door at 11am? These guys! I had fto order from a different place  and me thinking it's the people I reordered from and gave them almost $30 when my first order was only 17.. When I called and let them know I didn't want their order anymore all they said was "you got your order, so it was confirmed!" Uhh NOO I can show you the text I got that the order was left unconfirmed since they could not reach you! Now I'm stuck with two orders, one that I'm not going to eat and I'm out $30.. Very rude people.
