This was a total disappointment! My friends and I needed a late night meal after rehearsal. It was 5 of us and I placed my takeout order first. I was told it would take 15-20 minutes so we went to the bar to get a drink. Sat there for 10 minutes and no one ever acknowledged us. So I go back up front to wait. 

My order - bacon cheeseburger with potato wedges. The menu said all burgers were cooked medium well. 

40 minutes after placing my order and everyone else had their food. I requested a refund. The server checked on my order and brought it out. My burger was well done and there were French fries instead of potato wedges. While he went to get my wedges, my anger increased and I requested the manager to get a refund. 

We also witnessed seated customers have to see the manager to get someone to take their order. Additionally, there were multiple empty tables that weren't bussed. Tables that were that way for the entire 45 minutes we were there.  

I come to Cleveland once a year and always stay in this area. I know never to come here again.
