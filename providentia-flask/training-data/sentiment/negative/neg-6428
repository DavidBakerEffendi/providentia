I came here with my boyfriend who already stuffed himself with food before he picked me up after my work. I specifically told the server I was the only one eating when the server sat us down. However, when I ordered only one dish, she told me each person has to order 1 dish and that was their last exception. I had come here before and know their food was good but that was just rude to tell your customer how many dishes they have to have, especially when I told you from the beginning the other person is not eating (and I mean he didn't even touch their cutlery). I have been to countless restaurants in my life and countless time where I or the other person was there for the company only and not the food; yet this is the first that gave me such attitude. That was the most awkward meal I have ever had in my life and we'll never ever come back to such a money hungry business.
