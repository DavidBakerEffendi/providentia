A sad day for the Chinese food lovers of Pittsburgh.  Although I live in Cleveland these days, we'd still make excuses to pass through Pgh anytime we were within 50 miles, strictly to hit Mekong.  But last night we were in for a rude surprise.  First off, we called while still a couple hours out, and got a strange voice on the other end of the line.  Well, maybe they hired someone new.  Then when we got there, we noticed a subtle change in the decor.  And the menus were different.  But most importantly, no Theresa or her husband to greet us.

Things went downhill from there.  I ordered my usual, kung pao chicken, which I order at such pyrotechnic levels of heat, it would make a grown man cry.  But Theresa and I had come to an understanding over the years, such that when I walked in the door, she'd go to the kitchen door and yell, "HEY, MOM....IT'S THAT CRAZY GUY!!!"  I got it with hot 'n' sour soup, another slice of Mekong yumminess.

The soup was obviously wrong, but not unpleasant.  Nowhere near as good as normal.  Then came the kung pao, which not only wasn't spicy (by my standards), it was just....wrong.  Like the stuff you'd get from the worst kind of generic Chinese restaurant.  Nothing special about it at all.  My wife got her usual, broccoli and chicken lo mein, and it was awful.  I tasted it, and while my kung pao was no better or worse than average Chinese fare, hers was like what you'd get at the mall food court.  Horrible.

On top of everything else, the prices are all higher than what Mekong used to charge, so now you're paying more money for below-average Chinese.  I don't know what happened to the original family...since we only hit Mekong about once every couple months now, we never heard anything.  Does anyone have any information?  Did they move and hopefully start a restaurant elsewhere?  Did something happen to the chef, Theresa's mom?  What gives???

RIP Mekong.  Our most salient reason to visit Pgh is now gone.
