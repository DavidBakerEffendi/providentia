This place has really has the worst customer service ! The manager and his staff are rude and obnoxious. And it's not just a one-off occurrence. 
They have also screwed up my order several times.
Read the other reviews, they all complain about pathetic customer service at this particular location. 
Avoid this place unless you really want to spoil your early mornings and start off with a bad feeling in your stomach.
