Great beer, average food, terrible management. The owner told us we couldn't play cribbage (cards) because it appeared we were gambling, which is illegal. We clearly weren't gambling, most pubs even provide cards for their customers. I've also known a handful of people to work there and they've all said the owner (Atef) treats staff poorly, especially women. It's a shame because they have a great beer selection.
