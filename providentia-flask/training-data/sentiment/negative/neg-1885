This place is absolutely horrible and disgusting.

First off the food is not cheap, many authentic korean and japanese restaurants are cheaper and have better quality food.

The food is gross, the rice is dry and the salad is limp. Yes they got the katsu right, but that was the only thing eaten on my plate. The bed of bean sprouts it lays on top of is just sad. They also put some sauce on the rice which sits in a bowl on the counter with a gigantic brush to drip onto the rice. I wonder how old and how long the sauce has been sitting there out in the open.

The cashier/server turned me off from the food the most. Constantly scratching his arms and head and then proceeding to handle the rice, sauce and vinegar...  I used to work in food services and this is a definite no-no. Wash your hands man.

Never coming here again unless I want a san pelligrino, and that is definitely all I'm getting.
