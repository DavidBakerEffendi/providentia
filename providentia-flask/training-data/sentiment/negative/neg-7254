We will go from two to three times per week to ZERO after this evening. The register staff was nasty when I questioned why we were charged for carbonated water. Their answer, "it's a fountain drink because it has syrup in it." Seriously? I responded that we have been here repeatedly and only once have we been charged and they took it off the bill. The response, "well they should have been charging for it all along." Buh bye Manhattan Deli. We have been loyal patrons since you were on Chardon Road. We will never come again. Your food is still good, but your staff has gone downhill to the point that we can no longer tolerate the incompetence. There are plenty of restaurants in this area who will take our money- and not charge for incidentals like sofa water.

Update: we decided to give MD another chance. Staff is better... Husband was craving matzo-ball soup!
