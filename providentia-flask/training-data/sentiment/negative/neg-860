Ricardo the manager is rude and there Google place is misleading. When you google tilt studio tempe Google says they close at 11. We buy two unlimited cards go eat pizza at there facility, then the microphone says they close in 10 minutes (10pm). I inform Ricardo that there google page says they close at 11 and he was just rude. Instead of apologizing or saying they will fix it he acts likes its my fault and gives me a attitude and says how I should have went to there website for the correct hours.
