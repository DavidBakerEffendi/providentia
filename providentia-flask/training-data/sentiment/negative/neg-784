I remember outback being much better overall.  

Porterhouse had WAY too much salty seasoning on it.   

I ordered the side salad and there was hardly any dressing on it.  Seemed like a teaspoons worth.  My husband even asked where the dressing was when they brought it to me lol. He was being serious.  

Fries were not the best fries I have had.  Not even mediocre.  

And the breaded shrimp I ordered was disappointing.   Small and Soggy.    They don't even serve tarter sauce.   

Server went to take plate away from one of us that appeared to still be eating ( there was food still on the plate ) without asking if we were done.   Felt rush at the end.  

I was really looking forward to our dinner.  And left disappointed for the first time from an outback.  I haven't eaten at one in a long time and may not for a long while.
