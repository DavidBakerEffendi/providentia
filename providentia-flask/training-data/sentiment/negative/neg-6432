Live in Antiquity so was very excited about Crafty Burgers.  First time food was good but service was terrible.  Visited 4 times since.  Onion rings very greasy. Ran out of fries!!  Slow although they were not busy.  A mess in the kitchen.  Sat in last booth and floors were very dirty.  Hope they get their act together!!!
