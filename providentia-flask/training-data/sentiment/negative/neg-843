Total disappointment... This place WAS going to get a great review. 

I've encountered the Simple Greek three times thus far. The first time was great! They were apart of a delivery service, and it was so awesome to have great Greek food delivered to my door. The chicken was overcooked, but I still enjoyed the gyro.

So... Of course I wanted to order again. I put an order in on Mr. Delivery through the Eat24 app. Typically, it takes some time for actual restaurants to deliver the food, but no big deal. By the time my 'estimated delivery time' came about, I get a phone call from Mr. Delivery... They've called to tell me the restaurant isn't currently taking delivery orders, and my money would be refunded... Okay, I understand, maybe someone was short staffed on the restaurant side or the delivery side. I was disappointed, and still hungry... But not angry.

A couple days go by, and I figured there's no way that hiccup can happen again. So this time I ordered Mr. Delivery through GrubHub. At least they didn't wait for my delivery time to call to say the restaurant will not deliver. 

I guess the restaurant decided to not participate in the delivery game any longer... That's cool, but maybe have your vendor take the restaurant off of their websites, so customers don't place orders. Both times- I prepaid with my credit card and included the tip. Which I normally do since I'm a frequent online food orderer. 

Long story short, I'm out $45, yes $45 until the whole bank processing time is completed...  and HUNGRY! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT ONLINE.
