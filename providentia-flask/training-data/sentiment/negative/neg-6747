ignored my call for over 20 minute.  Hung up on after 1st 10min and never got to speak to anyone. Immediately called back and got stuck on hold all the way to closing time (11pm Sunday night).

I get it. Its late and want to get home. ANSWER your phone then and tell folks you aren't taking anymore carry out orders OR adjust your vmail greeting to say the kitchen isn't taking anymore orders.

Will NEVER order from this location again
