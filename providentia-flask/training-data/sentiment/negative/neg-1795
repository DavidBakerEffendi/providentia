Horrible service.  Went in to this restaurant with my pregnant wife and I.  As I told them table for two I saw plenty of open tables, the owner/manager then told me "you two can sit at the bar not in the restaurant".  I then asked him why is that and his response was "if you don't like it you can leave  Never been so disrespected in my life.  But thankfully I went to Delmonicos at the strip were my money was appreciated
