Have been there many times for dim sum and was always great. First time for dinner and the service was so bad!! Will not be back. 

Glasses were dirty with food stuck on them and fingerprints everywhere. Pretty scary. 

Felt like it was such a hassle to have us eat there. The wait staff constantly reach over you to serve or take away things from the table. It was an experience I won't forget anytime soon
