It seems to be busy and while tables are full they hand us our glass liter of water and glasses. Along with our plates and silverware. Theres no where to sit so i ask if im supposed to just hold our entire dinner table they handed to us and wait until food comes out with no where to go. Why they didnt care at all or have a method of dealing with situations like these are beyond me. If anything they were very rude even. They didnt care at all and i left unhappy after already tipping them while ordering. Horrible service.
