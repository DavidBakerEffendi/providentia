I have the pick 3 with catfish and double oysters. And it came with two sides. Which didn't come out until 10 mins after the fish and oysters?.?. The fish tasted like the freezer, the sweet potato fries were old and the Caesar salad was not a Caesar salad. It had blue cheese and cooked red peppers which is not normal. And when I let my waitress know that I didn't like the salad. She did nothing. I will never come back.
