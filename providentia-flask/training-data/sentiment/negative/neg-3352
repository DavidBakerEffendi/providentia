We never have GREAT service here but today we couldn't even get service. We walked into a thick smell of paint and when we were seated we noticed patches all over the walls and the smell of paint was even stronger at our table. We looked at the menu and decided what we were ordering and processed to watch other tables finish their meals and pay their checks while we were still waiting to order our drinks. We ended up getting up and leaving and going to Red Lobster down the street. I can't believe this location would remain open during a remodel and provide this level of service. I sat for at least 10 minutes inhaling paint fumes to leave still hungry. I know you get what you pay for but it's sad when I can't even order my cheap crappy meal.
