Terrible customer service and seems someone skipped cleanliness school. Our rude usher/waiter led us to a dirty table - food remains on the table, floor and chairs still there and gave a condescending laugh when we requested a different table. Not sure PGA Tour did restaurants because they should stick to golf. 
Now the second table top was just cleaned, but still wet onto which he plops down two paper menus which now are firmly stuck to the damp surface. Luckily not as many food remains around our chairs. 

Do yourself a favor and eat at a fast food joint in the terminal of which there is more than a couple. 

Our server who actually brought us the check was ok though.
