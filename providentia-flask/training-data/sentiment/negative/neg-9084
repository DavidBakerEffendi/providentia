Wouldn't recommend to anyone, food is bland, not fresh, dsnt feel like anything close to east Indian food, in face, my 5 yr old boy would probably cook it better than them. 
I don't see myself coming close to them again. 
I'm going regularly to east Indian places, this one is probably the worst I've ever tried.
