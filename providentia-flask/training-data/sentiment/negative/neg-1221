Cafeteria style now, but more confusing.  You pay for what you pick out and put on your tray, but you can't do little portions as you could in the buffet - so do you really want to pay X amount extra for that macaroni 'n cheese?  The new theme of pre-sorted menu items and portions is a loser for me, and I'd wager it will be for many who liked the old format.  Plus it is incredibly confusing as you look at the menu with some items having large price tags like $7-9 but then some having smaller ones like $2 or so because some are add-ons and others are straight up entree portions.  They've gone so far as to have a dedicated explainer working at the front to help you understand it, and offer you a walk-through the restaurant in case you're still confused.  The fact that they anticipated this problem and had to come up with this as a solution is itself a problem.

Won't be going back.
