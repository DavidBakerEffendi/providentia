I went to Kneaders on Baseline in Gilbert today. After a lackluster French dip with lukewarm bullion I went to order dessert. I decided on the carrot cake. The frosting was rock hard. I brought it to the managers attention. He went to check the other 2 on display and the same. He said, I'll get some from the back. He came back and said, "these are fresh from the freezer"......uhhh come again....fresh from the freezer??? That's not fresh. When I asked he said they were made the day before, and the frosting was.....you guessed it, hard!! I can go to the Safeway bakery next door and get a dessert made that day with soft frosting. I've tried this place on a few different occasions and I'm done. It's absolutely nothing special.
