We bought some small spinach pastries to go.  They were pre-wrapped, without date or indications of any kind.  When I got home I removed plastic wrap and the sides had alot of mold.   Terrible.  If a business is going to pre-wrap pastries, they have to put some date on the package, so they can ensure some quality level they are giving customers.  Very simple, glaring error.

We had eaten there earlier in the night, and the eat-in food was ok.  

FWIW, the restaurant on Yonge and Dundas is better.
