Too many homeless people come here.  I've been waiting for 30 minutes for a table.  This place is packed full of homeless people watching football, and not one to f them is eating.  I'm looking at 3 booths that have only one person in each.  Out of those three booths, only one person has food.  The other two people have a single beer each, and they are not drinking them.  I counted 20 tables and booths and only 5 of them have food.  I don't know how this place is still in business.  This place only gets one star because of the pure stupidity of the owner not cycling people through his/her restraint.  This is definitely the last time I ever come here.  I suggest that if your hungry, go to a restaurant that does not allow a single person to occupy an entire table and only order water!
