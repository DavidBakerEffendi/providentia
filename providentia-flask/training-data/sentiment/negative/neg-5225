If I could give zero stars, I would. Worst service in Vegas I have ever received. No direction, over priced drinks, and only one of the 5 bars had people working, and even at that one that was open, they had no idea what was going on. We got seated after the 50 other people that came in AFTER we were put on the list. We left shortly after finally reminding them that we needed seated. Worst place ever please save your time and head further down the strip.
