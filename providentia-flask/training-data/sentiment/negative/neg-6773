Over priced for organic. Their menu used to be affordable but then I guess cabbage must be at an all time high. It's a blend of organic hipsters and old people that clutter the place and if you're lucky enough to find a self servicing seat you might find yourself on a random open mic night that totally kills your one on one time with anyone you brought there. Yeah its organic and all that fancy stuff and it is good but unless you are going for coffee and happen to be there at the same time for lunch then take your ass somewhere else down the road.
