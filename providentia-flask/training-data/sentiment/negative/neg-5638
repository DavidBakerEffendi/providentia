Well this was an odd experience. 

My girlfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for a while. We finally made it there for a Friday dinner. Upon entering, the man made a gesture towards the restaurant. We walked in but must have still looked confused because he told us to sit wherever we'd like. 

I was pretty excited. It smelled great and we were both very hungry. We took a seat and waited for the service. It never came. After about ten minutes, I walked to the front and grabbed two to-go menus. There was a lady behind the counter but she never acknowledged us. We figured the to-go menu was pretty similar to the real menu so we took 5 or 10 minutes looking it over and deciding what we would like. Still, no one had acknowledged us at our table. 

After a while another couple had walked in, been given a menu and waters. My girlfriend suggested we leave but I wanted to wait around. I was more curious than anything. The one waitress took other orders, refilled drinks, brought out food, but we just sat there. Completely ignored. 

The waitress never came and my hunger got the better of my patience. After about a half hour, we left. I tried to make eye contact with any employee but they all looked away. 

We left the restaurant laughing at the weirdest dining event we have had in a while. 

I guess we won't be going back?
