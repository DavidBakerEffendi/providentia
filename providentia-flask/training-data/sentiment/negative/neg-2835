So this store made our sandwiches wrong, the delivery guy argued with us and then took our sandwiches back; delivering the right ones 40 minutes later. While we ate our chips, pickles and drank our half spilt Dr Pepper. 
It's always an argument with them, so we filed a complaint and spoke to a nice guy at corporate who offered to make it up to us and buy our meals.
Really nice right? We place our order, exactly the same as the one we ordered before and always order. AGAIN it's an argument, just the sandwiches were to be free but the whole meal was messed up with the Dr Pepper half in the bag and eating a pickle and chips as the dinner. I don't have time to argue with people over something SO STUPID!
This place is absolutely horrible! I will order pizza for my employees and never again eat here! I highly recommend you skip Jimmy Johns!
