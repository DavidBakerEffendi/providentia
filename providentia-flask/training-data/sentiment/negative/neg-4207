The staff is rude and the owner is rude too. Service is extremely slow and we felt like were left forgotten.  When having a beer waiting for the food, the manager came and grabbed our condiments in such a rude manner without any explanations. We figured they probably thought we were not ordering food, so went and told the waitress that we are waiting for the fish and chips please don't take the condiments.  What shocked us was their rude attitude. The first waitress asked "what's the big deal if you don't have food on your table"?? The manager came later and lectured us again " what is the big deal if there is no food on your table"?, she went on that she had been there managing for 20 years and we only there for 15 minutes therefore she knew it better than us ... excuse me... first we were waiting for the beers and food for almost an hour and secondly no respectful bar/restaurant manager would ever talk to customers in such a rude manner. 

Furthermore, the so called owner came out defending his employees again questioning his customers what the big deal was. Although we informed repeatedly the attitude was the problem sadly he did not appear to understand.  

There are issues with This bars service standards and we do not recommend. Bad review.
