Decided to grab a bite to eat after going out one night. We seated ourselves at a booth, and a group of people that were waiting for their bill told us to not sit in the section because it was bad service. We made the wrong decision and ignored the group and sat down. After waiting about 5 minutes,  our waitress came to the table to get our drink order. After another 5 minutes, our drinks finally arrived and she took our order. 10 minutes went by, and our waitress came back and told us she had lost our order and wanted to know what we wanted again! She never apologized, and acted like it wasn't a big deal. Our food finally arrived after an other 10 minutes. Our waitress never came back to check up on us, and never re-filled our drinks. I had to stop another waiter to get us water. Once it was time to get our bill, we went to the cashier area and asked a different waitress if we could have our bill because our waitress went missing. We wanted to split the bill on two cards, and she said she couldn't do that.
