If there was an option for ZERO this would've been it. My boyfriend and I went in for the Portobello mushroom burger during lunch...he orders it and was told they run out of the bread. We ask if there was anything for our inconvenience....the MANAGER comes out and says no. He says they ran out and can't discount the meal. He didn't even apologize for not having the bread. Fine we said. I ordered the 10 pieces nugget instead.  The food came out cold and the nuggets taste like it's been sitting out since this morning.  Bad service!..,check!  Cold food!...check!  Not coming to this location again.
