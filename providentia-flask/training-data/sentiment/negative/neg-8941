I added this location just so I could tell you how much I hate it. I first went with my boyfriend just after it opened on a Sunday afternoon before I had to go to work. We ordered 2 burgers, 2 poutines and 2 drinks. It was like $30, should have been the first sign. We went about 45 min early so that way I wouldn't be late, even though, I just work down the road. It took us 15 min to even get to the cashier to order, she was all alone and tr place was jammed. After waiting 30 min I decided I should probably head to work and get my boyfriend to drop off the food once it was ready. By the time it arrives 15 min later it was all cold. The cheese for the poutine hadn't even melted. We were both really disappointed. I wrote to head office telling them my experience sucked and in true
form they sent me a $20 gift card. One day I forgot my dinner and headed over on my break for something to eat, gift card in hand. There was only one person ahead of me so I figured it would be fairly quick, boy was I wrong!!! The cashier took forever with the people ahead of me, the people who were supposed to be COOKING my dinner were standing there chatting talking about some flyer that had been given to them with - get this - the owners wife instead of doing their job. There was a new guy training that once my food came it took him 5 min to bag it - poor guy I actually felt bad for him. By the time I gr back to work I was 8 minutes past my 30 min break. What the hell people!! I just hate this place, I will never go back.
