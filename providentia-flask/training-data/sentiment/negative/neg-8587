Management absolutely needs some serious training! I had a long hair in my rice/cheese. You could tell that whatever it was that the hair was imbedded in what I was about to eat. The young lady who said she was the manager took my plate and told me it looked like my hair! Not once an apology-- only an attitude! Wouldn't it make sense if the hair was just on the plate?... It appeared as though the hair was cooked into the clump! 
Please store owners require some education or educate your staff on customer service. She brought me another plate and still didn't apologize. She just told me how there were no females in the kitchen, so, how the hair got in there was uncertain. 
I did decline. I just couldn't trust what was done to the food... Sad too, because there are hungry people in our communities.
Again, the hair was clumped into rice/cheese.... Oh well! I was really looking forward to the carnitas! 
I will not return!
