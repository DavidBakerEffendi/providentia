Sorry, Capriotti's. You get the crummy review today. My company had me 'just swing by and pick up' FOUR SANDWICHES that had been called in on my way back from a meeting. Flash forward 55 minutes and sixty bucks later and I'm still in the shop, having watched at least twelve other customers walk out with their food, some of which came in and ordered in-house. Not sure what takes four sandwiches so long to make or why so many others were served before me... but there I was. Finally got my sandwiches, rolled out and back to a very hungry team. One bite of my roast beef and I knew there was no way I was finishing it. It was the driest sandwich I've ever had in my life. I've had mouthfuls of sand that had more moisture. Another coworker had the same sentiments. After FOUR phone calls over the next 3 days with no manager on site, but four promises to have one call me back, Capriotti's gets the crap review. This was my first and last visit to this restaurant. I'm sure others have had great experiences here, but I'm not willing to flush $15 a sandwich when there are other options. Lookin' at you, Sunset location...
