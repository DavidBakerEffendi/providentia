Here now. We ordered a tapsilog, bangsilog and tortang talong. Tapa wasn't good. Can't go wrong with fried fish and eggs. The fried rice seemed like white steamed rice topped with fried garlic and peanuts (ewwww). Plus it was soggy rice. But why I gave this place 1 star, and not at least 2? My tortang talong came out like 25 minutes after our silog meals came out. We were already so full. It was also flavorless. Never coming back again. Sticking to Tina's Filipino Cuisine for Southwest Filipino food.
