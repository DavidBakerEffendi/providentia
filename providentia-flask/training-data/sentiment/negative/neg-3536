Place was empty on holiday morning. Should have known. Wife thought coffee was too strong & bitter.  I was ok with it. I got a skillet.  Potatoes could have been cooked longer, gravy thicker with more flavor other than flour,  & over easy eggs were way undercooked. Wife's banana bread french toast was ok.  They gave us the wrong bill. They had a 1 in 4 shot at getting that right & missed.
No thanks. Won't be back. Should have gone to IHOP couple blocks away.
