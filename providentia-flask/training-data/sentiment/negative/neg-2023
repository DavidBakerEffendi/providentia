I've known about Walnut Grill for a while now but it wasn't till a few months ago that I actually decided to go to the Wexford location. I wasn't blown away whatsoever so I thought for sure I would never return to any location . I had a sudden change of heart this past weekend and decided to give the Robinson location a try. 

Needless to say there was clearly a reason I said I didn't want to go back. The menu looks enticing with all of its options but the food is nothing special whatsoever. After much debating I decided to order a Bloody Mary with my brunch. I'm a Bloody Mary snob so I was very hesitant going into it until I saw what it looked like and it seemed like it could be half decent. Wrong again. It tasted like watered down Campbell's tomato soup. I couldn't even force it down it was so bad. As a Bloody Mary fanatic, it was a disgrace that they would even call that a Bloody Mary. 

Food wise I decided to go with the biscuits and gravy. I thought surely they would have to be good if my work cafeteria can manage to make good biscuits and gravy. Wrong again. It didn't event look appetizing. The gravy looked as if they decided to be cheap and replace some of the cream/milk with water. It just didn't even look right. The biscuits didn't taste fresh at all and the eggs were most definitely not poached. Having a runny egg doesn't make it poached. The egg white shouldn't be completely cooked and rubbery. 

With my recent experience it's safe to say I'm done giving any Walnut Grill a chance. If you enjoy good quality, homemade food I would not recommend it. The food doesn't taste fresh and at times doesn't even taste like they made it in-house.
