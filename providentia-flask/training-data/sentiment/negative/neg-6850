The food was worth what they charged, it's not a dining experience. The mood is laid back, so much so that they don't let you know to seat yourself on a Tuesday night.

I got the Cuban sandwich which I though was tasty, my spouse ordered a salad that made no mention of dried fruit and yet it came with a lot of dried fruit which turned her off. I probably would have given it at least 3 stars if a member of the wait staff (not our specific server) didn't laugh in our faces when a little girl left a cherry stem on our table like we were supposed to take out the trash. Would have liked to leave a better review, but, I just can't.
