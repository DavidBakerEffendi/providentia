I came here to have a birthday celebration with my friends. We needed a table for 10. The hostess refused to seat us until she could count ten heads even though some were still parking. She said they had a table for us but couldn't seat until all present. We took our party elsewhere. They lost the potential for a large revenue and tip that evening.
