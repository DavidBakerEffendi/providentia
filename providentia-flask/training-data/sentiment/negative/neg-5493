Not sure what all the hype is about this place. Service is horrible... Showed up at 10:30AM on a Sunday and checked in at the awkward counter and was told by the hippie hostess the wait was about 20 minutes. So the wife and I graciously agreed to wait and take a stroll through the atriums and check out the bird rescue( probably the coolest part of this whole place). As we ended out our about 15 minute stroll to see the birds, the hippie hostess comes and notifies several waiting parties that she has just been notified by the cook that the wait is about an hour now. How you go from 20 minutes to over an hour is beyond me. When you figure out how to run a restaurant let the world know and we might be back... Until then, good luck!
