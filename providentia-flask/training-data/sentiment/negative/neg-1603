Food here is good but the cook Nick talked smack the whole time he was making my food. He was upset that I modified my order.  As a customer I am never coming back. If you don't like your job,  find a new one.  The time I came in here before the guy that made my shake was smacking the food tongs on the side of the trash can, gross. Not impressed.
