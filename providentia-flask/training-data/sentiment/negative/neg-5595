Have finally, after many years of ordering thru Just Eat, found the bottom of the barrel for delivered Chinese food in my area. Delivery was late, food was cold due to poor packaginging and handling by driver. Driver orginally delivered wrong order. No need for Ancestry DNA test on the General Tso's Chicken, there was NO chicken involved in this order. Absolute mystery what the"protein" was. Dumplings were textbook for the word ":flacid":. Dull and uninspiring, no dipping sauce involved. You could almost hear the sigh of ennui of the person makling them, The kung Pau chicken was overcooked and looked and tasted like the raw materials for making Christmas candy canes. Really sad stuff. Thirty four dollars down the drain. Never order from this place.
