this restaurant is far from perfect.

what kind of restaurant DOES NOT accept credit cards?!  apparently this chinese restaurant doesn't accept it when you order special prefixed dinners.  the boss was not able to provide a clear answer as to why they didn't accept it either.   no one wants to carry $300+ around if they don't have to.  it's not practical for their business to accept credit card for all other items on their menu except the prefixed dinners.

food arrived late and cold.  the dishes came out too far apart and we were sitting around thinking dinner was done.  they kept adding water to the tea leaves, never giving us fresh leaves.

if i can give this restaurant 0 stars, i would!
