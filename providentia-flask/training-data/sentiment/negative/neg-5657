So I decided to try this place since it is super close to my house. I went in and decided to order a chorizo breakfast burrito. Since I was a new customer I did receive a free drink which was cool. Looking at the only 2 menus that were in the entire little place, the owner of this restaraunt was talking across the counter to multiple people and didn't bother asking me if I needed help or even recommended anything. 
Anyways, I decide what to get and he did tell me it was going to be 15 minutes due to online orders. That was fine with me. But never did I think it was going to be 30 minutes which is what I waited for one simple burrito. Mind you, he did try to accommodate me with an extra add on of sour cream for the wait. Since the kitchen is pretty visible, I watched anxiously for my burrito. Although I did see that the owner/chef was dripping in sweat, dripping down his nose. I kept a close eye on him due to the fact I didn't want his sweat in my burrito. Ew. 
Since he offered me sour cream for the long wait, I expected sour cream, right? Nope nothing on the burrito. It was a big portion size but nothing had flavor. Rice was undercooked. Green sauce was okay but tasted like it was a little less watered down from Robertos. Paid $9 for this thing and definitely didn't meet any expectations, sadly. Ate half, threw the rest away.
