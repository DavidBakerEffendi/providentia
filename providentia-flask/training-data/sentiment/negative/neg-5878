This is my response to the owner, no I'm not confused. My total for the teas was $6, $3 each for 2 like I mentioned. Then your waitress herself came back and explained to me that the $3 on top of that was tip for the bartender and that doesn't go to her. I'm absolutely certain.

Was excited in more options for Asian cuisine but,  larb was tasteless & stick to Thai house for pad Thai.  My grandmother & I requested hot sauce to save the dishes. They give you 3 that you have to scrape for so in her words, "they are so stingy." It was good hot sauce though.

We order the hibiscus & green tea.  Hibiscus is pretty,  comes in clear coffee press type glass with pretty herbs in it. The green tea has to be assembled yourself & comes with a timer.  But in the end they charge me a bartenders fee on the tab,  no mention of this prior. I was confused,  the server told me it's a bartenders tip. So these are my problems with that: 
1. They require you to pay gratuity,  it's not even an option. What place doesn't just tip out like normal? Whether it's for bartenders,  hostess, busboys etc...
2. The required rate seems to be 50% bc they charged me $3 extra for $6 worth of tea.  I'm not overly upset about a few bucks but if you spend $50, $40 on drinks,  then the automatic extra charge on that is $25, $20 etc.??
3. Who told them it requires a bartender to pour tea?
4. You made me pay tip, but made us do half the work by steeping half of it ourselves with a oddly shaped teabag.  
How does any of this add up? 

I looked forward to this place for awhile & finally had the chance to stop in after a shopping trip closeby & a way for us to wait  on 5 o clock traffic to die down, but we left very unimpressed.  A star for nice service but that's it. Oh wait, the mango rice was good. We had 2 apps but they were just ok.
