Nothing like seeing a manager walk away from a server when the server asks for them to talk to angry customers (we waited over 45 minutes for our nachos and it still took ten minutes on top of that to pay for the few things we were served.) Classy.  Our compensation for the horrible experience? A $20 tab for a margarita and one kids pizza. (We had two kids with us. One didn't get his food.)
