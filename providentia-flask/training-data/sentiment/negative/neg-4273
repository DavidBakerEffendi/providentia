I'm going to give it a star, not because the food wasn't amazing (it was great), but because of the staff acting childish. When we left, the waitress took the bill and showed it to their colleagues and they were having giggles over it for some reason. Perhaps they were shocked we left tip, I don't know, I couldn't understand them. But either way, this is something that's very rude and unnaceptable, I'm not coming there again.
