Horrible, I asked if a could add a large drink and the man at the drive through said " Add it on at the 2nd window", in a rude way. Then we had to wait 14 minutes just for two four piece chicken nuggets we ordered since they only rang up one. So we pulled off and  they didn't give us any sauces, so we went back and got them. When we opened it up and they had given us the habanero ranch. Strange the woman in jeans and a black shirt "no uniform?" missed it. Needless to say the 5 and 9 y/o that they were for couldn't eat that. You would expect better on this side of town. Tip: "Don't waste your time and money here!" Ps, don't miss the current 93 sanitation rating from this February!
