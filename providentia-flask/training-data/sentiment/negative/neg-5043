I'm writing about my experience i had here about a year ago.  It is one of the few places i can give a 1 score too.    My friends and I came here because the other big crawfish place was too crowded and we were all hungry.   My friend suggested we try this place but I was a little reluctant.  I'm from southern california and I am use to Boiling Crab quality shrimp and crawfish.   

The fries were pretty average.   The sauce is really bland and watery.  It doesnt have much taste or kick to it.   

We ordered the shrimp but that didnt seem to fresh.  The shell was really hard to get off.   I also felt like it was hard to tagged the waiter when we were there even though there was only a few customers.   

All in all, i wouldnt come back here again.
