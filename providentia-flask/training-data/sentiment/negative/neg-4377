This was my first winterlicious 2015 and should have known better than to pick a place in Scarborough! 
I would like to rank this place slight better than airplane food and at par with food served probably at old folks home! 
Service was as u would find on Aur Canada flight! 
First off as soon as I walked in the door there was this moldy old smell! 
When asked what the soup of the day was the lady said chicken noodle! When asked what the "Rice Balls (Arancino)" on the menu was, her exact reply "rice balls
Gee thanks Sherlock, that's what it says on the menu! When I asked if it was like Risotto rice, she flat out said no just rice in a ball! Thanks for the great description! 
It turns out it was this great crispy fried rice balls with meet and cheese inside! Glad I didn't listen to her "great" description! 
The meal came with warm toasty garlic bread! And then it went down hill after that!my friends grilled pork tenderloin was like a weird bad tasting veal scaloppini! My stuffed chicken was tolerable but the side veggies was overly steamed and fit to be eaten for those with dentures! 
The dessert was like hospital dessert! Overall very disappointing in regards to service and food! My friend had two bites and left the rest on her plate! The "rice ball" waitress noticed the plate and asked if we wanted to pack it up, when she said no thanks, she pushed further by asking "u sure? There's a lot left!" No shit Sherlock, u'd think she would ask what was wrong! Sigh wasted a good $25 on a disgustingly nasty dinner! Swiss chalet would have been better! Felt so bad for dragging my friend here
