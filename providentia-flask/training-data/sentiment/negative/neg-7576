I was kind of shocked by how bad this place is.  The service was terrible.  The prices were high.  Wait times were long even though there were (maybe) two tables occupied besides ours in the huge dining room.  And the Ranch House has somehow found a way to make comfort food bland and unappetizing.  Probably the worst new restaurant I've tried in years.  There is no reason for this place to exist given that the Yard House is right below it and even Miller's Ale House is better.  Town Square may not be a haven for good restaurants, but this place is still bottom of the barrel.  Probably the worst new restaurant I've tried in years.  Stay away.
