Oh how I wish there were options here past 10pm. We arrived, sat down, waited, waited, waited, witnessed waitresses fighting, waited, waited, were approached by a waitress, ordered, waited, waited, waited, waited. We watched tables just get up and leave, waited, waited. Watched tables ask for their check and wait, we waited, waited, waited. We are still waiting, but about to leave (it's been over an hour now). Our less than mediocre wings arrived, delivered by a server we hadn't seen before or would see again. 30 minutes later a server walked by, we caught their attention and asked for the check.

I didn't expect much and we didn't get much but they still managed to disappoint us! Well done.
