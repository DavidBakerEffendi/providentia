HORRID.

My best friend and I went on the 4th of July in order to partake in some flag-waving boot-scootin' good times. Instead, we got:

-a 45 minute wait for a table
-a Mom's Apple Cobbler in a plastic cup because the bartender left ice in the martini glass too long and it cracked. Mom's Apple Cobbler, incidentally, is white, creamy, and looks like a bodily fluid manufactured by the half of the population of which I am not a member. Thus, having it be served in a plastic cup made it look like I'd robbed a bank, and not the kind with money
-water in plastic cups, NOT MASON JARS as advertised
-a 30+ minute wait for food after ordering
-soggy fish and chips with no chips
-absent service
-a clientele that summed up my impression of Las Vegas vacationers over the 4th of July: fat, white, and lethargic.

I don't love this bar.
