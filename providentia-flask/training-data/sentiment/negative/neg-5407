This place was  a favorite of mind , but why should you call in your order live a mile away, get there in ten minutes for them to say, what order? did you order something ? then receive bread that is not quite soft or a bobbie with not so cooked stuffing or pastrami that is underdone on a hot sandwich. The girl working the register very unprofessional, she thought it was funny that she could not find the order and stated so. Her eyes looked glazed , maybe she only receive a little sleep the night before maybe she was on drugs.. I will report her, I do not appreciate her non-chalant tone and attitude. Please get it together, before others catch on and get the quality customer sales associates that your business require. I live in Vegas now and I would not recommend this location to others
