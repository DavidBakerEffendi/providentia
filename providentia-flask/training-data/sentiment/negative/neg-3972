First time here and had lunch with my parents. Dad ordered their tuna melt and asked for it without apples, avocado and nuts and he still received it that way and 3 mintes after we received our lunch. Mom had egg salad and their was only a half dollar size amount. I had the portabello 1/2 sandwich. It was ok. We ordered iced green tea and waited 15 minutes to have someone bring us hot tea and then another 5 for the right teas. We waited almost 25 minutes for 3 sandwiches. Food taste fine but service was bad. I mentioned it to a supervisor and he said well their bringing it now. I would not recommend this place.
