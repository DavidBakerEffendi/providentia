Went for my birthday and was so disappointed.  From the weak drinks and the terrible happy hour service, we made our way to the dining room and it didn't get better from there.  The bread arrived at the table it was warm and tempting however, the butter was, well some seafood broth must have creeped into it because it was nasty.  They did bring fresh butter to the table upon request.  I asked for my salad dressing on the side but instead it came to the table, not only on it, but so much of it, it was like Elmer's glue.  The steamed broccoli was terrible and the sauce they put on it was awful similar to the Elmer's glue on the salad and so much of it.  Ickkkkk!   The lobster was over steamed so it was a bit tough but it was sweet.  Needless to say I won't be going back.  Very disappointing.
