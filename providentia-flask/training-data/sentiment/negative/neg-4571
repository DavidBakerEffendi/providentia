What the hell is with these guys?? 

Walked in and were told to seat ourselves... Ten minutes went by and no one even said hello. All their servers were avoiding eye contact when we tried to get their attention. 

My buddy said they racially profile here (you must be Latin) I thought he was crazy until I experienced it myself. 

Boo to this place for life.
