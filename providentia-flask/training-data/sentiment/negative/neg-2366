When you spend six dollars on a hotdog, I think it better be damn good, or at least damn drunk. Neither of these were the case at this ridiculous place.
Don't waste your time or money.

I had some form of chili that tasted just a minute away from being thrown away. Stale cheese was on top (they didn't even bother melting it to cover it up).
The bun was just as stale.
The bartender was a rude hipster.
I felt really silly for paying for this.
I guess it's my fault.
