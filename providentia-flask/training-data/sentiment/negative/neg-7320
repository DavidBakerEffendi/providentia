I don't plan to come back here. The first time I came after they opened it was real good. The next few times after that including this last week have been terrible. Service is so slow. Our table had to wait 10 minutes just to get drink orders taken after waiting 10 minutes to be seated. The restaurant is big but it was empty with maybe 2 or tables with people so I don't know why the wait was so long.

I ordered the Chili Burger, my wife ordered the Pot Roast Melt, and my friend ordered The Chain Saw. After our food arrived all 3 of us noticed problems with our food. My chili burger was opened faced with just chili and cheese. The burger and onion were missing! How in the hell do you forget to put the burger on a chili BURGER??? The server said it would be 20 minutes for them to remake it. I just said I would eat what was brought to me. My wife ordered the pot roast melt on previous visits and it was okay but this time her pot roast was very crispy. It seemed it was leftovers that they just heated back up at too high of a heat in a pan. The au jus they accompanied her sandwich was extremely salty. I tried a bite and had to spit it back out. My friends sandwich (the chain saw) had roast beef, tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers and bacon. It is supposed to be hot and came out ice cold. Maybe they took the food from the fridge and forgot to put it in the microwave? They brought him a new sandwich 10 minutes later and he said it was okay. We never got our drinks refilled once. I was surprised we had to pay for our meal at all. With the service being so slow and problems with the food I must pass on this place in the future.
