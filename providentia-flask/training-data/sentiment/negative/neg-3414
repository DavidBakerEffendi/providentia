I live just down the street, and therefore get food from the drive-thru here relatively often. I'm at the point where the service (or lack there of) is too terrible to ignore, and refuse to let another 20-minute wait outside the drive-thru window ruin my day. I just left the drive-thru and, just like the majority of my visits, had terrible service in terms of speed of service and the general attitude of the gentleman taking my order. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone that wants a stress-free fast food visit, and will be looking to spend my money elsewhere moving forward.
