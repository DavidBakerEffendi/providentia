I don't get the obsession.  Way to expensive for mediocre fried chicken.  Seriously, fast food chicken 6 pieces of leg and thighs for $30?  That's almost comparable pricing to gourmet sit down restaurants in Toronto!  And honestly, Popeyes is better!  To top it off,  terrible fries!  They are clearly frozen and not handcut.   I am always willing to pay god money for good food.   This s the 2nd time I've ordered take out from here.  I tried the boneless chicken the last time and it was a sweet batter.  It was terrible.  2nd experience trying something different did not change my mind.
