This used to be the greatest buffet on the strip now it's just a ridiculous joke.  Clearly MGM is well aware of the fact that they have to have a buffet but they obviously don't like having one so they put out the worst possible food and it's so tragic you have to get your own drink!  at the Bellagio??? Really??? My own drink? How Excalibur of them!  really thank God Steve Wynn is still alive Or he would be spinning in his grave with disgust At how they have ruined his masterpiece in every way!  MGM taking over Bellagio is like Walmart taking over Saks Fifth Avenue! It's garbage spend a few extra dollars go to the Wynn buffet!
