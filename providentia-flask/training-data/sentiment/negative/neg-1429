Second time to TG. Had a blast the first time as a Fathers Day gift from the family. We really enjoyed it and looked forward to this visit to now show my mom. This time  we were met at the door by staff advising of a policy change that we cannot use our drivers, woods or hybrids due to possibility if hitting over the net.  Really? You didn't think about that when you built the place?  Assured them that my 86 year old mom would hold back and not launch her 350 yard drives, nor would my wife or I.  Then told we had to leave the woods, hybrids at the desk and if we use our irons we were restricted to the lower level only.   Really?!  What's next?   With all the restrictions we decided just to leave and enjoy a nice dinner elsewhere.   It's really a shame that TG has been reduced to this.
