I wish I could give this place negative stars.... I ordered the Surf N Turf (Filet Mignon and Lobster) with a side of broccoli and fries. We also ordered the ribeye with a side of broccoli and a loaded baked potato (her side of broccoli never arrived for the record). I can't even begin to explain how upset My stomach was... sorry to whomever reads this review, but I had the Hershey squirts for a solid couple hours after leaving. This hurt my stomach so badly that I had to hang out in the bathroom during recovery. What a waste of an evening and $80.... never going to this place again- disgusted that their food destroyed my stomach that badly. Btw- I'm an extremely healthy 26 year old male at 6'0, 205lbs..... I never have that kind of stomach issue. Safe to say you'll need to find an outhouse after leaving the outback; gnarly
