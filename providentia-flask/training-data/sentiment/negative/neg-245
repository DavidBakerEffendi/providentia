I was meeting a friend at Yorkdale and we decided to eat at one of the restaurants there, we were hoping to catch the Raptors game and so asked to be seated in the bar area, and then we find out that they don't have tsn2 so that was disappointing. 

We got seated at 8pm, by 8:20 no one had even come to introduce themselves as our waitress, and so we told this to our hostess and she apologized and said she would get on it, 10 minutes later, no one even glanced our way when we were clearly doing the whole looking around thing that people do to get the attention of anyone and then we decided to just leave as it was getting ridiculous. 
We were also sitting in a very heavily trafficked area, so I honestly do not know what was going on with them.
Completely horrible and it was something I had never experienced in all my eating out in Toronto. 

In terms of my previous visits to Pickle Barrels, it used to be one of those places that we would go to eat just because we had no idea how much greener the grass was on the "other side" aka most other places. I would not recommend anyone come to Pickle Barrel, if you must eat at Yorkdale, go check out their food court or Milestones or something. 

Pickle Barrel has a large menu which is just a bit over priced, but I must admit that you're probably going to find whatever food you're in the mood for. It's not horribel food, but there are better options out there. On it's best day I could see myself giving a Pickle Barrel a 3 star rating, but that's never happened to me so far.
