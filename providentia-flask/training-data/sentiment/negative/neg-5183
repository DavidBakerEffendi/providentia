I know airport food is typically not that great but not all of it has to be this bad. 360 burrito was some of the worst food I have ever tasted anywhere.  I find it hard to believe that this place is still open. 

First, you pay a fortune to get food that is tasteless at best.  The chicken was incredibly dry and devoid of any taste.  We got the burrito and the tacos and threw away the majority of it because it was disgusting.  

Please do yourselves a favor and NEVER eat here.  Einstein bagels is right around the corner and you won't end up with terrible food.
