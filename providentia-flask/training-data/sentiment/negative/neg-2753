From the moment we walked in I had a bad feeling. Walking up we smelled great food. Unfortunately, that smell must have been coming from the Mexican place next door. Once we were seated there was a very unpleasant odor. 

We ordered pot stickers, sweet and sour chicken, and I tried to order beef with snow peas and baby corn.  I was told (awkwardly) that this is a real Chinese restaurant; no snow peas, no baby corn.  Fine.

We waited a while for food. My beef dish arrived. To be fair, this dish was pretty decent.

We waited over 10 minutes for my date's food to show up. When it did, we weren't sure if it was really bad chicken or really bad pork, but either way it was horrible. We immediately asked for a box for the beef, and the bill.

When she brought the bill out, it had all three items on it. With the bill she brought the pot stickers.  I told her the bill was wrong and that she needed to take the chicken and the pot stickers off. She told me "you ordered them, you must pay".  I told her the pot stickers came late, and the chicken was foul (lol), and that I could either pay for the beef and walk out, or simply walk out. She walked to the kitchen and screamed something in Chinese, then threw the modified bill at our table, all the while mumbling in Chinese to the other Chinese patrons.

We will not be returning.
