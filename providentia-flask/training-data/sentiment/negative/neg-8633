We thought it would be fun to give this place a try while here in Las Vegas.   The decor is what everyone says, over the top chinch. The autographed pictures on the wall of star from bygone era. 

The food was quite possibly the worst Italian food I've ever eaten.  I ordered the cannelloni because it's a dish often served for special occasions. The dish arrives decorated in the green white and red colors of the Italian flag and thoroughly heated through.   The amount of salt in this dish was off the charts!  Two forkfuls into it I was reaching for the water.  When the server came back to ask how everything was i stated that I didn't like my dish because of the salt.   She just said "okay I'll tell them" and walked away.  No offer to replace the dish and at the end no offer to remove any part of the dish off the bill.  

I will not return to this place nor do I recommend this place.  Stay away!
