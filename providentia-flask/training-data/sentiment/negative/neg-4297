I walked into Sorelle today and was left utterly disappointed. The cute little cafe that has always been amazing for people with food restrictions/allergies has really started to let me down. The past few times that I have walked in I have been met with terrible service. Today I was 1 of 2 people standing in line and i was left waiting for almost 15 minutes because three employees were tending to a single customer. The employee organization and management really needs some serious improvement!
