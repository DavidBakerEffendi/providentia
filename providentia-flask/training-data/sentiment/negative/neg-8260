HORRIBLE! I'll first start off with the food, we were a group of 4 but not that hungry so all we ordered was 2 servings of pork belly and it was fairly a good amount, but the slices were really thin(a little bit thicker than bacon) and came with soup of ur choice (choose kimchi) food was ok. SERVICE! First off when we arrived it looks at least 5 minutes for someone to seat us, and they have a button when you are ready to order, we pressed it and waited 5 mins again. We ordered and they didn't even give us water after 10 mins we asked them for it. They didn't give us side dishes after 10 minutes, and our pork belly until 15 mins. Than we were still waiting for our lettuce and we asked them if than can bring it. Than after i payed I didn't want to even think of tipping anyone so just as were about to leave the waiter stops us and asks for a tip. HE SAID WE HAVE TO TIP HIM 5$. I was planning on giving him 1$ bc that's literally how bad the service was, but I couldn't find it so i just gave him 2$ and he was like no ,3$ more. He was asking all of us and we were like we don't have any more money. He looked at us like money would instantly grow out of our heads! He literally wouldn't let us leave. He was like we have a credit card machine but none of us had any. And he than saw my 20$ which i was not planning to use whatsoever and he was like I don't think so and he said he could bring my 20$, TAKE MY 5$ and give me 15$ back. He kept telling me he "doesn't think so" that we don't have money. I WORK HARD FOR THIS MONEY AND HE LITERALLY JUST BROUGHT THE SIDE DISHES AND REFILLED OUR WATER THATS IT! I don't recommend this place for their crap service (a woman was serving us too while she was eating her mouth full). Never ever ever going back to this place. IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD! ALSO THE. TABLE BESIDE US ORDERED AND GOT THEIRS 20+ MINS AFTER! But they're was only 2 other groups (including mine) and they weren't even serving us nor the other group. They also had a bad experience and i truly honestly have never ever thought someone would have the audacity to do what that man just did. ALSO HE DIDNT LET ME KEEP THE RECEIPT! HE TOOK IT FROM ME AND NEVER GAVE IT BACK!
