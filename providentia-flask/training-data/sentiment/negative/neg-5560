Regretfully one of the worst meals I've had to date. Our experience started off on a bad note, from which it never recovered, when the waitress brought us our first round of cocktails.... Two in our party ordered Moscow Mule's, but were served watered down ginger beer/vodka blends sans copper mug,  mint, and ice. The waitress seemed annoyed and let us know that, "if we ordered another one after this, we can have it in a copper cup". 
My question is, if the drink sat long enough for all of the ice to melt; what would another 90 seconds to wash the mugs be? The waitress was unapologetic, but did note that we could order something else. I opted for a beer, which came out without issue (in a bottle). 
My next major problem was with my entree. I ordered shrimp and grits, a southern classic, which I have ordered more than a half dozen times at this restaurant in the past. The shrimp came out without being deveined. This is 100% unacceptable at even the most mediocre of greasy-spoon type establishments, much less at a $16 price point at Hickory Tavern. Again, the waitress seemed barely bothered by the snafu, and we did not receive an apology or explanation by management. A gentleman came out after the meal was sent back, asking for an explanation. I showed him the picture and explained the shrimp was not deveined, which seemed to baffle him. I'm not sure if he was in disbelief or was not sure what I meant by "the shrimp was not deveined". Either way, he did not respond to my negative experience in any way other than making a face and walking away... 

In short, please don't waste your time or hard earned money at this has-been chain that no longer emphasizes customer service or palatable food. This particular chain has gone downhill over the past year. I have never had an issue at another Hickory Tavern in the Charlotte metro area.
