I came here at this location for the first time, 1/17/16 about 8:40pm.
I order steak tacos and chicken tacos with side rice and pinto bean.
Chicken were so dry and no season, the steak under season too. Rice and bean with lack of flavor.
My wife order quesadillas with bbq pork, she don't like it.
I has bad experience here, I went to another cafe Rio the one at bluediamond rd, they are good.
