I have to say architecture is the star here ... but why such high ceilings for the prices? and I realize the servings used to be too big in Toronto at most restaurants and that is not healthy but why not have choices???
if we want something we should have the choice
Corktown is soooo sadly lacking in choices 
I live so close to Odin but choose not to go there until they have a decent affordable interesting menu
