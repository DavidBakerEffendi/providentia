How are you people saying anything good about this place? I'm in shock! This happens to be THE WORST Thai food I've ever eaten!! Omg the green curry was flavorless and the consistency of water. The tom yum soup was bland and too sour. I also ordered chicken satay, bad idea, how can you mess up chicken satay? The peanut sauce was terrible. I also ordered the pumpkin custard, nasty.... It doesnt take like pumpkin at all and over cooked. The only thing that was good was the young coconut because they didn't touch it. Everything I ordered was really small, it only took a few minutes to eat. $52!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What the F!!!   So expensive! I could of heated a bowl of water in the microwave and ate that for dinner, it be a lot cheaper and would somehow tasted better. Don't waste your money. Go to sakun or Thai house were they know how to cook Thai food!
