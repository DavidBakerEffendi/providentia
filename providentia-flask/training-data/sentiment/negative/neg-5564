The owner makes special sandwiches and post them on Yelp as the real deal. I paid $12 for a sandwich and it barely had one piece of meat and one piece of cheese. The pictures on the Yelp are an absolute lie. I could have purchased two sandwiches for the price that I paid for this one sorry sandwich. I hate being deceived by business owners. I've added a photo of the real product they serve.
