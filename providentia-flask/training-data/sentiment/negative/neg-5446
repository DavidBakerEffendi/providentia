Having seen so many ppl post about Captain Boil, finally being able to open in Scarborough, decided to give this place a try and I was disappointed. 

Unfortunately, there was no system in this restaurant. They didn't have enough servers, not sure if they were expecting to be this busy but there was simply no service. 

We ordered and the food came initially, first 15-20 mins was probably ok, afterwards everything went down the drain. They made a mistake on our food, left it on the table, unattended for a good 10 mins. It's just 2 answers, you either take it back and change it or you just refuse it...why did that require 10mins? No idea! 

They ended up taking it back and nothing came back.  We order clams, mussels, snow crabs, alcohol and etc... 

We later found out there was water dripping in our food from the ceiling.  Which really upset me to the maximum. 

Asked to speak to the manager/owner, no one attended to us. Ended up taking a video of the water dripping. No apologies were in the beginning until I said if I get sick from the water dripping, that's when they got intimidated.

I was very very disappointed and upset....lost and NEVER COMING BACK!!!
