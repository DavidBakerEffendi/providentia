I was very excited to enter into this wonderful building and was quite pleased upon entering Osteria dei Ganzi- the decor was retro-Italianita and tastefully done. I was meeting up with some friends for our weekly dinner get-together that we have established for a number of years now. We are quite educated in restaurants and wine. But, I was sadly disappointed for a number of reasons. The service was horrible and I am not exaggerating in the sense where the waitress forgot a fork. We were not attended to all,  we had to seek out help which at times was hard to find, our food was late or didn't come at all -we were all in disbelief. 
The ironic fact was that the table next to us (a group of men some of whom were Toronto restauranters were present) had not 1 waitress but three, the food kept coming, the wine was being poured and they  truly enjoyed their Ganzi experience. Things that make you go hmmm
