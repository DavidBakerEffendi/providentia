Just came in 8-15-14 late pm. Bartender was terrible. Zero acknowledgement to me at all. Looks like maybe owner/restaurant partner/or simply bartenders friends were drinking there. I wanted to eat but just left because i wasnt getting any service. Its crazy, cause im on record giving them good reviews in the past. They just lost business...And from a true LV foodie with influence. Bartender needs some serious hospitality training. Will be a long time before or even if i ever decide to come back or recommend. Crazy how one person can fudge it up for ya.
