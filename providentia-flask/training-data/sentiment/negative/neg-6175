Saw this bakery on facebook and got excited. My family is gluten and sugar free. Came to order a cake and decided to have waffles with fruits and cappuccino.  I made a mistake that I paid for my cake and all this already. Cappuccino was so tiny, like in Italian restaurant. It is $3.50 and I would expect a regular size like in any other coffee shop. While I was waiting for waffles one lady came in to pick up her cake that she ordered. When she saw the cake she started hesitating, she was a bit confused. Then she said that cake looked very bad and not presentable and writing was like a kid did it. I didn't see it myself, but she left and didn't take it. I finally got my waffles with fruits. The fruit salad was in a soup bowl and it looked so bad. Apples were chopped in tiny pieces, strawberries were cut big, bananas already had a color to it. Too bad I didn't take a photo. The waffles were on tiny plate and were hard to eat. This place has an issue with decoration and presentation. I left really worried about my cake for my birthday. That evening I called them and wanted to make sure that it will be nice looking and I would do a photo shoot with it. The lady said that she can put fruits on if I wanted or put some writing on. Please look at photos on google maps review.  My parents picked up this "masterpiece". I almost cried when I saw the size and look of it. I paid $50 and was expecting a regular size cake. I called and they told me that they informed me it was 6" and that it was heavy like a regular size cake. Well, maybe I didn't pay attention to size, but decor is unacceptable. How can you charge this much money and give this to customer, my little daughter does a better job decorating. Healthy ingredients doesn't give you an excuse to cut corners on decor.  It tasted good, but it is not an achievement, cakes suppose to taste good. I doubt this place will last long.
