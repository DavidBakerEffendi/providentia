The worst ramen I have ever had.

Ramen is my jam. I've been to most of the ramen spots here in Vegas. I have also been to the famous spot in San Diego - Menya Ultra. My go-to dish for ramen is always the ramen with tonkotsu broth.

My family and I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant is located on Spring Mountain near Hobak & Cha Time. Inside is pretty bare, and there were no tables - only bar seating. 

We ordered 3 things here - Tonkotsu Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, and the Chashu Don. Everything we ordered was extremely disappointing. The Tonkotsu broth had very little flavor - it literally tasted like boiled pork water. Tonkotsu is supposed to be rich in flavor. My hubs had the shoyu, and this was also bland. He ended up having to add an extreme amount of the hot sauce that they provide. The Chashu that was given in the ramen was also on the hard side. It was thicker than other ramen spots and a little chewy. Their Chashu Don (which is sold in limited quantities each day), was just bad. They take the same Chashu that is used in the ramen, and blow torch it to hell so that it's practically almost burnt. we felt like we were eating a bunch of char with rice.

Overall this ramen place was such a huge disappointment. I guess we will be sticking to Fukumimi for our ramen needs for now.
