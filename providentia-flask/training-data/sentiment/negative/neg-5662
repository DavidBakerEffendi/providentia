You don't wave a waitress here so you have to get your own drink refills.  The waitresses have dressed for Halloween.  When I first walked in I thought I had mistakenly walked into Hooters. I know it's Halloween and you want to dress up but leotards and shorts that short are not appropriate. The hamburger steak was ok but the grilled onions reeked of garlic powder. The mac and cheese was inedible. I'll post a pic so you can see. You could pick the own portion up with the fork.
