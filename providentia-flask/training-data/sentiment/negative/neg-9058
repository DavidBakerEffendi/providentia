I've never been a fan of Chinese food, but my friends wanted to eat here. Super greasy, salty and unhealthy. I felt so gross after eating the noodles because it was super greasy. We ordered soup, but it was pretty nasty. Customer service was pretty terrible. I kept on drinking water because of how salty the food was.
