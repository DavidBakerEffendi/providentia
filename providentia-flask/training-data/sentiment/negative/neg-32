The last 3 times I've gone have all been disappointing and I can no longer consider the issues a "one-off". The service is terrible, they seem to go through staff quite a bit and this is usually due to poor management. The bartender couldn't even remember the price for their happy hour special, "It's uhhh... THREE tequilas for.... a price". 

So for $7.50 I grabbed a gin tonic. I saw her pour something in, but as a bartender of nearly 10 years I can call BS as soon as I took my first sip. A) there was not a full ounce (or even 1/2 oz) poured into my drink, or B) they water down the alcohol in the bottle. It's one or the other. Unless their bartender is incompetent enough that she couldn't figure out how to put liquor in the glass. 

If in a 10oz glass, mostly filled with ice, and "topped" with tonic, I still cannot discern ANY trace of bar-rail gin (the cheaper stuff tastes more apparent) then YES, this is one of the times they're not serving what they say they are. I've been a bartender for nearly 10 years so I f***ing dare you to tell me I'm wrong. In 5oz of liquid I would clearly be able to taste gin had it been added to the tonic. My friend abandoned his drink rather than complaining. A place this low end, there's no point.

Previous experiences were about the same. Bartenders that couldn't properly pour a draft beer, couldn't advise on prices, changed prices after the drink was served, poor attitude and a generally lack of customer service skills.
