The saddest day of my life. I hate to do this but it's necessary. I don't know if East Side changed hands or if the owner(s) got too greedy but ordered a pie & when I got it home 1-it looked funny 2-tasted like a frozen pizza (the cheapest crap you could find) & when I looked at the bottom it clearly was not a fresh pie as the crust had small holes on bottom like you would find on frozen pizza crust. One bite & in the trash went the whole pie. 

I hate it when owners take a great business & ruin it by cheaping out on the customers. Unforgivable.
