I usually just pick up sandwiches from the takeout counter. On my last visit I dined in... What a mistake! The service was disorganized and sloppy. They definitely lost me on this visit. No one to greet us, no one to seat us, I had to ask someone to seat us... It was far too busy for us to find a table. The servers then didn't visit our table for about 15 minutes. The busboy didn't know anything about the menu... And when the server arrived, he was rushed and didnt ask if we had questions. The server then told me they wouldn't add pepper to my meal in the kitchen, and to just use the one provided on the table. 15.00 for. Plate, and they won't prepare it with pepper? Then he didn't bother to up sell the baked goods or dessert, just gave us our bill... We weren't frugal either... Our bill was over $100 for 4 of us...
