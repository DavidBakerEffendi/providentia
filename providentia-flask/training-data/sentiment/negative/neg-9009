Was really look forward to coming here after being on the website. I did read some bad reviews, but figured it would be okay I mean people have different  tastes.

The appetizers I had where amazing, the scallops are the best. 

However, the butter chicken not so good! We actually sent it back. We did tell the waitress we did not enjoy it ...she did comp our meals but did say "oh ya I have heard that alot tonight" I guess other people  did not enjoy it either. 

It's a shame, it's a beautiful little place, but the food was so so.
