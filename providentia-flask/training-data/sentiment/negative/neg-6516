Business dinner was disappointing. Steak was cooked perfect if you like cold steak ........served warm to cold. Flavor was good but was not hot like my favorite steak house serves. Menu is busy, hard to read and they need to focus on what they do well which is undetermined at this point. No fancy bread before, during our meal. Priced high for the product, location and service. Mixologist makes a good and different selection of drinks. I would return for the drinks. Staff needs training how to serve. I had to fight to keep my salad plate as staff kept trying to take it without asking. I would return for the pumpkin desert and cheesecake desert. Maybe they should be a drinks and desert restaurant? Love the other restaurants run by this owner so what happened here?
