Was just at Fat Ox for my first Mother's Day as a soon to be mom, with my my fianc√© for dinner. We called ahead to get a reservation and they said they had a table for us. When we arrived we were seated right away but wasn't greater by anyone after we sat. We waited for waters before we started to look at the menu...those didn't come. So we finally looked and after deciding on our drinks, apps, and entrees after having some questions. We still had not received any waters or greetings to let us know they would be right with us. We looked around for a waiter and was not given any attention. So we left...very disappointed.
