dennys was the best restaurant when I was a teenager. as you get older and have acquire a taste for real food and not a cafeteria joint.  I stopped being a fan of dennys when I was 21. it became something I rather not eat and just starve.
I don't expect a lot from dennys, unless Im drunk and need food to sober up. I just think your better off hitting up a drive thru instead.
