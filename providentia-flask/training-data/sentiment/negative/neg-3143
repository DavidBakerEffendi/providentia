I cannot honestly recommend this place.... at least not for pho. Being one of my own people, I want them to be successful. But when I feel a restaurant is trying to skim or take short cuts and still charge customers more than other restaurants, it's not fair. Today, I came in for pho...for the last time. The beef was chewy. The broth of the pho should take on the sweetness of the bones. The broth was too brown... maybe too much fish sauce. All I could taste were the artificial flavors. They still do not give enough mint. I did not enjoy the pho at all but did finish because I do not believe in wasting food, especially vietnamese soup.
