DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!! I am late in writing in this review but I did want to get the word out there on this restaurant.  I have visited this place a few times and it was pretty good, however I went a couple of weekends ago & OMG the food was so nasty I felt I wasted $40 on Sunday buffet.  There was no salt, spices, flavor, or color in anything.  When you know what true Indian food tastes like and you end up eating something so tasteless, you wonder if the chef even tasted the food.  Not only that, but these people give you warm water and you have to ask for ice....what place does that? Not only that, it was a hot Sunday when I went and there was no A/C in that place. Charging $11 for buffet, you are telling me you can't afford ice & A/C...REALLY?!!! I read recent reviews on this place & no disrespect to anyone's taste buds but being Indian and knowing what the flavors should be this place DOES NOT meet the standards.  Please enjoy other places like Bombay Grille, Blue Taj, Persi or anything other that Woodlands.  If you give this place a chance, you're optimistic you'll get good food or you have a craving for Indian food and this is the closest place to you.
