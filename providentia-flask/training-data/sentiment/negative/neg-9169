Ick.   Just ick.   Way back in the 90s or so, my mom and her friends used to go here, but it really just went downhill.  I saw the Restaurant Impossible show on it, and wanted to give it another chance, so my mom and I took my 3 year old to lunch there today.   The decor is really nice, but the nice ends there. (except the chips, those were actually pretty good.).   The fresco was ok, but everything else was just weird.  I got the texas burrito and it was pretty much a flavorless glob.   It is supposedly one of Robert Irvine's recipes, but there is NO WAY they are following his recipe.  The braised beef was fatty and chewy and the black beans had no flavor.   I want to say it was disgusting, but that seems to harsh. It was just yucky.   I ate about a 1/4 of it, and when the waitress asked if I wanted it boxed, at first I said no thank you, but then I thought "my husband is never going to believe this food" so I brought it home for him to try.   My daughter got a taco, and she took one bite, and decided to focus on the chips instead.   The ground beef was, again, just flavorless and weird.   It looks like the guy who owns the place know better than Robert Irvine though, because he obviously went back to his old ways.   On the good side, the restaurant has some pretty nice decor, so when this place folds, someone will have a decent place to work with when they buy it.
