I've been a member since 2015 and never have I been treated with such poor customer service. The girls in the front desk initially sat us at a four person table. Once I asked to move to a place suitable for 7 people (keep in mind we were all there at the time we got the bay) a male server sat one extra chair at the table. We then asked to be seated at a bay with a couch or further from the sliding door they said it would be 30mins. 30 mins rolls by and we ask again where will we be seated they say it's going to be another 30-45min. We sent someone to ask what their first available was the lady rolled her eyes and said rudely "oh you're part of the big party that wants "very specific seating" and said the first available will probably be by the sliding door. We've been here almost an entire hour and I'm just appalled at how we've been treated. Luckily the bar was open and we were able to order dinner and watch the game. The only upside to this experience was the bartender and the delicious food.
