Our favourite brunch hotspot is Cora, but we opted for something closer to home one Saturday morning. I'm pretty picky, so I chose to go with the chicken caesar wrap on the lunch menu. My boyfriend got some traditional breakfast affair with eggs and bacon and sausage.

The salad that came with my wrap was barely edible and the wrap itself was just OK. It wasn't the worst I'd ever had, but I make a much better one at home. My boyfriend said his food was OK too. The portions were smaller than Cora, but it was also about $10 less for the two of us.

The service was horrendous. A girl who looked to be maybe 16 (but was likely 18, due to government regulations) took our order and then disappeared. She never came around for drink refills or to ask how our food was. She literally dropped off our food - didn't announce either dish, as is standard with the industry - and that was it. We stacked our dishes, put our coats on, asked for the bill at the counter and paid debit for it there, too. It wasn't even busy. I think there were two other tables there, both of whom were there long before us.

Some people want the cheap, easy, low-quality breakfast that Eggsmart has to offer. We don't go out often, so when we do, we want something good. This did not meet our standards. We definitely will not be going back, and have no desire to try a different location.
