I wish there was a way to give less than a 1 star review.  Last Friday night's dinner was arguably one of the top three worst things I've ever put into my mouth.

First of all, the menu online is totally different from the actual menu in the restaurant.  We went in ready to order take-out based on the online menu and then had to sit down with the "real" menu to figure it out.

I ordered an eggplant parmesan sandwich.  My husband ordered an Italian sausage sub.  We also ordered an appetizer of stuffed artichoke hearts.

Here's the breakdown:  the eggplant parmesan on the sandwich was not parmesan'd.  It was four slices - very thin slices- of eggplant that looked like they had been broiled to death.  They were actually black.  There was no sauce on the sandwich.  The eggplant was not breaded or fried.  Wtf.

The Italian sub consisted of one Italian sausage, very little sauce, one onion strip and one green pepper strip.  I kid you not.  It was almost hilarious.  No cheese.

The stuffed artichoke hearts...  madone.  They looked (and tasted) like they were stuffed with Stouffer's breadcrumb stuffing.  They were so salty that they were inedible.  The artichoke hearts themselves tasted like they came straight out of a jar of marinated artichoke - vinegary.  The sauce was passable but why bother?

The pity is that the girl who helped us was great; so friendly and helpful.  She said the owner still comes in every morning and cooks so we were pretty excited.  It's hard to find good Italian food in Madison.  Well this didn't come close.  Now in order to get my eggplant parm fix, I have to just kill two days to make it myself.  So disappointing.

Gino...  clearly whoever you have in the kitchen is killing your business.  It would take a total overhaul to get me back into this restaurant.  Wondering why we didn't just go to the more upscale Italian joint directly across the street...
