I normally wouldn't waste my time reviewing a place but I need to inform people going here to never set foot in this place again. The only word I can think of to describe this place is NASTY. N-A-S-T-Y. Nasty. They told us it would be a 15 minute wait and it took 45 minutes for me, my friend, and her son to get a table. They had tables open inside and outside that weren't being used, and weren't being reserved. The hosts could have offered us ANY table and I would have been happy. We told the manager and she make some rude remark telling us it wasn't that long of a wait. Our server was boring, didn't smile, and was uneducated about the menu. She was probably just miserable working at this place because her poor attitude doesn't get her any tips. We ordered a side of fries and the Monster platter. The fries came out first and not even kidding... they tasted worse than McDonalds. You could just taste the nasty aftertaste of the oil that it probably was sitting in all day. The Monster platter came out and it was SCARY. The wings were SO dry that they could be labeled as beef jerky on the menu. The onion rings were battered, I mean battered with greasy, used up motor oil. Disgusting! The cheeseburgers were worse than the ones the I had at the cafeteria in high school. The buns were soooo dry that I think they could be compared to the hockey pucks from the Coyotes Stadium. I think the only thing I liked on that platter was carrots and celery. Not even the ranch and blue cheese was good! Oh- and the beer was good. That's it. I told the manager hey- it seems like our platter has been sitting out for a while. He said it was fresh, and he lied. I guarantee he lied. PLEASE, TO SAVE EVERYONE IN GLENDALE ARIZONA, CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN!!! IN THE NAME OF JESUS, AMEN!
