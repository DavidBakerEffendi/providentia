The food was just ok, not worth money.  The service was horrible. They messed up my kids order twice.  When I say no sauce on potsticker, I really do mean no sauce on my potsticker.  The food took forever. The server cried because she only received a 12% tip.  I may never visit New York New York hotel because of this restaurant.
