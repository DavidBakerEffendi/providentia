I went for a late lunch at Cozymel's today and I was a very disappointing experience.

The service was extremely slow eventhough there were only 3 other tables that were occupied.  The waitress seemed very disinterested, moved very slow and didn't watch over the floor.  She never came around to asked how the food was nor to check on our drinks, which most of my table finished and waited so long that we finished our meals and was ready to pay for the check.  Speaking of which we were still left waiting so long that someone had to go look for her around the restaurant to get our bill (she never did see us wave for her).

The food was very mediocre Americanized Mexican food.  The meat was over cooked with very little seasoning, and the sauces were strangely bland, not what you would expect at a Mexican restaurant.  The side of beans were so salty it was barely edible. The side of their 'famous' Mex slaw was merely a garnish, which was a good thing because it also lacking in flavor except for the overwhelming amount of raw onions.  I was very disappointed as I love coleslaw.

I left the restaurant unsatisfied and feeling a bit sick.  I felt bad because I took my coworkers there with me.  The only good thing I have found was the nice outdoor dining patio.
   
I would rather go to Baja Fresh or Chipotle for a better tasting lunch for half the price.
