This is not a good McDonald's. You need to check and triple check your orders everytime.   Staff working the drive thru don't care if they get your order right or not.  Last three times they tried to stick me with the order of the person behind me and seemed miffed that I wanted what I ordered and not a diet coke.  Which brings me to another complaint.  Drinks, apparently they are optional these days when you order a meal.   Guy at the pickup forgets to hand off the drinks about every time and looks bewildered and upset that your still sitting in the drive thru line waiting for the drink he is supposed to give you.  Chick Fil A down the street seems to have it together don't know why running a fast food restaurant is so difficult these days.
