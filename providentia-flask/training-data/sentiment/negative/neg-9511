$32 for 12 wings and two beers. 
Food was ok. Beer was ok 
Service very marginal. 
Two bartenders and only 10 of us at the bar but had to repeatedly wait for service. 
They both did find time to spend quality time with a couple of regulars. 

I got the dry wings and they were pretty much fried and rolled in a salt/spice mixture. 

The place was pretty empty and I see why. Won't be back.
