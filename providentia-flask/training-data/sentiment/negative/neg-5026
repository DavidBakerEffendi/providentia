This is an update of the review I made on Steak on a Stone's Thanksgiving Day buffet.  My daughter and myself started to become ill the next day. Severe diarrhea and stomach cramps.   Tomorrow I will be filing a complaint with the Lake County Health Department.  I believe the food served was not held at correct temperatures to prevent food poisoning.
