I began writing this while in the drive thru at McDonalds after leaving the Ranch House. Yes, Dorothy, it was THAT bad. 

Went in about an hour before closing on a Friday night. So not a great time, maybe. Soggy, cold vegetables? Yeah, might have guessed that. But when combined with a slab of flavorless, grey substance I hesitate to call "meatloaf" and a chewy, yellow/gray substance attempting to impersonate mashed potatoes, all covered in a brownish mess of burnt flower and grease - it added up to by far the worst "meal" I have had this year. 

Hence the McD's. 

Been here for breakfast and it was good. Which makes me even sadder. Think I'll have another fry...
