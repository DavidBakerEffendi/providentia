I've been here a few times for work lunches since this place is in a convenient location. If it wasn't for their location and group seating capacity, I would never come back here. 

I came with a group of 10 for lunch on a weekday, and it wasn't busy. There might have been 8 other people in the entire restaurant. We were seated on the patio, which was nice and sunny! Off to a good start. 

Then my experience goes downhill. The server took our drink orders first, and didn't come back to get our food orders 30 min into our seating. 1 hour after we arrived, the server tells me they are out of the item I ordered. I changed my order to the Arugula & Fig salad, without the cheese (I'm lactose intolerant). I waited 25 min for this salad, and at this point, I've been here for almost 1.5 hrs without any food. I think this was the longest I've EVER waited for a lunch. I had to get it to-go because I needed to get back to work. 

Not to mention, the salad itself was really not worth $14. It was just arugula, walnuts, maybe 1 fig sliced up, and a vinaigrette. Even if I could eat the cheese, it would have been disappointing.
