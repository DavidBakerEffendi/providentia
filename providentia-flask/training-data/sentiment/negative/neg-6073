The food is not extraordinary, but it's not too bad. However, that is not enough to cover up the TERRIBLE customer service. 

My son went in to order alone and came out very frustrated. He said the lady taking the orders was very disrespectful and rude! 

They have the boneless spareribs he likes so I stopped by one day to surprise him with an order, sure enough again...you guessed it! She was rude! 

Unacceptable! Does this lady know there are other Chinese food restaurants in the area?!?
