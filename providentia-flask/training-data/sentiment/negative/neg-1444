I have no idea what to say about this place. It has honestly taken me a few days to even think of something to say. Where do I begin.... first it was very unorganized, everyone was running around. People standing waiting in the front with no one greeting. I stood there at first and was confused if someone was going to take our name down. There was an older couple that had already been waiting prior to us arriving who left. My husband asked me if i just wanted to go somewhere else. I said no I want to try this place. So we ended up sitting at the bar. Our waitress was very nice. We ordered Chicken Karaage, Nishikawa Black, and the Spicy Miso. The broth literately tasted like powder and was so thick and I just cant even describe it. It was starting to turn into gelatin . My Pork on the top of my Spicy Miso was nothing but a big piece of fat I couldn't even eat it. The noodles where hard and could have been boiled a lot longer. The appetizer was probably the only good think oh and the house Green Tea. I also thought that it was really unusual that they were putting dirty dishes on the back bar where they put the food that was ready to go to a customer. I don't think I will be returning. My cup of ramen the next day was better....
