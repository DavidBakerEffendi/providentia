Never have I been to a restaurant where the food was so gross that I couldn't eat it! I am not a picky eater AT ALL but the food here was AWFUL. We started with a basket of fries which were barely warm and soaked in grease. They were so soggy we asked for homefries instead, and we received soggy/greasy homefries. Then I ordered egg whites, cottage cheese, and grilled chicken. Not only did I find bones in the chicken, but it had clearly been grilled days before and reheated in the microwave. It was like rubber!!! We asked for a side toast and the bread was warm but not even toasted! 

Even worse our waitress ignored us the whole time! She only stopped to bring us our food and to give us the bill. It was clear that we didn't enjoy our fries or meals because we pushed the full plates to the edge of the table and were not eating them. She just kept looking at us from the counter but never bothered to ask why we weren't eating or if everything was ok. 

I didn't want to make a scene so we paid and left. I really should've talked to the manager. Our waitress even billed us for the fries and homefries that WE SENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN.
