This place is terrible. We went here looking for a good Chinese buffet and found instead a pile of tables with over cooked under season indistinguishable food. Even the desserts were bad. They were like you took Philo bread sprinkle sugar on it and cooked it no effort at all was made to make something that tastes good.
