I wish I could rate this place lower. Personally watched front desk staff berate and disrespect a queer couple (on the basis of that fact) here to my shock and horror, and when they asked to speak to a manager, they were actually asked to leave. Would never stay here again (not to mention it's generally run down and dirty) The entire display was shocking and gross and not something that should have happened anywhere.
