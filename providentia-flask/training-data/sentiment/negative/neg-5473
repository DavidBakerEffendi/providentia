Inedible food and incompetent service in a shiny 4-star toy on the lakeside waterfront "100% corner" in Madison.  After staying at the Edgewater for business over four days and dining at the Statehouse four times, this review applies to the front of house and the back.  Routinely, I was not acknowledged or offered water for more than 20 minutes even when indicating in advance that I was on my way to a meeting.  The food was not served to order (raw poached eggs, tough and over salted meats/fish, over sauced mystery fish, raw strawberry pie dough). At breakfast, I had to request my check FIVE times and was 20 minutes late to my meeting.  At the last meal (and why didn't I learn my lesson?), my salad and entr√©e were served at the same time, swimming in a mass of unidentifiable glop.  Servers are not trained/ knowledgeable about what they are selling/serving. I had requested fish similar to trout and got a fatty, oily, thick, tough, over-salted bottom feeder.  When I opened my napkin for silverware, there was a lone spoon inside and no fork so I couldn't eat it anyway - again after a 45 minute wait.  I sent it back and got a cheese plate. Go for the view and enjoy a drink, but prepare yourself to feel like the invisible guest.  I suggest all employees watch the film "A Five Star Life" (Italian with English subtitles) to get an idea of a luxury guest's expectations and the Statehouse's vast room for improvement.
