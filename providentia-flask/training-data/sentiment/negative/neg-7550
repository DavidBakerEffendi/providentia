It's 5:30 am at the airport and they are not open for breakfast. The deli next door is open and has a nice breakfast. Chick-fillet is open. Cinabun is open. The smoothie place is open. Why not Uptown?

It may be because it's a bar and can't open due to local laws. Maybe they cannot figure out keep the bar part closed while serving restaurant patrons?

Hopefully the airport moves my flights out of this terminal while they renovate it. Maybe there will be a restaurant open at 5:30 for a standard breakfast.
