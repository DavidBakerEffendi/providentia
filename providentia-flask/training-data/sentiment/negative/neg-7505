First of all I don't think customer service should be refused because I didn't eat here, I had spilled a drink and needed napkins ASAP and I was sitting right across from this place so I hurried to get some napkins and they refused to give me any because I didn't eat here... it's not my fault that Greek food sucks and they don't get enough customers to be able to just give out napkins to someone that didn't want to eat Gunk food unlike McDonalds everyone talks shit but they give me napkins.
