Gino's is closing their doors later this month. If you are thinking about dining here before they close for nostalgic purposes... DON'T!!!  They should have closed their doors on a good note instead of staying open with minimal staff and stale ingredients. 

I got tortellini with Alfredo sauce and the sauce was SO watery! It was literally dripping off the noodles. What's worse is that the sauce was way too salty and almost inedible.
My mother-in-law got the chicken parm. Oddly, it didn't come with noodles.. It was just a sad piece of chicken on a plate. It was obviously frozen and reheated because you couldn't cut it (sort of like an overcooked Lean Cuisine). 
We ordered a pizza to take home with us (before we ate our meals and realized how bad everything was) and the pizza wasn't much better than everything else. The toppings were tasty, but the bottom crust was really tough to bite through. I'm guessing it was frozen at some point, like the chicken parm.

I'm sad this place is going out in such a bad note. I remember really enjoying it back in the day.
