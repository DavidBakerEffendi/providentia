Horrible service , was just trying to order pizza for the family when this really rude employee answered and was very unprofessional. He wouldn't even give me basic information without a very bad attitude. I suggest going to flamingo pizza instead they were very professional regardless of the time of the night. Avoid this place rude employees and worse service.
