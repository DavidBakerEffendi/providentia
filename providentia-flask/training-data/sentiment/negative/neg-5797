Service was very slow and food was mediocre. My family and I ordered the clams, wonton noodle soup, and chicken on BBQ pork dish. The clams did not taste fresh and the noodles in the soup were over cooked and they 'forgot' the BBQ dish until the end when we asked for it. Would not recommend eating here TBH.
