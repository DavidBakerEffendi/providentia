Worst Outback I've been too. First time they gave away my order yo wrong client at curbside takeaway. The second time they were understaffed for traffic, provided incorrect rate times and served all the customers first who walked in after I pulled up. What a way to spend a Friday watch as they walk away with your card that's waiting for you to sign after waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged only to be told it might have been faster if I went in and didn't participate in their offering of curb side takeaway. Go to the Outback on Chandler Blvd and 54th street. Better service all around. Shame on me for going back a second time to this location. Food was not worth the wait.
