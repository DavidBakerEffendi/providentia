Impressive coffee list and liked the effort they tried to put into their food and roastings. 
BUT....
The management and employees have their head on backwards. 
The food was way overpriced and just meh. The best part was the cheese that came from a local shop just down the street. So I cant even give the credit for that. 

And after a lengthy and exhausting exchange between the owner about setting up a roasting/tasting (that ended up being cancelled) I will never spend another dime there ever again.
And not only that I openly encourage others to find a more stable minded and accountable business that doesnt turn coffee into such a stressful experience.
