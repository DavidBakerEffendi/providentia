I would have given them 0 stars if it were possible. I ordered 2 sandwiches and kids chicken fingers, I was quoted a 45 min delivery time which would have been ok since I ordered it early in the evening. After 45 min I called and they said it was on the way, after an hour I called back and the girl on the phone said " It should be right there." After 1 hour and 20 Min I called again to cancel my order, no apology what so ever. It was the first and the LAST time I will order anything from this disgrace of a business.
