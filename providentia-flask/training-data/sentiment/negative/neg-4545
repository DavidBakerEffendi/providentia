So, I missed something here...mainly flavor.  I was  really confused because the ratings for this place are solid.  The two guys running the place were nice and seemed to be working their butts off. But I can't get over the fact that my pulled pork burrito with noodles tasted like nothing, absolutely nothing.  I didn't have Mexican or Asian flavors.  I took a bite and had to stare at the burrito to remember what I was eating.  I was disappointed and gave up after the second bite.
