Contrary to my fellow Yelpers, I had a really rotten experience at Canteen. Canteen is an upscale Mexican bistro, located in a restored building on the east side of Capitol Square. 

We were served circular corn puffs seasoned with cumin (I guess instead of tortilla chips) as the free appetizer. They were basically giant rice crispy cereal pieces - not exactly amazing. 

Things went downhill fast when my mother ordered the carne asada tacos. She ate most of the taco, which, by the way, tasted average. She happened to cut a piece of the beef in half. The beef was thoroughly raw and the fat wasn't even melted. I have ordered medium rare steaks around the world, but this beef was completely blue/purple - it was downright unsafe. 

The rest of the meal was mediocre-average. The refried beans were dry and stale, but the fried corn was pretty good. 

When I complained to the staff, we got most of our meal for free and we also got a free dessert. My mom had lost her appetite, but I settled on the churros. The dainty churros were tossed into a paper bag (I've seen better presentation at the state fair). These were the worst churros I've ever had. They were completely stale and greasy. They smelled like expired, cheap soybean oil and I had to spit out the small bite I took. 

When I got home (not surprisingly) I had terrible stomach pain. 

The staff took our concerns seriously and it was nice to have a nearly-free dinner, but for god's sake don't go near Canteen.
