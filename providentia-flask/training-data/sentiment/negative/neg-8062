We have been regulars at this pizza place for almost 2 years, only because my mom really enjoys it. But as of late, they can't get a single damn order right. Every single place we go to we request the pizza to be well done so it can be crispy and if the slices are large to double cut it for my mother. The last five times it has not been double cut and it has not been well done, leaving the slices soggy and easily falling apart. The time before that they did not even coat our buffalo wings in sauce leaving us dry husks of chicken wings . I don't recommend this place to anybody, unless your life is already used to disappointments.
