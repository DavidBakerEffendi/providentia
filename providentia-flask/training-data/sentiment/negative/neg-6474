Have stayed many times. Love the rooms and atmosphere. However each time even when asked well ahead of time to reserve the room for me they sell it at a higher price to someone else. Shame since I spend $1000's while there. Limited rooms I know. Old TVs etc. but always comfy. Shame I guess won't come back
