The worst restaurant experience I've had in a while. Food was 3-4 star, service is a 1 and that's pushing it. We were berated for not having a reservation and then part of a huge to do when we asked to just sit at the bar. Calm down, Plum, you aren't some 3 star Michelin restaurant. If even your bar seats are reserved you need to rethink how "good" you are. Then, the bartender could barely say 2 words to us, looked insulted when I asked for more water, and told us an item was out just to sell it to asked favorite patron down the other end of the bar. The bartenders were doing shots with customers, and unless you directly knew them, they were barely making conversation with you. Maybe I'm too old (28) but if you have new people coming wouldn't you work to attempt you be kind to have them come back? This was an experience I don't need to have again.
