I have eaten here 3 times now.  Each time, the owner has helped out at the cash register.  And, every time, the owner has been extraordinarily rude.  It's a shame because the sandwiches are quite good.  When met with such poor customer service, it far outshines the product that is being put out.  Due to this alone, I will never eat there again.  And, I will be certain to inform everyone I know of the way the owner talks to his customers.
