I'm not quite sure what it is about this location but every chain that has tried to make a go of it here seems to fail miserably and I'm afraid that Great Wall Buffet will be the next in a long line of casualties.

Over the last several months I've seen this place deteriorate drastically to the point where, when I came here last night for dinner, I was hard-pressed to find something that was actually edible.

The quality and selection of their food has gone completely downhill and I no longer consider this restaurant to be worth the time or money... even with the 2 for 1 coupon.

I suspect their days are numbered.
