We heard great things about this restaurant (elsewhere than yelp) so we decided to check it out.  We should have turned the other way when we saw the filthy walls behind the BBQ butcher area but the menu sounded good and figured the portions would be huge.  We were sat and ordered the BBQ duck/pork combination and a plate of sweet and sour chicken. The food came out almost too soon and in super tiny portions (I'm suspicious they gave us the leftovers of someone else's order). The pork was dry and no better than the usual stuff you get on the side at every chinese restaurant. The duck was the most depressing part of the meal: almost all bone and skin on a tiny plate. The chicken wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. All of it was mediocre at best. My boyfriend ate most of it because he was starving but I just nibbled at the food. We will not be coming back here.

After being totally disappointed and wanting to get out of there as quickly as possible we looked at the bill and they had charged us for the rice that came with our meal without even asking us if we wanted it. What chinese restaurant charges you for rice with sweet and sour chicken? They took it off the bill, literally pulled the rice off our table and brought it back to the kitchen (probably to serve to another guest). 

Our bill was $28 and the food was just enough to feed one person. My boyfriend is already getting hungry again and it's been about an hour since we left. My boyfriend suspects racial bias was the culprit here. 
The plates being served to all the asian guests looked better and bigger than ours did. I think we got the worst part of the duck as well.

All in all I wish we would have gone to Ichiza down the street. :-/
