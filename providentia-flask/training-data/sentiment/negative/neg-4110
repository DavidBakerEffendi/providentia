This is only based on the restaurant's location and hours. The location is not very good (unless you go to the college it is located at perhaps). I went here thinking it would be a regular Chili's but it is in fact a special campus location with unusual hours. It was annoying to get to and park, and the place was closed anyway. Beware the different hours in summer! It's not open during normal meal times and the hours here and on their website don't reflect the summer hours so it is probably a good idea to confirm that it's open before wasting your time (and money on parking) going down there.
