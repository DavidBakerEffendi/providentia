Please please please do not be fooled by the vibrant red, yellow and greens of the Jamaican flag splashed upon the front of this  establishment seemingly beckoning you in.  Your mind will inevitably associate them with melodic reggae music and spicy soulful Caribbean cooking known the world over for tantalizing taste buds, and 9/10 times this association is valid.  The Jerk Spot is a definite exception. 

Like many others reviewing The Jerk Spot I do feel a tad guilty about slamming it so as the staff are fantastic.  Yet even the best staff known to man can't save this place from the unpalatable monstrosities that they try to pass off as Caribbean cuisine.

First off the fetid smell that assails your nostrils upon entering can gently be described as a combination of bleach, excrement and rotting carcass.  I know what others may be thinking...why even try food from such a place.  I thought that I would try and follow the old adage and not judge a book by its cover, or in this case an eatery by its smell.  Yet I should have trusted my innate olfactory abilities and avoided consuming anything associated with such a stench.

My Roti was a combination of chicken skin, gristle, ground up chicken bones and what I can only assume were small twigs.  Needless to say I took one bite and proceeded to look for the nearest trash receptacle.

I reserve hope that The Jerk Spot hasn't spoiled the opinion of novice Caribbean foodies whose first encounter may have been less than stellar, for as a seasoned vet, I know that the Jerk Spot is a horrific exception and in no way reflects true Island cooking.
