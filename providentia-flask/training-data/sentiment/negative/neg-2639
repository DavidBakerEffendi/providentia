This place is awful. We were here with two other friends and the service was awful. The guy completely forgot about one order and  never checked in on us for about 30 mins. When we finally asked where my boyfriends tacos were he said they ran out of tortillas. They weren't even going to tell him. Because we were waiting for his entree the rest of ours got cold. I ate half of my turkey burger and it was so salty. Then my friend ordered a coors light and he brought us a blue moon. He then took the blue moon away when we corrected him. He then said we can have one on the house and brought us the old beer back. Dirty plates were left on our table the entire time and he never refilled our drinks. He then said he took the tacos off the bill. When I looked at the bill it only took $5 dollars off the $10 worth of tacos. This server was awful and they took no pride in customer service.
