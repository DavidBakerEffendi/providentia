Horrible customer service! Stayed as a guest and me and my husband were sick. I called to place a take out order and room service and all they could say was " sorry, we don't do room service & we only do in person orders for take out and were really busy".  This was around 9:30 pm, not too late. Ummm.. So they're saying their too busy for me.  Wow! I have stayed at numerous hotels in Vegas from high end to average and never had this type of response from customer service / hostess from any Restraunt/hotel. The room service wasn't any better and gave the same response. As it is the prices are high  for restraunts at  an average hotel , so I would have a high expectation from customer service!!! I'll never eat or stay their again !
