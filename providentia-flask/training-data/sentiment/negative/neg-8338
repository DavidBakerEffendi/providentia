Worst experience that's for sure! I don't understand why but the younger kids start to stare at you as if there's going to be a fight. Our shisha was over within 20mins and they didn't bother to replace it. Under age staff and costumers. It's weird that Drake goes here. You have to pay up front, they give you a number which they forget and uncomfortable furniture.
