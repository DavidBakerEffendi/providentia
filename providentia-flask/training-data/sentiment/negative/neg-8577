Terrible customer service, particularly the hostess. 

 They told us a table would be ready in 40 minutes so we went for a quick bite to eat two doors down. As soon as we put in our order we got a text from them saying we had ten minutes to get there. I texted back asking if we could have the next table.  Instead the hostess put us at the bottom of the list. When we arrived we were told it would be a thirty minute wait.

After an hour of waiting I asked for an update and the hostess was very curt and rude.  After an hour and a half of waiting the same bad-attitude hostess told us they were having capacity issues and that we had to wait outside in the cold.

I've spent hundreds of dollars at this place and bring game groups of up to ten or eleven players. This place will never see another dollar from us.

The rude and incompetent hostess wasted the Friday evening of six people, some of whom traveled one hour to get here, only to end up waiting for 2.5 hours and then being rudely kicked out into the cold.
