Horrible desserts, and service wasn't that great. My husband threw up after eating the "I like it that way" on a waffle. The bananas were not ripe and the chocolate sauce was chunky and the presentation was poor. He felt sick immediately after eating. The waiter had no knowledge of the food nor the ingredients. He brought a dessert and told us it had a nutella sauce but then said it was regular chocolate sauce after we reminded him that particular dessert was to have no nut products. We tried something new as an alternative to Demetres, however, we won't be coming back here again.
