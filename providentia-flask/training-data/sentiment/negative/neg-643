I see people sitting in Jitters' chairs outside all the time and I like the decor so I really, really want to like this place but the first time was the last time. The service was horrible and their coffee didn't taste great. I waited for ten minutes at least before the two people manning the cashier/bar before I was paid attention to and serviced as they were busy chatting with one of their friends who had stopped in. After getting my coffee, they were low on the sugars and milks and other fix-ins so was not pleased even further, especially for what I paid for a small coffee.
