I hate giving a 1 star rating, but here is the experience or lack of.

The food was "unique" to say the least.  The server said and I quote "it's a new chef and his dishes look really great".  To bad the new chef didn't put a lot of emphasis on the quality part.

The pasta primavera was, unfortunately to say, nothing short of inedible.  Pasta that was under cooked, a sauce that was non existent and literally no taste at all.  Basically horrible.

My significant other had the fish tacos.  Now I've had a few fish tacos in my life, and this was basically deep fried fish in a tortilla with tartar sauce.  No kidding!!!  We sent it back as it wasn't anything like the menu described.(way way to much breading and not a hint of spice or seasoning).

There was only one female server who seemed disinterested in the customers and more focused on talking with another server.  Tried to rationalize how the fish tacos where really good and "if I was sure I wanted to send them back?".     

So quick recap- service not good, food horrible and I don't even want to go into the Jack and Coke that was again "unique" but not in a good way.
