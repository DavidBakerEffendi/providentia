Pizza Heaven = Service Hell
I had not heard of this place and decided to take a chance on it because they had a Groupon. We ordered our dinner and asked for the starter dinner salad add on as a Caesar. 30 minutes after we ordered (with less than 50% of the restaurant filled), I asked where the starter salad was and was told that it would be out soon. It was delivered 10 minutes later and was a huge dinner salad. It looked great and I commented that this was a huge salad for a starter. The server told me that it was not the starter salad, it was the entree salad. I asked why I received this when I asked for the add on to the entree. She said that the Caesar was not the same add on and I would have to pay for the entree salad. I asked why she would assume that we wanted the entree when I asked for the $1.75 starter with Caesar dressing and she said that a Caesar wasn't an option and they only had the entree salad. She took it back without an apology and brought back a really small bowl salad with a small portion of Caesar on the side. Dinner came out burned and hard to cut with a knife, but after 45 minutes we weren't about to send it back. The food was ok, but nothing to note. Then we got the check and the dinner salad was $2.75. When we inquired why it was $1.00 more than the menu price, our server said that Caesar Dressing is a $1.00 up-charge (more than 50% upgrade) for the salad. Our table was blown away by the fact that there was an up-charge for a standard dressing, especially after the long wait and attempt to charge full price for the error that our server made. We paid the full price for everything and let her know that the service was horrible. She seemed to really not care and let us leave without offering to speak to a manager or an apology. BE WARNED: This place has ok food, but horrible service that really doesn't care if you like it or come back.
