Went here late night/early morning and it was a disaster. Was with a group of 6 with one woman who was Jewish and wearing the required snood for her religion. We were all settled in and enjoying the fireside when the waitress informed our friend she couldn't sit on that side of the restaurant because of her head covering. So they told her she would have to sit on the ice side, which none of us wanted to do. We were outraged! We understood we were sitting 3 ft away from a fire pit that was in the center of a pool. We are all over the age of 26, did they think we were gonna play with fire? Even though we had already placed our orders we left and will never return.
