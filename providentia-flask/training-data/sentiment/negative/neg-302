This was my first time at an irish pub/restaurant. I'm sad to say it was a pretty crappy experience. 

We ordered the Blarney fries ($14) and the Rover Bites ($10).  Blarney fries were like still white (not fried long enough). And for some reason they were kinda warm rather than hot. We were the only people in the restaurant at like 3pm, so I'm not sure how they managed to pull off the "kind of warm" food.

The cheese they put on top is like Cheez Whiz...very low quality stuff that comes out of your fridge. Then it was loaded with a buncha crap they chopped up and threw on top. You can make the stuff at home (and a better well prepared version) but then again you wouldn't want to.

The rover bites were interesting. At least I would recommend this one.

The waitress took forever to come take our order and then for us to pay when we were literally the only customers in the restaurant.
