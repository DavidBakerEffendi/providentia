Tried to eat here for Mother's Day. Got the fact that it is a holiday weekend, but come on, 30 mins to wait for your meal at a bakery?? We left. And saw many others leave as well. Lots of $$s to lose. I have been to Panera's across the country. They are very good. This facility is letting down the entire company.
