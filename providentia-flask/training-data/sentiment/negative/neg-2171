Save your money and don't go here. My boyfriend and I made a (mandatory) reservation at 6 o'clock and got there a little early. The doors were locked and the lobby lights were dark. We were greeted and sat at 6. Apparently they don't open at 5 like the website says. The soups at the buffet looked old as if they were microwaved from the night before and the salad didn't look very fresh either. Steaks came out fast but everything was over cooed and burnt, even when asked how we liked our Steaks cooked. The last meat to come was the filet which was hands down the best but when we asked for more I saw the owner yelling at the meat guy after giving us 3 additional pieces.
We did purchase a Groupon and it advertised dessert for 2. When we were finished with our meal we were expecting to have the dessert suggested to us but instead we received a bill for our soda. I asked about the dessert and she said it was the fruit at the buffet. And when I looked at the bill we were charged  $12 for 2 12 ounce cans of sprite. Keep in mind we asked for iced tea and she said it was no good. What?! So I'm being charged an insane amount for something I really didn't even want. It was safer than drinking the water that tasted like it was straight from Lake mead.
I'm an advocate for family owned and operated restaurants but I also work hard for my money and would have been more satisfied and treated better at Texas de brazil  (which is 5 miles down the road). 
I read reviews on yelp all the time and when I read the previous ones from this particular restaurant I didn't expect it to be as horrible as read but no one is exaggerating when it comes to this steak house.
