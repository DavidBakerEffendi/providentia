Doesn't even deserve the one star.

I don't generally give bad review's, but my experience here was inexcusable.

Service was horrible, with a forced smile from the waitress only when giving us the bill. Waited on table bread for 1 hour, but it never came. Restaurant wasn't busy at all, but our appetizers took 75 minutes to come out. Followed by two flavorless pies with the least amount of toppings possible, even for a Neapolitan style pizza.

Save your money, and stick to the pizzerias that do it best in this city. Queen Margarita, Pizzeria Libretto, etc..
