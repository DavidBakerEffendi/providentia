Hate. This places gives us a hassle every time we are here about having a party of 10. They refuse to push tables together and want to have us sit at separate tables.  

We're here with 11 people for two family birthdays, 3 of our guests are in from california, and once again they're arguing with us about letting us all sit together.  Hey let's have a family birthday dinner and all sit and eat separately! We can catch up next year when you come back from California to visit! No biggie. 

Our waiter was great and we'll take care of him, then it's yeehaw and see ya. 

Sorry Texas roadhouse, this is goodbye. We'll take our hundreds of dollars and go to a place that wants to accomodate its CUSTOMERS instead of arguing with them. I'll never, ever be back.
