We did not try the hibachi here just normal table for some sushi. First turn off point was a cup of hot tea with  "teabag"! Never seen that before at an Asian restaurant. The combination of a teabag and the white cup reminds me of Denny's! 
We are hard core sashimi eaters. Generally when we order 4 Salmon sashimi (total of 8-12) pieces and 2 order of tuna sashimi (4-6) pieces, the chef would guess that we know our fish so they tend to give us a mix of high/low fat salmons. Not here, the pieces were all closer to tail and darker meat. Lastly the pieces of sashimi are half the size of sashimi I had ever seen; way too small (see picture)
The onion soup was good!
