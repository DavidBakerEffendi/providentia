I've been to a few shisha places in the GTA and this by far is the worst.  I'm glad I didn't start shisha here, or else I probably wouldn't give it another shot.  When we walked in, there was a staff member at the front and we clearly were wondering if there was any empty tables and he literally just stood there staring at us. I didn't know he was staff until we walked up to the counter. 

They dont have any menus... it's literally a piece of paper taped to their front counter and you choose your shisha flavour.  I don't think they offer any food (looks like most ppl were bringing their own food in) and unlike most other shisha places there's no special drinks.  

The place is super super dirty.  It took me a long time to sit semi comfortably.  The seats are all burned, our table had a missing marble piece, and spilled coffee (or what looked like coffee) on it and the window ledge was full of dust and ash.  I can't believe how poorly maintained it was. 

The music was too loud for my liking. And very random, sometimes played super quiet, other times blasted.  It also sounded like it was played from someone's phone because you can randomly hear text messages come in. 

It is cheaper than other shisha lounges - which may be why they are unkept. But I still was extremely disappointed. I'd rather pay an extra 10.00 and feel greeted and comfortable sitting where I am, than feeling unwelcomed and grossed.
