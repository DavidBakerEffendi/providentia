I am from Chicago, new to the area and obviously am struggling to find comparable pizza. I found you on Google. I called to see if you have slices because I'm short on time. I arrive at the store on Ray and McClintock this afternoon - Thursday, April 14, 2016 at 1:20 PM to grab a slice. I walk in and the employee was cleaning and talking to another patron, no acknowledgement of my standing there until I cleared my throat. She then said "I'll be right with you". So I waited and I watched while she continued to wipe down the condiment bottles and pull out the cheese shakers and other shakers that where half filled. She placed them on the counter and I thought...finally, maybe she'll take my order. I'm the only person waiting so, she could get. Back to that. BUT NO! She had to spray down the table and wipe it, while I was still waiting to order. I count a total of 4 customers (as I sit in your parking lot to write this) all of whom are already served. I looked at her while she was spraying and wiping tables and I asked "REALLY?". To which she said nothing. So, I laughed and said, "it's ok...I'll just go somewhere else where they want my business". I walked out without so much as a word from her. Is it because I'm Black? I don't play the race card but that's the only obvious difference between me and the other 4 patrons in the establishment. I would like to think it was just poor service but I'm trying to find a real reason for the lack of service. Is my hair too short, am I too tall? What makes it ok to make me wait while you perform your other duties. She wasn't knee deep in anything, she was WIPING DOWN The condiment area. Why not take my order then come back to that? Again, I was patient until she decided that she needed to wipe tables NO ONE was waiting to use, and there was no one behind me. Nice impression. I'm sure I'll find some place else to try. THANK YOU?!
