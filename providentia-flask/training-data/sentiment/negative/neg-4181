Just had dinner at Lotus, haven't been in a while since they open that new buffet next to Big Lots however wanted some crabs legs so decided to go. First off the crab legs taste like it had been soaking in water for 2 days. I complained about it the manager came over and said there was a fresh batch coming out...That was not the reason I will never set foot into that place again....got my 6 year old cookie & cream ice cream noticed something pink when we were scooping it out but thought it was some strawberry ice cream. While eating the ice cream my daughter took a pink fake finger nail out of her mouth, I was so disgusted. Brought it to the attention of my waiter but rather than offering an apology he ask who's nail that was...I looked at him "like you cannot be serious" he then said kids get their own ice-cream all the time without supervision so it may have come from a kid. Clearly that was an adult finger nail...We quickly paid and got out of there...what if my daughter had swallowed this nail? They never even got rid of the ice cream container that dirty fake finger nail was it....Never again!!!
