(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I was really craving a sub that day so I decided to try Vietnam Sub and Grill since most Vietnamese restaurants in the area didn't serve it. I can't really say much about this place, but based on first impressions this 'mom and pop' shop is disorganized with take out boxes piling up in the back. It is also very cramped where majority of the restaurant is taken up by their kitchen. You have a choice of take out or stay in, but there weren't very many seats (about 2-4 near the door). 

You can order pho (Regular $9.50; Large $10), subs ($6-$7), vermicelli ($10), and even bubble tea. This is really expensive for Vietnamese food, especially their subs.

I decided to get the cold cut and beef sate sub. The cold cut was pretty bland but the beef sate was full of flavour and the meat was moist. Along with a yummy soy sauce/mayo mix, it made for a tasty sub. However, I couldn't get over the fact that the bread was soggy, stale, and tough to eat. I was just so disappointed and annoyed.

Although there aren't many choices for Vietnamese/Pho in the area (I can count about 3-4), I wouldn't recommend you come here.
