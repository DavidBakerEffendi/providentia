Updating my original review:
My son and I decided to have dinner here last week and were beyond disappointed, not just with the food but with the service as well. We weren't treated very nicely, an afterthought really. Felt it was because we were dressed down a bit and weren't ordering the pricier meals. We both decided on pasta dishes that turned out to be very poorly done. No one ever came back to refill our water and the check was dropped off tableside without asking if we wanted dessert (it was a special occasion, we were up for it, but it wasn't offered). Very cold service, even paying the check. We left feeling mistreated and won't forget this experience. 

Decided that we won't be back and will share our experience here, as well as with friends & family so they can avoid being treated this way as well. Sad. We're southside locals and it's disappointing to not be able to support a restaurant on our side of town.
