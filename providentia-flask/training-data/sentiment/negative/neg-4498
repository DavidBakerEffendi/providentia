Ha. Hahahahaha. HA!

Hilarious performance art masquerading as an Italian restaurant. I get it - I just had no idea that the Charlotte art scene had gotten so avant garde. 

No? You're telling me this place isn't an elaborate prank on unsuspecting diners? Well dang. Then this might just be the single worst Italian dining experience from a local Italian restaurant I have ever had. From the service to the overpriced mediocre food to the atmosphere this place is a total and complete bust. 

The server we had was completely unhelpful and literally wouldn't take our appetizer order until we ordered the entire meal because they were "really busy and couldn't handle it." (Yes, really, a direct quote. Mind you that all the tables weren't even full and this was a Friday evening...so I don't even understand what would happen if you went on a less staffed night.) The food was horrible from the appetizer to the entree and we couldn't even stomach risking spending another penny on dessert because the entire meal was so blah. I don't know if it's policy or not at this restaurant but my water was brought out and never once filled again, and looking around at the other tables this was the case for them as well. 

The inside is a weird combination of decorations and the outside patio sits right in the middle of a parking lot...no ambiance in either location. 

I could probably go on and on and on about how horrible this place is but the bottom line is this: avoid at all costs. Hell, go buy a bottle of Ragu at the next door Harris Teeter and save yourself the money and agony of dining at this establishment. I can assure you you wouldn't notice the difference.
