I went here on Saturday with my daughter, waiting on my son to arrive 10 mins after us. I was told that we could t be seated until he got there. I told the young lady at the front that we were going to start ordering appetizers and drinks straight away but she said it was against company policy to seat us if our full party wasn't present. I again told get we weren't just going to sit at the table and wait for him, we were going to order right away. She refused to seat us. We left and went to Red Robin instead.  I thought it was bad customer service. Neither i or my son, who goes there often with his friends, will ever go there again.
