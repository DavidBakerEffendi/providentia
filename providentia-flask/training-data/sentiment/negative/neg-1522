Chicken and Noodles Chinese Restaurant has been in Scarborough for over 20 years.

Compare to other chic, nicely decorated restaurant, Chicken and Noodles really reminds me of Chinatown.. or places back in the 80s where disposable plastic covers were used as lining on the tables, people going to Chinese restaurants because the food is cheap and one can expect to be served by waitstaffs that has quite an attitude.

The menu has quite a vast selections of Cantonese/Thai/Malaysian/Japanese inspired dishes... I don't know if that is good or not....Everything here is cheap... comparable to food court prices. Wonton Noodle soup for $3.95 is not easy to find up at a sit down restaurant anymore. A Hanoi Chicken with rice combo that comes with soup and rice for $6.95. Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup for $4.95. 

Mon- Fri they have specials when you order over $25 before tax, you get half of their famous chicken for $1. That for sure a bargain if you are eating with a group.

I ordered the shrimp dumplings noodles soup ($3.95) and chinese broccoli in beef brisket sauce ($3.95). The vegetables arrived first.. such a big portion, I feel full even looking at that.. The noodles though I found the shrimp dumplings are really tasty stuffed with tons of shrimps, however the broth is quite salty... (full of MSG??)

Found here everything is sticky. The outside of the condiments bottles are sticky, the menus are sticky...  The floors are sticky .....OK I am grossed out...

Sorry I won't be back... Please don't ask me to go back!!

Though, the place is fully packed for lunch on Friday with No lunch Specials.
