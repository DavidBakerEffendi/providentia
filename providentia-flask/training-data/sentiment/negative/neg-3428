I used to LOVE this place. My family and I went in on a Friday night, the place was not full and they were not that busy. We had a party of 5 and sat in a corner booth. We sat for roughly 20 minutes and was not acknowledged by any staff. One of the waitresses was pregnant and was waiting on a table right in front of us. She ignored our party several times and didn't say hello, I'll be right with you NOTHING!! I never had this bad of service here. This was a surprise to me. We ended up walking out, we didn't even get to order drinks, sad part is no one noticed us leaving. I'm so disappointed in this establishment.
