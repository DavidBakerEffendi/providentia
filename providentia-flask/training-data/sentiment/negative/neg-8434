Decided to give Mizu a shot after seeing such great reviews. The place is in Parma in a small strip mall. It definitely appeared to be a possible hidden gem, but I was sadly disappointed. 
My friend ordered an iced tea to drink. It tasted old and slightly off - so we were off to a bad start. We ordered two house salads. The iceberg lettuce was wet and yellowish. The ginger dressing was watery - it was like watered down lettuce soup. 
We tried a little of everything. For sushi we ordered the sweet potato tempura roll, unagi, yellowtail and the spider roll. The sweet potato roll was fine, you can't mess that up. But the fish - it was just off. It was clearly not fresh. The soft shell crab in the spider roll was straight up fishy. So fishy, that my friend spit it out. 
Third course was vegetable udon noodles. It was flavorless and mushy with raw chunks of broccoli and canned baby corn. 
Our server was very friendly and did a good job, but the food was just bad.
