One of the worst Pandas I've been to. Walked in and asked to sample one the of featured chickens at the front and then the guy proceeded to tell me they are out of that one for the day already... at noon???!!?? Oh okay. So I proceed to build my plate and go around to the entrees and they were basically out of every except like two or three pieces of each thing. The only thing that was full was orange chicken and I asked oh do you have more coming or a fresh batch of this or that coming and the guy just looked at me and didn't say anything. I said repeatedly wow you are out of everything. I would love to have something other then orange chicken but clearly your don't feel like doing anything so I guess I end up with double orange chicken as my sides. I sat down and watched as more and more people came in and looked at the options all saying the same thing like well um I guess I have orange chicken. I'm not what the issue is but when it's noon on a Sunday afternoon you can expect a large crowd and lots of orders so get to work and get some food out. Definitely won't be back to this location especially when there's one up the street in the San Tan village area. Most likely with better service and food.
