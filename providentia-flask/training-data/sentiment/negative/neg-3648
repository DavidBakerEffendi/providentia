They can't even get your order right. Kitchen is new & cant even get an ahi Tina salad or veggie burger right. They try to compensate with a comp desert or appetizer after eating when trying to eat healthy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Same thing happened last time I was here & thought I'd give them a 2nd chance.
