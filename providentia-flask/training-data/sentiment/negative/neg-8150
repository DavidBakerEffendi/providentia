Overall our group was very disappointed when trying Mezzo.  A majority of us had tried Emporio and Il Tetto prior to trying Mezzo.  It reminded me of a butcher in the rye that has BAD pizza and a limited drink menu. We waited 2 hours to be seated so we grabbed drinks at il Tetto. 

Service

The service was very subpar, which I was surprised to see all of the great reviews regarding service on Yelp. The waitress had an attitude and everyone at our table noticed.  The food runners provided better service than the actual waitress. I believe she asked our table maybe once or twice for refill of drinks. Our group had to ask multiple times for refills of water.

Atmosphere

A very small space- Do not go with large groups.  The d√©cor reminded me of Butcher and The Rye.  The music is very loud so the waiters/waitresses have to scream over top of it when trying to explain the menu.  This place feels very out place in between the other two floors as it I felt like they were trying to make it more formal than the other floors.  The drink menu is very limited so do not expect to get the same drinks that you were getting at Ill Tetto. 

Food

Our group ordered a variety of different pizzas and a few appetizers. The appetizers were not bad but thought they were a little pricey for what they were offering.  Honestly, this was probably some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  The sauce is not very good.  A few of the pizzas were extremely salty and everyone in our group noticed this. There were 8 of us in the group and not one of us were impressed.  You cannot take anything off any of their pizzas and can add a few listed items to them. I've never tried the location in market square so I cannot compare, but I obviously compared it to il pizzaiolo which is on an entirely different level than Mezzo.  The cookies at the end might have been the best part of our meal.
