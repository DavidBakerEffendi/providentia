Don't ever go here they are slow and don't care about the patrons. Food wasn't bad but nothing to write home about and with over a hour wait for food when there is barely anybody in the restaurant is unacceptable. And complaining didn't help anything but my peace of mind so save yourself some time and money. Not worth it not even worth a star but I can't rate it any lower I wish they had a middle finger emoji to put in this review smh.
