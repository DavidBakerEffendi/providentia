One star for the ambiance, but don't even bother ordering anything off their drink menu. It's a Tuesday night and they're literally out of everything. The server listed way too many drinks they were out of, and when we made a comment, she said this was better than any of the other nights. Then she threw out a comment saying they haven't been carrying most of the drinks on the menu. Again, it's a Tuesday night. I suggest they re-print their menu with the drinks they actually do have, and spell "Dos Equis Ambar" correctly. Also, my friend ordered a Dierks Dram, hence their name, and the server came back saying they were not able to make that because they're out of bourbon. As I'm typing this, bartender came by and we thought he was gonna say they were out of another drink, but instead said their French 75 has a strong whiskey taste so he wanted to make sure "the drink wasn't for a girl." French 75 does not have whiskey in it and how offensive was that comment?!!! How is this place open?!???
