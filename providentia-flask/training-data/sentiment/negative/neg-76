A fancy place like Bellagio but their buffet is weak. Not many things tasted good. Meat at the carving stations were all dry and overcooked. No crab legs for lunch, even though Aria has them for lunch and it's the same price. 

We came during the breakfast and lunch change. They kept putting out more pancakes, waffles, french toast, but didn't bring out lunch items until past 11:30.

Stations were all crowded and bottlenecked. No clear lines with many people cutting.

Condiments should be next to the food you eat them with. How come there was no cream cheese for the smoked salmon? There wasn't even any next to the bagels.

Dining room itself looked very outdated. I expected a lot more from Bellagio. For this price I would never come here again and would rather go to Aria instead.
