Wow...Let me start off with letting you know I have been a cook for 25 years and  I understand everything that goes on in the industry.  I just picked up a Mac n cheese and a pizza  and unfortunately the Mac and cheese hit the ground and half of it spilled onto the parking lot at my car.   Shit happens.  I picked it all up and went back in and asked if they could replace it.  The manager said he couldn't replace it without charging for it again because "they made it right."  Menu price is $5.49. Oregano's cost?  Maybe $1.   Never once in 25 years in any kitchen have I said that we couldn't or wouldn't replace it without charging, because we appreciated our customers and their business .  Would you charge me twice if my 4 year old knocked it on the ground and were at a table?  Or if your server dropped it?   The idea that you are ok with me delivering sub-par parking lot spiced Mac and cheese tells me many things.  Mainly you don't care about your job, your reputation or your food.  I have many friends in the industry and this story will go long and far.  Enjoy.
