This review is for the PGA Tour Grill Express. Yes, the "to go" option. I paid $11-14 for a chicken sandwich and fries. I think a McDonald's chicken sandwich would have more flavor. It took 15 minutes which seems like a bit long. I ordered the "guacamole black bean chicken sandwich" and it was like 1/4 teaspoon guacamole, black bean sauce and a grilled chicken patty and that's it. Don't waste your time and money, go somewhere else in the airport.
