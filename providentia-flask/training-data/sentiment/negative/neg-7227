The food wasn't awful, but the price is far too high for what you get. Individual tacos start at $3 ... Seriously?

Our waiter, while nice and pretty up on refilling drinks, was otherwise terrible. He took the order wrong, blamed it on us for not being clear enough, leaving two out of three of us waiting another half hour for our desired meals. Then when the bill finally came, which was a really long time coming, the mistaken items still appeared on the tab. After talking with the manager those excess charges were removed.

But then again with the TVs turned up so loud you have to shout at each other to have simple conversation, it's no shock that the waiter got the orders mixed up.

Dinner here was a real comedy of errors. When a waitress brought us a basket of sliders and dropped them, pulled pork and tinga chicken splattering across the table, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity.
