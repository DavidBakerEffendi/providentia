Assuming the other reviews are correct, this place has completely changed.  There is no tasting menu.  There is no soda list.  There is no sommelier with champagne cart.  There is no sommelier, period.  We also heard rumors of caviar carts, cognac carts, and dessert carts.  Nope. Not there anymore. The place was obviously designed to be a fine dining restaurant with the excessive chandeliers and all.  But it is NOT fine dining.  

But they do serve chicken wings and quesadillas!  Looks like they are trying for the typical 24-hour cafe at any casino-resort.  Except they don't have a casino, so that probably ain't gonna work.

If you are looking for fine dining or just decent food, stay away.  They apparently did not get enough business and have decided to cut serious corners.
