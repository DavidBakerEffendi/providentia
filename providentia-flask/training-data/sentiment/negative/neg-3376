This place is so hit or miss. We brought friends here and experienced TERRIBLE service. We were so embarassed for  bringing them here.

Our waiter was... Drunk? High? He was super slow and had slurred speech. It was hard ordering anything. Then he messed up the beers, and when we commented about it he started sticking HIS NOSE inside the cups!! Like TOUCHING the inside of the rim with his nose, and tipping the cup in a way that the liquids touched his nostrils a bit. He was trying to tell if he'd served the wrong beer or not.

The food that night was awful too. The phily bomb was SO tiny and bad.
