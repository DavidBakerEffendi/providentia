Very disappointing experience just now at Cien. We are in town from St Louis and were craving Mexican. Got to Cien around 8:35. Hostess told us the only 2 top table was upstairs and "feel free to go up there." We sit at an open table. 5 min later a server asks us if we were seated there, we told her hostess said pick a table. She said we need to go back downstairs to tell the hostess we sat there? So we did. Hostess said "ok great." Didn't give us menus or any further direction. No more acknowledgment from the server back upstairs. So we moved to a high top (it was dirty but only one available) thinking the bartender would serve us there. A busser got the dishes from the table and we were still not acknowledged by any server. At this point it was 8:55 and we decided to leave. No waters, no menus, no acknowledgment. Honestly pretty unbelievable.
