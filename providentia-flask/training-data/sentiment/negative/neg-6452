Oh my goodness. I ate a lot of the asian dishes at the buffet such as the seaweed salad, sushi, and soup. Well, it tasted decent at the time. But, when I got back to my hotel...I soon discovered I got food poisoning. It was horrible! I was running to the bathroom all night long. I suggest you avoid the buffet. It was a terrible night. This was in late August 2015, around the 25th.
