Wow, so much bad food. I would rather them have half the options and twice the quality. I went with a buddy for lunch, it became a game of "who can find something that tastes good" - I think we each found 1 or 2 things tolerable - nothing good. I would avoid this place unless you don't mind bad tasting food.
