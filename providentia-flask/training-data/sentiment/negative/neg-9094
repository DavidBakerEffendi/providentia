Won't go back.   Ate in the "dining room" because the patio was booked ( note....tables were empty the entire time we were there).  Dining room was just an extension of the bar...music was loud and made difficult to chat around a booth seating arrangement.  
Food was meh.  First burger was over done and poor. Shrimp caeser salad was ok...however several of the shrimp were still grey in color and not cooked.  Replaced burger with French Dip.   Better..but kept having to ask for the dipping sauce they forgot.  
There is a reason why this place was half empty..and the rest of the strip malls restaurants were packed.  Lesson learned.  
Will not be surprised if a "for lease" sign goes up soon.  

Listen folks...simple lessons...good food...differentiate your seating based on areas, and when you have to keep apologizing...send the manager over to actually do something about it.  No one is going to speak up when someone glances by and says " everyone ok"?  
Will not be going back....
