I really don't understand the hype. Or maybe I just picked a bad day.  I ordered the traditional enchiladas and a tamale. My food was cold and part of the order was wrong. I love mole sauce but theirs tasted awful - too sweet, cold and no genuine spices. The chicken tamale was dry and hard.  I also ordered a side of beans - they were bland and coming out of the styrofoam box (they have to know that they would spill out-why not use something with a lid???) The place was almost empty yet the food seemed rushed and the staff were not very welcoming.  I stopped here because it was close but next time I'll travel. Usually I'm into second chances...not so much for this place. I won't be back.
