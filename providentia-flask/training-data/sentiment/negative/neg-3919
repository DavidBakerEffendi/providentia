The food here is great, but the service is TERRIBLE.  I have been there twice, and the first time I figured the poor and rude service was a fluke so I didn't write a review.  Well, we gave it another try and again...TERRIBLE service.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him, and walked away before we even finished talking.  We waited 15 minutes for our table, which I wouldn't have minded, but the hostess said they had a table almost ready for us when we walked in.  It took forever to get our bill (hand scratched on a notepad), and we were overcharged for our drinks.  Happy hour prices are awesome and I really do like the food, but because of the poor/lazy/rude attitudes of the wait staff I will not be coming back.  The bus boys were very on top of things, but without a better trained wait staff I don't see why people would come back.  Check out Firefly on the same block for even better food and fantastic service :)
