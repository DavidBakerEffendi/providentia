How do you make a tasteless ice cream sundae?  What a ripoff for ten bucks.  I get that it's the Strip, so the price will be inflated.  But at least make the sundae correctly and don't use flavorless ice cream.  How can I take several bites of a sundae and think to myself "Damn, this is totally bland"??  It's ice cream, hot fudge, and candy for heaven's sake!!  

I threw half of it away.  And the kid making it didn't even seem to know what I had ordered.  He had to take a printed menu, set it down beside him, and refer to it constantly--yet I still received a sundae minus two of the five ingredients, plus one that didn't belong!  He basically just invented his own sundae recipe.  I should have called him on it but my friends were waiting for me.

Aggressively incompetent tourist trap.
