Have tried stopping in for lunch during the week a few times...no one home.  Answer we got when we called during some weekend hour when they were open from someone who "just works here" is that well, sometimes the owner is late and we don't open.  Not that there are people lining up at the door for this place, but how hard is it to state your opening hours and then, well, do something crazy like...be OPEN!  the service has always been marginal at best...and rarely are their other customers the times we've been, but this is horrible customer service.  If not for a ricotta-less lasagna and a coupon I bought that I need to use there, I'd never go back.
