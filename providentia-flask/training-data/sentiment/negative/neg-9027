If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. The first time I went all was well. Our food was good and I got the southwestern chicken bowl and didn't have any complaints. The second time I went I got the same thing because it was good the first time around. The first thing I noticed was that it was missing the delicious lime dressing. But the worst was finding not 1, not 2, not 3...SIX large chicken bones in my chicken that I could have choked on. After the first 3 I took them up to the manager. She proceeded to tell me that they braise and pull apart their chicken in house and that there's always a "small" chance bones  could be in there. No apology, no offer to make me a new meal, no offer to return my money. All she did was dispose of the bones for me. So I guess on the menu it should also say "SMALL CHANCE OF CHOKING ON ANIMAL BONES". She came around later to pick up our plates and asked how our food was. My friend said hers was good but mine was not. The manager then looked at me and said "yeah well her and I already talked" and walked away. If I had choked on these chicken bones (some were more than a couple inches long and had sharp edges), the restaurant would have been at fault. And if they really cared about food quality and not getting sued, they would make sure there wasn't a "small chance" that bones could be in their food. I will never go back to this place and will continue to spread the word about the poor quality food, awful and staff and even worse manager. What a disappointment. Don't eat here unless you like bones in your meals!!!
