I thought the food itself was outstanding, but the cashier added a few items to my bill that I didn't order.  Unfortunately I didn't notice until after I paid, and when I questioned him, he said only a mgr could give a refund.  Coincidentally, the mgr wasn't there, and wouldn't be there for another hour.  So I was told that I was welcome to wait.  Really??!?  WTF?!?!
