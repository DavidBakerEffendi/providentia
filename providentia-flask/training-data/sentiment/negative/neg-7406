Well....I got sucked in. I already dislike Domino's to begin with...But I have been seeing all those commercials where they are bagging on themselves and saying how the pizza is completely new and improved. 

Well that's a load of Horse $h!t. 

We ordered a pizza last night because I am a bad wife and haven't gone grocery shopping. I say to the hubs, hey lets give it a shot. He moans in disgust. I say, well they say its completely new and improved, lets just try it out. 

We ordered on line. That was really cool. You can follow your order in the shop while they are making it. We even knew our delivery drivers name before he got to our door because the update told us his name and that he just left. That's rad...I would give Domino's a 3 just on this alone! 

We ordered their new pizza with the special crust and then new fancy sauce. Kept it simple and just got pepperoni on it. We also got an order of cheese bread sticks and some of there boneless chicken kicker things. 

The chicken kickers were tasty. I really liked the dipping sauce. 

The cheese bread was yummy as well! 

The new fan-dangled pizza....HOLY GROSS!!! Same old Domino's people... 

Do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial. 

The commercial should go more like: 
Hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks. 
So we changed it up and guess what PIZZA STILL SUCKS! 

Our cat that always begs for food didn't even come around asking for pizza. That's pretty bad, that cat will eat anything! In fact, from now on, any take out we get will have a Tuki (our cat) rating on it. 

Tuki gives this zero stars, as he didn't even want it near him.
