I always pass this place and I wanted to give it a try. I will never go back. Order a stuffed pretzel to start it was a pretzel cut in half with cheeses in the middle weird right not what I think when I think stuffed pretzel but not bad. My boyfriend ordered ranch wings with fries and I got chicken strips with potato pancakes, Then we waited a loooonnng time. 
When the food came they gave me fries instead of the potato pancakes I ordered and the chicken strips were aweful all I could taste was burnt grease. At this point I was so disappointed I didn't even want to complain just get out of there. 
Also my boyfriend and I are an interracial couple and were being stared at meanly by many tables which added to an even more upsetting night. I've read other reviews and seen they have a good fish sandwich that would not be enough to get me back in these doors.
