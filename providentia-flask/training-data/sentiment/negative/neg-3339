So although I'm leaving 1 star, I feel I am leaving a complete and honest review. 
So first, the atmosphere was great. Very modern and nice. We had reservations so no wait. 
Then came the bad. It took about 10 minutes before a waitress came to give us water but she wasn't even our waitress. Another 5 minutes passed before they came over. Ordered drinks which took a while. Then ordered food which took over 40 minutes. They cut our bill in half for the wait, but still it just wasn't a pleasant experience. And our waitress had zero personality. The food was maybe a 6 out of 10. Sooo overall while the place was nice; the service and food were not spectacular, especially for the price. Probably will not go back; but guess it was worth a try.
