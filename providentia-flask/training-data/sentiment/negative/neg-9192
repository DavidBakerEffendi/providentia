The line really felt like it was 30 min if not longer.  and yes it's $11 for a foot long.

It was the worst subway sandwich put together.  I watched the guy butcher the bread with his dull knife and sloppily placed the cold cuts and other toppings on top.  It was a mess.  An expensive mess.  I thought it was a good idea to stick to what I know but I was wrong.  If you are in a hurry, skip this place and get something else.  Don't want you to miss your flight!

not only that, their toaster oven was out of order!! ughhhh
