I went to eat lunch here today. I ordered pasta marinara with shrimp and meatballs. Everything was good EXCEPT the shrimp. They were chewy with an intense fishy seafood flavor...which is not normal. I eat a lot of shrimp from other restaurants and they taste just fine. The ones served by Za's are either spoiled or just not prepared right. I went to talk to the manager at the cash registered and he basically didn't care. He asked if I wanted something else and I said no....because I had already eaten my entree. I told him about the situation and he told me, "I don't know what you're talking about, but I'll check it out for you." I was not looking for a refund, all I wanted for them to do was realize that they serve disgusting shrimp.

WARNING: DONT ORDER SHRIMP AT ZAs.....go to red lobster for shrimp because they actually care about the quality of their food.
