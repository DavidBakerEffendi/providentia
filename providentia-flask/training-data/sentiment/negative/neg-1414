I went for lunch on a Thursday - be prepared. This place is small, so it gives the perception of being very busy. But I'd be surprised if they do more than 60-70 covers for lunch. From the time of my order to the time I got my food was over 40 minutes - hard to accept on a one hour lunch break, especially given their limited menu. I ordered the Mushroom Burger - the mushrooms were rubbery - and the burger had the taste of old grease - like the grill wasn't properly cleaned and seasoned. The garlic fries were limp and really didn't have much of a taste other than maybe a little garlic salt/powder. The cost was $11.99. I expected a fresh and tasty burger with crispy garlic fries. I got neither. I can go to Carl's Jr and get the same quality burger and fries for 2-3 bucks less - and much faster. Very disappointing.
