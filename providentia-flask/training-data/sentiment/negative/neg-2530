I walked in and immediately started sweating because of the heat in this Jersey Mikes Restaurant! I noticed all the workers were sweating and they looked miserably hot. I asked one of the guys, "Is the AC not working?" He answered,
"The AC has been broken since July 4, 2018 and the owner Corey refuses to fix the air conditioning."
I couldn't believe my ears! The owner of this franchise will be reported to the Phoenix Department of Labor because the horrible work conditions he is making these poor teenagers work in. He doesn't care about the health of his employees neither does he care about his customers! I was planning to stay and eat in the restaurant, but because of the heat I couldn't! We live in a desert and everyday and night this summer has been over 100 degrees! Shame on the stingy owner Corey and his Billionaire father who lacked on teaching his son the importance of making sure his employees are safe in good work conditions. Please report this to the Phx Department of Labor if you go to this Jersey Mikes and the work conditions are still the same.
