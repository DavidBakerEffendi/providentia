This place has wonderful food and a great beer selection, but the bartender (girl with long brown hair in ponytail, Sara I think) was downright rude and acted as if I was wasting her time by asking for a beer or mushroom bites at the bar. This was enough for me to not come back. She was rude and had a scowl the entire 1.5 hours I was here. All else was good, but my bartender ruined it. Find someone with a smile and more customer service experience. -a customer and fellow bartender.
