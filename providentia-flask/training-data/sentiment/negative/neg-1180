I have eaten at The Guild twice now, once in 2016 shortly after they opened up and it was very average, then again today as we couldn't get into the Cactus Club.  I ordered the brisket, and it was the worst tasting meal I have ever eaten in downtown Calgary.  The meat was extremely fatty, and it looks like a piece of chocolate cake when it comes out, but moves with the consistency of jello.  There was micro sides with the brisket as in leeks and such, but the taste of the brisket was comparable to something you would find in a frozen food grocery store.  The service was weak as well, as the hostess sat us at the very back while we past a dozen empty booths, so I asked for a booth instead and she complied after she walked all the way back to the front counter to verify.  The server also never came back to check in on us during the meal as I would have preferred a side salad to compliment the meal.  For a meal that was so small and pricey at $29, I am glad that I never had to pay for this meal.  The Guild must be a place for overflow for those customers who cannot get into quality restaurants.  This will be the last time I eat at The Guild, regardless who is paying!
