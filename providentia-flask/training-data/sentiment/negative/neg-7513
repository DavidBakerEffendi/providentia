I was really excited for Indian food and always liked the chain. I've never been to this Mississauga location. 

I had the chicken tikka and lamb korma here. The food was pretty standard. However I feel that I got food poisoning from this place!

To top it all off, the service was terrible as I was constantly asking for more water, and was insulted near the end when they came to insistently take the plates I was still working on. It appears there were people waiting for a table and they'd rather take new business than to provide good service to their existing patrons. 

I will not be returning.
