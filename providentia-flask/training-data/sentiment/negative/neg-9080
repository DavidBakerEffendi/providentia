Food just average, neighborhood as descibed but so be it, if you don't like the neighborhood,  no one is going to miss you.
The reason for the one star is that the prices noted on the link to their website are on average 30% lower than the prices they actually charge. 
All in all, I should have asked for a total when I ordered via phone, though I never expected a 30% premium.
I doubt Liyuen will take action to correct this misleading approach.  If they do, I would be happy to reconsider my rating.
