Wow, I so wanted to like this place! Boy, I hated this place. I don't know if they read other yelp reviews about being bland, but my experience was everything was incredibly over seasoned. All I could taste on the schnitzel was pepper. I still can't get the overly sweet and vinegar-y taste out of my mouth from the German potato salad and the sauerkraut. The best thing they had there was the applesauce. Their portions are huge and I am a big portion guy, but I would much have smaller portions made well than a mountain of really bad food. Side note, their menu had a couple of Brat plates that stated they were Johnsonville Brats. Don't get me wrong, I like Johnsonvilles now and again on the grill at home, but I would hope an Eastern Euro place would have something more authentic! Kind of like going to a Mexican Restaurant and have them bring you Tostitos and a jar of Salsa. All that a side, I have always felt Great Service can make up for average food and great food can make up for average service. This place has bad everything. Bad location, bad food, bad service. Seemed like a family that thought they had a great cook in it and then conned all the family elders into playing a role. The people there seem as if they are doing you a favor and could care less how your experience is. No one there has any food service experience at all! Do yourself a favor, go to Little Polish Diner in Parma and get average service and good food!
