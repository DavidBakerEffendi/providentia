This place is sooooo nasty! Ordered from Uber eats and it was really fast but the food is terrible. No flavor what so ever. You are better off ordering room service and paying a pretty penny than ordering from here. My sister, boyfriend and I didn't eat the food since all we got was chicken skin instead of chicken breast. If I could give it no stars I would. Nasty!!! And over priced. Just don't do it. Order McDonald's instead trust me.
