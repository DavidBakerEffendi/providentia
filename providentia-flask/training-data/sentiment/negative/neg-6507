4:30am, in deep sleep, tired and grumpy from losing $$ earlier. Beep and the door swings open. We hear voiceS and think nothing of it. Must be our friend bringing back guest. Out of curiousity I look up and 6 random dudes are standing at the end of my bed. I look over at my friend, who just woke up and said WTF. 

Apparently, Venetian screwed up and double booked our suite. At first they tried to comp us food, then a nights stay. But, we were not satisfied. Just think, if we were not in our suite.. ALL of our belongings could of have been gone. Also.. is this not invasion of privacy? I could have been butt naked coming out of the shower. 

The incident is now under investigation. Will update at a later time.

In addition, our room keys kept malfunctioning. I swear by the end of the trip we had like 20 room keys.. with 4 of them working. We were locked out so many times. Annoying..
