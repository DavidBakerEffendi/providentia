I take ODS shuttles to the airport almost monthly from the Venetian.  Usually there are no issues.  Today we seem to have either a dispatching issue or just confusion.  I showed up 15 minutes early as your supposed to and the driver showed up at roughly 10 til 3.  The driver was polite and greeted us and loaded our bags as usual.  We boarded and began to wait.  It was ten minutes after 3 when I got off and ask the driver when we would be departing.  He said I don't leave until 330.  The issue was we were supposed to depart at 3.  When I ask if we could depart early because the 3pm shuttle did not show up he said no.  While I understand that there could have been a delay elsewhere to prevent the 3 o'clock shuttle from getting there ODS or the driver should have made accommodations to transport the 6 guests to the airport at 3 if the other driver was delayed.  I know there are issues when it comes to transportation but it was the fact of how the driver handled it!  I ask the driver Geb,  if he could ask dispatch to leave early to accommodate the lack of a 3oclock shuttle and he said no I am scheduled to leave at 630. (Even though it was only 320 at the time). I've never had any issues with ODS and hope that this is not a start if unreliable service!
