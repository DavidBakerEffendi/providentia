My husband and I have ordered from Angelina's often, today we ordered for delivery and the order was not correct. The young kid who delivered the food was really nice and went back for our missing tiramisu. My husband ordered the sausage and pepper sub, it was decent. I ordered the cheese ravioli with Alfredo. What a disappointment, the ravioli was greasy, the cheese they used was not good and overall extremely salty. We packed the food back up and drove to the location. The older woman we spoke to must have been the manager or owner. She was nasty and rude, didn't apologize or ask if there was anything she could do to fix the problem. We called the third party company who delivered, they apologized and refunded us our money. We didn't go in there to get free food, we've ordered from Angelina's several times and it has been good. Highly disappointed with the garbage they served us. Never ordering from this place again. Save your self the hassle, go to TRATTORIA ITALIA on Eastern and Ione. Real Italian food and the family who runs this restaurant are professional and very classy people.
