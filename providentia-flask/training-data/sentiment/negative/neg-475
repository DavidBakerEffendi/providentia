Grace O Malley's is one location I despise going in to because the crowd in there is simply not my type. Even most bands that perform here have give me no interest and with nothing special going for this bar be it the lack of a friendly/efficient staff, annoying cover charges, overpriced drinks, large crowds and long wait times at the bar I have to put my foot down and give it that rare one star rating from my end. 

I can't say it's got nothing that's good about it, it's got seats inside....and I must admit that it does cater to a certain niche of people that seems to love it since it's always crowded. 

I believe I've been here twice and you would be hard pressed to find me checking in here anytime in the near future.
