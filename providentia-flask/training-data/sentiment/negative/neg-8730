Waitress took forever, didn't take any of our plates after we ate all of our appetizers, she just moved them and squeezed our entrees on the table. I didn't catch her name but she was really rude and didn't get my mother's order correctly. We were the only people in the place. We got some weird hot pepper starter and did not like it at all. Entrees were ok, I really wanted to like this place but I will not be coming back. Overall food was ok but the service was terrible.
