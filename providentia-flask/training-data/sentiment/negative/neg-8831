Not vegetarian. They recently raised their prices again, the food is decent and I use to like coming here, but after this latest price raise I won't be coming here anymore. 

The cheese isn't vegetarian and probably never will be...I've gotten bean burros with meat in them when I didn't order it that way...it should be obvious to any vegetarian that this place isn't for you. In any case they just lost a long time customer. I should have stopped sooner, oh well lesson learned.
