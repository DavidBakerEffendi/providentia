We love Kneader's! We go to this one most often but we've been to San Tan and even some of the Kneader's in Utah. 

Sorry to say this one dissapoints too often. They are often out of many items on the menu and have never offered a discount for substitutions--after the third time, I asked. Nope. On Wed I was told they were out of mint brownies but yesterday, the girl told us they don't offer mint brownies anymore. :(

The worst part about this Kneader's? A few weeks back, my mom said she got sick and I thought it was an isolated incident. About a week later, i felt sick after ordering a salad. Last night, both my husband and I felt ill from our sandwiches. I think I'm done with this location. I'll make the drive to San Tan.
