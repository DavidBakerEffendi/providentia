The service was terrible. Their gluten free pizza wasn't fully cooked. My water was empty up until the check. And when the chef came out to talk to me about my pizza, he spoke to me as a child and he snapped at me to get off of my phone. I was in the middle of writing an email for work and didn't see him approach the table. I wasn't there during a high volume time and I was alone. My food and meal shouldn't have taken almost an hour. Rude, poor quality food, and will not be returning.
