I wish I could give them 0 stars. I have gone to this place plenty of times and always got the pho. I had been begging my mom to come with me to try the pho and finally one day she agrees. Well turns out none of us out of 4 got the pho but I did order something new to me, the curry shrimp. When ordering the waiter asked if I wanted it spicy since it is not spicy at all I said a little would be ok. My food comes out so spicy it made my eyes water and nose run. My mom decided to try some and was angry that i was eating it and insisted I say something. I told the waiter and he offered to bring me some extra sauce with no spice to help balance it. It didnt help much so I asked for a bit more to go and i would attempt to eat it at home since everyone else was done eating. The manager then tells him I have to pay for the extra sauce. So he offers me to speak to the manager and I do. The manager explains this is how much chili flakes is added to a mild meal and basically people have different opinions on spice level, as if I am just being a baby and my food is not that spicy. He also keeps asking "what do you want me to do there is nothing to do. I told the waiter extra sauce wont help" and starts arguing with my entire table. He was beyond rude I was in shock I had never heard anyone at a place of business speak like this to customers before it was obvious he didnt care about our business at all. He never apologized and did not care at all. It was clear I just had to deal with my inedible food. He made it look like I wanted a free meal, but I just wanted an apology some compassion, something. So we eventually paid and left after all the arguing was done. It was embarrassing and rude I was so excited to take my mom there and that is what happens. I will not return. Oh and the next day my mouth was actually sore from how hot the food was and I did not even finish it.
