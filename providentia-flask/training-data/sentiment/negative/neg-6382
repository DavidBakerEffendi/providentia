Today was my third visit to Cafe 157. The previous two visits were good -- the food is usually tasty. Today, I went for lunch at 1 p.m. with a colleague. The food was good but I was TERRIBLY disgusted by the tall female server with the long, blonde hair who came to the table with a visible runny nose (left nostril, to be exact, and I know this because I could see it as she stood over my guest and I asking for our drink orders), which she wiped with the back of her hand. I would have made a complaint to the management on the spot but I figured they were already aware that she was VISIBLY SICK with a runny nose and cough (and she audibly coughed while serving other customers) and allowed her to work anyway that my complaint wouldn't have made a difference, so I decided to vent my frustration this way. With her contaminated hands she touched my unwrapped straw and the limes that garnished my drink. I also watched her sit in the back of the restaurant and roll silverware into napkins while coughing with an uncovered mouth. TOTALLY DISGUSTING!!! This says a lot about how seriously the restaurant management takes the health and protection of its diners.
