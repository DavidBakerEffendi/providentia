Do NOT go to Salad N Go on 99th and Lower Buckeye. We ordered a wrap and it had a large black bug inside of it. We were so disgusted that we didn't even take a picture. When we went back to make a complaint, the employee had the nerve of saying "poor little guy is still struggling". He wasn't surprised by the bug either and just gave the money back. No sorry or nothing. We couldn't even speak to a manger.
