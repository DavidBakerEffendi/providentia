Very rude staff. You walk in and the place is completely empty absolutely no ambiance lightening is dark and depressing. We tell the waiter we would like to share an entree and he proceed to explain there will be a $3 charge ??? Hello am i at the Wynn Buffett ??? Food was bland definitely not authentic Mexican food. Not a fan
