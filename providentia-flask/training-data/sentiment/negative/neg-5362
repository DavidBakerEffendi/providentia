I went there yesterday evening and the place is okay. The lady assisting was nice, but the food however SUCKED I had order 2 burritos de asada and a taco de asada for my Bf and I. The meat was very dried after I told the lady I wanted a little bit of beans multiple times I ended up getting them with a ton of beans. Long story short both of us are now in bed with food poisoning puking our lives away.. This is the WORST PEPE'S I've been to never again am I going back there I rather eat at Taco y Taco or Tacos el Gordo.
