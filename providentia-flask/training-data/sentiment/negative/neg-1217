They messed up on our order and had the nerve to try to argue and go back and forth with us saying we didn't say it correctly. We ordered chicken rolled tacos and were handed beef enchiladas. How? Don't argue with the customer when English is something you clearly struggle with... They charged us more for the wrong item and didn't pay us the difference when they finally made the correct lower priced item. Never again.
