Terrible service from the cooks!!! Wen we arrived one of them was in the front by the cashier talking in the lan Phone line, we ordered an our order got behind like 20 min to be ready!! Them i was observing that they were just playing in the back and my food was never called like ready to pick up or let the cashier know to pick up, also my tacos de pastor was chicharr√≥n burned $&@$&@ WTH, I dint want to waste time there with a complaint cause apparently there is no supervisor at 1am , so I just walk out. Shame in the kitchen!!! Not the cashiers!!! This review is about the kitchen not the front.
