Today my mom and friends went here for lunch and decided to try the new Texas Cobb salad. When their salads came out it was nothing like what was described  on  the menu. Both salads were supposed  to have a mixture  of romaine  lettuce  and iceberg lettuce, what they got was a handful  of old romaine lettuce and all green red cabbage. Both were covered  in  jalape√±os (not mentioned on menu) both salads  were sent back and new ones were brought  out exactly the same. The waitress  saw that neither  one of them had eaten there say but never bothered  to ask why? I asked why they didn't  say anything  and they figured that if you could  bring  out same thing twice then obviously they don't care!!
