Very upset about tonight. Me and my husband come here almost once a week. Tonight I ordered the chicken yakatori to switch up my usual sushi binge. I had had it twice before. The sauce is AMAZING. Upon my last bite i found it sort of chewy so i spit it out. It was raw. I informed the owner and showed her the raw peice. She pointed out that I had eaten all of it. Like I would intentionally share 6 peices of chicken with my husband, knowing they were raw and eat them all? I said I wanted it removed from the bill, she again said I had eaten all of it. I work in a resturant. So does my husband. We never complain about food, we know what quality we are paying for to have such cheap sushi here. Our expectations are low but we are usually happy when we leave. We were very dissapointed in themanner that the manager took regarding to this very serious safety/health issue. I felt like she was accusing me of purposely eating all of the chicken and waiting until the last bite to complain. That's like saying I would intentionally eat raw chicken?  It was removed off the bill, after an insincere "sorry" was muttered to me by the owner. Grossed out I went next door to NYPD pizza to order a salad for dinner instead as my husband paid our remaining tab and  tipped the sushi chef. Working in this industry I know how these things happen. This resturant obviously does not practice safe food handling measures and I'm happy I atleast noticed,( even though it was at the end) that my food was undercooked. It was however the way the manager handled the situation that will keep us from ever going back, not the food.
