I dont think I have ever had such a terrible experience.

My boyfriend and I came here on a whim thinking that it would be worth trying something new, and fresh and organic is always wonderful.

We ordered two iced teas which were great, as well as a small hummus appetizer. The hummus was fine but really nothing special.

I ordered the kale and beet salad, and it was the first time in my life that I have ever sent something back to the kitchen because it tasted badly. Besides the kale the salad was full of HUGE pieces of slightly warm beets and tiny pieces of caramelized nuts. The menu advertised a "house dressing" that turned out to be olive oil and large amounts of lemon juice. The dressing was sour but lacked any quality flavor and the giant  pieces luke warm beets added nothing positive. When I politely informed the waitress about it, she was rude and passive agressive. I felt VERY uncomfortable. She asked me if I wanted something else, and so i ordered the tomato and basil soup to go. 

My boyfriend ordered the sloppy joe, and while the fries were quite good they didnt have ranch and the actual sandwich was quite bland.  When I got home and tried the soup I was blown away with how terrible it was. It was COMPLETELY over salted to the point where you could barely taste anything else. 

As we were leaving the waitress brought us our check and tried to charge us for the salad we had sent back, but took it off when we complained. We also heard the table next to us complain because the waitress had forgotten to put in their appetizer and she didnt even remember which one they had ordered (as she is bringing out their food), On top of that the food was expensive, and the waitress had almost no tables. It was a slow sunday afternoon.

Avoid this place. I think it might be the worst place I have been to in phoenix, and I have lived here over ten years.
