I cannot begin to express just how frustrating it is to perpetually give a restaurant a chance in hopes that they won't keep screwing up take-out orders and still have them do it CONSTANTLY. I've been eating at this location for 3ish years, and tonight marks easily the 11th or 12th time I've had my order screwed up (chicken missing from a salad, certain meats missing from a sandwich, etc.) and I'm done hoping it will stop. If you are wanting to eat at a restaurant that actually gets orders right, this is not your place. Not sure if they need a change in management or just competent cooks, but hopefully something changes.
