After going here since they opened I had the opportunity to have the owner, Bob, school me on his $10 minimum for a credit transaction (I was just grabbing a couple beers to go as opposed to dining in like usual).  It was nice to be argued with after having been a loyal customer for over 6 years.  I'll drive the extra quarter mile in the future for Bottles 101 since the selection and attitudes are better and they actually care to remember what their customers look like.   Also, the hummus has become quite oiley lately, though, since it's coming from a super market as opposed to made fresh I guess this isn't their fault.
