well well well, I have a coupon for this place in the entertainment book but I was never interested in coming here... but somehow that's where I ended up last night.

We were the only people in the restaurant, which worried me as I have no idea if the food is good or bad and maybe that was a sign as it was dinnertime. They brought a basket of bread to the table right away along with water and bread plates. There was nothing on the menu that stuck out and said "TRY ME" so I ordered a french onion soup to start and my boyfriend ordered the soup of the day which was butternut squash.

I found my soup to taste like a container of salt but I was hungry so I ate it and the butternut squash I was told was very good but I didn't taste it, I'll take his word for it though. We both ordered the veal parmigiana and it wasn't long coming out..

Before the waiter walked away from bringing our dinner, my boyfriend saw that his veal was completely raw looking! I immediately cut into my  piece and it was pink inside too!!

The waiter didn't know what to say and he took our plates back, he came back two minutes later and told us the chef is going to do some" chef tricks" whatever that means...

I personally didn't want back this raw piece of meat back and luckily we didn't get it back either. The waiter came back and said the chef cooked another piece of meat and it was also pink inside.. I do not know what is wrong with this meat and believe me I do not want to find out so we just paid for our soups and left..

I will probably never know what the veal tastes like as I have no urge in coming back anytime soon.
