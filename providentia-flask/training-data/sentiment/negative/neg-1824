This is a very popular "driving range" that turns the fun into a game and dinner all in one experience.  Unfortunately, it is so packed that you will likely have to wait several hours to get a spot on the range and you will pay a pretty penny to do so after adding up all their miscellaneous fees, food, tax, and tip for a family of 4.  I would suggest separating the golfing and the eating/drinking into separate events instead of trying to combine the two at Top Golf.
