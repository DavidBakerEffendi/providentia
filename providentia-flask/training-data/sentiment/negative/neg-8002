After inquiring about holding an event at this venue, I was told to fill out a survey about what my event entails. I asked questions and gave detailed information. The response from the venue was to setup a call or meeting, completely ignoring the 30 minutes I spent filling out the survey. I asked a few times for a breakdown of pricing, which was ignored. I asked once more, and then I was rudely brushed off stating "$3k plus tax and gratuity. Thanks for your consideration!" I am really tired of certain venues not being upfront about the pricing and then after many days of trying to get the numbers, they are rude about it.
