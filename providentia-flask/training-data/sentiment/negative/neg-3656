Was excited to try this "hand-pulled noodles" place. On Yelp it says they're open "Monday-Friday 10:30am to 10:30pm"..well I got there at 9:10pm and they're closed already. Wow what the fuck? Also there's no official website to know what their real closing time is! No phone number can be found anywhere as well. Will not be coming back. Thanks for nothing.
