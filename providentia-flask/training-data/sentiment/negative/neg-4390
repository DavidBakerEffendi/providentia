Came here for breakfast today with a friend and our kids. She has been to other locations, and has had excellent customer service. This location however has horrible service, and we waited way too long for our food. Plus when the food came the croissants came out last and were not heated. When we asked to have them heated the girl asked us to hold on. After waiting forever another few minutes was not possible. Once we were done the server (cashier #6697) came back around and asked if we got our heated croissants. As she was the only one who knew we asked for them to be heated of course we did not get them heated! I would not return to this location as the service was terrible, and the food was mediocre at best. The shop inside is cute and I would consider trying a different location for their lunch. As far as any highlights of this location I will say that it is clean and quiet.
