This location was very disappointing. My pizza took 50 minutes(was quoted 30-40) and when it arrived it was cold and appeared to have been sitting for at least 30 minutes. What was the delivery guy doing? I can understand being last on a route but not sacrifice that much quality. I live 2 miles away from the location FYI. Never again.
