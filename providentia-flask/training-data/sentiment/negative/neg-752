Pretty disappointed.  Over 15 minutes to get food. 
Cajun spice was uneven, no taste on first half, good on 2nd half. Jalapenos were pretty tasteless. Grilled onions were under done. Ordered medium rare, got medium. Bun was  $2.45 for regular fresh cut fries, very small portion.  They came out late and weren't very hot (or didn't hold heat well).  Too many small bits.

On a positive note, parking was convenient and the bt Sauce was good.  Friendly staff.
