I normally would not go to Little Caesars for pizza, but we had a giftcard to use and I decided to stop by here for Lunch on Monday.  I ordered a pizza and gave them the giftcard.  The staff had no idea how to charge with a giftcard.  They apparently got a new system the other day, but LC corporation failed to communicate and train their staff.

I was handed my pizza while they still talked about how to make the giftcard work.  They called someone to ask and were supposed to get a call back.  They didn't tell the person on the other side of the call that they had someone waiting because they never called back while I was waiting.  I waited as they still griped about the new system.  One of the guys eventually said hey, how are we going to help this lady, she had been standing here and waiting.  And the lady says, I'm waiting on the call back.  I asked if I could just get money in exchange for the giftcard and pay with that, she was not willing to do that.  Okay, well do something instead of just griping.  

I eventually asked for my card back, gave them their pizza back, and walked out.  I don't get how you even let something like that happen.  Should have just allowed me to take the pizza and be on my way while they figure out their screw up with the new system.

Anyone want a giftcard?!  I won't be back.
