Went for the first time tonight after seeing the billboard on 25th and Macleod, we were starving and wanting to try something new.  Expected an excellent menu and service based on the decor, you can tell they underwent a recent renovation.  The server was sloppy but nice.  Service was slow, bruschetta was on dinner rolls from Costco and a basic recipe, nothing amazing.  

We waited 45 minutes for our entrees, one was a pasta dish and one was a fish dish. The pasta was so hot it had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp.  The fish was cold and the garlic bread old and cold.  We sent the fish back and by the time it came back the pasta was gone so we each ate on our own.  Super over priced, 2 diet cokes, onion soup, bruschetta, pasta and fish entrees = $75.00.   

Didn't fix the bill or comp anything for the trouble.  Won't go back, if you haven't been, don't go.
