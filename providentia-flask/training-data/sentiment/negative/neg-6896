Wow...I've never paid so much ($7.99) for such a small bowl of soup. Thanks for the 3 shrimp...2 bits of tomato and 3 mushrooms in BROTH...in a half quart container. Additionally, we called 8 minutes before they were open...they took the call, but not our order. Told us to call back in 8 minutes. Backwards logic. Not good business considering they are one of 5 Thai restaurants within 3 miles. Won't be going back.
