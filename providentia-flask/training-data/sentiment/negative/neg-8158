I used to be a regular at this place for many years but not anymore..
Customer service doesn't exist anymore .. New young girls don't want to move from their chair and just point with their fingers on where to look for stuff. I was the only customer in the store and there were like 4 employees and non of them helped me finding what I was looking for ... I'm taking my business elsewhere .. There are a lot of gourmet stores in Montreal and with this attitude they will not stay in business for long .. Too sad
