If you see this place,  Keep walking.   Run even.   Run fast and far away.   It's gross.   This gives shawarma a bad name.   If you think this is delicIous you need to get your tastebuds checked maybe even a tounge scraped .   Nothing fresh or appetizing about it.  
To sum it up with one word -  Barf-o-la.

Oh.  I've also never had my potatoes crushed up in front of my eyes with the workers fingers.   Try a fork next time and a plate.   Disgusted from the start.
