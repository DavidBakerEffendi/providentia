Horrible place! The service was extremely slow and impolite. The price is too high for what you get for. The broth is just PLAN water which is not the shabu shabu I have in Asia or even other shabu shabu restaurants in the US. Charging $6 extra dollars for sharing three pieces of leaves and two pieces of tofu is just beyond ridiculous. We were still hungry after spending $80 for dinner. Will NOT go back again.
