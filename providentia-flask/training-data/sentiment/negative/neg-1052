A friend recommend this place, so the boyfriend and I stopped in for a Friday lunch. Server was rude, complained about doing her job constantly because it was "2pm" (they close at 3; we arrived at probably 1:45). Bitched because a family with their two kids wanted decaf, because she's not used to making it at 2pm. Apologized to the kitchen because they had to make what I ordered... at 2pm. Fish and chips should be taken off the menu since it would be better from the frozen food aisle. Boyfriend said his omelette was "just ok." The ambiance reminded me of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, but worse. I hate to shit on a local business, but I work hard for my money at work, work that I do with a smile on my face only to pay to be treated like a nuisance on my day off. I stopped at the post office on Biddulph after this lunch and had a better experience. NEVER AGAIN.
