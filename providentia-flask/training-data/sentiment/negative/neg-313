I honestly don't think I've been to a worse McDonald's. The fly situation here is out of control. There was a wasp when I was there. Super appetizing being handed my food with a wasp swarmong around it. Yum.

It was disgusting there. There was garbage on the counters and sauces that haven't been wiped up. The soft serve machine was dripping.

This place employs high schoolers who are clearly not proactive or diligent. They were snapping at each other. It was the worst.
