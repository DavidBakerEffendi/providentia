We live near this Denny's and service has been hit or miss so we normally avoid it. I wanted moons over my hammy so we went to Denny's and my husband even expressed his concern. I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I'm done with the Denny's. You have sealed the deal I won't be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won't keep you in business either.
