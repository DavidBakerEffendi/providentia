I want to recommend this place but....Twice my food smelled terrible and spoiled. I've had good food from here in the past but recently  there was a hair in my rice. Look and smell your food carefully before you eat it. They season it a lot maybe to cover up the spoilage. The owner should buy fresh food and check his food carefully.
