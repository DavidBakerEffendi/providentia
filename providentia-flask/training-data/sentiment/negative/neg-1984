On Sept 18th at around 6 pm my family and I had just come back in to town after being gone for almost 4 years. We were so excited to eat sandwiches from Mr. Good Cents because we used to eat there all of the time since it is near the home we own in Waddell. When we walked in we were a little surprised that the menu was different, apparently it's under new ownership... We ordered an had been on the road all day so we hadn't eaten any where else prior. We all had sandwiches and went home to bed. The next day my 8 year old was complaining of a stomach ache and wouldn't eat breakfast, then at around noon she began vomiting... At around 3 pm my husband began complaining of a tummy ache and he had the runs then began vomiting. I felt fine so I thought maybe it was just them but then at 9 pm my 2 year old starts vomiting in her sleep. So I had my husband, 8 year old and 2 year old vomiting all night, I was praying I wouldn't get sick but at 3 am my stomach began rumbling and I covered my mouth and ran to the rest room and ended up vomiting all over my hands. It was a long night... None of us got sleep. The only person that didn't get sick was my 6 month old and she was the only one that didn't eat at Mr. Good Cents. I wanted to call to let them know but I figured they probably wouldn't do anything. But if anyone else ate there on Sept 18 and got sick, we feel you. I had an entire family up all night running to the bathroom and many times my 8 year old and 2 year old didn't make it. My 2 year old kept vomiting in her sleep and I had to turn her over so she wouldn't choke on her vomit. It was so scary. Unfortunately we will never eat there again. It was horrible.
