I was here a few days back just getting some last minute items for my daughter's bday. Customer service was the worst. I had an issue with their pricing. They didn't want to honor the price that was displayed. I had to speak to 3 people to finally get it honored. I was trying to not make a scene but it's like one of the ladies was doing that on her own. After walking back and forth with different people showing them the price displayed and finally getting the price honored I get back to the register with all my items bagged and already scanned but then I had to wait longer because they couldn't find the items they scanned and saved on their register. I asked if they can scan my items in front of me but they insist on finding it. When they finally found my items I noticed the one lady who made this a bigger deal than it should speaking to the other lady who actually honored the price being very passionate with her words. (She was obviously speaking another language near where I was standing.) I thought that was disrespectful. It's obvious she was either talking about me or the situation. Either way that's bad customer service. It's disappointing because I used to like coming here. Because of this I won't be returning.
