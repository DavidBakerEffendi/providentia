This is a review strictly about what happened as a result of the lack of security at the front desk - this is not about the amenities or the rooms at the hotel.

When I checked in at The Venetian on Aug 19, their computer system was down and they were taking everyone's credit card numbers by hand, writing them down, having you write your phone number and full name and signing.  I was very nervous about this, so I used my American Express card.

I had a great time at the hotel, but when I got home, I was alerted by Amex by multiple fraudulent internet charges.  I contacted one of the merchants and it turns out the customer had used my correct full name, credit card number, and phone number but the wrong billing address.  Interesting that they had the info I wrote down for The Venetian but nothing else.  

Amex took care of the fraud immediately, but when I called The Venetian, they didn't care at all.  They said that there was no investigation and that I couldn't prove it was someone from their hotel.  They put me through to the security department who took my information and then never called me back.

This place has HORRIBLE security.  Do NOT stay there unless you want your identity stolen.
