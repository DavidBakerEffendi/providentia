This will be a short review. Look on Yelp and decode to try an new spot. Drive across town to get there before they close. Pull up and they decided to close 45 minutes early. Why? Well I'm sure your guess is as good as mine. 

I'm sure my rating will go up in time. Once I'm able to try this place. I won't go out of my way though the next time.
