Not sure why this location can't seem to get it together. Last three times I've had horrible service and smoothies have been made wrong. Today I waited in the drive-through line for 17 minutes for one smoothie with one person ahead of me. When I got to the front they had to re-confirm my order because she forgot. Then once I did get it it was made incorrectly. Won't be coming back to this location, probably just going to stick with Jamba Juice up the street instead.
