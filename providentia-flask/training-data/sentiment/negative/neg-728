I'm shocked celebrities find this a hot-spot, unless Sugar Factory uses celebrities in order to promote their name (which is most likely the case).

Out of the whole experience, the best thing was the atmosphere. It's obvious that large parties accommodate seating, and you get a nice view of the water fountains from Bellagio across the street.

I would suggest even the smartest of trendy tourists to avoid this place. Everything has a candy or sweet theme to it, which is unique in itself and interesting (a twinkle flavored alcoholic drink? What?), but this is obviously a classic tourist trap for overpriced food (and they go beyond what is overpriced!) I didn't see a single thing under $10 for food, and even the drinks were $7 and up. They have a good variety on the menu, almost every category you can think of (salads, soups, chicken, pasta, pizza, burgers, etc.)

Our server told us drinks were half off for happy hour. Apparently drinks are half off at the *bar* area, not the restaurant area. The whole time we were under the impression that all the drinks on the menu were half off, so I ordered the root beer cocktail that was $14 (might I add it wasn't too bad either). When you think you're getting it for $7 because someone assured it was half off and see your bill at about $20 (including gratuity for our large group that night), you're definitely going to have an issue with it!

The manager was very nice in making adjustments. Apparently it was buy one get one free, and even if it wasn't half off in the restaurant, I never got my second drink. Food was nothing special, you can have better elsewhere for over half the cost. The fries were ordinary, and my friend said the pasta wasn't anything exciting for the price he paid. 

One of the high selling points are the goblet drinks, but they're $35! Personally, I didn't see what the hype was all about. I guess if you have money to burn, this place seems like another fast-food restaurant to the rich.
