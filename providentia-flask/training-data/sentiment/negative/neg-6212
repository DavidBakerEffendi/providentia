Ordered french dip and the meat was tough and dry. The Aju seemed like it may have been previously frozen, like the stale bread.  Bozena got a burger and it was dry even though it was ordered medium. The fries were kind of crispy (a good thing to me), but flavorless.  

Perhaps this experience was an anomaly or maybe what we ordered is not what this location concentrates on.  When paying for food at a restaurant, I don't always expect it to be better than what I can make, but I do expect it to be satisfying or better than average.  I normally like to leave funny reviews; the the only thing funny about this evening was how I ran into the grocery store after dinner to get some dessert.
