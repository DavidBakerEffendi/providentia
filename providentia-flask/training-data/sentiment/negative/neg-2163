I did not get to eat at Stack'd, although we arrived at their front door. We were seeking lunch, so I pulled up my Yelp app and looked for something interesting. Stack'd! Great idea! According to Yelp, it is open. I double check on their website from my phone...no hours listed (and no mobile site either)...wtf? But surely a burger place would be open on a weekday at noon, right? Wrong. Only after we park in the garage, lug the baby and stroller out into the rain and pull up to their front door do we find out that they are indeed CLOSED. So we ate at China Palace instead.

Moral of this story...I guess I need to just call any restaurant I want to visit to make sure they are actually open when they say they are.

I'll be sure to update this review should I ever end up in Shadyside again while they are open...
