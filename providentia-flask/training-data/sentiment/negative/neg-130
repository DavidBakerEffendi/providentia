OH MY GOD NEVER AGAIN. Only come here if you have enormous amounts of time to kill. We walked in at 3:30pm on a Sunday and walked out at 5:30pm. In that time, we only ordered soup, salad and an appetizer. Originally, We were told a 30 minute so we opted to sit in the bar area. HUGE MISTAKE. I asked for a second salad, which never came. My minestrone soup had an entire can of beans in my one bowl. I found 3 pieces of lettuce with mold on it. It was so hard to get ahold of our waitress that I never got a chance to complain. Even if I did, nothing would have happened anyways. Terrible experience... We only came here because I was having pregnancy cravings for their salad. I pray to god I do not have another craving like this again because my baby can starve before I step foot in here again. Absolutely unacceptable all the way around. If you're going to eat here, wait the extra time for a table because the wait staff in the bar have no idea what's going on. Oh and the table smelled weird so my constructive criticism would be to use a clean rag to clean it off next time.
