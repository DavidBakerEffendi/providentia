Went for a surprise birthday dinner for my wife. Host was great. But thats it. Server didn't get to use for 15 minutes, we asked for drinks and he responded"we will get to that what do you want to eat" after 30 minutes we got our drinks with our food.
Steaks were horrible- overcooked and cold imagine that.
Garlic bread is delicious though.
Bill was $700 and i would of been happier eating at a burger joint.
