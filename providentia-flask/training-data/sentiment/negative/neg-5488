The WORST service I've had in a long time and I'm patient. Snotty bartender, have to ask for a water or drinks, pushes you off on another employee, ignores you and then wants to act like she's working when the owner walks in. I've worked in hospitality for 8 years and this behavior is never satisfactory and should never be passed as okay. I will never come back here.
