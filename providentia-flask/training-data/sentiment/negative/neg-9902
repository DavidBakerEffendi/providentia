Mr hero is good but overpriced. However, this store itself gets a 1 star. The woman at the counter said some very sexist things about the food I was ordering, then the wrong food was cooked...needless to say, it didnt leave a good taste in my mouth.

if you dont care about that or the price, go ahead and eat there. Otherwise, theres another one literally a mile up the road.
