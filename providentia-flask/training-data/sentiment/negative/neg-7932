Pitiful.  

The restaurant was empty so I figured I would get some attention.  Wrong.

The served my food and then I didn't see anyone again.... until I they had the bill.

I ordered the ribs and they were hard as a rock.  I ordered two sides and got only one.  No refills.  I wasn't about to go get a server when 5 of them were standing behind the counter gossiping.  

The worst part is that the supervisor gave someone a tongue-lashing in front the limited people in there.  It was very uncomfortable.  

AVOID.  Lemonade stands are more professional.
