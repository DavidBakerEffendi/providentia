Wow!  What a disappointment!  I took my teenaged sons to Dick's because I thought it would be fun.  The waiters were not at all entertaining, and the "verbal abuse" promised was minimal (except when the waiter refused to put a lime in my water ).  I was willing to pay extra because the waiters were supposed to be obnoxious and fun, but with the gimmick missing, it was just mediocre food for way too much money.
