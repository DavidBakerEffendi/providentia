What can I say about Baja Fresh? I used to work near this location, and as a quick place to have lunch, it was o.k. Not a bad price. Relatively good food, hot and fast. Pretty good salsa bar. 

Hadn't been in a Baja Fresh in a few years because there are more Mexican food places that I like much better, closer to where I live (like Roberto's, for instance). Anyway, on April 3, me and some friends decided to stop in to the 7501 W. Lake Mead, Summerlin location for lunch. Big mistake! Place was pretty empty at lunch time. That should have told me something.

I wanted fish tacos, so on the menu board there were 2 choices. "Wahoo" and "Crispy Wahoo".  I ordered 2 taco platter with Crispy Wahoo taco and one shrimp taco. After my friend ordered her meal, she was told that the "Crispy Wahoo" was not fried but grilled. O.k. I had to then make sure that the girl at the counter knew that I wanted fried. I asked why there were 2 different menu choices IF BOTH WERE GRILLED? I was met with the same kind of stare my dog would have given if I'd asked him the same question. From reading another Yelp review, this is an ongoing problem apparently. The menu choices need to be clear!

My order was delayed. When I got it, it was wrong. They forgot the shrimp taco. When I finally got the shrimp taco, it was cold. My friend's kid got rolled tacos that he said tasted like soap. So that order also had to be sent back. The general manager that day was grouchy and not in the greatest of moods. He acted like we didn't know what we were talking about. He said "No one has ever complained before!" Whatever. I got a new taco, and my friend's kid also got a new meal, but by that time we didn't really want anything else. 

The counter girl/server was nice and tried to be accommodating. The complimentary chips were pretty stale. The pinto beans, rice and salsas were decent. I wouldn't recommend this location and  I'll never go back there.
