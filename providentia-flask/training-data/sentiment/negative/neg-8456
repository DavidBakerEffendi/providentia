Their boba was just powdered mix and we had to wait over a half hour for them. Not worth the price and the size of the drink was far too small to even be considered a little enjoyable. Their pho was just fine but it was the same problems as the boba. Had to wait too long because they didn't call our number out loud enough. Overall, I won't be coming back here again.
