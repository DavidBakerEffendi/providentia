The food is not very good and the people that work their address not the friendliest. We happen to go to the buffet in hopes that we would be able to still have breakfast food. When we got there the last said you all will be able to have breakfast food the next 30 mins. Cool we said let's go ahead and go in. We paid proceeded in and grabbed a plate as we were walking towards the only like 3 remaining breakfast items the guy pulls them. My friends and I ask the guy like can we have some of that bacon he ignored us and throws it away. At this point I'm sad I was really in the mood for breakfast food still. So we go to the next breakfast item there are no tongs to grab the food so we ask the guy can we get some tongs to have some of this item he looks at us crazy gives us the tongs and says it's dinner time now. I told him well the lady in the front said we could eat breakfast for the next 30 mins. He was like well she is wrong. I was pissed at this time now. Then from one bad thing to the next moral of the story I will not be eating there again because their food was not very good and I feel as if I was lied to and that's not a good feeling.
