Unbelievable.. Chai not only charged us for two items that he completely forgot to serve us but he also charged us for a roll that he screwed up. His excuse was that right before he threw the food away my friend said she would eat it. So he charged us for the new,  right order AND the one that was headed for the trash.. I brought it up to him and he refused to take it off the bill!! That has never happened to me at any other restaurant I've ever been to. Unreal.
