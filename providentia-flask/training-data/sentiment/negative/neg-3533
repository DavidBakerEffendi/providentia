Never got to even try the food as service was horrible from the start.  This is the first time I ever walked out of a restaurant, as hostess stand wouldn't seat us despite our reservation and refused to seat us in the many open tables in the lounge.  I hate hate rating a restaurant solely on service but this one is well deserved
