Infuriating.

After making a reservation for my mom's birthday since we were having a family reunion (we all live out of state in different locations), we were so excited to narrow it down to Chica at the Venetian. The ambiance and food were what drove us to choose this place. I went to the restaurant website, made a reservation, and got confirmation for tonight's dinner.

Upon arrival, we noticed there was a convention going on, but no actual restaurant employee in front of the house- just the conference leaders shuffling people in. When I tried to enter to find someone, the conference worker directed me outside to the left..to nowhere. Perplexed, I called and spoke with Kayla and James. They let me know that according to their records, they had called twice to try to update me of the unavailability of tonight for regular dining. I never got any missed calls. When I asked why they did not leave a voicemail or email me, they said according to their records, they could not leave a voicemail and did not have my email. There was really nothing they could do since the restaurant was closed to the public. Why have your restaurant linked to an online reservation system where you confirm via email when they can't communicate there with you directly..?

Kayla and James were empathetic and professional- I do not blame the actual staff working at the location. I do, however, feel that it's my responsibility to warn others of corporate irresponsibility in making sure they have a direct and convenient way of communicating with their customers.. especially when cancelling reservations.
