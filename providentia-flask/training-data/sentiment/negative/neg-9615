So angry bought a Groupon to try Yolies wasnt worth it, plus they cancelled contract with Groupon told me I couldnt use it $70 really.  First you take an elevator up  dirty and shaky that was odd, place had only 3 people in there, what a creep atmosphere to begin with, my daughter didnt like just when we went thru the door.   It was so ins insulting to be told we will give you the same dinner but you need to pay.   Oddly I think I was glad it was old and smelled odd the people eating there didnt seem impressed with the food.  They were saying dry huh?   I will not recommend this place restaurants in Vegas are always busy and the other reviews says it all.  Too many other restaurants they try to be Rodizo's that they cant come close too      pick a cleaner place.......if it is a gem it was then now its a lump of coal
