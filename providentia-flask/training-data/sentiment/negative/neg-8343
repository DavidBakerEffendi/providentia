The Chinese owner that behind the cash machine is an idiot. We had dinner in this place before and the waiter and waitress were good. Once we brought a frozen fish to this place and a waiter recommended a cooking method and we had a great meal. Today we brought a lingcod there and I asked if they can cook it with chilly bean sauce (Northern Chinese food style) ? The owner told me they don not cook it. While I was talking to one of his waiters (the one that help us last time when we brought a fish to this place) and figure out a cooking method that this restaurant can cook, the owner came over and stupidly repeating himself that they do not cook northern food. I asked him to stop repeating and he still continued. I told him no problem if he does want our business, we don't have to eat here. He said it would be fine as he has fish. We went to another Chinese restaurant at night and had a wonderful 3 course meal out of the 8 lbs lingcod. There are many people fishing on their own and bring their catch to restaurants. The owner of this restaurant appears to be ignorant about this fact. We would never go back to this place again. Not because of the waiters and waitress there, but because of the idiotic owner!
