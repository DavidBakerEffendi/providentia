Very rude staff. Horrible service. The restaurant is empty and we're told we have to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  We decide to order to go. We ask if we can get our food as it's coming out to feed the kids as quickly as possible, and the cashier says, "If you eat here, don't make a lot of noise because we have to take care of our normal customers." I remind the cashier that the restaurant is EMPTY. At the end of our meal we ask if we can give them the trash that we packed back up neatly and the cashier says, "The trash box is outside" and points me to the dumpster. The ridiculousness of the whole situation earned their one star rating!
