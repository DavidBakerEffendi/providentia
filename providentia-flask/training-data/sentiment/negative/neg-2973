I'd give 0 star if I could... The only reason I considered this buffet was because I was supposed to receive a complimentary 2-for-1 dinner voucher for the buffet with our hotel reservation.  Upon check in, we did not receive any of our coupons or promotions, or even reminded of any. 

When we arrived at the buffet, we realized that we were supposed to receive a coupon. I spoke with the Manager of the buffet to see if he would allow us, all they had to do was just receive confirmation through telephone by calling the lobby.  The manager did not even seem to be the least bit interested in even talking to us. Sure enough, he did not even hesitate to tell us "No, I'm the manager of the buffet, I'm not in charge of coupons.. go to the front desk." So he wanted us to go walk back to the lobby of the casino just to get some coupons that he should be able to validate with a simple phone call? "Yes..". 

To make this short.. not worth getting into specifics.. we had received a dinner coupon voucher (needed lunch coupon voucher) at the lobby front desk. We figured its about 15 minutes until dinner (it was 3:45, dinner starts at 4), even that incompetent manager shouldn't have a problem with this. Just let us pay for the dinner price, which was in 15 minutes, DURING lunch. WRONG! 

When the manager returned, (looked like he didn't want to talk to us) we told him our situation again. Before I finished a sentence the manager said.. "We don't do this normally, but I don't want to deal with this anymore... since the front desk can't get it right go in.. I'll just wait until dinner time to charge you." Never again.. 


This is NOT a reflection of the hotel room or the servers at the buffet.
I just wish that the MANAGER would have given us better service than what we received, which was close to nothing.
