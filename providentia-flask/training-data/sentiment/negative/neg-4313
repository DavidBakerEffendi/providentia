Went for dinner on 7/19/2017. Walked in and instantly noticed a foul mildew like smell. The further we walked into the restaurant, the stronger the smell. We sat down and started looking at the menu. But the smell overpowered us. We got up and left. Whatever the smell is, no restaurant should ever smell that bad.

Used to enjoy this place quite a bit, but I refuse to eat in filth
