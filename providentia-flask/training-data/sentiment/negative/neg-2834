VERY disappointing. My partner and I had a lovely meal there last summer and this time it was TERRIBLE. The food and service were both UNACCEPTABLE. The paella was burnt to an inedible ash-tasting MESS. Our wait-person didn't understand our order and NEVER ONCE asked how the meal was. The cocktails are served in what has to be shot-sized martini glasses and the bar-maid said they didn't serve ANY white wine by the glass except for DRY whites. But LOW and BEHOLD they had $80.00 bottles of Reisling on the wine list at the table. NEVER going back again. BUH BYE!
