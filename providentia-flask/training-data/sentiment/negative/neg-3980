After not taking a vacation for a long time, I came here during a weekend trip and during my stay here it was horrible. We rented three rooms and the results were the same. Everyone in my family became sick here. The air circulation was horrible as there was mold in the bathroom. I have been sick for nearly two weeks now since my stay here. I do not recommend this hotel to anything for further stays. When I called about the quality of their air they said house keeping and I do not think they were qualified to check the air quality in the rooms. It is an old hotel and I even asked for a humidifier and the one they provided me just made a loud noise and did not work. We had a hard time breathing here. Saturday night we asked for room service and my son in law got food poisoning. The food quality is not good either. They charged good but do not give you the right service. They do not give you the service for the money they charge you. I do not recommend. Do yourself a favor and do not stay here.
