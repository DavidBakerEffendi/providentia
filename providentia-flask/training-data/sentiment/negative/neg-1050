I've tried to like this place. No matter how many times given it a chance the service is always non existent. Today I was going to dinner at a friends house who is a wine fan who lived in France. I know absolutely nothing about wine, I figured this was a perfect opportunity to get some direction. Not a single person spoke to me, even though there were only two other customers and about 6 employees including who seemed to me to be an owner. (Since you state there are never 6, here are the 5, a girl who rang me up, one guy talking to the two customers, two cooks and one blond bearded man talking to the two cooks. Sorry I was off by one person!). I resorted to looking up information on my phone. I stood for 20min ( not an exaggeration, I timed it) looking at labels till I found an wine that worked. I see no reason to ever go here again. Why make the effort if they don't. Truly disappointing.
