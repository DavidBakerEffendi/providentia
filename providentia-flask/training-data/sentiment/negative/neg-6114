NEVER NEVER NEVER  AGAIN will i go back to this place
Service was slow and mediocre, Our food was not fresh, and was fishy.
they served us milky oysters that was for sure going to make us sick if we ate it.
Crab tasted frozen an old. Shrimp was overcooked and no flavor, How can you mess up scampi, its butter and garlic, but they did. We paid $80 for two it is not worth it,
you might as well go to buffet on the strip for the same price.
