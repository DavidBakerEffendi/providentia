I used to come here all the time, but over the years they really cheaped out on their portions and raised their prices. 

Tonight we stopped in to pick up some take out. They added $2 surcharge for a 15 piece sashimi tray for all salmon. Fine. Then I got home to see that they basically split one piece into 2, and the rest were so thin, and the quality was bleh. 

They must not have changed the fryer oil because the spider rolls and dynamite rolls were bitter 

 Ridiculous. Never coming  here again.
