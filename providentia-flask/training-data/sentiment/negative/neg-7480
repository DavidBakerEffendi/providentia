I've never actually had your food but being how you are surrounded by neighborhoods you should probably not have live or loud music past 10pm. Get over yourselves, you are in an Albertsons parking lot. If you want to have a party atmosphere at your "tavern" you should probably think about a different location. A more family oriented restaurant is more suitable for your location.
