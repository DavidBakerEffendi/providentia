Absolute WORST customer service ever!!!! Ordering from here twice within a week on grub hub, Same EXACT lox platter which is like $18+ platter. First time it was delicious, less than week later ordered same EXACT platter and it tasted like someone dumped entire container of salt on the ENTIRE platter, absolutely disgusting!!! I called to complain and the rude manager didn't care.. kept saying the lox I ordered is the salty one... didn't even acknowledge that I told him everything on the platter was salty even the olives and tomatoes, didn't acknowledge that I mentioned that I ordered less than a week ago and no excuse for the inconsistency.. he was so rude and didn't care one bit! NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM HERE. I'll take my business elsewhere. Zero stars! We would have been regulars if their was consistency in their food and decent customer service when a problem arises. Gross!!!

Again... after reading your reply I explained to the manager that I ordered the SAME EXACT PLATTER twice in a week and again you cannot even acknowledge the severe inconsistency in your foods from one day to the next instead you insult me and say I used profanity and blame me for the item I ordered . Yes I ordered the belly lox both times!!!. Horrible customer service any other establishment would have refunded or sent new item! Unacceptable gross place never again will I eat here I'll send my business elsewhere
