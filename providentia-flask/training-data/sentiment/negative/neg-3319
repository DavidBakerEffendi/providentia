The pasta and omelet stations are the only things worth eating here. With all of the wonderful  food options in Las Vegas, I am surprised this place can survive with their subpar food and high prices. The staff is tired and hagard. The Buffet Island could really use some customer service training. I feel sorry for the friendly hosts who have to act as though you are in for a mouth watering experience eating at this school cafeteria quality place. Avoid unless you have free passes.
