I wish I could give negative stars. This restaurant was by far the worst restaurant I've ever dined at. The service was awful. Buyer shouldn't not beware after this post. The food was awful. Absolutely awful. 7 people struggled to eat the tapas and entires. 7 people should devour food not sit back and look at it. Robbed us of our money. Regret ever going there
