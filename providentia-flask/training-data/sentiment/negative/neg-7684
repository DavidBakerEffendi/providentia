One star is still to polite considering the rude and horrible service we received. On 11/7/14 at 6pm I had the single worst dining and professional experience of my life. Prior, We arranged with the owner to have a party of 50-60 people at this establishment and it was agreed we'd get happy hour specials. When we arrived at the agreed upon time the restaurant had one table with 4 chairs available for 50 people. They gave us attitude and acted like we were inconveniencing them. The small group of people who were actually served, were served by a manager who was obviously....um...impaired and rude. He kept making it a point to serve the pregnant girl last and thought it was funny. The majority of our party dispersed before being served and the evening was basically ruined. There were so many negative issus, I could go on and on but I'll just leave it at this...There are MANY quality eateries in downtown and places like this will drive clientele away and ruin the positive vibe in downtown. I know I'll never return and I'll never recommend anyone go there considering the many other better quality options. My group still dropped over a grand at this place for hands down the worst experience of our life.
