For one, they don't have coffee here.  
Second, the Wifi didn't work.  
Third, they did not accept my VISA.
All in all I did not like this place and wasted my time trying it out.  this place was dark, dirty and cramped there was no where to spread out and study.  The girl at the counter was nice.  Just not my scene.
