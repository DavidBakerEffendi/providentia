I cannot beleive this place is still open and relatively busy... It is unedible. The food is of poor quality, the kitchen is dirty. An open kitchen should be kept clean, considering that is the first thing people look at!

The service is good, but that cannot redempt the food. I can't even understand how people think this is italian food. 

The pizza is actually not terrible, but not good either... The kind you find in a food court. 

The pasta is horrendous. The tomatoe sauce tastes like it was pre-packaged and served straight from a can. 

The appetizers were not fresh... Mozzarella was dry and the cold cuts had an unhealthy funk... I had to spit it out. Waiter did not ask why our plate remained untouched, and to be honest, I did not feel like making a big case out of it because he was so nice.

To avoid at all cost: the sausage. I don't know where that "meat" comes from, but I think that you can get serious food poisoning from ingesting that stuff. 

Will never go back.
