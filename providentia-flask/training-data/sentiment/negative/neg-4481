Ugh. That's about all I can say about this place. I was VERY excited when I saw that they were opening a Vietnamese restuarant in the Surprise area, I'd previously had to drive an additional 30 minutes to get my pho fix. Because there's a lot of cons to this place, I'm just going to break it down into a list:

Pros:
-good location (Surprise)
-ample parking
-clean, modern restaurant
-nice bar seating, TVs to watch sports
-sells their own "infused" liquors, which I haven't tried

Cons:
-pho is disappointing. The rare beef soup was oddly flavored (like something out of a box) and the beef was stringy and not tender at all. 
-STAY AWAY FROM THE SPRING ROLLS. They are the WORST I've ever had. The pork was dry (like, crunchy dry) and the shrimp was not chilled, but room temperature. The rolls had too much mint, were not well put together and warm. I literally was sick after eating these. 

Given that I've been there on 3 separate occasions and have left twice without finishing my meal, I seriously doubt that I will be giving them another chance. I'm a serious fan of Vietnamese and other East Asian cuisine and this place, quite simply, does not cut it.
