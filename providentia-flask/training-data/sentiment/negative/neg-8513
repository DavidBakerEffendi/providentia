I arrived at this restaurant under the impression that I was about to eat at one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area. Unfortunately, I couldn't be more incorrect. As a matter of fact, if someone were to tell me that this was the worst Mexican restaurant in the area, I would have completely believed them. I ordered the red chili burrito, which according to Yelp, is a regular favorite. The red chili had an almost expired taste to it. The portion was incredible small. I don't know if it was because I ordered it as a combination platter, but the portion was one that you would expect to find in a kids menu. I left completely disappointed that I made the drive all the way to this place when in all honesty, disgusting ass Taco Bell would have been just as appetizing, if not more appetizing. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but I don't think I will ever find out as I don't see myself giving this place another chance.
