I should have known better, but let's say I held out hope for the new Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and was very disappointed. The sandwich looked nothing like the sign (which is typical) but the chicken was dry and over cooked, the patty was no where near the size of the bun let alone "bigger then the bun" as advertised. 
I generally don't like fast food for the most part and I've been disappointed with Arby's specifically for some time now. I won't be back for a while if ever.
