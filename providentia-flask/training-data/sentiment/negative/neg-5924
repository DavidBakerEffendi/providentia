I took 2 of my boys here for a daddy/son date. It was hideous. The mac and cheese looked old. My corned beef hash looked like it was right out of the can. The pancakes looked decent. The water tasted horribe. When I mentioned it they said it was because it was an old building. It is mass produced food you can make at home cheaper and better. I would suggest finding a better option.
