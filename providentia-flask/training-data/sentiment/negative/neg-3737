So apparently they are really serious about the reservations here. 

I walked in and asked for a single seat. Hopeful that they would allow me to experience their restaurant for just 25 minutes.

I was asked promptly if I had a reservation, I said no, but this never deterred me in the past at any restaurant with open seats. The first staff member said "no problem, just one moment"

A few seconds later a second staff member walked up and said "I am sorry, we are fully booked, and we are booked all night" 

I look over and point to the bar and ask "even at the open seats at the bar?" 

She said "yeah even at those open seats, we book them too..." 

So I walked away with a dry mouth and an appetite. 

Thanks for nothing...
