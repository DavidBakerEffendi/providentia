slow and terrible customer service + flavorless food = never again.

if the food was all there was to complain about i would've given this place 3 stars, but the customer service is just NONEXISTENT. A customer shouldn't have to nag at a waiter about their needs when the waiter can clearly multitask especially when the cash wrap is right in front of the customers face and this waiter walked back and forth 3 times and then disappeared a majority of the dinner without asking if my husband and i needed more drinks or if we were doing okay. It's not that difficult of a job plus we were one out of 5 groups of people (mostly singles or couples) eating there 4 hours before close.
