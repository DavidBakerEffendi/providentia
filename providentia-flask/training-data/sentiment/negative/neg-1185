As a huge fan of Bakersfield and outlaw country I was excited to try this spot for brunch. I am a Nashville TN and Louisville KY native that moved to Scottsdale last year, so my expectations for a "genuine country" experience were high. Unfortunately I was not at all impressed with the ridiculously, overly gentrified environment. They really missed the mark in trying to capture the honky tonk whimsy of Nashville. It's decorated like the inside of a barn which is not what Nashville or the real whiskey row in Louisville KY is like at all. And all of the female servers look identical, along with all of the male staff. Brunette, snotty attitudes with push up bras and denim underwear were seemingly mandatory for the female wait staff. Some diversity wouldn't hurt this place one bit. 
As far as the food is concerned, it is mediocre at best. My pancakes were ridiculously sweet and crumbled apart and I couldn't eat it all because of the over abundance of blackberry pie filling that they smothered my plate in. My fianc√© got the big ass breakfast and said it was decent despite having to wait an extra 15 minutes just for his side of bacon that was supposed to be brought out with his meal. Pretty basic in my opinion.
The service was spotty and you could tell that 90% of the staff didn't want to be there and were nursing hangovers of their own. Plus, THE MUSIC was BAD! It was nearly impossible to carry on a conversation because it was so loud. They played only new age pop country that sounded like it was all the same. 
I was disappointed, and probably will never return, even if it is walking distance from my house. Johnny cash would be rolling over in his grave at the sight of this place.
