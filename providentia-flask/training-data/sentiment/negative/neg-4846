Never again will I come back to this Sam Woo location.

Initially we were planning to eat at Ichiza, in the next complex, but because they had a long wait and we had a show (O at the Bellagio) to go too, we thought Sam Woo is a safe bet. I had good memories of Sam Woo from a few years ago, and I've also been to other locations in LA.

So they messed up our combo BBQ order.  We ordered the triple combo: bbq pork, roask pork, and soy sauce chicken.  But when it came we got roast duck instead of bbq pork.  So we sent it back, and it took forever for the waiter to come back with our 2nd plate. And it was STILL WRONG!!! this time they changed the duck to the steamed chicken!! DId they not understand English??  Anyways we were not happy but decided to leave it alone and just ate since we were hungry and didn't have much time to spare. But even if we wanted to complain it would be hard to call back the waiter because the waiter dropped the plate without looking at us, almost like avoiding us and walked away instantly. 

We also ordered a bowl of wonton soup which I had high expectation for - and it was just blaaah.. I found 2 big bones inside the wonton.  Couldn't really taste much shrimp in the wonton as I like it.  The third item we ordered was Yang Chow fried rice and they messed this one as well!  It was so dry my husband commented that even the free fried rice you get at chinese fast food place is better.  The last dish was Braised Tofu (Hong Shao To Fu) and it was okay.  Everything is overpriced!  Those 4 items cost us almost $50.  We left the place so unsatisfied and angry, what a waste of space in our stomach! 

Oh and the front hostess who showed us our tables was also so unfriendly. Stay away from this place!!
