Here's the problem: This is in a DICEY neighborhood, right at the edge of a BAD neighborhood. Two friends of mine were ABDUCTED AT GUNPOINT from this "lovely patio" about a month ago. Look it up in the AZ Republic if you don't believe me. One managed to escape being driven down a dark alley (for what purpose??) after being forced to empty her bank account, and managed to run to a store where they called the police, who rescued her friend. Ladies, I would say do not sit on this patio alone after nightfall. BTW, the owners avoided calling the girls back and there was not so much as an "are they ok" when their sister called to let them know there had been a problem. they were worried they might ask for something, apparently. Nice!
