Very disappointed! I ordered egg benedict trio snd avocado was spoiled when other waiter came to clean i said this is how you serve food?? He said ok i will let your waiter know. He told our waitress she just walked away and sent the bill. I wanted her to apologize and let the kitchen manager know i did mot expect it removed it from the check 25$ wont make rich or poor. And overall restaurant waiters at Wynn and Encore are mean not professional at all! 
Whoever orders check in-front of the waiter before eating!
