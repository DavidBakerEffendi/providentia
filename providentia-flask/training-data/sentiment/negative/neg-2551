This place says it's open till 9pm, the waitress started by telling us all the things that were unavailable on the menu. We got here at 7:45 and ordered bruschetta to start,the waitress said the kitchen was closing so she would "see if they could make it", she said yes, but they would have to cut everything up from scratch. Um okay. They started putting up the chairs around us, it's now 8:20 mind you they close at 9, another couple came in and were told the kitchen was closed that the only thing they could have was pizza. Bad business, making your customers walk out and rushing the ones that were there.
