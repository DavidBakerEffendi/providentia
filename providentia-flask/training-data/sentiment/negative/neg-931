Open your wallet my friends. Most of the entrees are finger foods.  We had four corns or as they call them "lollipops." Four (4) corns was $53 -that's insane!!! Only mistake I made was not looking at the price before ordering  these 
4 corns. Our bill was $250 for 4 appetizer empanadas, 4 regular corns, bread basket they use to serve free when they opened,  1 order of French fries, 1 rotisserie chicken and 2 drinks (beer & pisco). I'm afraid to see what a bill is like if you actually order real food in this place.
