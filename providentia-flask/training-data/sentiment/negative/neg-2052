How would you like to have a meal surrouned by a bunch of cokeheads? And I don't mean Coca-Cola. We had a front row seat, by the window...

Hands-down the most creepy ambiance. Who does smalltimer drug deals in restos anymore? This is so Boul. St-Laurent (à la Caféteria) passé. One of the local dirtbag dealers actually got the waitress to break his drug money for change. WTF!

Sad part is, the food is actually okay, because it's a chef-owner running the kitchen.

Bathrooms: I have to comment- don`t even lock properly. (sliding pocket doors with a ten cent lock)

The wine by-the-glass was old from sitting around for too long. Not cool. Red vinegar anyone?

The whole experience was shocking, considering the potentially charming interiour of this resto. I was expecting more.

The icing on the cake, was the big whiff of cigarette smoke that passed through the room when the kitchen staff took their break. Mmmm... appetizing.

Do urself a favor and pick any Laurier resto- except this one; unless, u want a chance at the same experience. They're anything but uninteresting, that's for sure. Oh, and if you do blow, this review might be useful to u, as well.
