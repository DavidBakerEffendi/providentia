Good food. Fun environment. Would have been great for all / including kids if not for smokey Jane next to us. We have 3 small children (including an infant) and in between her all you can eat crab plates she was cranking butts like we were in a scene of Mad Men. I get it/ we were on the porch (though outside). But we were NOT at the bar. I think it says something of a restaurant that allows the discomfort and inconvenience of all of it's patrons. We are eating dinner. Totally ruined it. 

I would possibly go again cause the food was good (we had the bucket of shellfish) & kids meals were priced well but we'd have to eat inside to avoid the possibility of madness.
