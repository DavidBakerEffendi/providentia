Worst TGI Fridays experience ever.  They weren't busy but the time to get our food was about 30 minutes.   My burger was so over cooked I could have played hockey with it.  No point in waiting another 30 minutes for replacement.  And of course the fries were stale from sitting under the heat lamp.   They replace those but without apologies.   

I won't be back.
