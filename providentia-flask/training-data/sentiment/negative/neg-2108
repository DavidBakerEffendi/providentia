I understand reading the reviews that some people like this style of pizza, but it's not for me. There is no crust, its just a limp mess. Toppings are sparse. Service isn't that great in the beginning and then annoying after you get your food. Keep this garbage, being from Calgary I prefer a greek style pizza. 

I also like thin crust but it should be like cracker, not this mess.
