Maybe we were there on a bad day.  This was the worst and the cheapest tasting pizza that we have had in some time.  The crust was bland, the cheese tasted like plastic and the little rubber eraser ends that passed for Italian sausage were chewy and flavorless.  They always seem to be empty when we eat next door at the GREAT Mexican restaurant.  I don't think they will be in business for very long.
