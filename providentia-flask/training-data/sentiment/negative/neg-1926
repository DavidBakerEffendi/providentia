Me and my bf always try new breakfast spots and get really excited to do so. This place was by far the worst breakfast I've ever had. The staff were great all nice and knew the menu very well. But the food was terribly bland, I would assume salt and pepper are frowned upon there. My eggs were legit just eggs no salt no pepper no thing... the red potatoes that the waitress said were her favorite again had no salt or pepper just tasted so bland. The price is to high for that basic food. I'm not sure I could be payed to go back.
