Someone else used the words "salt bomb" in their review - that sums it up perfectly!

I was in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. I wanted to get a feel for the offerings, so I decided to order the two meat and two sides platter. I requested pork and brisket (they were out of pork, so I switched to chicken) as the meats, and the potato salad and beans for the sides. The employees behind the counter were great. Friendly, able to answer questions, and in good moods. The place is kept clean, and given the "off" time I visited, plenty of table space to choose from.
The meats are served without sauce - and there are four sauces on the table to choose from. (Mild, sweet, mustard based, and hot.) The potato salad was nice. Maybe a little heavy on the red onion - but I happen to like onion, so I didn't mind. The beans were bland, and somehow, the pork in the beans was completely dry and tough. I can't figure out how that's possible - as there's so much liquid in the beans - any meat in there should positively be tender.
Then comes the salt bomb! The chicken was so salty, I could barely taste any of the sauces other than the hot, which tasted like a BBQ salt lick. Tasting it without the sauce, I could barely discern any chicken OR smoke, only salt. The brisket (also seen in another review) was almost like a beef jerky. It was so dry and tough - and when tasting without the sauce - I could taste the meat and smoke - but mostly - no surprise here - salt!
In the time it took me to eat the potato salad, half the beans and half the meat, I went through three cups of iced tea, and filled my cup a fourth time on my way out - and was still thirsty). I ended up throwing away over half the meat and leaving still hungry - I just can't handle all that salt.
There are several options for decent BBQ in the area - I won't be coming back here at all.
