Unquestionably the biggest Yelp let down ever!

I had a pepperoni pizza and it was just plain flavorless. The pepperoni and sauce was the delicious flavor of a good old water. Yum! (not).

I've never been so disappointed in a well reviewed Yelp establishment ever! Let's hope this is the first and last time!

(you'd be MUCH better served by Cibo, Pizza A Metro or Spinatos ... all within the vicinity)
