What has happened to Claim Jumper? wanted to stay close to home last night with all the rain happening so we decided on CJ. I haven't been in a little over 3 years but had no concerns because it is the Claim Jumper. when we arrived we got seated and noticed the dingy and dirty feel, our table had a sticky pieces of something on it. The menus were filthy( we should have walked out then). Our salads came and they were warm, soggy and were disgusting. I also noticed a couple other tables having similar issues with the food and wait staff. Our dinners came, and it was gross. The Grilled Mahi was the worse i had ever had, Hard as a rock, could not even cut it with the supplied table knife, the rice was cold and the veggies were hard and cold. The whiskey glazed chicken was a bit better but still no where near the quality that i remember with the Claim Jumper. So after $65.00 for 2 people, i will never go back again, so many other choices in Phoenix. A couple of other tables looked like they were having a worse go around than us. Did not even stay for dessert, that's how disgusted we were.  RIP Claim Jumper !!
