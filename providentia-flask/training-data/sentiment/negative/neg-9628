If I could leave 0 stars I would! We came here to watch the Seahawks and have a fun afternoon. My girlfriend ordered the chicken sandwich and the chicken was raw. Raw chicken really? The server was apologetic and offered to take it back and comp my girlfriends new meal. Enter the owner; rude pompous and straight up unprofessional. Imagine a restaurateur with a mechanics outlook on life. He said that they didn't charge us for the raw chicken but we will pay this bill as is and slammed the check on the table. Exact words: "You will pay this bill!" And just walked away! How about that for service?

I suggest you avoid this place like the plague.
