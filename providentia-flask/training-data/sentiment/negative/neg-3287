It took forever to get through the line and then to order.  My favorite sandwich is the bacon turkey bravo and my favorite soup is the broccoli cheddar.  When my food was delivered to my table the soup wasnt very warm.  Panera Bread makes me miss Paradise Bakery.  I am accustomed to getting a cookie with my meal but not here at Panera Bread.  Their whole process just seemed very slow and maybe it's because it's a new location with new employees. Well, its been a while now and their customer service still sucks. Every time the wife wants to go here I cringe because I know that it may be a while to order. The drive thru is a nightmare and I have been stuck in line a couple times waiting for what seemed like forever. One time someone changed their order after getting to the window to pick up their food and instead of having the person wait in the parking lot they just had them waiting at the window until the order was changed. Do not go to Panera Bread unless your wife makes you go.
