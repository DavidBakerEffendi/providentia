This place is horrible don't waste your time or your money food wasn't all that great chicken seemed a little bit undercooked the staff is just a bunch of kids that like to stand around and not do anything every time I looked up at the television in front of me just watch the ball game I felt like I was staring at them because there was about 10 of them standing there staring back at me definitely not a place I'll come to you again
