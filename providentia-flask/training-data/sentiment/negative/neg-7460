I heard about Waverly on Yelp and decided to give it a try as it is close to my neighborhood. unfortunately I was very disappointed. The service was fine but nothing over the top as some of the recent steakhouses I have been to this month. I was most disappointed with the RibEye steak that I ordered and the scalloped potatoes. The potatoes were too dry and had no flavor or salt whatsoever. The worst was the steak I ordered medium but the cut was worse than I could have got at a local grocery. The steak also had no seasoning and was just so blah...I ordered a Cosmo and that was good. I must say on my venture to go to all the Las Vegas restaurants that this by far the worst steak I have tasted.
