Went there today for take out dinner was sitting outside waiting for my order watched an employee come out and change the garbage he walked back into the restaurant immediately took the lid from the beverage machine I stood and watched him walk through the food prep area to the ice bin filled the bin with ice from the ice maker and put it into the beverage machine I alerted the cashier..she got nasty and defensive then told me I'm not the manager so I can do nothing he was allowed to fill the machine and I was basically looked at as a trouble maker..people die from food borne illnesses and asses like this guy are the reason!!!!
