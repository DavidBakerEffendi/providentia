Blown away by the other reviews. Anyone who thinks this place is good is not from Philly or has had a real Philly cheesesteak. I give the place props for trying, but it was not good. The wiz is fake and canned. Taste like a can. They put red sauce on it, which doesn't happen in Philly. Love the decor and that they have tasty cakes, although for a box the price was outrageous. I get having to up charge some because they are imported, but holy moly. It was 5x the cost than you would get it in Philly. Would not recommend if you are looking for an authentic Philly cheesesteak. Their hoagies maybe good, I'm not sure. My review is based off the cheesesteak.
