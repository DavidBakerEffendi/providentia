Here during the 4th of July weekend-- get this! I walked out! Staff was not surprised and said they were having some problems that morning. I was given a free refund and a pass to any MGM Mirage Buffet.  Well, I tried it again on the sixth, same problem... Cold food, broken saucing on the eggs benedict, waffles and pancakes that looked and tasted like cardboard. Slow service, and I ordered tea, when coffee was brought I reminded my server I ordered tea, he came back two minutes later with another cup of coffee.  I'd say I've had decent food here over my past few visits, but I think they deserve the yelp one star! The food was gross looking at almost every station! The consensus from people I spoke to about Cravings was you don't Crave breakfast here, but might tolerate lunch and dinner. 

I don't Crave you anymore Cravings! :(

No.
