I am guilty of eating at this location from time to time as it is close to my home. 

I have to say I normally like Dairy Queen! It takes me back to the 80's when life was easy breezy! Mmmmm Heath bar blizzard, such a treat! 

Cherry dilly bar, mmmmm yummy! 

My issue and complaint is THIS location only! 

I finally decided to write my review to help others avoid this train wreck of an operation! 

If I can save one person from eating at this location then I have done my duty! 

Food is never made or cooked properly! 

Corn dogs are still frozen in the middle. 

Blizzards have very little mix ins! Always skimpy! If I order a snickers or heath bar blizzard, come on and put some in it! 

Cheeseburger tasted fowl and I can't describe the taste and odor other than the memory of tossing it into a bin labeled TRASH. 

Prices are high for the amount and quality of food you get. 

The wait for food is ridiculous, after visiting a few times and waiting 20 minutes regardless of what I ordered I knew this place had issues. 

I should have never returned after my first visit however I was open at the time to give them another shot. Always a long wait and disappointment in what I ordered. 

This store is clearly a franchise, they are not playing by the rules that is for sure. 

They cut corners beyond reason and it shows in their service and quality. 

The staff at this location leaves a lot to be desired. 

I have cut this location out as an option, it no longer exist to me. 

The drive thru set up is ridiculous. Try driving in an inside circle and talking through a cup and string speaker system. 

Stay away from this location! 

They are only consistent in BAD.

This location has been written off of my list for good!
