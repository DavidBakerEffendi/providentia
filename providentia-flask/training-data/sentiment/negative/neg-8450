Bought the Groupon to check out this place and thank goodness I had a Groupon.  I would have been so upset to pay full price.  To get the full meat choices we had a $10 per person upcharge.  The good news is that the meat was brought around frequently. The bad news is the meat was horrible. It was terrible quality and not flavorable.  I would not suggest trying this place even with the Groupon. The cheese on the cold bar were hard and who knows how old.  The hot bar did not have good options.  Save your money and try another Brazilian steakhouse.
