No question their bagels are fantastic. HOWEVER, they will screw up your order consistently. Very, very frustrating and we drive out of the way and have been coming here for over 7 years (we followed their change in location). So yes, the fix the problem but they will screw it up again, as expexted. When the problem is butter vs cream cheese, toasted vs not toasted, or a bagel that has jalenpenos in it vs a plain bagel???? How do you screw this up? And then you GIVE ME BACK MY RETURNED ITEM TO KEEP???SERIOUSLY!? 
H&H Bagels has come to Tempe so no longer driving out of my way to NYBB. I'll take Big City Bagels or the H&H, thank you!
