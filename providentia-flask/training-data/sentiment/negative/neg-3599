This place is a joke, if I wanted Square fish I would've gotten a fish sandwich from McDonald's or went to the Safeway and purchase frozen Gordon's fish and fry it at home which taste the same. Then there was not tater sauce who serves fish with out tarter sauce. Now let's talk about the shrimp which looked like chicken tenders which also has no taste, and what is this red special sauce taste like katsup that was watered down. I don't know if it's because I am from the east cost, bet there has to be a better place the petes
