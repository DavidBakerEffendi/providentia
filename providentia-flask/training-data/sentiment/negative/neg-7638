We got there a 2:00 am on a Saturday. The man at the register was very rude, no costumer service experience and lack of manners. 

When Got there was telling off a costumer saying " if you don't like the service get the hell out of here then" the costumer replied "are you the boss?"   The man at the cashier said "no, but almost". 

Anyhow, since I didn't know how their argument began, I went ahead and place my order. When it was time for me to get it, the main at the cashier grabbed my food with his bare hands after he had been handling money, touching his face, and scratching the back of his head. I told him that I did not want the order of food that he had touched with his bare hands. Then as I was looking at the rest of my order, he didn't separate the guacamole and cheese from my taquitos. When I told him that I did not receive the rest of my order the way I had requested it, he stated yelling at me in front of my wife and children. Finally I requested my money back which he did refunded it, however, not before throwing it to me at my face. 

Save your selves the headache and don't bother going to this place.
