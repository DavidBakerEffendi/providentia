I honestly had to check to make sure I was at the right place because all of these reviews had me fooled! A friend of mine raved about this GF restaurant so when family came into town we made sure to stop by. The guys behind the counter were incredibly annoyed that we didn't already know what we wanted to order (there was maybe 2 other people in the whole restaurant so it wasn't like we were holding the line up). We got our food & all 5 of us in our party barely ate. I had chicken & waffles, the waffles were still gooey in the middle & the chicken had zero flavor & was overcooked. I'm assuming the owner (as she had been behind the counter on the phone previously) came by to clear our plates & didn't comment on the 5 plates of barely eaten food. My mom mentioned how disappointed we were & she basically just brushed us off & walked off. This was NOT a cheap brunch at all. Such a disappointment. We will not be back.
