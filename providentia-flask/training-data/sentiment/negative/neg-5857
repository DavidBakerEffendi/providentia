Not at all impressed. Food is mediocre at best. No salsa bar. Ordered carne asada tacos, tortilla soup & Maui onion rings.
All MEH. Tacos were not fresh tasting, meat was bland, onion rings were greasy and tortilla soup was ok.
Being a fan of Cafe Rio and Baja Fresh, this place pales in comparison. Such a shame that it occupies such a great space in this mall.
