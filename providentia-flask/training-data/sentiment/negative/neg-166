First off, beware that this restaurant charges a 3.5% "Concession Fee" (It shows up as CNF on your bill) that they DO NOT TELL YOU ABOUT IN ADVANCE.  The staff (and even one manager) will try to tell you that it is a resort fee related to the hotel, but it is not, since Paris Las Vegas is pretty clear about the fact that they do not charge resort fees.  Rather, it's just a way for the restaurant to bilk unsuspecting customers out of even more money on top of the already inflated Strip prices.

As for the food, it would be deserving of three stars if it cost the same amount as the same items do at Denny's.  The burger was oversalted, the Mac & Cheese "burger" doesn't even include a burger, and the fries would be embarrassing for McDonald's.  Strip pricing is to be expected, but $16+ for mediocre at best food is unacceptable, even on the Strip.

The one "high" point--and the reason the restaurant really does deserve the one star I am giving them--is the drinks.  At $36, they seem pricey, but a 36oz goblet is a lot of drink, so it's not outrageous.  They are garnished with fun candy, and the presentation with dry ice that makes the whole drink bubble and smoke is quite fun.  Coming at happy hour for the BOGO special in the bar area would actually be quite a good deal.  (Unfortunately, the non-goblet martinis and cocktails are still overpriced--even for the Strip--so stick with the goblets; split one if you need to.) 

Sadly, Sugar Factory falls into that category of tourist trap on the Strip and, with so many other fantastic and similarly-priced offerings nearby, is one to avoid.

(It's also worth noting that they have an F from the Better Business Bureau.  I am not the only one who takes exception to the CNF charge, apparently!)
