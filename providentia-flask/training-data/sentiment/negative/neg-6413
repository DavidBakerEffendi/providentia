My husband and I have ordered garcias through doordash a few times and the food has been great. We've even picked it up at Ocotillo and Arizona ave and again the food is amazing. Tonight, we just picked up food at the Warner restaurant, and our experience is definitely different. Unpleasant really.  I was left on hold for almost 5 min, which would have been fine if they were busy. But my husband called them also while was on the phone still waiting, and they were ready to take his order.  When we ordered, I specifically asked if certain sides would be included in a fajita meal. They said yes. I then requested for corn tortillas for that meal, but the staff said they didn't have corn tortillas, just flour. When my husband picked it up, he asked about the corn tortillas since we've gotten it before at the Arizona ave restaurant. The young lady told him that they do have corn tortillas, but the chef only makes it for tacos. Think about that for a second. So that means that they could not fry it and just heat it up and give it to customers upon request. However, according to the young lady, that couldn't be done. The final product, the fajita steak meat was dry/overcooked, hardly any vegetables and dry, and the fajita sides (sour cream, guacamole, Pico de gallo) was forgotten. Again, unpleasant.
