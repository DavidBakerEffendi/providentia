Last week me and my wife went to this restaurant and we disappointed with what we got. We understand for the long line because we wait for 1 hour in order to get table. Not one single person from the restaurant that come to the people that were waiting and give something small appetizer just to appreciate us for waiting.
When we got our table, the ambience is like old restaurant with couples staging for the food. We walk arround and taste all the foods and the taste is just OK not delicious like we hope. 
The only msin attraction was a king crab which is taste verry salty.
We went to sushi side and the choice are limited.
For the price 86 dollar for both of us, we verry disapointed with the buffet bellagio.
Let me compare to our buffet that we always come ( mizuki) at tukwila seattle, this bellagio buffet is nothing. So for the price 44 dolar per person is verry expensive and not the one that I expected. 
We will never go to this buffet again. I hope the management read this.
