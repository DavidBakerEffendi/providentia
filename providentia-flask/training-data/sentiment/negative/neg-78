We'd eaten here before and really enjoyed the pizza, so were looking forward to a lovely dinner, and just ended up supremely disappointed. We made a reservation, expecting that most places are going to be crowded on Saturday evening. We would never expect to be seated for over 20 minutes without anyone so much as offering us water. Maybe I'm being harsh, but when a group of 8 was seated after us and is attended to with water before we are even acknowledged we decided to just up and leave. 
Not sure if we will ever go back.
