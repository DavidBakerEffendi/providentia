First time, last time.  Knew something wasn't right as soon as the kind delivery guy handed me the food.  Something smelled not right and it was the szechuan beef.  It smells like mystery meat, and the mystery continues to haunt us.  The won ton soup is doughy.  The shrimp fried rice was good, but not what fried rice usually tastes like (more like white rice with shrimp and onions).  Best part of the meal was fried cream cheese won tons, which were adequately tasty.  Kung pao shrimp had peanuts, not the usual cashews and was edible, but not enticing.  After a few bites, we threw the entire dinner away.  We have high hopes for the wrapped fortune cookies though.
