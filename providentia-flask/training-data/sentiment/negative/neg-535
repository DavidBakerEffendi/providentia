Questionable Beef

Ordered two things in my takeout order tonight - Sezwaun Lo Mein - there was no description so I pulled the trigger.  A bit more expensive, it had a sauce that I did not find spicy but my wife did.  It was fairly flavorful and had veggies - onion, carrot, spring onion, broccoli.  Was not bad really.  

The real awful part was the combo order of broccoli and beef.  The beef is cheaper than the chicken - the beef had a strange flavor, like beef jerkyish flavor, not a flavor that should be in chinese food.  Perhaps the beef had 'aged' some?  Gross isn't really the word, downright nasty.  The fried rice was flavorless and not good.

This place does do a few things right, the teriyaki chicken tends to be very good, but based on what was ordered, the horrible beef means that we will be not ordering for any future chinese food needs.

Update: I can confirm that my wife got food poisoning from the beef, she started feeling bad within an hour or two after eating, and had vomiting, and diarhea.  Avoid this place, and most of all avoid the beef.
