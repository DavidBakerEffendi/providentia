The service is horrible! The waiter starts trying to collect the dishes when it's almost done and most of the dishes taste not quite authentic. 

On our last visit, we met friends there when we picked up our takeout order and started chatting at the table. About 5 minutes later (we were about to leave actually) the waitress asked us to move because she wanted to seat a customer right next to where we stood while the restaurant was 90% empty.
