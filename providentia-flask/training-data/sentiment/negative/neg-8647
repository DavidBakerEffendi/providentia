WOW.. THE WORST!
From a person that eats all over Pittsburgh at some of the best places in this city, this place was so bad! 
I met a friend there last night. I knew something was wrong when there were 10 cars in the lot, on a beautiful Friday night at 7pm. I should have followed my instincts. 
 Drinks (12.50 each) were fine so were the bartenders. But the food and prices were ridiculous ! 2 entrees, sea bass and blackened scallops. 4 drinks and 1 appetizer. $151.00 + tip. Trust me, go to Applebees and you will get better food and I hate chain restaurants.  
 Sea Bass.. tasteless with bland rice and nasty spinach. Blackened Scallops.. not blackened and tiny with 3 spears of asparagus.
 I usually would never go to a chain, but we did for convenience.
 I can eat at some of the Burghs best restaurants for Mitchell's prices and walk away saying WOW.  
 This place needs a serious face lift and needs a new head chef. OR... price your food like it should be. These entrees were worth about $12.00, instead of $35.00.
 I have never been to Eat and Park, but I am sure you will get better food there.
 This is my first Yelp review. I had to create a profile just to write about this place.
 I know food is a crap shoot, but the managers and owners of Mitchell's should be ashamed of what they serve and charge. 
 Close the doors or just get a clown for a mascot and price your food like a below average restaurant.
