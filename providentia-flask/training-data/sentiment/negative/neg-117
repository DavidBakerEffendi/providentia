Your experience at Subway is relative to its location and employees. While all Subway menus are the same, the quality and handling of food can change substantially from location to location. 

This Subway has a group of employees that wish you would implode in the parking lot before you make it to their door. I'm not expecting someone to hold the door for me, welcome me to the establishment, and take my coat, but do you people really have to be such a bunch of frowny muthas? 

I can't crack a joke, utter a friendly word, or either breathe in the same space as these employees without getting the look of death from any one of them, especially the older guy with grayish hair. He's either a card carrying member of the shortbus, or he's too busy fantasizing about stabbing me repeatedly in a dark alleyway to actually speak to and make eye contact. Maybe he's prone to seizures, I don't know. 

If you go here, and you're even slightly undecided about what kind of bread you want, or what kind of toppings should go on your sandwich you should probably call the PoPo and ask for an escort back to your car. 

I'm not one to hamper anyones freedom of choice, but enter at your risk, and bring an umbrella because they will piss on your parade.
