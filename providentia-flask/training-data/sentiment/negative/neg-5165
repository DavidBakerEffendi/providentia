My First time in Scottsdale was last weekend. I was craving Chinese food and after reading reviews from several sources I decided to try Yummy Yummy. At first everything seemed fine I finished my meal and left, but as time passed I began feeling sicker and sicker. By the next morning I was running a fever, in pain and keeping nothing down. I without a doubt had food poisoning and will not be dining at yummy yummy again.
