WARNING: DO NOT RESERVE LANES FOR A NIGHT EVENT OR COME HERE EXPECTING PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE

If I could give them 0 stars I would. My friend reserved lanes for a wedding after party the weekend of April 22. When we arrived to Corner Alley they first refused to serve one member of the party citing they were too intoxicated, which was not the case. They then said they wouldn't serve any of us saying it was because the groom hadn't arrived (they were cleaning up their venue). At this point, there are about 25-30 members of the wedding party there and they wouldn't even discuss it with us or be agreeable. It seemed like at this point they just wanted to close up for the night and didn't want to have to deal with all these people (which if you look at other reviews seems to be a trend).

We ended up going to Euclid Tavern who was more than happy to accommodate us (and take our money) and had an exceptional time.
