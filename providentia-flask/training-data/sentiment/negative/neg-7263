Was so excited to bring a friend here for 1/2 priced steak night....arrived to see a packed house. Was told by the INCREDIBLY RUDE hostess that they were no longer taking tables for the night due to the kitchen being so backed up on ticket times....ok, disappointing but understandable. What's not understandable...the hostess rolling her eyes and acting as if I'm bothering her when I ask her if there's an eta on when they may take tables...or her annoyance by my suggesting I sit at the bar and have a few drinks while waiting...was told I wasn't gambling so I wasn't allowed to sit there...or at any of the empty tables to again, just have a drink and wait out the kitchen...she rolls her eyes again and tells me no. Who just says no? I get gaming on a normal night but to accommodate the overflow wouldn't you bypass that rule? I never yelp. I'm in the service industry, yelping is for idiots with to much time on their hands generally I feel like. But wow! I have never ever encountered someone so nasty while dining out. I'll never go back. I'll pay full price somewhere else.
