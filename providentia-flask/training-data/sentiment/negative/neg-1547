Ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and a dozen hot wings. Very disappointed with both. I thought this was the spot for buffalo chicken pizza? I think you yinzers must not know anything about how buffalo is supposed to be, and I feel sorry for you and myself. The crust was very hard and thin, the chicken was super dried out, there was no buffalo taste to the pizza at all. It was edible, but I think rural, West Virginia gas station pizza would have been comparable. The wings were just the opposite. Although good in size, They were SUPER gooey, you could actually eat these wings if you had no teeth, just slurp them off the bone. I like a more balanced wing, some where between gooey and burnt to a crisp.  Super disappointed I spent almost 30 dollars on this meal that more than half of will likely go in the trash. Highlight of the meal was my Pepsi cola.
