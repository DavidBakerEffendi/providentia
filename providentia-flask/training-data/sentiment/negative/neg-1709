Its more a 2.5 star. Friday night came here at around 7:45pm was a 10 min wait for 2 ppl but when we were brought to our table we notice the restaurant was not even full maybe half full. Wasnt sure why there was a wait for the table. Hostess was friendly. Our server was kinda hard selling. Kept asking if we want the $5 beer deal. When we order a cocktail he kept asking if we want to add another shot for $2.99, I told him its fine and he askes again. Food came pretty quick. Food tasted alright. Wasnt great but wasnt bad. Prices are average price. Server did come twice check on us. Menu does have a lot of options. May come back if no other choices.

Update 3 hrs later.
Decide to change it to 1 star. We waited for at least 20 mins to try to locate where our server went. We did not see him amd ask the hostess for the bill and she said she will get it right away. 7 mins later she was out of sight. Server finally came over after disappearing for more than 20 mins. Didnt ask if anything was alright n pushed us in getting dessert. I also think they put alot of salt or MSG. I was thirst and still so dehyrated and keep needing to drink water 3 hrs after the meal. I definitely will not come back. Atleast not to the Yorkdale location.
