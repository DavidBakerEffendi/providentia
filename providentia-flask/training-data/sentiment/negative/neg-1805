5 dollar cover for a shit ass suck band. It took 20 minutes to order drinks. No tables. They serve food but will tell you it's more of an after thought when you ask why there's no where to sit. The waitress laughed at us when we asked about eating. ALL mixed drinks are poured in full sized beer mugs!....one shot of vodka and an entire beer mug filled redbull. I asked why such a big cup and she says, "oh we pour heavy here." I says, "yes I know, you pour heavy on redbull but I needed heavy on vodka!"
