Absolutely horrendous! Our waitress was absolutely unavailable during our visit and the restaurant was empty so their was no excuse. I did see our waitress socializing with her co workers instead of waiting tables. As for the food I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was incredibly dry, unfortunately I was hungry so I finished it instead of complaining. On top of the horrendous food, our waitress clearly didn't understand the order of how a meal is suppose to be she instead served the entrees before the appetizers which for another words shows a lack of training at this restaurant.
