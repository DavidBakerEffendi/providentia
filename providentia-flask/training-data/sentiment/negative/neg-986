1.5 stars out of 5.

The good - The service was excellent because the waitress made arrangements when we needed to add an extra spot for our reservations.

The bad - The food.  We ordered chicken fingers and fish and chips.  We figured, you can't mess then up... We were wrong.

The halibut fish was bad.  The batter want crispy.  It tasted like those frozen fish you get from the supermarket.  Even Burrito Boyz's halibut fish was done better.  The coleslaw was passable.

The chicken fingers didn't have much meat.  They looked very sad.  Even jackastors chicken fingers were better (St. Louis chicken fingers are the best in our opinion).

The fries were not crispy.  I don't think they were fresh either.  The gravy was good.  It helped us finish the fries.

We didn't want to go to Pickle Barrel since we never had a great experience with them.  We only went because the group decided.

With the prices they charge, the food's pretty crappy.  Won't be going if we could help it.
