I wanted to bring my parents to a great fusion place and heard about this place. Drove all the way from Brampton and walked in around 630 to be told that it will be a half hour wait. The lady was really nice and we accepted to wait. After sitting there after an hour and 15 min I finally got frustrated and approached the lady and expressed the long wait and she said that there was another person in front of us. At that point I grabbed my parents and walked out and went to the keg across the street!! I could of done that in Brampton.
