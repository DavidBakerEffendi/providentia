Went here for breakfast. Saw their menu for breakfast and was pleased to see they had an option for fruit and a half sandwich. (Exactly what I was craving). Their breakfast starts at 7:00... I came in at 8:30(ish) and ordered the half sandwich and fruit combo... to find they hadn't cut their fruit yet. Personally having been in management in a similar style cafe, I found that a bit ridiculous.... so I opted for the sausage sandwich... to be told they didn't have that (inventory issues...also unacceptable..... but a little more understandable as it is Monday and maybe they had a big weekend breakfast rush)... I went to fill my cup with ice and noticed the soda machine was FILTHY... like their closers must not have cleaned it, nor did the opening crew bother to wipe it down. Much too filthy to have been done in an hour and a half with the very small amount of people in their lobby. 
Now being as I worked in the restaurant industry I'm not much of a yelper. I realize restaurants have good and bad days. But this is 3 issues on my first attempt at getting breakfast here..... not pleased.
The only good thing about my service was my cashier (Alishia) remained calm and collective regardless of my obvious annoyance... I almost felt brushed off by it... but I'm glad she will continue to smile and go throughout her day regardless of a annoyed customer at 8:30 in the morning.
