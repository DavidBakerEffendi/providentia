Went through the drive-thru here on Sunday, 7/24, at about 10:30pm, and the kid at the window was miserable from his introduction on the speaker. We thought we'd give him the benefit of the doubt in thinking that perhaps he had a bad day, but then we watched from the payment window, as he rolled his eyes, made faces, and jabbed at the computer screen in total disgust at the following car's ordering or conversation over his headphones. I have never seen such immaturity in a person while at work. We just watched in disbelief, but didn't say anything to him because he was handling our food. Speaking of our food, fries were cold and the burger had much too much sauce on it. We were awed by the entire experience. We won't be going back to this location again - and that kid needs to get fired. He's unstable.
