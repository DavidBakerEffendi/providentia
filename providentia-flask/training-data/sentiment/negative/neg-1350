Went there yesterday to give Five Guys another chance and had a cheeseburger (one patty), fries and a soft drink for $9.42. I couldn't even taste the burger since the enourmous bun swallowed the burger. Obviously, this bun is meant for the double patty burgers. The regular fries are ok but the cajun fries are brutal because they are drenched with spices which renders the fries inedible. I can think of few burger joints off the top of my head that have a much lower price point and burgers that are much more tastier than Five Guys (Culver's, Lenny's & In-n-Out to name a few).
