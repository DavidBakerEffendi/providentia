EKKKKKK! Are You Kidding ME? This Sam Woo restaurant location is RIDICULOUS! Disgusting food for a ridiculous price! 90 DOLLARS for SIX DISHES! 

Came here for lunch before leaving Vegas - and obviously not a good one at all.

We were a party of 6 adults and 2 children - we ordered 6 dishes:

House Steamed Chicken with the ginger onion dipping sauce - there were barely any meat on the chicken - quite frankly it was nearly all bones and skin.

Seafood Tofu Pot - this dish was okay 

Soy Sauce Beef Chow Fun - it was like they pour oil all over it before serving it - it was very hard to eat when it's slipping off your fork/chopstick.

Beef Stew Lo Mein with Wontons - the noodles were disgusting! it was soggy and not to mention tasteless. 

Duck Noodle Soup with Wontons - again the noodles were disgustingly soggy...wontons were bland and there was not much meat on the pieces of duck.

Chinese Broccoli sauteed with garlic - pretty greasy and it was definitely very aged broccoli 

They also charge for rice - per bowl..

Normally at the Sam Woo back at home (San Gabriel, CA) ordering 6 dishes for lunch amounts to about 30 dollars - 40 dollars at most but here it was unbelievably 90 dollars!  

The service was just as bad - it wasn't busy but had to ask several times for things plus one of the waitress openly and loudly complained about another table of diners that left - how they asked for utensils but didn't use them.

One last thing I have to say is - I can't believe this place is still in business!
