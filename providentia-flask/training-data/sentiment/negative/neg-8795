Pre Game for Coyotes Game. Quoted 40 minutes, but it ended up being more like 30 minutes for a party of 5. We waited at the sidebar near the mechanical bull. Service was good there, and when the party seated at the bar stools got up the bartender said we could sit there and eat. Should have taken the offer, but waited for the table. We were seated,(4:40pm) and Misty came over to serve us. Some had drinks already, and a few needed refills. We also cut to the chase and ordered a Monster Platter, with a bit of everything. So that round of drinks took 15 minutes, and appetizer came promptly. Then entrees ordered,(5:05pm) and another round of drinks. By this time we see Misty running around, and not even able to wave her down. 30 minutes later round of drinks delivered, and was told they had to change the keg. Game time is 6pm  will we make it?   Entrees delivered by a food runner one at a time (5:45pm) Really? Having a restaurant background I am pretty easy going when it comes to seeing a busy venue, but this was really bad!  All entrees delivered except mine...a rib eye. My wife had to get up from the table to get salt and pepper, plus some steak sauce. We then stopped another server to ask about the missing meal. While everyone at my table is hustling to get the meals eaten in 10 minutes, 5:55pm my rib eye arrives, I turned it away because we needed to get to the game. I asked for the check, and Misty came over saying it was her fault, and she was sooo sorry. She never has a bad day, but her Son was arrested the night before, and blah, blah, blah and she is off her game. Did I want to take the steak to go? I am going to a hockey game. Really?  So they discounted the steak, no visit from Manager, who was clearly visible throughout the evening, but didn't seem to be helping staff much. Overall a terrible night, and game had started by the time we got in our seats.
