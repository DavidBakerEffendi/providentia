Not worth the money at all. Very very average buffet we ate there only because we got late in picking up our show tickets and had booked the 9:30 Cirque show and didn't want to eat after the show. So thought oh Vegas is known for its buffets so let's do that. Worst decision ever. The fried rice was kept on the burners like forever they were too hard. Will not recommend at all. Servers were nice no complains there just food wasn't to par with the price wouldn't pay more than $10-15 for that meal.
