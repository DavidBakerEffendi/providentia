Good service, but below average food. 

I'm not much of a seafood person, so when we go to seafood restaurants, I order some type of chicken or steak. At the Salt Cellar I ordered a rib eye steak. I know that you shouldn't go to a seafood restaurant and order anything other than seafood, but my steak was surprisingly bad. There was absolutely no seasoning on my steak... no salt... no pepper... no flavor.

If the kitchen can't prepare a decent steak, they shouldn't have it on the menu and it shouldn't be $40. Unfortunately, it made our experience a disappointment and we won't be back.
