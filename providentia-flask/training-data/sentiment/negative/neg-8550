I was waiting I'm in line with my mom and she was ordering u was still looking at the menu next thing I hear is the chef inside the kitchen talking really loud to another female staff "OMG she is so fat she could be 4 times of you" to the female staff in Cantonese. I don't look like a Chinese with all the different color in my hair. He was staring at me while he was talking about me. I stared at him for 5 whole mins crossing my arms. He then knows I heard every single world that he said about me so he quickly shut the door to the kitchen. I told the boss about this but of course the boss was protecting him. I'm a paying customer, I'm not begged for food,and he has not rights to judge his customers. The owner should have ask the chef to come out to apologize to me about what he had said and which no apologies was giving to me at all. I'm warning all people not to go here at if you don't want to be criticized.
