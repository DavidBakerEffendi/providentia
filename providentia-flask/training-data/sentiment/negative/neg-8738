Waited with anticipation for the restaurant to open. Was disappointed. The $8 plate I had was nothing but a let down. And the tacos I got for a friend were equally as bland. There was no taste to anything. I would never be able to tell you where these tacos came from. And the sauce that was supposed to be "extremely hot" was as spicy as red colored water. Which seemed to be a theme, because my tamarindo was also watery. Never going to eat here again.
