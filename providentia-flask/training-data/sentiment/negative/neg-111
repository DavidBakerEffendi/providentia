Disappointing! The front staff is great and the ambience is really nice. And that's all the great things that you're going to experience. We ordered a Caesar salad, which was very bland. Nothing like you would expect a Caesar salad to be.  We ordered the Buratta, and a couple of pastas that were okay. Nothing worth the price of them. We then ordered the filet steak, which tasted like it was burnt, and honestly I feel you could get a better cut of meat from whole foods than this place. With our state came out of side which our waiter never told us about and it tasted like vomit. By this point we were hoping the desserts would be so good that it may make up for the meal. Unfortunately we were wrong. We ordered the olive oil cake and the tiramisu. The olive oil cake had way too much orange flavor to it and the tiramisu was more of a chocolate brownie on the bottom with a cheesecake layering on top then a traditional Italian tiramisu. Then we ordered some cappuccinos and after one and a half sips we were done. I asked the waiter did we order espresso's, he said no they were cappuccinos. The service we got was very poor, they don't tell you about sides to meals and their overall guidance for you for the evening for your first time there is very underwhelming. All in all we will not be returning, even if they paid us to come back! Extremely disappointed, and avoid this place and make the better decision to have true Italian food, because this place does not serve anything like Italy has. Founder must have been drinking too much wine to remember what Italian food should be like. Avoid this place!
