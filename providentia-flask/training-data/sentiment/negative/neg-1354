I've never had such a disgusting food experience anywhere in Las Vegas! You couldn't pay me to eat here again.  I don't get how the owners/managers can serve such horrible quality food with a clean conscience.  
The shrimp was raw, the meat was burnt and every single dish had the same nasty sauce all over it.  Gross! Don't ever eat here.
