It took about 20 minutes to make my wrap and when I get back to my office I see the lettuce is completely old and wilted. I understand this is a warm wrap but it should not wilt by the time I get back to my office (5 minute drive) and open it. I am very disappointed that they supposedly pride themselves on being a wellness cafe. Not cool. I posted a pic as well.
