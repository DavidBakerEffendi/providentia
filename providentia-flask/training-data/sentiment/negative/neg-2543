I generally give every business a fair shake and realize everyone has a bad day but don't waste your money here. I ordered a meatball parm sandwich and what I got was an embarrassment, there was almost no cheese and the meatballs were sliced what seemed to be in quarters but length wise and then laid on the bread, there was almost nothing on this sandwich other than bread! The worst part is it's a $9.00 sandwich, if it was $5 or $6 I would understand and if I worked closer I would have brought it right back. I will say the flavor was ok at best. If you served people sandwiches like this for $9 anywhere in the northeast you wouldn't be in business for long. Either lower your prices for your mediocre sandwiches or up your game to justify the price.
