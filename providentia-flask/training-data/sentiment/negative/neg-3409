Stayed here for two nights over the weekend and was greatly disappointed. Yes the suites are big but that's all this place has going for it. I tried ordering room service and I wasn't allowed to charge it to the room even though I had a credit card on file. Maybe because I booked through expedia? I wasn't given a clear reason why but this seemed like a basic request. I tried calling the front desk and was put on hold for a few minutes so just gave up. I had a question a few days later on my bill and was put on hold again. When I got on the line the rep was speaking to a coworker and didn't realize she was live, heard her coworker say "hey, I think your on" and then got hung up on and had to go through the whole process of waiting to talk to someone again. I prefer the service at the bellagio and will just deal with a smaller room.
