Decided to get some brunch with my boyfriend and we're probably 1 out of 10 other people in the place and first in line when ordering our food. Obviously missing the rush because after sitting multiple people walked in, however a multitude of people that arrived after us were getting their food prior to us. We waited over 20 minutes where people who barely sat were getting their food before us. Asked multiple employees to check on our order and we're never gotten back to. We're honestly appalled at this level of customer service. Just received our food while writing this and it's cold? How can something that took 30 minutes be cold on arrival? A few bites in I could tell my French toast was extremely moist and didn't seem cooked through. Asked for the manager and it turns out the person that brought us the food was the manager! Why was nothing addressed? Why didn't we get an apology for the lengthy time we waited? Or any acknowledgement at all. He was rude and unapologetic. For a place that is usually fast paced with delicious food it sure seems they've taken a turn for the worst. Very disappointed with our food choice today
