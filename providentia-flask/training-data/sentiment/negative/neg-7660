Slow service and overpriced mediocre food. 

This restaurant is located within the Trump Hotel. Since we were already staying at Trump and didn't want to venture out for food, the group of 9 of us ate lunch here. 

Throughout the entire lunch, service was extremely SLOW. There weren't many guests at the restaurant and the wait staff seemed to be standing around a lot of the time as if they weren't working. We waited a long time for our water/coffee to come, and even longer for our food to come. The service was pretty terrible as the staff seemed rude and even disengaged. They came to our table a total of 3 times (once to take our order, once to serve water/coffee and once to serve our food). 

The food here was mediocre but definitely not worth the price tag. A burger was $18, but definitely did not taste that great to justify the price. I would NOT recommend this place, even if you were looking for something convenient. You will end up saving time by going somewhere else because the service is so slow here.
