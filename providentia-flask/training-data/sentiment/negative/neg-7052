Wish I had read the reviews before I forked over my money.  This was by far the worst airport food I have eaten ANYWHERE. Two bites and it hit the trash. Massively overpriced, lacking flavor, and slow service. A 5-year old running a stand selling lemonade and PB&J sandwiches would have turned out higher quality food. 

In sum, avoid.
