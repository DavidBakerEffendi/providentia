Not recommended at all. The service is disappointingly poor. I found dried shrimps and chicken feet in my order. I ordered shredded pork but instead I received the items above. I fought for a refund, which I received after a lengthy argument with the management. The management was being aggressive, rude and made racist comments regarding my ethnicity. The food got delivered one hour later after being ordered. The other dishes were cold, blend and tasteless. The food was definitely not worth the price of purchase. I would not recommend anyone order from or dine at this restaurant.
