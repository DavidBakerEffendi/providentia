Is it a requirement to smell like urine and be over the age of 65 with no taste buds to eat at this establishment? Cause, that appears to be the case of you do decide to venture in for a bite or two. The service is great. No complaints there but the food is NOT edible! My whole family is nauseated right now. I hope this isn't food poisoning. :(
