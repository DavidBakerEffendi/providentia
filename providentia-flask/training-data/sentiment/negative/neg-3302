It's a beautiful Friday at 11:30 am and I decided to stop for a quick lunch with my very young daughter after feeding the ducks at the Anthem park. We walked in and the hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait (I should have left I looked and saw a bar booth open with a pile of glasses, napkins and plates so I asked if we could eat in the bar area. She said sure, but it's going to take just as long to get food. We sat down and after 10 minutes they finally cleared the table. After what felt like eternity we got our food. The table next to us waited even longer and they had to send their chicken sandwich back. They are severely under staffed. The two bartenders that were serving the bar section were very nice so it's not their fault. This chilis is poorly managed. The food is just okay and the staffing is terrible. You are better off driving down to happy valley and eating at one of the great places there.
