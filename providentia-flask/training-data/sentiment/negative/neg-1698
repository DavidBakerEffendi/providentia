This was my fourth visit to this place. And will for sure be my last. I came in tonight for the resorts social Sundays promotion where locals get 50% off the bill. My pizza was passed off to another customer on the assembly line. Ordered 2 salads and the ticket got lost. Ordered a side of broccolini and it was stone cold and WAY too spicy. I like heat but it wasn't edible. The best part of the meal was the complimentary ice water and when I walked out. This is the only venue on the property that doesn't seem to be able to get their act together. The entire team seems lost and definitely not a sign of management to be seen. A huge turn off and will most definitely be letting friends and family know about the poor service here.
