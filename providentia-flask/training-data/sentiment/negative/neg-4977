Called in before I headed out to ask when was last call.  First the girl had no idea and asked the other staff and after discussing she said 10:30pm. We made it before 10:30pm after a 30 minute commute and the waitress said the chef had already left. They were not apologetic at all and just said well there's no chef to make the food for you. Was definitely a disappointment since it use to be my late night sushi spot.
