Food here has always been great. Service not so much. Last night we ordered an Uber eats order from them. When the driver got there, they informed him there was no order to pick up. We had already been waiting almost an hour from placing the ride at that point.  

Second issue.  Came here in person tonight. Called in our order 25 min ahead of time.  We were told 30 min. No problem. We get here and instead of having a pick up window or pick up area, they directed us to stand in the long line of people waiting to order. Why should we wait in line with people who are waiting to order when our order has already been placed? The line was deep and hardly moving. They should seriously considering having a pick up window especially for the people who called ahead knowing there would be a long line rather than shuffle those same people with the people who did NOT call ahead. Otherwise what's he point of calling ahead? 

3rd, this is my first time leaving a review but not the first time we have had issues. My other half suffered food poisoning from chicken here a few months back. The general manager did make it right thankfully. He has been great and the staff ultimately do their best. The food is amazing every single time. But certain things like this can't entirely be overlooked.
