Ordered a chicken shawarma for lunch yesterday in addition to three other sharmarmas for friends. We Got REALLY bad food poisoning and have felt like I'm dying since. I will never ever eat here again after this experience and i highly recommend you to stay away as well unless you enjoy throwing up absolutely everything and pooping yourself a couple hours after eating this food (for the next couple days).

Note. This was the first and last thing we ate all day. We had to miss work the following day to recover from what we just endured all night and morning
