It was Thursday, around 6:30pm January 18, 2018. We went to get 2 sandwiches at the Subway on Pecos and Russell. There was two young employees making sandwiches. One of the employee was on the taller side. Our problem was with the shorter employee. I have no other way to describe them because they were not wearing name tags. It was all fine and they were both very nice and polite but the problem was when we were checking out and the employee took our money and give us our change with the gloves on and then as I was walking out I notice that he never changed the gloves then he started stocking all the veggies sticking his hand with the dirty glove in the food containers. I was so surprised by what was happening I didn't think about going back and telling him just to give me my money back because who knows if he did the same thing and made change with the same gloves right before he made my sandwich. 
Of course the more I thought about it the more I could not eat that sandwich and there went some money to waste.
