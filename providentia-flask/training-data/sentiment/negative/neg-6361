Our waiter was very rude to us. Interrupted us impatiently when we tried to order our meals. The food was very bad, I had the bland and dry fish tacos and my friend had a chicken wrap where the fat hadn't been rendered properly so it was just disgusting. They obviously don't care about the quality of their food here. And considering their prices, I would never come back again. Avoid at all cost.
