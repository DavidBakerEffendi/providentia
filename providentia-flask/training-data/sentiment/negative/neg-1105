OK so we went into this place cause it looked kinda cool. Well not so much. 

First of all because of the brewery this place smells like hops and stale peanuts. I'm NOT down. So we get sat by the hostess upstairs and there was one other table that got sat there as well. The server took 15 minutes to come to use. By that point the other table had left. Worst service ever. We ordered our food (whole another story there) And by the time our food came I still had not received my WATER?!?!? like are you pumping the spring in the back. I asked her 2 times for the water. Ridiculous. The food was so so, My boyfriend got some pizza that was garbage and I cant remember what i got because it isn't worth remembering. The smell alone was something i couldn't get used to, like a fart or the way your apartment building smells lol. We only stayed because we only had 1 hour for lunch and by that point there was no point in going somewhere else. I will NEVER go there again. Shit service and stale peanuts are not my forte. :)
