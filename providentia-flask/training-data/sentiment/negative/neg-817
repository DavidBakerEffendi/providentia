I finally decided to write to Panda Corp to express my displeasure with the smaller containers and now the price increase and a business practice of not filling the containers up.   I went through their whole process and tried to submit it and big surprise!! I wouldn't go through.  Oh well, I loved their food my lunchtime favorite is no more.
