If I could give it less than one star, I would.  It was the Worst. Meal. Ever.  Biscuits that came out with the salad were raw inside.  The filet mignon ordered medium rare came out bloody.  The broccoli was yellow and had brown spots.  The ribs were hard and dry.  Nothing was served hot.  The iced tea was from a powdered mix.  The waitress would only talk and look at my husband.  He got refills on the awful iced tea.  She was carrying the water pitcher at the same time, but never refilled my water glass.  
It looks like it would be good, but anyplace is better, even MacDonald's.
