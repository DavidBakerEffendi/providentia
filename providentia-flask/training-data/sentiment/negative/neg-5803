I was thrilled when I got to this place for my friends birthday and found out their gimmick was a hot dog with over 50 toppings!

It was surprisingly good and so were the tater tots with quality nacho cheese all over them.  

But then, and I hate to base this on one "special" night, this guy got on stage to introduce "Visual Night".  All of a sudden there were horrid home made films on the screen with people just screaming on the top of their lungs on film.  You couldn't talk over it and the films themselves were honestly the grossest things I have ever seen.  It totally killed her bday.  Luckily we were all good sports about going elsewhere but they lost a lot of business that night.  

Just the fact that they never mentioned to my friend who planned her bday there that this would be the theme of the night and there was no warning whatsoever, nor an apology to anyone was really a turn off.
