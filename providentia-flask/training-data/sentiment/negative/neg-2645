This wing stop gives the franchise a very bad look . 

1)  Don't try calling , they don't pick up if they do it's after you've called 3-4 times minimum.

2) The service is slower than that last bit of dish soap you're waiting to come down so you can say you used it all and got your money's worth . 

3) After the hour and a half wait for your order the fries are soggy , the boneless wings barely covered in sauce , and they forgot part of your order. 

I'm so disappointed because I love Wing stop .
