Whoever is running this now is doing a major disservice to the Las Palmas brand. I love Las Palmas grocery stores; the restaurant is interminable.  Over an hour wait for our uninspired meals.  The wait staff was apologizing for the delay.  The manager gave us a 20% discount without talking to us.  What, you don't want to face your customers??? Giving my group of 6 a $12 discount don't do diddly.  The guacamole was good, the burritos starchy and the posole a disappointment.  Until there are a dozen or so positive reviews, stay away.
