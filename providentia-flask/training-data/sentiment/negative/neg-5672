If you are a smoker, you will love this place. All others, stay away!!!!  This is one of the restaurants in Nevada that ignores the clean air act.

The waitresses wear nothing but their underwear, so this place is not for kids.  They do not warn you about that ahead of time, and there are lots of people that bring in their kids and then try to shield their eyes.
