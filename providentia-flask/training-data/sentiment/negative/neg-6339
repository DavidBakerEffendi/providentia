I should have known better based on other reviews--learn from my mistakes!

Customer service: 1 star. The dude who took my delivery order was really rude. Whatever.

Speed: 1 star. 50 minutes to deliver on a Monday afternoon, but still, that seems to be the norm based on other reviews.

Taste: 0 stars. Gross. I ordered the Orange Tofu, General Tso's Tofu, and Egg Fried Rice. The sauce of both of the tofu dishes were really similar, like they just added more soy sauce to the General Tso's. Both sauces were really gelatinous  and just tasted really low quality. I also felt terrible after I ate them. 

Just don't.
