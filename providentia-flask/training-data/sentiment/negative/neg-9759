Been here several times. Today was big disappointment. Cashier refused to honor a coupon because of a "system issue".  Pulled chicken portion was minuscule and the rubbery.  At least it was hot, unlike the side of greens which were lukewarm at best. Green beans were warmer and edible.  Dinning room was also disappointing with several dirty tables and debris on the floor. Won't be back any time soon.
