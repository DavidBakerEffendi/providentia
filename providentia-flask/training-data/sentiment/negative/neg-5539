I've been coming here for years and the place has really gone downhill. For starters, when you walk in you're greeted by the stench of sewage, but not by anyone else. My friend and I came for lunch, and requested all you can eat. I placed our order by writing it down on the sheet they provide. I ordered 2 nigiri, 6 rolls, 3 green mussels, and a miso soup. We received 2 green mussels, 4 rolls, and the miso soup. I'm not sure if the rolls are actually not fresh or my senses were being tainted by the horrible smell. After waiting at least 25 minutes I asked the waitress why we hadn't received the rest of our order. She talked to the owner, and he gave me a dirty look as if was being ridiculous for asking about my order. He then proceeded to talk about us to the other sushi chef. After my other order finally came out, the owner just stared at me while I tried to eat the lukewarm mushy roll, making me feel extremely uncomfortable. The waitress, who is clearly new, was very nice and very apologetic about the bad service. Very disappointed as this used to be one of my go to sushi restaurants.
