Worst experience I've had in memory.  Our party of six waited over an hour to be served while everyone around us was served.  Five of us ordered burritos and when, after numerous apologies, we finally got our food it was inedible, with either burnt rice or bones.  The waitress knew nothing about the menu and for some reason kept promising the manager was going to come speak with us, not that we ever requested it.  We were given a discount, but I didn't see how much.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough and will never return.
