The first time we came here service was OK and all the meals arrived at the same time, however since then service has gone downhill. The last time we were there it was the last straw, 5 of us sat down for breakfast. I asked for a glass of water and am still waiting for it. All the meals arrived except mine, and when it finally arrived The eggs Benny was stone cold so I sent it back. 

If you all get bacon and eggs all is fine but try ordering a crepe, eggs Benny, an omelet and a smoothie and everything seems to fall apart.

After 3 consecutive bad service experiences we have taken our breakfast business elsewhere
