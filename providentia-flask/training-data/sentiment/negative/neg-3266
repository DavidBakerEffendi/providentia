Waited for 10 minutes for a hostess to show up for seating, finally the party that came in afterwards went hunting for somebody. Seated at a table and waited another 20 minutes. When no one came to take our order we finally left. Greeted on the way out I asked if the service was always this slow (it was Tuesday) she simply replied "I am the owner."
