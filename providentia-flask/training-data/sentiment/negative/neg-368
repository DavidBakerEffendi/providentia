I have eaten here plenty of times, but NEVER again! I go some menudo this morning and there was a napkin in it! I don't know if it was a clean or dirty napkin, but that's disgusting! Of course, the owner is on vacation and the manager isn't there. I make menudo and never has anything other than what's required has been in it! To add insult to injury, they accused me of putting the napkin in there.
