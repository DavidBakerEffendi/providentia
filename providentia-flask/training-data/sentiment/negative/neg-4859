I've been a long time customer of the cafe and have had their delivery and dined in before.

The Food : The food is pretty good, I've never had a bad meal here. The specialty drinks are pretty good too. You really can't go wrong on the menu. 

The Service: Absolutely horrible. We order food from them a few times a week so we give them pretty good business. We always tip their drivers out nicely too. Be aware you are going to wait at least an hour-hour 30mins for delivery. The dine-in service always was bad, drinks never refilled in time, the girl would forget things. Not to mention the seating is the most uncomfortable ever. So after 3-4 trips we refrain from visiting here for Dine-in. 

They have forgotten stuff on delivery several times, and when you call they get all defensive about it, second guess you, call you a liar and they definitely don't apologize for their mistakes and on top of it, they don't try to make it up to you. In our business if we don't keep our customers happy, they leave and go somewhere else. I think we really need start looking for someone else to service our breakfast/lunch needs in the area.
