I ve been going to Oddseoul for about a year or year and a half. I loved the food at this place and their cocktails are awesome. The last two times I have been there though, the bartenders have been awful... First time I figured he may be having a bad day, it happens. Went back today... I have never come across this anywhere else. He tried to explain to us that we couldn't sit at the bar to wait for the table. So we told him we d get some drinks as we waited. We asked if that was possible and in the most condescending way told us that it wasn't the issue. That he wanted the bar spots for other people. Got it. No problem. If you explained that, we would have gotten it and moved to the bar across the street as we waited for our table. But he felt he needed to be rude and condescending instead of explaining himself. Two times in a row that their bartenders do this? Not for me. I won't be going back there again. Lots of other bars with no douchey bartenders. I have never written a bad review before, sometimes I rather use reviews if a place is great, but I was so angry and dissapointed with their bartending staff, I had to.
