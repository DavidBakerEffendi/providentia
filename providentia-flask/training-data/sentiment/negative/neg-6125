So sorry to have to the bearer of bad news but let me just say the new owners have Killed East Side Pizza. So sad, I am in mourning. We have been going to East Side for years, The previous owners Jerry and Peggy were awesome. Made you feel like you were going to Uncles pizza place and now its like the soul of the pizza and the place are gone. For a NY pizza Joint cirque de soleil decor does not work nor does it distract you enough to notice the food, the pizza, the environment and oh by the way the portion size is not the same anymore. The staff is loyal and doing their best but the new owners just don't get it and unfortunately just don't care.
