I tried this place last Thursday  and I ordered to go and got the standard pork dish  after arriving back home I found that not only was my order wrong  they also stacked the to go cups causing the one on top to melt through the lid of the one on bottom leading to a spill in my Car and a bag full of broth  I went back they fixed the order and gave me a coupon for a free meal  while I thought that was fine  and it was just a simple mistake I then went to eat this new dish  I found it to be very tasty until I got food poisoning the next day which lasted all weekend  today is the first day I've eaten anything solid since  and it was prob the worst food poisoning I've ever had  I most definitely will not be going back  all though the food was good I felt I should let people know that something happened  idk if it was cleanliness or raw food but it was bad  be aware!
