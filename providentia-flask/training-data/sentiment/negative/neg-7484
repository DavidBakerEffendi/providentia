DO NOT COME HERE!!!!Arielle c was very rude she cut me off while I was trying to talk like 3 times rushed me I was sampling the beijn beef so because I was in a rush and was hungry I had to settle with the crunchy beef that are hurting my teeth. Totally unsatisfied basically an obligation. I noticed that she is only nicer to the men and very rude to the women. Ok to top it off I thought I would edit my review to let you know that my beef was so hard it broke my fork so I complained and again I was cut off while I was trying to speak I will not come back!!!!
