Not a good experience; i typically will spend about $70 at dim sum just for me; went there by myself and got a horrible seat in the back and not enough carts came by; asked for another seat and was told NO that this is where the single seaters have to go; the carts that did were come by were 
Essentially empty so hardly had anything - no har gow, no shu mai - just stuff no one else wanted; literally spent $8 and wasted an hour of my time and left; service was bad and clearly staff don't care if YOU get food in their restaurant as long as they get the money; food was very slow and lacking but bill came in a minute;  should have eaten the bill.
