As being from Los Angeles, I grew up with Sam Woo.  I really like their simple but delicious soup noodles, noodle plates, rice dishes, BBQ pork, and all sorts of cooked Chinese dishes.  Never was disappointed...

...until I visited this Sam Woo.

Somehow this Sam Woo is different.  While it offers the same type of dishes found at other Sam Woos, the food here is not especially well prepared, on the very greasy side, and quite surprisingly expensive for what you're getting.

Upon my latest (and most likely last) visit I had the wonton soup noodle bowl and chicken lo mein.  There was nothing wrong with the soup noodle bowl but it could use some more Chinese broccoli.  

The chicken lo mein was (in my mind) an utter disaster.  Instead of the fat roundy smooth lo mein noodles, it was prepared using thin wiry egg noodle which was all degrees of "wrong".  I ate this stuff all my life...you can't fool me!  The chicken pieces were bland and the noodles where swimming in grease.  The only thing on that plate that was decent was the Chinese broccoli.  Besides that I would never ordered this plate if I've known.

Prices here are typically $3 more than any other Sam Woos I've been to.  Service was of course crappy with minimal acknowledgment.  I even had to ask for change back as they assume the extra $8 were for them.  Giving them such a big tip for sub-par service...I think not!
