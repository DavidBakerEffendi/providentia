6/29/17 Extremely poorly managed, very poor service, mediocre food and dirty environment. A single order of food took over 35 minutes to arrive, when it did arrive it was already cold. After the food arrived I ordered a glass of water and a beer. The server never returned so after 25 minutes I went to the bar to get my own glass of water and beer. There were four servers, a manager, a bartender, and eight patrons on the floor in the entire place and still The service was Nonexistent or poor at best.
