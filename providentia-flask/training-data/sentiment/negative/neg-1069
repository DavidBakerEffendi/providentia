Was highly recommended this restaurant by client.

The service was a total miss.

The food was okay to mediocre.......way too expensive for what it is.  

Been to India several times for business and never seen belly dancing in India. I asked several client friends that are Indian if belly dancing is a tradition. Not one said yes. The belly dancing was a bit annoying and felt slightly uncomfortable with my guests. The dancer was annoyed that no one at my table appreciated it and did not tip. She just started to fling her hips closer. I would have flung my naan at her to get the hell away from us.
