Ordered the veggie pizza, came on time for a great price for something with no flavor. Cheese had a plastic consistency and the crust was bland. Sauce was also very plain. It seemed like the vegetables even forgot how they're supposed to taste. 

Fried zucchini was good though, whatever they did to the zucchini they should do to the pies.
