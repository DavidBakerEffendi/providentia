I do not understand these reviews at all. I went to Roberto's one evening for a burrito and some tacos. This place being from LA, already impressed me as I walked in the door. The second that I got in and paid my fee, my opinion changed. I cannot believe that they charge over $6 for two tacos, which were not only NOT fresh, but the tortilla was burned, the sour cream tasted terrible, and the beans were burnt. The meat tasted horrid, even worse than ground meat bought at some bad supermarket, and I don't even think it was steak. I don't understand why people rave about this place - it is strongly disappointing. I can't wait for another taco company or truck to come out with real Mexican food, fresh ingredients, and actual tacos that are worth their price. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't just this location so I went to the one on Harmon across from uNLV too and it was even worse. I've definitely had better, and while I understand that some businesses can stay in business due to the hype, this is definitely NOT authentic Mexican food. Instead it is a place that has cut corners and used poor quality food.
