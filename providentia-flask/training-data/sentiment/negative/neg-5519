The service here is the worst ive experienced so far in Chinatown . Disorganised staff. Rude. Food was average. The place had only six tables occupied so it was not crazy busy  We waited for 15 minutes after we were seated .. and I had to ask if we could get some menus. When the food was served to us on a table for six. They kept just leaving all the dishes on one side of the table. And we had to pass it on . We had no space on  the table but the empty plates and the menus were not being picked up even though they kept passing by. They did not serve us water or ask if we wabted drinks till half way thru the meal we had to ask them for water. When done we had to ask them for take home boxes and the check.  So basically no one followed up. When we got the check . They charged us gratuity for 4 adults and 2 kids . Will not be going back to this place again. This place does not deserve a star. But to post I have to give it a star.
