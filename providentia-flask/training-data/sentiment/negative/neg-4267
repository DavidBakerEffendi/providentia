Horrible service. Cashier was friendly but all I wanted was the salad bar with grilled chicken, the cook was mad we wanted grilled chicken and gave a loud UGH sound when we asked for it and then he yells from the back are you sure you want "grilled"? We said yes we don't eat fried and he says well then its going to take twice as long and we said that's fine, but then he just gave attitude and turned around. Definitely didn't stick around to see what he was going to do to our food!! Will NEVER return!!
