Came here twice with my boyfriend, one a week after they opened and again on Sunday night 10/16 at about 11pm. The first time we came, the servers were very nice but very slow. Our appetizers took about 30 minutes and the dinner took about another 20 after that. When the food did come, it was lacking flavor and tasted very cheap. We figured because it was a new place, maybe they were still trying to get the hang of things and so we cut them some slack and decided we would come back to Sunday. Fast forward to Sunday 10/16, we came for drinks and apps for happy hour. We were literally the only people in the restaurant other than the 2 people drinking at the bar. The drinks took 15 minutes and the appetizers took about 20 more minutes after that. We were the only customers there and it was absolutely ridiculous. The drinks were decent at best and the food was very bland and salty. After two tries of dining there, this place is definitely a flop. The name is very fitting because the entire experience felt very lazy from the food quality to service quality.
