First time and LAST time at La Piazza al Forno! Great food and great service should go hand in hand but that is certainly not the case at this restaurant. The hostess was very rude throughout our visit and then we find out the hostess, Rachel, claims that she is the owner? It's Unbelievable how a small business owner does not understand the value and importance of treating each customer with kindness and appreciation for choosing their establishment. La Piazza al Forno may have great pizza but the bad service is enough to keep me away from downtown Glendale for dinner in the future.
