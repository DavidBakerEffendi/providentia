Very disappointed. My friend got the tacos and I ordered the asain saled. He got his tacos first and I had to wait over 10 minutes for a salad? Really? It'd be nice if they didn't forget about my salad. Finally after waiting 15 min for a salad I got it and tbh I've could have made a better salad at home! It was bland and had barely any flavor! The tacos were dry! As well as the pastor! And then we wanted ice cream and they're MACHINE IS BROKE! REALLY?! And no music in there made it a very depressing atmosphere! Also the owner brought his kids into the restaurant and they were loud and annoying and behind the counter and in the kitchen...very unprofessional. Probably won't be back. Bring back Braddah's Island Grill! At least when it was still there they knew how to make REAL tacos...this place is a joke!
