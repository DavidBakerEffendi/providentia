Disappointed in this location, first time visit. I stopped in on a whim last night at 6:15 seeing people outside eating chips and guac. Asked the bartender how long it would take to get an order to go, then which type of guac he'd recommend. He said it would take less than 5 minutes and recommended the special tuscan guac which has avocado, pine nuts, balsamic glaze and sundried tomatoes. My first thought was that it would be a weird flavor combination and too sweet for our taste, but took him up on his recommendation. I asked how much it would be for a half order of salsa to go with it. He charged me $9.50. 25 minutes later I was still waiting at the bar for my take-out order, and after I asked the other girl at the bar how long it would be (twice), she gave me a glazed look and said "I'm packing your order now". It came out chips/guac only. After 5 more minutes validating the cost for my order with the guy I ordered it from (he was patronizing me trying to state I'd ordered a full order of guac and corn salsa, which did not amount to $9.50 but  $13.00), I showed him the $9.50 ticket charge, then he said "Cool!" Got home and I was right on the guac, it was so sweet we could not eat it. It was not super busy and there was no sense of customer service here. Very disappointed in this experience and would not recommend. The guac wasn't the issue it was the service. Tremont location is better.
