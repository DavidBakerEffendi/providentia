Honestly, why this is called a Mexican restaurant is beyond me. Smallest order of fajitas we have EVER had. Guacamole was literally a mashed avocado and the chicken dish I got with the jalape√±o creme cheese sauce I am still trying to figure out. The salsa was awesome and so was the waitress but the food? No...
