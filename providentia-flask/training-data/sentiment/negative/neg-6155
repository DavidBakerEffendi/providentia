Absolutely the WORST Indian food I have ever eaten!! And that's not an overstatement. I got their #1 combo with butter chicken and it had a gummy texture and was disgusting. The curry had no flavor either. Man, I wish I read the reviews before I ate here. Never trust a place that doesn't know how to spell 'tandoori'.
