I tried to call to order some food , but the people who are working their never pick up the call as I tried 5 to 6 times in a hour and when I walkIn at 9.30 PM they said me that kitchen is closed, I took a b'day cake the lady in front desk took 25 min to write birthday wishes on a readymade cake. It's a completely worst service.
