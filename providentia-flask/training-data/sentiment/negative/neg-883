Can't fathom the hype! I love Food Fight restaurants but this one just does not live up to the label.

Let me provide some much-needed menu translations:

Mimosa = a tequila sunrise with some extra ingredients (none of which are champagne). Ask for a champagne mimosa and--if they have champagne at all--they'll charge you full price for the tequila cocktail. 

Street corn = canned corn with some cheese sauce on top

Griddled burrito = just rice n' meat in a tortilla 

There's nothing going on here that isn't going on in my microwave at 4am on a Saturday. Except for the bill. 

I recommend checking out Bel Air Cantina for better food and a smaller price (especially during happy hour on Tuesdays).
