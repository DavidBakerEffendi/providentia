I decided to try them again.
One guy kept pulling his pants up; only problem with that is"he still had his gloves on and trying to prepare my food". And this was the same week that all Chipotle stores closed on a Monday for food safety. Feb. 8th 2016...my visit Feb. 11th
Another guy was by the grill and checking his messages.
Burrito tasted okay.

Long line due to the fact that workers stopped make orders to start fax and online orders, 15 minutes; while other Chipotle stores have a separate area for fax and online order production.
