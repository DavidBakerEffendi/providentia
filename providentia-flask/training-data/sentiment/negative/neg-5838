Go to the Carnival buffet instead. Oysters are small, sushi and sashimi is fresh, great lobster bisque. Came here right when they opened so everything should be fresh and hot, right? Not the case, Chinese garlic crab was cold and were some other hot dishes. A friend said the lobster and crawfish wasn't good, so I didn't even bother. A lot of items were hit or miss. Wouldn't wanna come here again.
