Please- the next customer who asks for a root beer float with chocolate ice cream; let them know you don't have any chocolate ice cream before you make it., not afterwards and act like it doesn't matter. When you make it with vanilla ice cream and pour chocolate syrup in it they will always be disappointed, out $4.00, pissed they didn't go to Mitchell's around the corner and mad at themselves  that they gave this "used to be great place", another chance.
