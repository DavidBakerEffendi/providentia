Food was good. We always love steak n shake. But we didn't get our extra fries. Server brought us the receipt. Showed as 21.76 for the total but then brought us a different receipt after bringing out the extra fries that he admitted he forgot to put in. New total was 19.78. It didn't have the fries on it so we assumed that he had taken them off to compensate for the time we had to wait for the rest of our order. So we left a nice tip and made sure to thank him. Got up to the register and she scanned in the receipt to pay and it rang up for the 21.76. I understand that this was what we got and we paid but what a shitty move. Then the girl that cashed us out pretty much blew off our issue. The fact of the matter is whether it's off 2 cents or 30 bucks, the check was different than what we were presented with. And after we paid she took off while I'm putting the change in my purse without giving me a receipt to show what I actually paid. I had to flag down one of the cooks to ask if someone could produce me a receipt. He's response: We don't give receipts on cash purchases. This is not the first steak n shake I've been too.  I know that's bs. And you don't walk away from a customer like that regardless of it being a cash transaction or not. Totally disappointed and will make sure to never stop at this location on trips back through. There's plenty of other restaurants who can have our business.
