Used to love Mimis. Today we walked in and the hostess didn't greet us or say a word to us. Talk about a warm welcome. We finally said two even though we weren't asked. And, we then decided to sit at the bar which was filthy. At one point the bartender was arguing with a waitress. We will never return.
