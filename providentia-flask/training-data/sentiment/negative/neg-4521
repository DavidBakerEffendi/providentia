We visit Senor Taco's fairly regularly as the service, food, appearance and employees have always made it an enjoyable visit.  This last Sunday nite around 6:15 was a clear exception on staffing and cleanliness.  The place was not busy when we arrived or left. Although there were several empty tables none of them were cleaned. We chose the least dirty table and asked the cashier/waitress if she could wipe it down for us.  She did so but so poorly we went over and picked up some napkins and put water on them and wiped the table ourselves. I went up to order and stood directly in front of the cashier.  Our faces were about 24 inches apart.  She was staring at the wall mounted tv where some sort of Hispanic dance show was on.   I stared directly at her face but she did not break eye contact with the tv until I turned around to look at the tv to see what was so mesmerizing. She took our order at that point and then just stood around doing basically nothing.  The condiment area was in need of restocking, there was not a clean table anywhere and food remnants and/or used plates etc remained on all tables.  Used napkins and crumbs littered the floor.   We were their about 20 minutes or so. No one ever cleaned a table, the floor, or acknowledged us when we left. Clearly not a good visit.  We have always liked Senor Taco's but this visit left us thinking it is time to look elsewhere for a more organized eatery.
