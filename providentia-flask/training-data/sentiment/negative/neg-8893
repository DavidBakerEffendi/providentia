Mediocre food (they have "airportized" their normal menu - so price is up and quality is down) but my main beef here is the customer service, or lack there of. 

If you want organic quinoa, an egg white Mediterranean salad sandwich and a side order of incompetence and bitchy attitude, then this is the spot for you. It's like everyone here is sour on their job. 

The only employee that wasn't rude or crabby was a guy pounding out muffins and scowling at customers though his little glass window.
