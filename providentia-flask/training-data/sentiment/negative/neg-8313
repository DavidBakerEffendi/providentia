I feel so sick!!! I had a pizza with mushrooms, mozzarella, and it was suppose to be pepperoni, but it was gross pepperoni that I think has now made me sick. 
I hope to feel better soon. But it's already been 2 hours since I ate and it's just getting worse. I don't know it is was the canned flavoured non-Italian sauce or the weird pepperoni?
