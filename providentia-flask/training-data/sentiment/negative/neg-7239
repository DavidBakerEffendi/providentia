Burger was ok & service wasn't. I felt invisible & ignored. Maybe because I was a single visible minority female??? I don't know. They showed me to a table. I left my stuff, went to the bathroom & came back. Had to wait over 5 mins & make eye contact with a server. I felt everyone else got better service than me. No ine checked on me to see how the food was. They got the smiles & please come backs. Only reason I stayed was because I was hungry. Ordered a beef burger wrapped in a collard leaf with spicy sauce & guacamole. Thin beef patty & it didn't taste special. I rarely leave zero tips but I did this time. I can get a better lettuce wrapped burger elsewhere.
