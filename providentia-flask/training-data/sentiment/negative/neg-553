We were staying at the resort up the street from this restaurant. I read the reviews and thought we would check this place out. Walking in my 1st impression was oh no this place doesn't look good. It was dark and dusty and the smell was of stale wine not good food. I  ordered the lasagne. It was greasy and cold and not at all fresh. I  picked at it and then decided to get the tirmisu. When it came it was soggy and didn't look right. I took a  small bite and immediately spit it out. The cream had soured. Awful. Needless to say we will not be back. I don't know how this place stays in business.
