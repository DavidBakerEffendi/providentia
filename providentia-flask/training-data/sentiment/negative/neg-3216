I don't understand why the ratings are so high for this place. I'm spoiled coming from OR where Thai restaurants are plentiful and delicious. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, fried wontons, and a side of peanut sauce. First off, their delivery boxes leaked all over the bag which was annoying. Second, the pad Thai was orange. I've never seen this before. The wontons were dry and the sweet sauce with it, leaked out of the container also. The only thing redeeming to me is their peanut sauce. I felt like I was eating cafeteria food. I will not be back.
