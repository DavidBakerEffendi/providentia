BLD is the one place in Chandler that I really want to like, but after three visits, I just give up. They have a great-looking menu, a hip-kinda vibe, and all the promise in the world. And that's where it ends.

A disinterested hostess will invariably seat you in the one table you'd least prefer. Near the kitchen entrance. Near an angry baby. Whatever.

Next, one of several equally disinterested servers will arrive to take your drink order and by the time you've worked up a good thirst, drinks will arrive. If you're lucky, it'll be the drinks you actually ordered. If you're really lucky, they'll be good.

The one saving grace on the breakfast menu is the Monte Cristo. A+, seriously. Everything else is average, despite how it reads on the overpromising menu. And don't worry about the prices: just pretend you're in Scottsdale or, say, Midtown Manhattan, for the entire meal. If you remember you're in Chandler, you'll just get angry.

Like the breakfast menu, the lunch menu equally overpromises, but that's okay, because you'll wait just as long to receive your food. If it's not over or undercooked, you might as well just dig in and not think about how much you overpaid for a sub-par meal.

BLD looks and act like they want to be a BFD (big friggin' deal) but they need to start caring about both their customers and their food first. A good menu doesn't make a good restaurant if you don't deliver the goods.
