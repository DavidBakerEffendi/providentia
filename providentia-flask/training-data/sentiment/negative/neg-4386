Never eating at a Denny's in Vegas again.. I thought it was just the Denny's on fort apache and trop but I guess it's this one as well.. First of all the establishment is filthy! They need a surprise health inspection ASAP! My glass came out with lipstick on it so I asked for another glass and the server just looked at me like I ugh.. Okay!?! Then our food came out and it was swimming in oil.. Hmmm yummy! Then I notice hair in my food =\  can you say gross! After that I completely lost my appetite.. Never again..
