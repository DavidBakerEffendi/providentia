I go to baja fresh all the time (different location) i happened to be on this side of town and love their food so decided to come to this location. They messed up our order off top and then made a big hullabaloo about charging us the correct price for enchilado sryle when they should have just fixed it. My husband had exactly 5 soggy chips on his plate with his burrito. I sent my tostada salad back because it was dry and lifeless with barely a sprinkle of cheese on it. I was literally grilled about why i was sending it back. I didnt like it! Simple as that. I could have made way better at home This location sucks and i will not be returning or recommending this resataurant to anyone. Disappointing to say the least.
