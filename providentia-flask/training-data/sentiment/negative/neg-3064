This place should be shut down.  Went for Sunday "brunch".  They open at 11 am but don't have food (if you can call it that) out until 11:45, and you still have to ask for things like serving spoons and syrup?  Ordered hot tea, had old lipstick on the cup.  Flies on the window sills.  The only thing edible was a bagel and very little cream cheese.  I spent 15.95 on a bagel!  Do not waste your time or money
