I was a frequent patron for two years and I  have posted positive reviews on Yelp (often at Biaggio's request) and positive reviews on the local gluten free yahoo group as well.  BUT, I have used the delivery service only twice, and BOTH times they messed up my simple order, the second time sending a regular, non-gluten free pizza, which of course I could not eat. I live an hour away, so waiting for another wasn't practical. I decided to give them another chance tonight, but I wanted to speak with Biaggio personally first and let him know about the mistakes on the deliveries and help make sure it didn't happen again. I told him I would be upset if it happened again, and jokingly said I would post a bad review on Yelp if they messed it up. Instead of apologizing, he defended the restaurant saying, "It's just a pizza and people make mistakes. I'm going to decline your order and wish you on your way." Ironically, he was upset that I didn't call and speak to him about the mistakes(at the time), but this is actually what I was just doing and he refused to let us eat there anymore as punishment. Turns out the service isn't that great after all! Fortunately there's no shortage of restaurants in Las Vegas.
