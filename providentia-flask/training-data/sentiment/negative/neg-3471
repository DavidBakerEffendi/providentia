When this place used to be the Silver Spoon Cafe - it was decent and most importantly edible.   Not anymore. 

We went there for breakfast this morning and my friend and I each ordered a breakfast sandwich (Egg, Sausage, Cheese & English Muffin and Egg, Bacon, Cheese and Biscuit - we both had hash browns.

I opened the box to douse the hash in ketchup and everything looked good, so I thought we were off to a good start.     

Back at the work, we each went into our respective offices and ate - then simultaneously emailed each other how horrible it was.  

An excerpt: 

Friend: "I took it apart and ate the egg and hash browns everything else went in the trash....and you know I love bacon but even that was awful."

Me: "That was the worst thing I've ever tried to eat.  Trashed it. "

The hash browns were mediocre.  One bite of the sandwich and I spit it back into the container.  The sausage patty was some weird spicy thing (it tasted like what I imagine rancid food tastes like).  The egg - which they fool you into thinking because they cook on a griddle that it will be a fresh egg, but no, it was the same microwaved-looking B.S. that you can get at Subway - and it was CRISPY!  How do you make a crispy egg????

Vomit.  I won't even waste my time going back there for their little ice cream counter.
