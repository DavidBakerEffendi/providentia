Sooooo disappointed!!!! I ordered hot open turkey sandwich and my husband ordered the special, Salisbury steak!!' Well it came and it looked like slop!! The runner didn't even know which was which dinner!! I wish I took a photo of this mess!
The food was disgusting, covered in a half coagulated brown gravy, and vegetables that were just thrown on the plate in disarray! Our server didn't know whether she was coming or going.
I'm sorry but we will NEVER return to this diner or any of the other metro diners in Vegas! Food tasted terrible!!!!!
