HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Sat at the bar, was served burnt chips with salsa, salsa was good thou, ordered tacos (pork & steak) they were very good and generous filling. Drink prices are outrageous!!! $8 for a cocktail, this isn't Scottsdale, have pricey food with cheap drinks if you want to stay in business in this location. Improve your staff.
