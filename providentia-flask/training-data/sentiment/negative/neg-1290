I have only been here twice, but both times were not so fun.  The first time was for a birthday party that included 45 guests.  Now, I'm not accustomed to great or even good service when there are that many people to take care of.  Having worked in the restaurant industry myself, I can understand the trials and tribulations that come from 45 drunken 20 somethings.....However, I do take note when 4/5 of the bills are taken care of 1 hour before the other 1/5 such that the majority of the party can move on to the next location long before the bills are received by the rest of the party.  Not to mention the fact that the server was not able to then clarify the bills such that it took them FOUR attempts to get the last few bills correct attitude included.  Again, I thought nothing of this at first.  So, I went back with just the bf.  

The second time I went to Marcella's, the server forgot to offer bread, asked what we wanted to drink and never brought them and even took 30 minutes to ask us what we wanted to eat when the place was not even remotely full.  Needless to say I had to fill out a comment card.   

I understand this is a newer restaurant in the newer area of fashion square, but I'd like to think that service would be a company's first priority when opening a new restaurant.  At least for me personally, if the service is great, I'm more likely to attribute poor food to the specific meal I picked rather than the restaurant as a whole.  

To end on a positive note, I've heard great things about their prices for happy hour!
