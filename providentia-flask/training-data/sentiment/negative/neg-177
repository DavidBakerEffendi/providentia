Bad customer service. Called way before it closed to order pizza, then they had me on hold for 13 minutes and hung up. Called again and they had me on hold for another 15 minutes, then hung up on me again. Called one more time and the same guy on the line said they were closed, I told him that he kept putting me on hold and pretty much said "oh well, we're closed." Worst experience at a Pizza Hut ever.
