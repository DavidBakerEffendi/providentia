Well, were to begin.  Shambray was an excellent server.  I had the corned beef hash Benedict.  The egg was way over and it didn't have an English muffin with it.  I asked and they said it does not come with an English muffin in it.  Really???  Side of bacon was good.  Potatoes were boring.  Coffee was average.  I've heard good things but I will not be back.  So many better places that pay attention to quality control and don't hit you for over $40 for two for breakfast.
