Walked in to this place thinking we where going to love this place based on the reviews .. wow I was wrong , I have to admit it was very busy how I don't understand I ordered the spicy Tokyo ramen , let's just say I've had better top ramen at home .. the noodles where hard and clumpy , the broth was oily and flavorless .. I also ordered 4 pieces of sushi nigiri 2 hamachi 2 ahi they looked beautiful nice big slices made your water mouth until u put it in your mouth for previous frozen no flavor taste .. even the green tea tasted burnt HOW DO MESS UP GREEN TEA ..
