My wife and I had always enjoyed the pies here until our last visit. What used to be a light flaky smokey crust is now is hard, dense and tasteless.  Maybe the guy who was manning the oven was recruited away to a competitor?  Whatever he reason we will not be going back to this store anytime soon. Too bad as we thought the pizza here was very close to Pizzaria Bianco.
