Very poor experience at this Earl's location.

The waitstaff and hostess were completely clueless to nearly every single question we had (we were asking about happy hour specials), their menus are outdated such that the waitress had to explicitly mention that it was not valid, and the food experience was very poor.

I ordered the fish tacos, which were served to me with the fish raw. THE FISH WAS RAW - it was a white fish and was still completely translucent and lukewarm. 

The dry ribs were, unfortunately bone dry with no flavour but salt. 

To make matters worse, they didn't even apologize for the raw fish beyond, oh, I'm sorry. They didn't comp the tacos. Are you serious? 

The staff were no where to be found and it was hard to flag someone down. What a disaster of a restaurant. Absolutely terrible experience.
