The rooms are nice, but that's the only positive thing I have to say about this hotel.

The front desk agent messed up the room they put us in. We paid for an upgrade on the spot and they didn't give us the upgrade. When we asked them to change our room they took FOREVER to send us a key (they quoted 20 minutes, and it took about 45-50). We had to call three times to ask what was up. Then when we got to our upgrade it still wasn't a view of the strip unless you literally stood next to the window. 

They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING and they don't even have a coffee maker, a bag for laundry, or any of the things that even Motel 6 gives you. There was no price sheet anywhere for the minibar. I might have used some of it had I known the cost.

When we tried to talk to a manager on the phone they didn't let us, so we decided to go down and talk to one ourselves. They compensated us by giving us a free late checkout..that's just insulting. AND the cherry on top was that they "accidentally" overcharged us!!! So now I'm in the process of getting $138 refunded to me. Absolutely miserable.
