I wish I yelped this before I actually bought my food =\.. I had the chicken artichoke mushroom. Artichoke was tasty and you cant really mess up cooking mushroom, but the chicken was so bland and dryyy ! Definitely not worth the +$8, save your money and just wait for the peanuts and snacks on the plane !
