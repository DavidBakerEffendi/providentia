THE WORST service I've had in Charlotte. The delivery order said 30 minutes...the order arrived over an hour and a half later. I called a few times to ask about it and after 11 minutes being on hold as "the first caller in line" they hung up on me. The driver showed up after an hour after the estimated time with a pen that wouldn't work. I attempted to sign my receipt and asked him for a working pen. His response was "whatever....just try to scribble." He never gave me a receipt or apologized for how long her took. In addition to that, we ordered 30 wings with veggies, ranch and blue cheese dressing and we only received the wings and one little packet of ranch dressing. My friend has warned me several times about the service of Fuel Pizza and I definitely know now that I should have listened to him. Truly terrible.
