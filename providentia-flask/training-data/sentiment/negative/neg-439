Somehow a lot of people kept recommending us this place (might they get paid to do that?). Ordered shrimp fried rice and another one with shrimp and scallops. The first one had miniature, ridiculous looking shrimp (probably imitation ones) while the second one had a few minced scallops and no shrimp at all. We told the waiter who took the dish back to the kitchen only to bring same dish back a minute later. He said that the cooks told him that the shrimp were chopped very little but were there. Of course you could not even smell the shrimp nor see them. Why would they use shrimp in one dish and none in the other is a mystery. all I know is that they will never see us again and we suggest you to do the same. The waiter also said that their food is authentic Cantonese.
PS: We eat shrimp fried rice at Cantonese places all the time so we know how it supposed to look.
