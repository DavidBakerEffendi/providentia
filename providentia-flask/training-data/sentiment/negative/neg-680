More like, "The Rotten Fork". I came to the Good Fork for brunch with my sister and 4 year old nephew. The first thing I noticed about this place was how deafening the atmosphere was. The music was so loud that people were actually yelling across their tables to have a conversation. I ordered The Spanish Hash, my sister ordered the Heuvos Rancheros and we ordered the burger and fries from the kids menu for my nephew. My sister asked the server to make sure that my nephew's burger was cooked well-done as we did not want him to get ill. When our server brought out my nephew's burger, the first thing we noticed was that its middle was raw. We pointed this out to our server and asked her to put the burger back on the grill a little longer. Instead of being concerned about the undercooked burger, our server told us that, " she would get the kitchen to make us another burger but that she would have to charge us for both burger meals!" I pointed out to our server that the burger was under cooked and she argued that the burger was "very brown and cooked". Which the picture I took of the burger clearly reveals that the burger was under cooked. I would honestly give this place 0 star rating if I could just based upon our server's reaction. Despite all the positive reviews, tasty food is just a small component of you factor in it being cooked properly and recieving proper service. Needless to say,  I will never be returning to "The Good Fork " again.
