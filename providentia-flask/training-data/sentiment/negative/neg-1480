Oh Hell no, what an experience! I got there at about 7:30-8:00pm. There were like 3-4 people outside the door like waiting, so I waited as I kept looking inside for like about 5-10min. I then decided to leave then after looking and looking for another place I come back at about 9..This time there was noone waiting outside the door so I stand inside, right by the door when a young waitress comes up to me and says..there's no place to sit right now, but wait a minute someone might leave soon! I waited about 3 minutes when another young waiter comes and tells me, "Hey, the house is full!" So, I was in shock!!! So I whispered in his ear, "Hey, I came earlier and left and now you're telling me to leave?" Thanks, never again! Very bad customer service! Very rude, to say the least. I don't recommend this place. I recognized from the last time I had been there a few years back, like 3-4 of them? I think this place takes preference over some regulars and treats everyone else like shit! They don't care. Also I heard from friends of mine that took me there the first time, that they open their Karaoke time with my voice singing Amor Eterno too? Crazy, and definitely not good at all. Think well before coming to this place..
