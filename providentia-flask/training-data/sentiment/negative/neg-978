How do I start?? So I came here the day before Christmas eve at the end of last year, we sat down yadda yadda, and our waitress came up to us after like 15-20 minutes and for some reason has a major attitude. That's not going to fly with me. She was like this uber short, midget short kinda, Mexican chick. We place our drink order, which takes her forever to get. A simple water isn't so hard or is it?? I get my water and blehhh it's tap water!! That b*tch! So we 'finally' place our order. Half of my parter ordered the chicken pot pie and I the steak salad. Then she comes back ten minutes later to tell us that they ran out of pot pies! Lol. Absurd, they're known for their pot pies! So they change their order. Then she comes back again about ten minutes later, saying there are two pot pies left haha oh man! Two people out of the 4 that ordered one said okay, I'll take the pot pie. Yet, we see I'm the window a little later, 5 pot pies sitting there! Horrible service by a horrible waitress! One star for my yummy steak salad;-).
