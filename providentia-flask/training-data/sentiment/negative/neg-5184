I am NOT a fan of this place, not at all. They served us spoiled monggo, so disappointed!! I was having lunch with my friend and I had my 3 year old daughter with me also.
The dish (monggo) tasted sour and you know when it tastes like that it's spoiled. I couldn't believed they would serve that to their customers. Don't they know you can die from food poisoning? Luckily, my daughter only had a little taste of it. 

My friend had sinigang and let me tell you. It wasn't very good either. It should be served as hot but it wasn't even warm. This was my second time eating there and I thought I should give them a benefit of the doubt. If I remember correctly it's worse the second time around. I should have known from first experienced.

So, no, I will not go back again. I will go to Halo Halo Kitchen even if it's too far away. At least I know what I'm getting and not SPOILED for that matter...
