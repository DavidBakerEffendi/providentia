Alvin, the manager, what a word I can't say. Arrogant, unprofessional, and ignorant. I ordered from grub hub and online they have spicy garlic listed as a dry rub. It came as a sauce. When I asked him the difference between a rub and a sauce he said I'm not going to answer any questions. Alvin stated this was grub hubs mistake even though they are a third party delivery service. He also changed the name of the smart mouthed hostess from Sabrina to brandy. I was advised to contact grub hub in regards to the confusion. Alvin was also rude to that employee stating he would not be doing anything to address the misconception. I was not looking for a freebie. I wanted them to correct their misleading menu. Will be going to corporate asap...never going to hooters again.
