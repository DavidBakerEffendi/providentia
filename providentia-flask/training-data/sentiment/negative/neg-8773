I have gone to this location a few times and every single time they mess something up! I go to this location for the sake of convenience but I will never go again! Last night my husband and I went and he orders the teryaki chicken with sauce ON the chicken as well as ON THE SIDE. The guy at the window repeated our order TWICE and still didn't put the damn sauce ON OR ON THE SIDE! One time I went through the drive thru the girl told me to pull around and park in front to wait for my order...20 minutes later I walked IN to the place only to find they forgot about me and hadn't even made my food yet. I was angry and spoke to the manager to give me my money back and she said all she could do was give me some free cheese rangoons. This location is bullcrap. I'm done giving this location chances to actually function like a real business.
