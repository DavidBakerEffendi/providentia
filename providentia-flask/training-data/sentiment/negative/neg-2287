Worst sushi take out I've ever ordered.  

My usual restaurant was closed for some reason so I thought I'd try something new.  I read the reviews on just-eat and other than comments about delivery times it had good reviews so I gave it a try.  Big mistake. 

Here's the rundown of my order.

General Tao chicken - cold, over cooked with next to no sauce to mask it's horrible flavor. Had a few pieces and the rest went to the trash. 

Sushi pizza (white tune) - where's the fish?  Most pathetic looking sushi pizza I've seen. The fish was paper thin and flakey.  I questioned if I should eat it but I was starving so stomach won. 

Snow dragon roll -  this also had white tuna. Same situation as above. 

Buffalo roll - this one I actually liked.  Would have been better if I could have seen or tasted some of the cream cheese that was listed as an ingredient but at least it wasn't as horrible as the rest of my order. 

So other than quick delivery time this place had nothing to offer other than the gurgling in my stomach.
