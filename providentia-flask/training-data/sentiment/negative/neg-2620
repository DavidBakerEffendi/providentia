Absolutely dismal. We should have been tipped off by being the only 2 people in the place for Friday lunch. The "server" was hanging out watching a portable tv. Spring rolls were soggy and almost completely cabbage, plus having an overall odd taste. Wontons were bland as wallpaper paste. The dumplings were ok, but nothing special. My partner ordered pho which just....never came. We waited. And waited. The server kept going back into the kitchen, and we'd think, "ok maybe now?" Nothing. Finally having had enough we just told this kid to forget it, we'd pay for what we had eaten. He seemed surprised and his was response was "oh, there was a misunderstanding, I think it's almost done". Um, what misunderstanding? We were the only 2 people there. In the duration that we were there ONE person came in to pick up takeout. 
In short, don't bother. There are MANY better options for Americanized Chinese in the area.
