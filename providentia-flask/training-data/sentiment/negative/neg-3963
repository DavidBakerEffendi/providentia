The service was horrible. They lost one of our order papers and kept us waiting for an hour and half. We asked many times and they didn't tell us they didn't have the paper. When we decided to leave without waiting longer the cashier argued with us and they demanded full payment even though they didn't provide all the food we ordered, we were still hungry and it is an all you can eat restaurant. Will never go back again and wont recommend to anyone.
