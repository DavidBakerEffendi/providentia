This place reminds me of Fat Tuesdays.  It's a place where tourists and college students go to get nasty drunk but don't expect good food.  

The food is incredibly spicy but lacks quality and actual flavor.  It's as if they spiced up the food so they can sell you more margaritas.  If you wanna go just to get messed up on margaritas, which you kinda end up doing while you're waiting to either be seated or served your food, then the place is perfect for you.  

Unless you're a tourist - don't expect any decent customer service.  The place is an old mortuary redone into a restaurant.  It needs some SERIOUS updating, hell, just get a hose and wash the inside clean!!  It's sticky and nasty!
