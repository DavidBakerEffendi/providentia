A country bar that doesn't play country music. They cater to the hip hop crowd. The dance floor is open with no barrier, so there is just people standing not dancing. The bartenders or whoever those girls are, dance on the bar top like strippers and you put money in their leg garter. This place is a train wreck. Not even close to being a country bar. Change the name to some generic hip hop name if that's the kind of business your going to run.

Summary: It's not a country bar it's a hip hop nightclub. Two steppers go somewhere else.
