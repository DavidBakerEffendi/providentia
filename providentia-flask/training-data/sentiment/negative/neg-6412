The website said 45-60 min for an order, when I placed my order. They automatically entered a tip in for them selves, which I could not take off and was more than 20%. I called at the 45 min mark to get an eta, and was told another 26 min. 26 min later still no food, when I called he said another 10-15 min. At that point I asked for a 15% refund, because we could have gotten other food. The guy I was speaking too told me oh well it's only been 61 min since you ordered...no it's been 116min. He just kept getting nasty and finally he threatened to cancel our order and still charge us. Turns out the pizza place snuck into our resort to drop off flyers and when we contacted the front desk to ask about them, they said they had multiple complaints. As the guy was dropping off our pizza at the now hour and a half mark, the front desk confronted him and he ran. Do not order from these scammers!
