I've called 3 times to place a to-go order now & all 3 times not a single person at this establishment could tell me if they had gluten free products. I asked if they had corn tortillas and yes they do but the employees had no clue what I meant when I asked if they had flour near or on them. Half the time they didn't know how to say something in English. Such a disappointment. I will never return.
