I was excited that this opened near my work, only to be greatly disappointed.   I have given this location 3 chances.   First time I sat in drive thru , and sat, and sat.   The following time went inside and was told I only the drive thru was open (why the front door was unlocked who knows?).   This time I walked in, employee was on the phone, looked at me and then walked to the back.   I hope whoever owns this location is checking yelp, and gets this place running right.
