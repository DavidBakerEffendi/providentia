Went here for lunch with some coworkers today. Hadn't been to one of the locations since I was at the Indian School location 10 years ago. I recall not being impressed back then and nothings changed. Probably worse than I remembered. Got the shrimp and chips today. The shrimp are a joke. They take a single shrimp and butterfly it and then slice it again, then roll it in this horrible corn meal batter a few times to make it look bigger. So basically their 10 piece shrimp is 2.5 shrimp divied up. No flavor whatsoever either. They give you a small ramekin with what they call special sauce. Just watery ketchup with some slightly hot el patio sauce. I guess the fries were ok but ended up eating most of them plain because the provided sauce ran out halfway thru the platter. 
Oh yeah two other things to consider. Make sure you use the restroom before you get here as they don't have one. Awesome and thoughtful that a place that serves food you eat with your fingers doesn't provide a place to wash them first. So if your hands are dirty, oh well!!! Hell, maybe that'll add some flavor to this horseshit. 
Other thing is, its cash only. Why this is still a thing beats me. I can buy a breakfast burrito via card from a dude at the farmers market in the park under a pop-up canopy, but not here! But its cool because they WERE thoughtful enough to put an ATM by the order window. That charges 2 dollars and 50 cents per transaction. Sweeeeeeet.
Staff was ok, standard except for a large rude woman but I've already written enough to start in on her. 
Next time I want a plate of fried stuff I will just do the fair. It blows this place away.
