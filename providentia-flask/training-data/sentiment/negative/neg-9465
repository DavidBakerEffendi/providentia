We were seated at a dirty table, and then waited 15 minutes to put in our drink order. The waitress was more interested in talking with her friends that were dining in the establishment than taking our order. We both ordered the prime rib, and it took forever to come out. The meat was bland, unseasoned and tasted like it had been boiled. It then took our waitress an additional 30 minutes to give us our check and an additional 15 minutes to run our card. This place may be great for drinking and 20-somethings on a Friday night, but the service blows and the food is disgusting.
