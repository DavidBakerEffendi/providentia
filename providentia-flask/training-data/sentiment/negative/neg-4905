I'll cut to the chase on this - stay clear of this disaster of a restaurant.  I went out to with some friends last night and this place screwed up in every possible way.  It took about a half hour to get served something to drink, and even the water was lukewarm and had some stuff floating in it.  Had I known what was coming I would have savored the mysterious floating gunk because it was the best thing I ate at this dump.  

After about an hour and a half we were served our entrees, although we watched them sit under the heat lamps for 20 minutes beforehand.  I had the yellowfin tuna special, which was dry and indescribably nasty and smelled foul.  It was, however, served with 4 green beans.  The steaks were overcooked, some in our group wisely choosing to send the meals back and skip dinner.  They came with some strange salt crusted balls they claimed were potatoes, but tasted more like salt crusted balls if you know what I mean.  

It took about another 45 minutes to get our checks, which were wrong when they arrived.  The meals ranged from $38 for a serving of three scallops served atop gummy rice, to $60 for the steak that would have been Applebees quality at best had it been correctly cooked - which it wasn't.  This wasn't my first bad meal in Madison, but it was the first one I consider cruel and abusive to my mouth.  I bought my first tongue scraper on my way home.
