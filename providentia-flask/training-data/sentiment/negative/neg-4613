I love wing stop, but hate this location. I've lived in Laveen and have always went to this wing stop but it really has taken a turn for the worse. The customer service is terrible! That older man that took my order glared at me the whole time and mumbled. I've never had such terrible customer service as I've had here. There are Plenty of other options for foot in this area. Go to native New Yorker across the street and avoid this place!
