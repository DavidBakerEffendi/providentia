It normally takes awhile to eat in here and so I usually order to go but tonight even that was bad. 

I ordered 2 rolls and noodles. I was told 20-30mins and so I went close to the 30 min mark. When I arrived they said they were waiting on my noodles. So I waited about 20 more minutes before finally asking  what was going on. I was then told about another 20 min so I decided to cancel that portion but right as she was going to ask they brought it out. 

I should have asked they remake my rolls since they had sat for 30-40 mins and one was a crazy roll which is tempura. When I got home my spicy mama roll was warm and the crazy roll was soggy and cold. I was able to save the spicy mama by putting it in the fridge for awhile but the crazy roll was just gross once soggy. 

The noodles were such a small portion that they were only enough for my 5 yr old to eat, we normally order one to split between our 3 kids when eating there and it's always been enough. But they also had zero flavor! Normally they have a sauce but this was was plain noodles and chicken. They were gross! 

So I paid $45 for warm, soggy sushi and a tiny portion of unflavored noodles. I would have gone back but I had to be somewhere and didn't have time.
