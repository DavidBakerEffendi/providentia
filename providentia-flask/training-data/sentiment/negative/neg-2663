NEVER go to this place for lunch. It was extremely quiet, since apparently everyone but us knew that it was horrible. It is located near a hospital, numerous office parks and businesses... but was dead at lunch, for good reason. We ordered off the "fast break" menu helpfully placed at the table, but apparently this location "doesn't do that." So we got cold food after an hour (advertised free after 15 mins), had to harass the waitress for our check, and summarily vowed never to set foot in a B-Dubs again. They should be grateful that I'm not suing them for false advertising.
