Horrible. What a mistake. Two pizzas, one pepperoni, one pepperoni, mushroom, black olive. The pepperoni pizza was a greasy, soggy mess. I couldn't lift a single piece out of the box because the crust was wet and greasy. Same with the other. Not cheap either. I picked it up because of the problems others have had with delivery. Bottom line: Steer well clear of this place. Never again.
