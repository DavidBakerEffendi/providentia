I will never go to this place ever again. I booked a party for 20 people. The week prior to the event several people became sick with the flu. I called the day prior to adjust the reservation. I was told they had already prepped the food so I said I would be willing to pay for the food since it was already prepped. However, why should I pay for golf for people who will not be there. They refused to reduce the price of the event. We were willing to consolidate to fewer bays so they could rent them out to any of the hundreds of people waiting in the lobby to play. They said I needed to give them 7 days notice. How are you supposed to plan for the flu??? I booked the event from 4-6 PM. However, they took the food away at 5:30. So apparently it's ok for them to not stick to the contract but they force it on you even though there was a serious flu outbreak in Phoenix.
