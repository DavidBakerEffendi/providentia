I would give this 0 stars if I could. Foolish me wanted a Caesar salad and I quickly ordered one from here. Shredded iceberg lettuce, 1 slab of "bacon", a sprinkle of powered parm and some crispy croutons (only redeeming thing) - that was my salad. Rookie mistake to order from here, will not be coming back again. Worst 6$ spent.
