If you are a not a beer drinker, don't worry because they don't serve any here.  Instead they have a variety of sewer water ranging from honey flavour, to sour milk.  I ordered a blonde, but got a wit.  Not feeling that picky I just went with it and it went down like drinking sweet and sour sauce from Mandarin.  Not willing to give up I had a dark which actually hurt me a little.  I didn't know a taste could be so terrible as to hurt.  This is only after being lucky enough to actually get served.  Its like a lottery, only when you win they poison you.
