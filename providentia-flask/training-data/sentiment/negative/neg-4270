I've heard so much about Five Guys, I was eager to try them out.  Alas, they're very overrated, in my view.  The burgers are so thin and overcooked, they're almost tasteless.  The toppings are impressive, but the point of a topping should be to accentuate the taste of the burger, not overwhelm and disguise it.  But the burgers themselves are just weird--instead of one reasonably thick burger, they put two insanely thin burgers on top of each other.  Not recommended.   Mind you, the fries are almost edible.
