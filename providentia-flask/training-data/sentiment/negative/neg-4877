Ordered through uber eats. This was by far the worst meal ever placed in front of me. I ordered a side of queso and guacamole. Both were missing. Also ordered 5 rolled tacos. 2 of them weren't rolled tacos but just pieces of shell (photos attached) also they were burnt so much they wee inedible. The side of rice and beans were a whole different pile of sh*t. The rice was so hard and stale. I attempted to bite into it and hurt my teeth. This was also pictured. What a disappointment. When I attempted to call Super Burrito the girl that answered the phone didn't speak English. What a waste. DO NOT eat here
