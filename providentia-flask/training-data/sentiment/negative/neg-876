The Yellow Griffin has a lot going for it -

It seems trendy, it has a patio, you can rent out the top floor for parties, free of charge.  And there is the burger menu.

But - this review, it's about the food.  And the food is not great.  I've been to the Griffin six or seven times.  When you live in Bloor West you, at times, find yourself attracted to it.  But six months ago was the last time I was there.

A hamburger should not cost more than 10 dollars.  It doesn't matter that you've come up with a nonsense amount of toppings, it's still a hamburger.  And a hamburger should taste great - especially at the prices you're paying.  But sadly, Yellow Griffin does not satisfy.

A good burger can be found at the Burger's Priest.  Why the Griffin hasn't learned to make a tasty treat like that is beyond me, unless of course, they don't have to.

It's always crowded - which is, of course, another issue.  And the service is beyond slow.

If you're looking to impress someone who will be distracted by the fantastic menu, then this place is for you.  If you're there for the food?  Well, it's more than a bit of a let down.

Still - like I said, I'd been there a number of times.  It's hard to resist the allure.  Just know you've been warned.
