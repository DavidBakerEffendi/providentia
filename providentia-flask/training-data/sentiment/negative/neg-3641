Went to Chat Bar with my CT on a Monday night to check out what the hype is for this place because on the weekends there are always huge line up.  Not knowing what to expect due to limited reviews, we walked in very open minded.

First thing that I noticed is the strong charcoal smell from all the grilling of skewers which I am not a big fan off because I don't want to smell like BBQ after dinner, but we went in anyway.  Sat down, looked at the menu and decided to try 3 items to see how it goes, we had the lamb skewer, beef skewer and the fish.  Lamb skewer was good as the taste and texture was not bad, but for 4 skewer for $6, not sure if it's worth it.  Beef skewer just tasted like the lamb except is was harder to chew.  The fish was okay, similar taste than the lamb and beef and not too special.  They said you can eat the bone too, but I highly DO NOT recommend eating it with the bone.  3 items took over 1.5 hour to come (lamb came first, then the other two took forever), which is unacceptable!  Why so SLOW?!

Place is very dim and smell like charcoal, drinks are okay due to the wide variety of selections including the little budda beer!  Water is free (bottled water too!) but all drinks, you need to pick them up at the front and open it yourself, so no service whatsoever.

Overall, not a big fan and would rather spend my money on something better. The price adds up quickly if you go with a larger group due to small portions.
