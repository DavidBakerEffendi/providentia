No thank you to this place. Gone is the fun, retro, happy atmosphere most people know of Johnny Rockets. You will now find a fast food style, counter-order, over-priced, mediocre burger joint that will not make it. Living in the Charlotte/Lake Norman area, there is no possibility that this place will come out on top. Here's why:
It is very expensive. Expect to pay about $10++ for a combo. 
The burger is garbage. It has a weird texture and is just not flavorful. 
My wife's chicken (sandwich) had a weird texture, fair taste. 
Kids' chicken fingers were as expected except small. 
Fries were solid, but just warm. 
No juke box.
No table service. 
No singing waiters. 

Anyway, like I said before, great burger joints are everywhere. This is not one of them. You would be better off paying half the price for a much better burger at Wendy's.
