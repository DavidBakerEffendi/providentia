Came here for Dinner tonight after I arrived from our Hawaii vacay. Decided to take the dog out since he was boarded for a whole week with Family Paw and decided to take him out. 

The service wasn't all that great. I felt like we were an inconvenience. When we asked for a refill in water, she rolled her eyes. It's hot outside. Yes we had a choice to not bring the dog and ate inside in AC but that's the whole reason why we ate here.  We watched the other server and wished we sat at her table. She checked on all the tables. Our waitress probably checked up on us twice but when we wanted to leave, we waited even longer for the bill. And when the husband did pay with cash, she just gave his change without saying thank you. We dined at Lazy Dog in Summerlin and I'd say I'll drive all the way there then be back in this place. And food wasn't all that great either. Nachos was awesome. I had the Ahi sandwich. It was nothing special. But I'll probably not come here again.
