Have you ever thought a place was good and later discovered that its really not? My disappointment with a young waitress who forgot to enter my phone order and only did so when I arrived to pick it up, was actually a benefit to me in that I realized a few things about this place and its cleanliness which is so lacking. To understand that, simply have a seat at the bar and look around for a few minutes.

If you do that you will see stacks of cardboard boxes to your left with supplies shoved onto an open shelf. Feed lines from a slushie machine that doesn't look like it had been used or cleaned in years. The area is filled with fruit flies that are circling around leaked syrups and other liquids. If you look to the right you will see tons of wires in spider clumps with old monitors and other discarded but still in place sign technology. 

If you see all this in an area that is open to customers, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. The thought of that permeated my thoughts while I tried to eat a mango salad that was prepared with old mangos and a ginger beef dishes that was swimming in liquid and onions with about 8 thin small pieces of beef.

I have eaten there on many occasions where I thought the food was okay; not great but okay. However I usually walk in, go to the assigned table and don't see much of the service areas. After experiencing the sites of the bar area, I vow to never eat at Axia again until they clean up their place. I can't believe they have ever passed a health inspection.
