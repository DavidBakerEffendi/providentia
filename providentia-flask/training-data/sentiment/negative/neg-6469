Not a good experience here this evening. Cracker Barrel has sure gone downhill. My parents and I were very underwhelmed to say the least. My mom was told the chicken she wanted was available but it was not so she picked the cod fish fry special to replace it. She asked for fries and carrots. And got carrots and mashed potatoes. So they took back the fish with mashed potatoes and brought her fish with carrots...that's double carrots and no fries. The fries were an additional 6 minute wait. And don't bother trying to sub in a baked potato because there is an up charge...apparently bc they are so big but unfortunately I have no picture to prove that. They brought my fish dinner with only two of the four pieces that were to come with it. The fries were lackluster. I'll give it to them, the fish was tasty. However, we had asked to get butter that wasn't hard as a rock and that didn't happen. A floor manager stopped over and even after hearing that the visit was less than stellar all she offered was more water and if we wanted more butter. Not my idea of amazing customer service. The manager at the counter was better and did listen to the complaints and we were lucky enough to get the bill slightly discounted.

All in all, Cracker Barrel likes to think they are good place to gather with friends and family but we won't be going back. We bid you farewell cracker barrel. If you ever get it back on track maybe we will venture in.
