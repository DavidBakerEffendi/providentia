This place has your average pub fare with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!

Came here on a Sunday for a meet-up and the owner immediately started to harass me about how I had to order something because she was being so gracious to let us use her space (and I had ordered something, just not an entire meal). I then proceeded to ask her if anything on her menu was completely gluten free, and she berated by by telling me that people were dumb for not eating gluten and implying that I was an idiot for doing this. Firstly, I am a grown ass person, and do not need to be lectured about what to put in my body. Secondly, Celiac disease is a real condition where one's own villi and micro villi are destroyed when they ingest gluten, and this is sometimes irreparable damage, so no, I do not think it's stupid to avoid gluten if you have a condition. Ignorant hate speech really grinds my gears, and so I will not soon be coming back,
