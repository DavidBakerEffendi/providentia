Visited yesterday day with wife and four grand kids. Food was ok but place was dirty. Uncleaned tables, trash on floors, dirty drink and condiment area. French fries stuffed in a cut in one of the booths. Kid doing clean up looked like he was in a trance. Staff indifferent. Owner of this place must be real 'proud' of himself! Won't be back anytime soon! Forgot... wife said ladies room was disgusting!
