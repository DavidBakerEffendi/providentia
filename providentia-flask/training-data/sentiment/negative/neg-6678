Ok so i came inn a week before my daughters b day party to order the cake and get prices so i did i filled out a sheet of paper of the cake i wanted and placed the order she said she don't know how much it will be  so on Monday shell have her boss call me . Come Thursday i never got a call i called inn and she said her boss put a note that she called me and left me a message i never got a call or a message so i explained that to her all she said was sorry we are booked and there's no way we can make ur cake not caring one bit about nothing worst customer service ever this place sucks big time you don't do that not only that but the starting price for a round 10 inch was starting at 100 so i can only imagine what ridicules price they where going to charge me so last minute on Friday i called carlos bakery witch is wayyyyy better bakery than this one and they where able to do a customized emergency cake with less than 24 hr notice for only 50 bucks Omg cake boss is awesome and gimme sum sugar needs to care a lil more about there customers and not be rude............ Btw i asked for a supervisor call back and never got one they suck
