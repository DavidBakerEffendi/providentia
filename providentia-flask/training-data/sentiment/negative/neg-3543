First I would like to say the food is phenomenal.  Second the service is the worst I have ever had in the ten years I have lived in Las Vegas.  The atmosphere is simply.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  The waiters are lazy. Everytime I decide to dine in they do not check on me unless it is to bring the check. It is never busy.  And I have seen the staff on their phones more than anything else. I suggest only purchasing take out from this place.  It may possibly be the best mexican in Las Vegas. The quality of food is superb.  But the front of house is horrendous.  I'm not even going to begin to describe what happened to me there tonight.  Truly I will never eat in at this restaurant I would rather order out and eat two doors down at samurai sams.
