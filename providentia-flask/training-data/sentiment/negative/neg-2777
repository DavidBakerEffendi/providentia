First of all I will start with the positive.  The server/drive-thru attendant was pretty pleasant.  That's it.

The food itself was awful.  I had a chicken super burrito and the thing was a full step below taco bell.  The chicken was drenched in some sort of creamy goop and I couldn't tell what else was in the burrito.  Totally gross.

Go to Taco Bell if you want crappy mexican food and go here if you want to be even more disappointed. 

 I have begun to wonder about some of the review I see about this place and others.  Are people really this out of it to think this is 5 star food?  People must have really low standards or maybe just dumb in general.
