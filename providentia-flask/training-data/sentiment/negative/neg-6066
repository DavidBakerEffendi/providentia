Place is just not
Up to par. When we were there it was a mess, rude management, staff was not knowledgeable and the cook was unsanitary. My daughters quesadilla still had the paper wrapped around the cheese melted in the quesadilla, when i brought it up to management, she looked at me like I was crazy and I did something wrong. She offered to make me another one but at  that moment I was through with them and we just decided to get up and leave. Food is bland, place is dead, they are done, what's next?
