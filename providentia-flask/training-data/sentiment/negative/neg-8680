Others are right. The food is ok at best and the service was horrible. If you are short on time, do yourself a favor and find another option. Won't be going back. It walked in at 1145 and place wasn't crowded at all. Seated right away. Half interested waitress finally came over at 1205 to take drink orders. It felt like we were bothering her. She was supposedly sick. Well if that is the case, why come to work and expose the rest of us??? Anyway, finally got drinks at 1215. Glad I wasn't dying of thirst. Took our order. Then apparently she finally goes home cause of sickness and we get another guy. He was nice enough. Kept checking on us but by 1250 and still no food I am about pissed. We ordered at 1215! Food comes at 1255 and is pretty much lukewarm. We finished what we could and then bailed. This place is definitely on the never return list. Apparently we weren't the only ones around that were upset. We saw a couple of tables complain. A quick lunch turned into a terrible adventure. Good luck with that business model. Beware.
