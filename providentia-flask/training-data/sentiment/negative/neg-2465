Have been here twice and both times th kids running the place a. Got the order wrong and b. Served us burgers that werent cooked.

In fact, while I was there I saw the staff screw up a little kids ice cream, he asked for chocolate and they gave him vanilla. How do you do that?

Considering the price, the place is a joke. I cant believe the management doesnt get involved. Not only will I not be back but I would literally eat Burger King before I ever returned.

Consider yourself warned.
