The cook here certainly believes in baking stuff until it's truly good & dead, and the result was almost everything we ordered - pizza, wings, fries - was heated, heated and heated to the point of leathery tastelessness and indigestibility. The 'train-wreck' fries were overbaked to the point of requiring a bit of scraping to separate them from the plate; the wings were crispy but suffered from next-to-no saucing. At this moment, eleven hours later, I'm still in a state of digestive distress, sliding between crapulence and dyspepsia; it takes some real gut-bombing to produce THAT effect!  A great disappointment, given that I'd patronized this establishment before and found it's cuisine to be not stellar but acceptable.

A wall-mounted speaker right over our table blasted out hip-hop favorites, with the rawest of lyrics replete with 'n*gga' this and 'p*ssy' that and 'f*ck'' everything else, loud enough after ten pm  to make conversation at our table difficult. Y'know, musical tastes differ, but if you're taking Mom out, or have young kids in tow, you may want to find a place a bit more family-friendly. This ain't Peter Piper, for sure. 

The server was on the ball, fast and attentive - about the only thing this place had going for it. Our pizza order was botched at the kitchen level; he did make best-effort to make it right, but by that time we were hungry enough to be willing to compromise our preferences in favor of just eating. 

"We draw a diverse crowd after 10PM" was the server's excuse for the playlist (though I didn't take his point; the crowd seemed to be exclusively gen-Z and millennial-aged white working-class lads). It's now a bit less diverse, because this is one batch of over-50s who will be taking their custom elsewhere. Too bad, 'cause I've liked the place in the past; but this particular experience qualifies as a disaster.
