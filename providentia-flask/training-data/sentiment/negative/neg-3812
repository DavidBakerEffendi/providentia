I tend to eat out a lot, and I see a lot of customer service, both good and bad. Our experience at this restaurant is one of the worst I've ever experienced. The place is run by three teenagers who could care less about you. We ordered our meal and when we tried to order a pizza, we were told it takes too long and we should order something else. We decided on alternative meals and then proceeded to wait for two sandwiches and two omelets. We continued to ask when our meal would arrive and in the most flippant uncaring way we were told 5 more minutes, every time we would ask. After nearly an hour we finally could not take it anymore and got up and left. The teenagers could care less. I've never felt more unwelcome or unwanted in my life. Avoid this horrible place at all costs.
