The service and food was great up to a point. I had a personal pizza with chicken sausage and my wife ordered the lasagna bowl. The flavors and service were fantastic. But halfway through my wife's was on your bowl she noticed a long black hair in her food. At that point we got up and left didn't mention anything didn't want to ruin anybody else's night but it definitely did put a heavy negativity on the establishment in our eyes. What I try Tagan uncertain at this point want something like that has happened it's really hard for us to get over it.
