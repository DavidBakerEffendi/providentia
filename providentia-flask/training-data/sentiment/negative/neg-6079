Went here on Father's Day.
We were sat at a dirty table.
Someone must have seen the look on our face because they ran over with a rag and towel and proceeded to wipe the table down as we sat there.
There were crumbs all over the table.
They then gave us menus.
As we were looking through the menus, we commented on how filthy and greasy they were. The pages were literally stuck together.
My mother was with me and she opened her menu. She forced the stuck pages open and found a disgusting mess on the inside.
It looked like someone had vomited on the menu and then closed it up.
This place was absolutely filthy. I was so disappointed beyond words.
I can't believe they would sit people at a dirty table. This is inexcusable.
If they can't even clean the tables before people sit down, it makes me wonder if they're cleaning the areas where the food is prepared.
I didn't feel safe eating here. 
We decided to just leave and go somewhere else.
My only regret is that I didn't ask to see the manager and demand to know why their restaurant was so filthy and disgusting.
We were so disgusted that we stood up and left without saying a word.
Completely unacceptable. 
Perhaps they need new management or at least new cleaners.
