Really should have consulted yelp before going there....
The sandwich was ok at most though definitely not tasty but the fries were the most disgusting ones I ever got in the U.S. Soggy. Greasy. Just bad. 
Should have chosen the salad & wraps place next counter which did look quite tasty on other tables. 
Not that I could not have been warned before. If I'd had consulted yelp in advance.
