Absolutely horrible! The food is mediocre at best but way overpriced. The management was horrible. Had to wait after checking in with our reservation. Then the waiter was rude and awful. Messed up our order then brought a rushed replacement to only have a second one come 5 minutes later with the actual presentation and plating that it was meant to have. How insulting! After complaining to one manager and getting blown off we had to wait 20 minutes to talk to the general manager who then argued with us about why the poorly plated version was delivered. The entire evening was so disappointing and insulting we will most definitely never go back nor recommend it to anyone. Take your money elsewhere you'll be glad you did!

as far as the food goes, it was less than amazing. The cod had half a piece of bok choy and a tiny piece of pineapple the sauce had hardly any flavor. The scallops were small and nothing amazing. The steak tartar was fine though it would have been nice to know they came with french fries so we didn't order mashed potatoes as well. The alaskan king crab was fine, but overall none of the food was worth what they were asking.
