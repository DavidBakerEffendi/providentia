Drive on by, don't look back and find a good Burger King.  Stopped in at lunch and not a car in the drive thru, thinking back that should have been a clue, but ordered, and requested to repeat it, repeated order and requested to repeat it, repeated order and requested to repeat it , see a pattern here????  It did sound like there was a party inside maybe that was it.  

Got to the window paid and change was literally thrown in my hand with most of the change landing in the driveway, the only time the employee looked was when the change hit the drive to which he said, oh sorry and quickly turned back to the party.

Order arrived and same thing, without looking the order was handed out the window as the employee never broke eye contact with the party inside.  If I want to be ignored I can find other places to have that happen and maybe get all my change back.  Then to find out I had been charged for a meal and only ordered the sandwich and fries.  Well a good way to make money I guess.


Never again for me
