I already thought this place was overpriced and over hyped.. but this last time was the tie breaker. I came in with a girlfriend right before happy hour ended and all they had available was the "community" table which was by the restrooms and had 10 high top seats. After an hour of many overpriced margs and food, the hostess came up to us and told us to leave and to move outside. We all had full drinks we just reordered and had not paid our bills. It was 8:02. And the hostess told us the 8:15 reservation was here for this table so we had to move. I have never in my life been asked to be moved to a new table because a reservation was here early. We asked for the manager and all she said was that we could be moved to the bar tops when there was still a booth available inside. We will never be going back here and will tell all of our friends to never go here either. Worst customer service I've ever heard of in my life, and I've been in the industry my whole life.
