Tried Spring Sushi yesterday. Extremely pricey for mediocre food. Service is perhaps the worst I ever seen in Toronto - reservation for our table was given away and the hostess made us wait for over an hour and kept leading us on by saying that there will be a table avaliable shortly (we could have just left if we know there will be a long wait). Talked with two managers, the younger one is a douche and basically tell us to fuck off when we complained. The other one at least offer us a discount and show that he care about the customers. Overall, a terrible experience.
