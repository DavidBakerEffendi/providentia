I haven't been here in a while since they received a D rating. Ordering the food over the phone was fine as always. The staff can not multi task. You'll be waiting there for a while until they finish a task and then they move on. 

Now to the food. I usually get specific rolls because my spouse is highly allergic to shrimp. He comes rushing in my room asking me if the Crunch roll has shrimp. Their menu says avocado. But there was shrimp in the avocados place. Luckily he didn't swallow it so it was minor itching. 

Because of that huge mistake I will no longer be going to this location. It has proven that they are going down hill and just don't care about anything anyone.
