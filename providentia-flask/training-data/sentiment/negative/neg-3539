I had the worst experience ever at this particular Panda Express.  My brother and I went in to grab a quick lunch to take home to our wives.  My sister-in-law loves the black pepper chicken there, so that is what we ordered.  The server looked and saw that he was out of that dish, so he asked the cook to make another batch of it .  The cook smiled at him and then said that he did not have the ingredients to make it.  The cook decided that he would rather continue organizing ingredients, take things to the fridge, and do prep work than make food for his customers.

I am pretty sure the cook LIED to us.  

We asked him what ingredient they were out of, and he couldn't tell us.  We let him know that if he was unwilling to make more of the dish that we would be reporting him to his manager.  He was very rude and he told me that he couldn't hear me even though I was talking very loudly in a close proximity to him.  Normally, we would just pick another item, but because we felt we were being lied to.
