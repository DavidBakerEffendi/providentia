What a disappointing buffet!!!    Stopped here for lunch while out in Vegas for the CES/AVN shows.    Selection of food was just ok and the quality was terrible.   Some of the food was cold.    As I sat at my table, I watched as people would go up to the dessert station, look around for a while and then walk away with nothing.   Terrible selection of desserts.
