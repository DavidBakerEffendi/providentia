The burgers were very dry and not juicy. But the fries were very good! Except for the fact I had a wing inside my bundle of french fries. Haha sorta gross. The waitress got my boyfriends order wrong and when he tried to mention something. She just waved it off and said the only difference was the seasoning? A smoke house burger comes with bacon, onion rings and BBQ sauce. When it came out it was a burger patty covered with portobello mushrooms and Swiss. Yeah not the same. You or the kitchen made a mistake. Just fix it properly. Don't try to misguide us saying you gave us the right order. Won't be returning...
