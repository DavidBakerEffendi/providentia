Used to be great. Not sure what happened but I ordered Hunan dumplings and General Tao. First: my food took well over an hour to arrive. The delivery driver shoved it in my face. Then, no chopsticks. What type of Chinese delivery doesn't give chopsticks? But the kicker? ALL my food was SOAKED. The dumplings were sitting in about an inch of water and the chicken tasted like, you got it. Water. Save your money, get your food elsewhere.
