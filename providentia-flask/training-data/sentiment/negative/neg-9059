So disappointed! Racing across the airport and bypassing several very interesting looking wine bars and bistro's so we could visit a taste of Carolina. Do you believe they use California Pizza Kitchen as their food menu?  There was a Carolina beer at the bar but I think that was the only thing. If you love CPK have at it!
