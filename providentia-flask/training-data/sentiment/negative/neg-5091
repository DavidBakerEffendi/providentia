A few nights ago my friend and I came in during a power outage sometime around 11pm. Both of us only had card and since the power was out on the whole block, we obviously weren't going to be able to use an ATM. I asked the waiter, who was standing by the door at the time, if they were still open and if we could pay with card. He said yes that they could only make the pho and were still accepting cards. So my friend and I order one chicken pho each, that were going to be paid for separately. (Btw the power was out our whole meal, but thanks for still serving us) After our meals they asked us to come to the counter so we could pay with our cards. The waiter then took down my friend's and I card information on slips (because again, we were paying separately) and when they took it down, they wrote down the expiration date, security codes, everything. He then said that it was going to be charged later when everything is back to working. Well, that would've been nice to know before our meal as having all my card info just written down isn't something I'd like to think about. Basically I didn't see the charge for a day or two, and when it finally showed up in my bank account today I was charged $20.09 when I only ordered one pho. I called to find out why I was charged double, and talked to the manager who said that what had happened was that an employee lost the slip with my friend's card info and charged both pho's to my card. She then told me "my friend owed me $10." I mean I don't mind paying for my friend's pho. But still I don't think this was handled very well as now all of her card info is just around somewhere and I wasn't told I was going to be charged $20. Anyways, I'm very unhappy with how the manager handled this situation and the fact that they lost her card info and didn't take responsibility for it. Won't be coming back.
