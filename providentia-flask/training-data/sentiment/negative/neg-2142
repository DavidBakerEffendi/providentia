Pros: The (new, I think) owner of this restaurant is clearly trying to make this restaurant run well.  He is attentive, polite, and courteous.  

Cons: The sushi.  I've only tried the spicy tuna hand roll.  I have to agree with the previous poster-- it was nasty.  Rather than mixing the ingredients together you get tuna with a gross glob of mayo on top.  The sickening sweetness that undercuts whatever spiciness there may have been comes from the rice, I think.  Nasty.
