Read that Sam Woo is a chain started in CA, so thought that they must be pretty good to have so many locations.  The food was not bad, but it was pricey! All the soup noodles were at least 7.50 and more. We ordered 2 bowls of noodles, ended up being close to 19 bucks before tip.  The service was okay, but the cashier lady was so unattentive.  She was talking on her cell phone the entire time while we were trying to pay. Didn't say one word to us (just pointed at the check for the amount) or even a thanks at all. Oh btw, this restaurant takes cash only. Definitely not a great experience.
