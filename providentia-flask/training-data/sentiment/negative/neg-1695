Visited here with my daughter for the lunch buffet.  We have been to this location before, when it was under prior ownership.  I figured we would give it a try...would've been better off going to Taco Bell.

Strangely, the food tasted pretty good going down.  I'm going to guess that the small sampling of sushi we tried was the problem.  I stayed away from anything raw, but I should've just stayed away...period.

Let's just say both of us had some gastrointestinal issues once we got home...

Well, at least it was pretty cheap, but it is also the last time we'll eat there.
