Got to the restaurant at 8:50 pm. The sign on the door says they are open until 9:00. The hostesses turned me away saying they were closed. That's just bad business. If you want to close at 8:50 then put that on your door and website so people know what to expect. I won't try again regardless of how highly others have rated them. If they can't deliver on the advertised close time I don't trust that they'll deliver a great dining experience either.
