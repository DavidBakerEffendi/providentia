So I have been going to Teharu for about 2 years. I remember when there short lines and delicious sushi for a great price. At some point and time they started counting on quantity over quality. The portions got smaller and smaller, to the point where I went this evening and the salmon was literally paper thin. So essentially prices are the same but you get less. What?!

Service was not great as it felt like it was understaffed (big difference from the first time I went there).

The worst thing was the cleanliness. Tonight was the first time that I saw plates on the conveyor belt without covers on them, which was a big gross out factor for me.

I will not be going back until they fix the quality of the food and the service to the old standards of the past.
