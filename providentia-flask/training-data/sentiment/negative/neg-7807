Very disappointing tonight!!  Clearly the quality has gone down. Mostly dried or salty food selections. I can tell the line tonight was shorter compared to our last visit to the restaurant. 

No more for us~~ boys (they're 9 & 11) were looking forward to tonight's dinner, but they said they won't ask us to go eat there again!!
