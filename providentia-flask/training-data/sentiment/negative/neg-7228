Tried to go to Top Golf for the first time today. As we made our way up the steps this morning with a driver in hand we were stopped mid way by what looked like a Manager (I purposely say "stopped" vs "greeted" because her demeanor was nasty). She berated me & my daughter like naughty children - keep in mind I'm middle aged.  The associate was unapologetic when she proceeded to say, and I quote "There's 2 things. Number 1... You cannot bring in your own clubs. Number 2... There's no drinks allowed." 
OK - the whole point of going out this morning was to try out my new driver & spend a father-daughter day with my kiddo. My daughter was carrying an unopened bottle of water, it's not like it was a soda or a bottle of Jack Daniels. Get over it lady.
So to your establishment I say: number 1 - the whole point of a driving range is to practice with the equipment you have to improve your game, so your rule is as ridiculous as telling a bowler they can't bring their own equipment into a bowling alley & number 2 - it's hot in AZ & it's appropriate to carry water with you when playing an outdoor sport. 
This place is a racket.
My guess is that they can't trust customers with golf clubs & are worried you're going to steal theirs. Guess what? If you can't figure out how to come up with a process that protects you while allowing people to enjoy the game as its intended to be, you don't deserve to be in business. And while you're at it, next time apologize, even if it's insincere I might not be as tempted to take time out of my day to write a detailed review about a horrible experience that you delivered before I could even get my foot through the door.
