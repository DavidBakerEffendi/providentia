Just awful. I ordered a dirty martni because their logo has a martini glass on it. I figured that's what they specialize in. I asked for it to be chilled with 2 olives. Well my order must have been too complicated because they served it in a beer glass. Nice and warm. No olives. I chalked it up to maybe a miscommunication. Some how... So instead of seeing the signs and leaving I ordered some food. Do not get their lump crab Mac and cheese. They are really just serving TUNA. I do not recommend this place for food or drinks.
