This is a racist establishment. Last night my brother got kicked out of the bar for not having his ID,which is a completely legitimate reason. But the way the situation was handled was completely ridiculous. I was already at the bar with my friend and my brother's wife. We had a waitress, she had already carded us and brought us drinks. Our waitress knew that my brother was not going to have his ID because his wife had told her. So when my brother arrives she completely disappears. After like 10 minutes the biggest white dude in the bar comes over and stands right by my brother and starts demanding that we all show him our IDs or get up and get out of the bar. My brother told him he didn't have his ID but didn't want to leave so the guy goes and gets the owner. The owner starts giving us some ridiculous speech about how there might be a sting operation and the cops might show up and ask for everyone's ID and if that happens he'll get fined and all this bullshit. And this whole time our waitress never came to the table and just ask my brother for his ID like she should have, because she was scared because my brother is 350 lbs and he's big and black. So she sent that fuckin kid over there and he came over acting like he was a fuckin cop at a goddamn traffic stop. Half of the people at the table were already drinking when that stupid little retard came over there so there was no reason for him to demand everyone's ID like he was in fuckin charge or something. The whole place is bullshit and I honestly hope they get shut down. They never should have sold that new owner. Also when I tried to bad mouth them on Facebook and tag them in it they reported the thread to get it deleted.
