I'm US combat marine veteran that presented a 50-state wide acceptable form of veteran identification and was turned away by the doormen whom claimed it was not sufficient ID. They stated my out of state MD drivers license would have been sufficient had I had it on my person and their "state laws" (of AZ) not only accept and out of state ID BUT REJECT A FEDERALLY MANDATED AND ACCEPTED PERSONAL ID FORM. This establishment is therefore most VETERAN UNFRIENDLY. Buyer beware.
