I had already visited this restaurant several times. To be honest we feel the service is not good and the broth is sloppy, better in Min-ah. But this restaurant has a comfortable atmosphere and relatively close to my home. That's why again visited there in late June. As usual no service, sloppy soup. 
And, I don't know why, gratuity they collected didn't match our record. (We noticed that later when reviewing the card record and receipt.)
