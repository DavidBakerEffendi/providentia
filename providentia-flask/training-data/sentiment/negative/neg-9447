Worst customer service ever! The owner/owners seriously need to get rid of their staff and hire new ones that will actually like working at an establishment like this and is great in customer service. My friend and I have been wanting to try this place out for a while now and we finally decided to go today. We had already looked at the menu outside so we knew what we wanted to order ahead of time. When we walked in, we didn't even get greeted or anything. We stood at the counter and the workers didn't even acknowledge us. It being our first time there, we didn't know if we were supposed to sit down and they would come take our order or we were supposed to order our food at the counter. After standing there for a little bit, I finally asked the worker if we should sit down and they told us yes. We went and sat down. 15 minutes go by and nobody came to take our order. It wasn't busy whatsoever, there was only a couple of tables occupied table so we were a little confused why none of the workers came to our table. A couple walked in and I hear the lady placing her order at the counter. As one of the worker walked by our table, I asked him if we were supposed to order up front and he said yes. We walked up to the counter and the girl working there asked us what our order number was. Smh! I told her that we were told to sit down and that we never got to order anything. We decided this place wasn't worth trying and definitely would NOT recommend it to anybody. Such a disappointment cause my fatass was craving crepes too!
