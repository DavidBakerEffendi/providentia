In one word.... TERRIBLE!!! I took my parents there for lunch today and the food served was just as bad as the Pacific Seafood which has gone so far downhill, I don't see how either place has any customers. I was told it was very good once but not anymore. Food was cold, dried out, tasteless, and didn't even appear to be appetizing when it might have been fresh sometime during the lunch hour which was hours before. Service was downright slow and inept. Table was not even cleaned so I had to chase someone for that. A totally rotten experience!  Go elsewhere for Chinese food. There are many good selections in the area. Never again!
