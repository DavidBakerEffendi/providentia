Our server was wonderful throughout the night and so was the food & atmosphere. However, we were half way through our food and our bay only had 5 minutes left and our server mentioned lengthening our time (we already did once) and we passed because we just wanted to finish our food and leave. We spent $100 at the bar and our bill was $270 at our table. This man, Richard, came out asking us to move to the "free" section mid bite. That was probably the most insulting thing he said as if we didn't just spend $370 before a tip. He kept going on and on about the "policy" etc. we would have understood if it was 8pm on a Friday or Saturday and it was packed with a wait but it was 10pm on a Tuesday and there were all free bays in sight. My family is in town visiting me and we were trying to enjoy each other's company. We are reasonable and if we planned on staying to "party" we surely would have moved. Our family owns restaurants in PA so we know customer service and understand occupying servers tables. Richard should have came over, said hello, thanked us for coming and made the bay idle long enough for us to finish our meal. He should have given her a table out of her section to make up for us staying there (which idk what there would have been to make up for.. a $55 tip..?) and just confirmed we weren't there to party. I have never experienced anything like this in my life and is a sure way to keep people away from Top Golf. Such a disappointment.
