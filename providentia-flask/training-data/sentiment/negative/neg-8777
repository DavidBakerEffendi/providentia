Don't go to this TGIF!!!! The atmosphere and manager's attitude are both despicable.  My friend and I stopped in after 7 pm and the restaurant was partially crowded, so we were seated immediately. We saw the bus boys cleaning the table and seats with the same cloth; we saw employees using their cell phones while working; the talking/noise was unusually loud; the atmosphere was scary. We could hardly eat for looking around at the other clientele fearing for our lives.  We didn't know if someone was going to shoot or not.
  We complained to the manager about what we were experiencing,  he didn't care, didn't apologize for any of it and was very nonchalant. He simply walked away. 
    Because we were so appalled with the atmosphere and what we saw, we called him back and asked for the GM's name/card. He became indignant, started getting loud and still did not care or apologize. When asked his name he said Chad (no last name)........cause he would be too easy to find on facebook.......hahaha!! "He's the only Chad at that store and the only manager in the company named Chad." Still no last name.......still he didn't care nor apologize......The total atmosphere at this TGIF has drastically changed!!!!
   And oh, the hostesses at the front dot even know the manager's name.....they don't know who they are working for........and they also ask for Id when you are over 18 and not sitting at the bar!!!!! Wth???
      1 star.......and won't be back........
