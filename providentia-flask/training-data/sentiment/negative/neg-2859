I was so excited to try this restaurant because we need some real Mexican food here in Las Vegas!  I was finally able to go last night and I was so disappointed!   When we sat down at our table it took 10 mins for the waitress to come over for our drink order then another 10 for the girl to come and bring us some chips and salsa.  She brought us a basket of chip crumbs.   Once the waitress came back with our drink order I asked if we could bring us some chips so we could try the salsa.  She brought us more crumbs.  Disappointing!   You need to have chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant!!!  Ok now comes the food, there isn't much to select on the menu so I tried the cheese enchiladas.  You really can't mess that up!   Well they bring me something that looks like a corn tortilla topped with salsa.  It was so gross and the beans on the plate looked like they scraped a baby's diaper!    The only thing I could eat was the rice and that was not cooked all they way!   My friend did not complain too much about the Pollo Delmar, but wouldn't recommend it.  Very pricey for the meal.  Needless to say I was very disappointed and would not recommend this place.  The only reason I gave it a 1 cause you have to in order to write a review!!!   Save your money and cook at home!
