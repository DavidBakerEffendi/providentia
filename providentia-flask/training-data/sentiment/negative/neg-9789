Next to the Federal Pizza, where I got food poisoning a month or so ago, this is the worst restaurant I have EVER been to. At least the Federal tasted good going down.

I will preface this by saying my boyfriend and I LOVE frybread and LOVE trying new things.  We arrived starving and this was JUST awful.

I got the Frybread Southwest, while my boyfriend got a Frybread with Chicken on it (can't remember which one).  

I have got to be honest.  The frybread was GREAT, but everything else was a disaster.  Both of our dishes had Frybread with canned refried beans piled on top (about a centimeter or so thick) with no meat to speak of and another centimeter or so of garbage shredded lettuce.  There might have been sour cream or a topping, but all we could taste was horrible beans and trash lettuce.  How can a business sustain itself with Walmart store-bought goods? If it isn't, at least fool the customers with some quality.

I have friend's who have tried to make food for me that is absolute garbage. To be honest, I'd have those other meals instead of AZ Frybread ever again.

I hate saying this because they were so nice and welcoming.  Plus we were starving so we would have been happy with anything.  I could not have been more disappointed.  Also, the juices are SO PULPY they are almost undrinkable.  It also seems as though it is a mix of store-bought juice and someone juicing strawberries and mango's for their juices and that left a pretty horrible taste in our mouths.

We took 4-5 bites a piece, because we were starving and threw the rest away.  And if you know us, you know that we NEVER throw food away.  We always take our leftovers home.  Not this time.  Wish we had put the calories toward something actually satisfying like In-N-Out. 

Sorry AZ Frybread.
