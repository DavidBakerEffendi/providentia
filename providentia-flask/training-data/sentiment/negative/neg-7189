This store is horribly mismanaged.  Twice I have been into the store and had to wait for over 20 minutes to get a breakfast sandwich.  Today I walked in at 6:30am and after the person in line before me was served the clerk disappeared for about 8 minutes, then finally came back to take my order.  Perhaps he needed a bathroom break, but on a Saturday morning they should have had someone else up front.

It seems like they focus more on the drive through--just like my first visit, I stood at the counter for about 10 minutes after my order was placed and didn't get any attention until i asked how much longer it would be.  Had to show them my receipt as they didn't even know what I had ordered so I had to wait more for them to get the order started. 

While waiting I saw an employee stir coffee for a drive through order with a spoon, throw it down on the counter, then stir a separate coffee with it later on.  Gross.

Finally got my order and my "crispy hashbrowns" tasted like mushy grease soaked cotton balls.

I don't do fast food much, but I know that it can't be normal for it to be this bad.
