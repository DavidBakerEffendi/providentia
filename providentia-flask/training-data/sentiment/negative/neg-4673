This place has fucking shit service. I walked in and aged 7 years before I was seated....I missed my son's birth and my wedding. By the time I was seated, I learned 3 new languages. The individual who was serving me knew one word, yes. The one star rating is a place holder, it's should be shut down due to NO ONE WORKING HERE. Not to mention 11 people 2 grills oh baby.


overall a good experience 10/10


update:
After cooking for a few minutes, the grill turned black. We asked for it to be changed, he said to wait 10 minutes....after 30 minutes he returned and said "we out" and reignited the black grill. He then filled our water with another tables left over water. I am not tipping this half ass service.
