I went in for pick up today to take advantage of the $28 deal and I couldn't have been more disappointed. I got home and my 14-inch pizza wasn't even cut! I tried to use a knife, but ended up just tearing off pieces one at a time. Not the best way to enjoy a pizza. While I was at the store, the girl at the front ran out of paper and wasn't sure if the card had gone through, so I had to login into my bank account to check and show her the charges. Definitely annoying and a bit personal of me to have to show you my bank account! When I get home I decide I'm calling to tell them about my experience and the girl who answers says, "sorry, that sucks" after I explain everything. Are you kidding me?! How unprofessional is that! I ask to speak with a manager and she says she's the manager and will be sure to tell everyone because she just got there 10min ago- highly doubtful with those manners. I will definitely not be back!
