Waited 15-20 minutes when there were available tables. Hostesses were more into themselves than seating customers. 
All of the waiters and waitresses look, act, and talk like zombies. Hot chocolate arrived NOT hot. When we asked them to fix it, they brought the same thing back but just microwaved. 

My crepe came half on the waiters hand and on the table than on the plate itself. 

After paying, waiter nor the 2 hostesses said thank you for bye. 

Save yourself the trouble and don't bother coming here. It's not worth the atmosphere or price.
