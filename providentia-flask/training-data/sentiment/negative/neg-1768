Don't bother.

The food? Blander than bland. It doesn't taste like anything. I can't tell you if I like it or not. Here's what I can tell you: it was served at a piping hot 74 degrees. Like eating leftovers that sat on the kitchen table all night. Also, the pork in my hot and sour soup (neither hot nor sour) was really spongy.

The service? Adequate, if a little curt. I know someone who went here, ordered a Shirley Temple, and got a "You've got to be kidding me" from the waitress. I only wish I had that kind of story to tell people.

Yeah, don't bother.
