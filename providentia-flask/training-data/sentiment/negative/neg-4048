I love Arby's. I really do. It wasn't my fav growing up but for some reason while I was deployed for a year to Iraq in 2004, I dreamed about roast beef & cheddar sandwiches constantly. When I got home, I think I ate there every day for 2 weeks - it may have been longer.

Unfortunately, I have to give this particular franchise 1 star. The service is achingly slow and they appear constantly understaffed and overwhelmed. I don't understand how because other fast food chains seem to have similar volume in the area and wait times are not 20-30 minutes of sitting in the drive-thru line.  Yes, you will waste some gas going to this location.  If you're thinking Arby's, go somewhere else.
