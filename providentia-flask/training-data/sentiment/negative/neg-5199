This review is for this specific location. 

I've been to many Farmer Boys throughout the valley and have always been greeted with good food and friendly people, but this place SUCKS! 

1. The cashier got our order wrong. Along with our meals, we ordered 3 shakes. The cashier confirmed that there were 3 shakes before I paid. When they brought it out there was only 2. We immediately said it was supposed to be 3. No biggie,  they started making one. The lady brought out a shake (the wrong flavor) and asked to see our receipt (very rude btw Apparently the cashier didn't get our 3 shakes in EVEN THOUGH HE CONFIRMED IT BEFORE I PAID. whatever.. We didn't see a need to pay for the wrong flavor shake. 

2. Food came out fairly quickly (pro) BUT OUR ORDERS WERE ALL MIXED UP.  Our order wasn't complicated,  just some people didn't want onions, pickles, or tomatoes and others did. I checked our receipt and the cashier got this part right, but looks like the cooks didn't... At this point we are already in a bad mood with the wrong order, rude lady, and mixed up order. I'm not the type to send food back so we kind of just "dealt with it.." 

3. Food was not on par. Zucchini were soggy af!  We ended up throwing them away. Burgers were cold. Fries were stale 

At first I was just going to write off this location, but the more I think about how bad the whole experience was I may never go to a Farmers Boys again.

Actually, yeah, I'll never go to a Farmer Boys again. Thanks for nothing  Farmer Boys.
