Rating based soley on service as we didn't actually eat there. - Truly bizarre... walked in around 9am on a weekday. The place was virtually empty. Maybe four tables. There was an older couple sitting on a bench by the hostess station "waiting". The hostess looks at me and says "it'll be a few minute wait". I look at her like "Huh" as I look around the restaurant. She says "were giving our servers a chance to catch up". We were surprised but sat to wait. After about five minutes we looked at each other and went "no way in hell. This is a really bad sign" and out we went to IHOP across the streeet. Where we had both a good meal and fast and friendly service. Still mind boggled by being made to sit and wait in an empty restaurant while the servers "catch up".
