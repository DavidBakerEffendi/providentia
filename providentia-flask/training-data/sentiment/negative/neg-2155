We walked in and didn't have a reservation so they asked if the bar was okay. We said yes and the hostess starting walking us towards the bar. Then she stopped and pointed to bar and said "your seats are over there" and left us. We didn't know which seats she meant because we were pretty far from the bar when she left us... so we just awkwardly went and sat in two spots. No one said hi, no one asked if we wanted any drinks and we had no menu. So I went back to the hostess table and asked for a menu. The girl asked where I was sitting (not the same girl who didn't lead us to the table) and told me that menus were at our seats already. Um why would I lie about not having menus?? We still hadn't been asked if we wanted a drink so I finally asked the bartender who was standing right in front of us (ignoring us) if we could have waters. He seemed friendly enough... but was too busy making drinks to be the server for the people sitting at the bar. After we got our drinks, no one came to take our order so I had to flag down another bartender. They took our order and I ordered a mushroom soup and my husband ordered a burger. There really aren't a lot of options for vegetarians... but that isn't uncommon. The food took forever and that mushroom soup was probably the worst soup I've ever tasted. It tasted burnt... which I don't even know how a soup can taste like that. My husband said his burger was pretty bad and his fries were overly oily. Overall, the service was really bad and the food was awful. Also, the actual decor looked great... however, what was with all the dead animal bodies hanging as decoration. Sorry, I don't eat meat and I don't want to look at dead, skinned animals while I eat. That's disgusting. We won't be going back and don't recommend to anyone.
