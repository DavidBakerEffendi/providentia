Do NOT ever go to the Hickory Tavern on Harris!! I'm so embarrassed for their managers. After having been pushed to order multiple beers (not that I minded this part that much) my server then told me to leave my card on the table and he would just get it (without being given my check). I decided to see what would happen so I did. He brought me back my receipt without my check. I then asks for my itemized check and he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. I explained what it was to him then he brought it. Guess what!! It was lower than what he ran my card for?! Seriously!! Don't go there! They let their servers TRY to rip you off!!!
