Tried this place once and will not come back. We came in after lunch hour so the place was not busy at all, we were seated and sat there for over 5 minutes before someone came to take our drink orders. Throughout the meal, they were having training or some kind of meeting in a room next to our table and they were so loud the entire time, we could hear them talking and discussing, it was not a big deal but just really distracting when we were trying to have our own conversation. 

The food sounded better on the menu than it tasted, the only thing that stood out to us was the grilled pork belly. The rest of the food was really bland and not impressive at all. We also ordered a fish fillet that comes with the skin still on the fish, I am not disgusted by fish skin at all, in fact I usually don't mind eating the fish skin... but this fish fillet still had lots and lots of scale on it. It was so disgusting, the waitress was not even around for us to ask for a different piece. Needless to say we did not finish the fish, we reluctantly ate the rest of the food and left. 

They also advertised happy hour food and drink menu but the happy hour menu did not offer many options at all. Had so much expectation for this place because I heard good things about this place, but my experience was terrible.
