We were there over the weekend and the restaurant felt like it was opening weekend. Food was served cold and the waitress had to be continually asked to refill our drinks. We waited almost 20 minutes for two managers two poorly attempt to move our table. They sat us in a table that had the sun beating down on it. Instead of moving us they continued to seat 3 other families in open tables. Finally we had to come up with our own solution and move our own table. Very disappointed in a restaurant that has been open for awhile now. It appears the management needs better training in problem solving
