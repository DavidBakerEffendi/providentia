Went to the Thai House tonight and ended up walking out.   We have been going here for a long time and the food has hit an all time low.  

We both ordered Pad Thai and it tasted like they used Bar B Que sauce in it.  It wasn't even close to the Thai food that we have enjoyed over the years.  I hate to say this but don't think that we will be going back anytime soon.
