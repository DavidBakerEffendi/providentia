Yikes. I feel bad because they must be struggling, but that does not excuse poorly cooked food, an awful salad and side bar and gross goop on their tables to ruin shirts while you're eating..leading you to peel off your shirt while trying to keep your appetite. Instead we voluntarily stopped eating despite not being full and left. The owner said, "don't worry, if you wash it it will come off your shirt okay?"....sure.  But the guy slicing the meat for us was very nice.
