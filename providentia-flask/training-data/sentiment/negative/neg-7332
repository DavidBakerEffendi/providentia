Super Gross. I stopped here for lunch today and found a lovely surprise in my Black Bean Chicken Bowl:

3 RANDOM PILLS! 

They had been cooked with either the broccoli or rice (a black bean substitute) and had started to disintegrate so I couldn't tell what they where.

The GM wasn't there, but they gave me my money back. Lucky I didn't eat any. God knows how many other people where served rice/broccoli from the same batch. Ugh.
