Made reservations in advance, arrived a few minutes early (7:20).   Mentioned that my son-in-law would be arriving about 8:10 from work and they said that the front doors are locked at 8 and he wouldn't be able to get in.   Asked to talk to the manager and she said "nope, doors get locked at 8:00".  He won't get in"   Why when we made the reservations the day before didn't someone tell me that they close at 8:00. Our reservations were for 7;30 -  amazing.   Glad we left there immediately and went to Macaroni Grill next door.   Food was fabulous and the service was tremendous -  Will not ever eat at Landrys again -
