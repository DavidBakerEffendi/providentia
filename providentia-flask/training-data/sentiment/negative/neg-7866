An addendum, after complaining to the establishment I was assured I would get a return call when a manager would be able to the next day. Guess who doesn't understand customer service. If a customer gives you the opportunity to rectify a fail on your part you should jump at it. Stavros obviously doesn't care fr their patrons.

On a related note. Mona's pizza has 2 x 12" 3 topping pizzas for $20.

Additionally, on Mondays you can get an 8" pizza from the Local for 5.25$. Finally Donavan's has a Wednesday pizza special equally as good. As you can tell I like my pizza. None of that business will ever go to Stavros. Not to mention my beer, sports, and hang out habits.
