Called and made a reservation for Mother's Day, was met at the front by an older women who was in a bad mood. She told us that it wasn't there and then shoved a ticket at us to wait in line! She didn't even apologize and then expected us to wait an hour for their mistake. We were good customers but will never return to this place again! They need to fix their attitudes and learn how to provide good customer service!
