Went in for a late breakfast on a Sunday. The waitress was attentive, however, her interaction seemed forced. A couple days later I found she/someone charged me $13.64 for the Miners Breakfast and then another $5.00 for who knows what.. obviously someone doesn't know what they're doing behind the register. I highly advise paying in cash if you want to go to this Sierra Gold. If you want better service where they don't fuck up your check, go to the location on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.
