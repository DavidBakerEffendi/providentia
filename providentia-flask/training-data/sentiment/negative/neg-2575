What the hell happened?  Went here again, exact same time of year, one of the same servers.... the place was dead and I see why!  The bar didn't have a bartender in the middle of the day, the service was horrible, the food was crap, even the girl at the cash register was rude.  Wow, what a decline.  Last year was so great, the place was rammed and times were good.  The worst turnaround I have ever seen.  How do you mess up a Denny's?  Wow.
