I came during Wednesday ladies night. Guys hoping for easy pickups might be disappointed even though females get in for free. Guys are stuck having to pay a $7 cover but that didn't seem to discourage huge crowds of men from entering the place. From what I observed there were far more guys than gals so if it's a hookup place the odds are stacked in favor of predator females. 

Both inside and outside areas were packed with mobs of people. 

Music was painfully loud hip-hop (and not good hip-hop either, assuming there is such a thing). The PA system was being overdriven to the point that all you could hear is a loud "thump da thump" and some screaching human voices. 

Most of the crowd were young -- lots of tattoos etc. The men dressed like gang bangers, thugs, and bums. Women looked like sluts and biker chics. Most of the females came and left in groups, so it didn't seem the young bucs were scoring very often.

Everyone was yelling at each other so that they could be heard over the music. It was quite a cacophony. 

I had to wonder why young people are willing to put up with such abysmal conditions. Cheap drinks, perhaps? Everywhere it was crowded and hot, and the stench of sweat and vomit couldn't be avoided. If they are there to hook up, how do they find somebody when there is so much noise it's impossible to talk to each other (maybe that's the idea, LOL!).

The dance floor was small considering the size of the crowd -- but nobody knows how to dance anyway so who cares? 

I have heard WR is better in the early evening when the country dancers are there (I arrived after 11 pm). Once the hip hoppers arrive the adults leave. Maybe I'll try going there again for the country dancing but for now I got a belly full of the place.
