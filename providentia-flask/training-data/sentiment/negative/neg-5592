To be fair, this particular review is specifically about their grilled cheese sandwich. First of all, apparently if you don't specify,  they use American cheese... strike one. Secondly, they only grill it on one side, cutting it in half and folding it so that the ungrilled portion is "hidden" on the inside. The moisture from the two warmed slices then made those pieces not grilled, but steamed (yuck). My third, and final complaint is that they did not put butter on the bread before grilling it resulting in a final product that was relatively tasteless and soggy/crunchy. Maybe I'm just spoiled....

The cookie that came with it was good.
