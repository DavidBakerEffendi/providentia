Don't do it! Way to expensive for the kind of food served. Fish taco's served with FRIED FISH! Yikes! My son had the "live" queso and chips. He thought  this would be fun to see them made at the table. All the server did was dump the cheese, etc. in the  bowl and stir! Not much of a show for 8.00! Bad nachos. However the chips and salsa at the table were good.
