The service is beyond horrid, the food bland.  We were seated, a pot of tea literally thrown (it landed and slid) on our table, our order taken, order delivered by the same throw-slide......and that was the last time we saw anyone. Our waitress sat at the booth behind us, with another waitress swatting flies in the window with a swatter, and never even said a word when I made eye contact with her.

My Sam Woo Hot Pot was simply soy sauce, salt, and a variety of seafood, a few pieces of chicken, and a few of pork. The fish was like wet cardboard (I think it was fish?), the squid was just the body--no tentacles, and there were all of two shrimp.  It was hot, it was in a pot...that part did not lie. But it was not worth the $14.95. 

 The Mongolian beef, ordered extra spicy, had no spice and nothing except beef and scallions.  Want rice? That's extra.

$30 for just those two dishes and a bowl of rice.  Save your money (and the ATM fees).
