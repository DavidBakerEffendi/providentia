We got the wonton soup and pork fried rice here and they came out with them in less than 5 mins.. so surely the food was just reheated. We got a bad feeling from this, and sure enough the food was a disappointment. The soup was bland and had a bad tap water taste; the fried rice was also bland; and our water/cup had a smell of bleach. We came here pretty hungry, and my  husband ALWAYS finishes his food to the last drop, so I got to see one of the rare occasions where he left half of the food untouched.
