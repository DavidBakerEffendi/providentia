Walked in on a Sunday morning. Place was pretty busy but several tables were open.  We sat there for about 15 minutes. Nobody approached us. An older gentleman, who is obviously a regular came in after us and was waited on and given coffee. Lots of staff shooting the breeze with regulars, nobody approached us. Mind you, this is not a big place.  When we thought about how long it's taking to get waited on, how long would it be until we were eating.  We left. Unless you're a regular don't wast your time.
