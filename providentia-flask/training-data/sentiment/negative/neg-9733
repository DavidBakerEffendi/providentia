DO NOT EAT HERE! Bad service, horrible food. Ordered delivery. Took over an hr to arrive. I live 5 miles away.. The Pastrami sandwich I ordered barely had any meat on it. They forgot the toppings I asked for and the sandwich was really soggy. The hamburger we ordered came with about 5 pieces off French fries. They also forgot the drinks that came w our meals.
