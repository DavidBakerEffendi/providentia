Never have I witnessed such a corrupt and disorganized restaurant. Came here for dim sum with family and friends on Chinese New Year and naturally there was a long line. But as I waited, I noticed customers who knew the staff, coming in after me, jumping the line and being seated. And even noticed some groups coming in, bribing the hostess, then promptly being given a table. Only after we made several complaints to the hostess did she decide to give us a small table by the door. 

Serve customers on a first-come first-serve basis, not through bribes and favoritism. Very Fair? More like Very Disappointed.
