Well the goat was good, the red chicken was good.  The rice was hardly palatable even after putting heavy gravy from the above dishes on them  the squash was good, the round sweet balls were way overly sweet.  The buffet was not very appetizing to look at, everything was very spicey and would not recommend for the kids, very spicy. The food was palatable at best.  Very dissatisfied with the overall experience and would not recommend.  Water was the only option offered for drinking.  The yogurt used to cut the spiciness of the food was good.
