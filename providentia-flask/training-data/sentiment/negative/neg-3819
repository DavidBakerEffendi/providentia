Went here back in February and have been meaning to write a review because I've been fuming about how bad the burrito was ever since. It was the worst burrito I have ever had in my life. It was so tasteless and awful I had to throw it out and I never waste food. It was veggie so I can't personally vouch for the meat but my friend who was with me had meat and said it was equally disgusting. she also couldn't finish hers. Bland, bland, bland. What a waste of money
