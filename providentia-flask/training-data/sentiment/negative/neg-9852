Slow during Sunday lunch, hostess sat us immediately. Hostess was chewing gum and wearing white and pink socks, very visible. Upon sitting our server Maria came over before we completely sat down and asked us what we wanted to drink before we looked at a menu. She left dirty plates on the table. We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, which was great. Ordered the crawfish bread and gumbo, both HORRIBLE. Talked to Maria about the gumbo because it was supposed to be the Shrimp and sausage gumbo but no sausage was in the dish and the server said it doesn't come with it but the menu says it supposed to(very important to know your menu as a server). Talked to a manager Marcalla and she was accommodating.
