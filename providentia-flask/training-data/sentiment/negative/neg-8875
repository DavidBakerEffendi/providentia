I was roped into going here as part of a cousins birthday party, and after checking the reviews I knew I was in for a special night.

The wait was long, the servers paid little attention to the tables, and half of the parties orders came to the table incorrectly prepared.

Also what's with the GIGANTIC buns? They almost made the burgers inedible.

Also, I understand that it's a Toby Keith bar, but I was not prepared to be inundated by the same 3 song Toby Keith playlist over and over.
But hey, at just the waitresses are walking around in their underwear.

Tldr: expensive, slow, and mediocre food.
