Low quality, SLOW, and not worth it! 

Blegh do not come here! 

Came here for dinner with my family, I was looking forward to it because of everyone else's reviews. The tuna sashimi was old, had stringy parts, and was mushy. Couldn't stomach it at all. The salmon was a little better but all of the sashimi was cut way too thick and big which reduced the quality. 

The lovers roll was forgettable. Not worth the $12. 

Finally, we were still hungry so we ordered a ramen soup and an udon noodle soup. We waited almost 35 minutes for it before being told that they were still going to take 5 minutes. It's unbelievable how slow this place is, the sushi took a long time too. 

I wish I could get our money back, what a wasted meal. PLEASE don't come here,
