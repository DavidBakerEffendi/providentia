Recently I commented about the Caf√© Tranquilo in one of the Yelp talk threads and commented about some of the backed up smells out of their back door since I live next door. I decided to be fair and give them a shot since I hadn't visited since the old White Cock brand.

We entered the lobby Friday night at 9:30 PM and noticed the dining room and patio was mostly empty. I asked my gal to get us a table as I used the restroom. When I came back I found her seated in the lobby and said it would be 15 minutes. 15 Minutes to get seated when the dinning room looked mostly vacant. We sat their like dorks for about 15 minutes eating some complimentary chips and salsa and finally decided to bolt and run through the drive thru around the corner at Erickbertos and was served in 5 minutes.

Note to management... if half your restaurant is empty try filling the seats.
