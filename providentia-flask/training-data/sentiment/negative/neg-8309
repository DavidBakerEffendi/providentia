My family and I went there for brunch recently.  The sat us at the back of the restaurant  near the kitchen, which is equipped with an exit door.  The kitchen staff kept propping open the door causing a very cold draft which hit us directly, and our 2 sons ended up eating in their ski jackets.  We asked repeatedly for them to close the door, which they did, only to re-open it a few minutes later.  We waited an unreasonable length of time for coffee.  The food was mediocre, and I felt kind of ill afterwards.  At the end of the meal, we repeated our complaint about the cold draft, and instead of an apology from the manager, we got an argument.  We won't be returning.
