I love the food here! There pastels and coxhinas remind me of home!! Good place to try out!---- !!!!!!!!! sadly this has changed! It's been two times that I've found hair in the food! Never going back! Last time i did post mates 35$ of food called restaurant told me nothing they could do called Postmates, they told me restaurant would refund! Sorry but i had to throw all of it away! Sucks i really liked it here, but after two times finding hair, I won't ever go back! Hair is disgusting!
