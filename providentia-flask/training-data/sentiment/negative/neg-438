*update*
Tried to come in one evening. more then ten tables available in dining room, host said to give them a min waited for 15min then left giving up in starvation. Don't insult me with your empty dining tables starting at me  :p


Had a great meal the crispy gnocchi defiantly saved this review!!

The host was great got us seated earlier then our reservation on a sat night, but on the other hand it was DEAD in there for a sat night. The wait staff was not on it that night either, it seemed like no one was sure what section they were serving.... took for ever to get one over and get our drinks.

I had a Moscow bourbon in a copper cup mmmmmm! And started with the crispy gnocchi which I will say again was my favorite! My meal was the rice au gratin with chicken very good but very rich! 

To finish they gave us a free flourless chocolate cake for my and my friends birthday! very good but, dense and rich , order a side of ice cream to go with defiantly needed . 

All and all I want to give this place another chance to get five stars I know they have it in them I just need that stellar service.
