Second and LAST TIME we try this place.  Looked forward with anticipation to this restaurant opening. Tried it shortly after opening and the service was terrible.  We figured it was just the vagaries of opening a new restaurant.  Went this afternoon, March 19, and were seated promptly on the patio.  And seating was the only service we received.  Three waiters came out and looked at us but made no move towards us.  We obviously weren't seated in their section.  Another couple was seated after us and received attention immediately.  They obviously WERE in the right section.  Smokin Fins blew it.  We eat frequently so it's your loss.
