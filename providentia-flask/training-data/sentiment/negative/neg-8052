Well for starters let me say we have always been a huge fan of CPK. However today I had a fly cooked into my shrimp pesto pasta. Super disgusting. Everything else was fine. The manager offered to remove the plate from the ticket. Then I told her ok thank u but that I would post the pictures all over social media and on review sites. She then came back and said she removed the entire ticket. Thank u manager but flies in the kitchen are super disgusting and even more cooked into people's food. Think about it next time you come to CPK biltmore!
