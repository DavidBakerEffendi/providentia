Frequent diner and take out customer at this restaurant for many years.  Only decent Chinese restaurant in the Northeast Phoenix Area. Come for the food only but beware the service is always horrible from the older Chinese waitress with the glasses. This woman does not know or care about the meaning of customer service and being friendly and attentive.  Always very argumentative when asking for something and condescending to us and in my observation with other customers with a sour face. I recently ordered takeout with value of over $120 and asked for extra gravy on a particular dish. This same waitress taking my phone order said it will cost me $2.00 more. They just received a nice order and now she's being cheap and has the gall to ask for $2 which I declined.  No tip for them. They don't value and appreciate loyal customers. We need more good Chinese restaurants in this part of town to give them competition and teach them not to take customers for granted. If this restaurant was in San Francisco the customers wouldn't take this poor attitude and take their business elsewhere.  Unfortunately with popular Chinese restaurants in general they know people come for the food and don't care one iota about being nice and respectful to the customer since they figure there will be customers still coming.
