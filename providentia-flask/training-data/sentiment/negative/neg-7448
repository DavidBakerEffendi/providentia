We live very close to this restaurant and it's been our go to breakfast place for years. Great service, large portions and the place all our out of town guests were taken. That has all changed. The once perky, friendly servers are now lifeless drones who act like they would rather be anywhere else. My wife and I ordered breakfast, asking for crispy hash browns. When the food came, the portion was literally half the size it used to be, and the hash browns were barely cooked. What once was the best breakfast spot in scottsdale is now a glorified Dennys. Very sad.
