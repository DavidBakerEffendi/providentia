Last week I decided to check out Chick with my buddy on a Wednesday night at 7:30. As fans of the Grind (best burger in town), we decided to give it's avian cousin a shot.

It was an epic fail. They ran out of chicken after we ordered our chicken dinners. The manager was apologetic and discounted our bill 20% and comp'd dessert. I'm not sure if that's reparations or not -- I just know that we aren't eager to return. We ordered steak instead. We should have ordered the burger from the Grind next door.

The sides of veggies were good, as were the apps.

This might seem trivial, but as other reviewers have noted, the menus are a royal pain to read. It feels like a novel and you need elbow leverage to keep it open. 

Winner winner, steak dinner! 

Big let down, but hopefully they'll get their act together.
