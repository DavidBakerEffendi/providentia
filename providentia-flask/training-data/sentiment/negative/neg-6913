For a place that attempts to be a high end burger place with brioche buns and Niman Marcus beef, Smashburger falls woefully short. 

Smashburger will not cook the burgers to order. Instead, they arrive medium well to well done. Also, the brioche bun was a little stale and also too large for the burger. 

Would not recommend this place.
