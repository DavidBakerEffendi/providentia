Just got ready, left to pick us both up biscuits from Rise to start our day off together right. This was my fourth time there, the biscuits are good - mainly because of the odd combos, they're not spectacular or anything - the space is awkward and they always seem to have trouble keeping up. The newness has worn off, management just apparently sucks. Walked up to order and was told because they were so backed up they were not taking food orders at this time. WTF; definitely my last visit and I will tell anyone I know to avoid this place. Super poorly run. Bye bye, hope they put something better in that space.
