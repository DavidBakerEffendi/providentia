The absolute worst service I've ever had in my life. She had zero personality.  I genuinely tried hard to get her to engage.  I feel bad for the restaurant if they have staff like this. Drink was empty,  after waiting forever for her to come back she brought us a ticket instead of offering a refill for my vodka. Messed our bill up so badly, we had 4 things on our ticket that weren't apart of our tab. I paid it and left. I rather pay it then have to hear "ok" out of her mouth one more time. Oh, my favorite part of our dinner was watching her in the kitchen running her fingers through her hair looking at her reflection.  Goodbye mesa Hooters, I'll stick to Mill, they have better food/service.
