Horrible customer service. I won't be back because of it. Ordered a pizza for pick up. They told me twenty minutes. I came after 30 minutes and was told I was a few minutes early and the pizza wasn't ready yet. When I pointed out I was in fact late, they admitted to burning my first pizza and threw in a second one as I was standing there, after having paid. They were not very accommodating, did not offer a refund or any sort of compensation for the extra 15 minutes I waited. This to me is just a common sense thing to do. Most other places would've at least tried to make it right. One of the boys working there said a manager would come out, but no one ever did. I would be more understanding if they were super busy but there was nobody in the restaurant dining in (this was before 5pm) or picking up carry out.
