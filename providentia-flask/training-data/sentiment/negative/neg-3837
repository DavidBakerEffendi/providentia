I hate to write negative reviews, but I had no choice for this restaurant....

Let me start by saying that the staff was extremely friendly and nice.  But that's where it ends.

The food is very, very, very poor in quality.  I tried a small portion of about 15 dishes, and was not impressed by a single one.  I didn't expect gourmet food for $13, but the quality was very bad.  The shrimp looked and tasted old.  The rice, chicken dishes, beef dishes, etc were really bad.  The ice cream had frost on it as if it's been sitting there for 6 months.

It might be fun to take small children who want to eat new foods; but I definitely don't recommend it for adults.
