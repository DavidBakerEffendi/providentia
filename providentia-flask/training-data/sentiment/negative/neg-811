Went there when it first opened. Friendly staff. Good idea about the pizza, poor execution. 

My friend and I both got too much sauce on our pizza that it overwhelmed a multitude of toppings. I paid $8 to eat tomato paste. I've had other friends report the same thing about getting too much sauce. Perhaps we all got the wrong pizza makers, but it's enough to discourage me from going back.
