Wow, how does this place stay in business?
In recent years they have expanded their bar area, so if you wish to stop in for a drink, I guess it works.
However, the food is terrible! While I thought there is no such thing as a bad pizza- I was wrong! 

The owner must have Chicago roots because of all the Chicago sports gear on the walls. If so, make  Chicago style deep dish. Or make a decent thin crust pie. Instead you get neither.

The subs are also uninspired. The meatball sub comes out in a soggy sub roll that is very unappealing.
