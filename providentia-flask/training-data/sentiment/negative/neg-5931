Pretty basic meals. Do not expect a gourmet experience. You might not want to return again. The special red potato fries are blend and the cold slaw is below average.

The service is however fast on lunchtime and I can't argue you on the kindness of the waiter.

Unfortunately, I am not coming back again.
