I cant ever seem to look forward to eating here, but this last time was the last time. We ordered pork tacos, beef nachos, and a chicken quesadilla. 
The pork taco tastes like the meat wasn't cooked today, probably recooked or was cooked and we got the last bit of the pork before they cook more. It just didn't taste right at all. Our nachos came out having shredded beef instead of the ground beef that we asked for. It just seems like a mess when we get nachos. Everything is piled on the chips, you can hardly get to any of the chips without getting your hands dirty. 
Then the chicken. Unfortunately this chicken quesadilla gave me food poisoning. It was very dry, it was hot but not moist, just hot like a plate being warmed up in the microwave. All it had inside was bell pepper and onion, hardly any cheese at all. 
We went at midnight, but I just wouldn't come back here. It just seems like a mess when we get the food, and now I got sick.
