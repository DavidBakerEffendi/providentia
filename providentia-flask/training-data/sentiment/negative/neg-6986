Great service! The people that work there are super friendly. The restaurant has cool decor and a beautiful upstairs area. 

Sadly, the one star is because the food was really bad. We ordered the chimichanga and chile rellenos. Both were described as being deep-fried on the menu. Unfortunately, it seemed as though the oil in the fryer was not hot enough because both of our entrees were soggy and swimming in oil. That, or the items were dipped for a moment in the oil. Either way, neither of our entrees were crispy and didn't taste good.
