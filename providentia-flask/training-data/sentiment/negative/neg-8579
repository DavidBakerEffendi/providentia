0 fat stars If I can!! Rawr.  Hubby and I went here for lunch.  We order some Pho, beef noodle soup and combo soft fried noodles. Our waitress asked us "isn't that too much food? Is there another person coming?" "No...just two of us " (fatties for life?) Food was okay... really oily. I asked for more bean sprouts for my pho. Our waitress put the bean spouts on our table and said " it will be extra $2.00 charge ." Hubby and I give each other THE LOOK and said okay..(should have told us before you brought us the bean sprouts) When we got our check, they  charged us $4.00 for the bean sprouts so when I mentioned that our waitress said $2.00, the lady said they changed their menu prices just yesterday so their computer system put $4.00. W....T...F??? I was a waitress and an assistant manager for 7 years and I would have never let this happen. Arg... $2.00 is whatever but service was just horrible. ):
