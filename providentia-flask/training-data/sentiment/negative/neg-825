Sigh, two visits to two different Fionn's in one week and two equally bad experiences. 

This one was so simple it is unfortunately they couldn't get it right and still didn't in the end. My Hubs ordered the Reuben with NO 'rocket sauce', but thousand island dressing on the side, please. Our server even wrote it down. Easy, peasy!

1st attempt: Sandwich came out covered in 'rocket sauce', no thousand island on the side. Sent it back. 
2nd attempt: Sandwich came out covered in thousand island. Sent it back because it was soggy.
3rd attempt: Sandwich came out with thousand island on the side but without mustard on it. 

I then had to track down a manager (because surprise, surprise, our server went MIA). The manager offered to bring the mustard over. Great. He brought over two types of mustard with an apology and offered to comp the sandwich. That was nice! 

Now that you have the back story, here is the real reason I am writing this review...

Another "Manager" came over and apologized and offered a dessert. We didn't want one, but our friends accepted the gesture. Great.

Bills come: Sandwich not comp'd and both couples were charged for dessert with a -$0.50 (yes, fifty cent) discount. What? I will not bore you with the ridiculousness that came afterwards, but it took them a total of 7 (seven) attempts and 45 minutes to get our bills right. 

I need to learn to stay away from Fionn's because apparently Fionn's does not like me.
