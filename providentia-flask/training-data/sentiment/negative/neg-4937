Well I pushed because a friend said it was great. My husband is from Peru and said "It's not good, but I'll give it another chance" So I should have just believed him! 
The best part were the Yucca fries with Aji but why too over priced! $9.95!!! 

I ordered the Aji de Gallina, it looked nice when it came to the table, I'm just sad it didn't taste that way. It was flavorless and my rice was stale. I added salt and some other aji sauce they brought but no hope for it. I brought it home today hoping maybe I can save it with some Peruvian pastes I have here.... 
My husband has the Pollo a la Brasa called "Our Peruvian award winner rotisserie chicken" he said the Costco chicken is better. I didn't bother to taste it because it looked boring as hell too. 
Our son had the steak... once again no flavor! 
My husband said "who the would vote them BEST for 2014" I said "they must have known they were getting voted on those days and called in a real chef to cook for it." 

THIS was the biggest waste of $70.00 for Father's day! 
Take a PASS if you want Peruvian Food! 

Stick with Lima Limon or Inka!
