We've been in the area for a few months now and really needed to find a decent Chinese restaurant that delivers to us, which being in a new development in an underdeveloped area the choices are pretty scarce. So, we had two options, Jacky Chan and XO; after reading the reviews here on Yelp we decided on Jacky Chan's. Since we were driving by, we figured we would stop in and try them out for when we wanted Chinese delivery. Our bill came to a little over $53 and let me tell you that the food wasn't worth half that! We ordered the combination appetizer platter, 2 extra eggrolls, sweet and sour pork, beef with snow peas, general chicken, chicken pad thai and beef chow mein. Because the order was over $50 we had a choice of free items and the only thing that we liked from the offerings was crab rangoon. To keep this brief I'll give a quick rundown: 
1. All of the fried items had a horrible old taste, I'm assuming it was due to the fryer oil since everything was made to order. 
2. The eggrolls were thin and mostly wrapping no real filling to speak of
3. Crab rangoon was ice cold, and did not actually have very much crab in the filling mix.
4. Sweet and sour pork was rock hard, even our dogs turned their noses at them 
5. Threw the chicken pad thai out! After two bites I was afraid it was spoiled because of the God awful sour taste and smell, even the color was an off orange. I've had pad thai from many places and have never seen anything like what they offered. 
6. The general chicken had barely a taste to it other than the old fryer oil taste, the sauce wasn't enough to even mask the stale taste. 
7. Beef chow mein wasn't the best but it was edible, though rubbery and oily. 
8. The only dish that we liked was the beef and snow peas, it was hot and had a lot of taste. If it wasn't for this and the chow mein we would have been ordering a pizza. 
It's sad how bad this place is, save your money and look elsewhere!
