Not impressed !   The desserts in the bakery side looked delicious upon walking into the restaurant!

My bagel was NOT a real New York style bagel, but had the taste of a cheap bland bagel (and it was an everything bagel)   Very Very disappointing!    Had the pastrami sandwich, was pathetic in size to any pastrami sandwich I ever got in a New York Delicatessen...and to top off my bad meal was 2 pickles that tasted rotten -- verified by my other eating partners!  Will NOT be back -- especially at the prices they charge !
