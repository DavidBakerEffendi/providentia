Maybe I ordered the wrong things but the food was greasy and not that great.  The people were super nice!  I wanted to like it and was surprised that the great reviews didn't not match the food.  It seemed a little old (the food) and the kitchen looked really messy and full of old boxes and dirty.  I'm not afraid of a little dirt but it just all added up to a bad experience.
