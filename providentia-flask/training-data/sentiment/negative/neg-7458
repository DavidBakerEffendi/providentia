The place was super busy even though the reviews where average. The door was broken and the wind would take it and slam into the glass. This happened a bunch of times until someone finally put something between the glass and door so the glass wouldn't eventually end up in a million pieces. My friend and I ordered separately. My chile relleno and taco plate took a while, but her breakfast burrito came at least 15 minutes after mine. My taco was pretty greasy, but tasted okay. My chile relleno was still cold inside where the cheese was still a solid slice. The beans and the rice on the side was good. The salsa bar had fresh radishes which I love, but the pickled carrot/jalapeno mixture used cooked carrots which were no longer crunchy. Maybe because it was busy, the place was not cleaned up and people left messes on the tables that no one cleaned. When exiting, they only use one of the doors so now you get to manuever between the line and the glass wall trying to get out where people are coming in for the mad dash at lunch. Sadly we won't be coming back.
