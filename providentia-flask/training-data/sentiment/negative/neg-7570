Valet is bad!  Even tho they dont charge i gave them 20$ when i arrived and asked to keep my car close.  The man said no problem.  I did the same at Encore the same night and when i retrieved car it was close and in front.  At the Venetian when i retrieved car i was the only one waiting at 1130pm on monday.  It took almost ten minutes.  I asked the guy why it took so long and why it was not up front.  He said he just got there and didnt know why.  I still gave him 5$ and he just walked away.  Also none of them looked happy. Not friendly. Will self park if i go back.
