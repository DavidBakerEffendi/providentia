I've been in NC for 15 years and this was some of the worst pizza I have ever had. Everything from the crust to the sauce was not what you'd expect for a pizza. Huge disappointment. Spend the extra money to have quality italian food not overpriced ketchup on bread.

As a follow up and only because someone can't take constructive criticism....I am not affiliated with any of the places I rated. I work for a fortune 500 company in CLT and am a foodie plain & simple. I had a free evening and just decided to rate all the places I've eaten in the last few months including yours. I believe in rating the places I dine at no matter how good or bad. If you've done your research on my profile as you've indicated then you'll notice I gave more than one negative review and more than one review in the same day. I can't help it if the 5 star pizza place is the best in Charlotte.  You should try the pistachio pesto pizza. It'll make you want to close up shop, go to Italy and learn how real pizza is made. Boo-ya !!!
