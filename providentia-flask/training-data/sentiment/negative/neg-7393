Worst customer service ever! My chicken wings were under cooked I told the manager he said that to him they looked cooked and I pulled it apart and showed him the pink meat and he grabbed them and tossed them in the trash. I said I had to wait 25 minutes because they had a lot of orders and walked away no apology or anything. If I could I wouldn't even give them one star. This will be the last time I come eat here.
