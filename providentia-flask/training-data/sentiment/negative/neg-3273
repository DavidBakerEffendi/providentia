I have gone to Stoke's Grill over the years and always had a decent experience. After tonight I will not be going back. When I first walked in, I stood at the hostess stand for at least 5 minutes, and did not once see an employee enter the dining room, and there were other tables there. When I finally was greeted it was an awkward "so like,?did you order take out, or.....?" To which I said I'd like a table(duh). I was sat at a dirty table, and than sat for another 5 minutes at least, while I was not acknowledged by anyone. Just as I was about to get up, a server came over, and another awkward greeting and drink order. After waiting another few minutes I moved into the bar. The service was slightly better in there, but still terrible. Waited with closed menus for a good 20 minutes or so. Once our order was in, the food came in a reasonable amount of time, and was mediocre. I will say they have a decent Reuben, but if you order the fries, they suck. Sorry, can't sugar coat that. For a place that makes their own food, getting a side of crappy frozen french fries is disappointing. Once our food came we waited again to get condiments, and again for our check. As a SIN veteran, and a former local, small business owner, I am surprised that they have made it this far with such a lackluster experience, considering the recent boom in awesome local eateries, where the service typically matches the incredible food. It's one thing when a restaurant/bar is busy; I have no problem waiting however long it takes, as long as I see that the service is making a valiant effort, but this experience was clearly just lazy people giving zero f***s.
