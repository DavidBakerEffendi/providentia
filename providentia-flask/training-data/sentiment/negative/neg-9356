Came here with my daughter, the sushi was sitting out for a long time and still had skin on some of the rolls. Also I want to point out my daughter got a cream puff, when she bit down she screamed. I took it from her and not one but two flys came out. I told the waitress and they just apologize and said they were ordered in.   They didn't even comp my daughters dinner, they offered a 10 percent discount. The manager didn't bother to even come over and apologies.
