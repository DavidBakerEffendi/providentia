Manager Jose & most of the workers this evening seem to not appreciate patrons who live 1 block away and come in on average a MINIMUM of 1-2x a week. Truly disturbed by how I was treated on todays visit and will likely change dinner spots going forward to Cafe Rio which is almost as close and honestly has better food overall. Customer is not ALWAYS right however I certainly was today....
