Crap. Waited 4 hours for a table, only to find out it was given to someone else who came 2 hours after me. then the one behind the counter tells me "Be patient!" in a stern german accent. I guess waiting for 4 hours isn't patient enough. I'm never going back to this place, and I've never finished a boardgame to date. Good riddance.

I show up, since my cousins wanted to go here for their birthday, and asked to reserve a table for 6, and was immediately told by the person behind the counter not to expect my table until midnight, since 30 groups were before us. Had to cancel our entire evening plans. I can't even get into the door to this place. WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Even more frustrating, I didnt even get a text message confirming my table, they forgot my f**king reservation AGAIN!!!!!! Are you f**king kidding me?!?!?!?!?!?

This place is run by incompetent staff, period. This place is a f**king joke! End of story. Go to walmart, buy a board game and stay home. Anyone who gives this place more than one star got there on a good weekday, has their head up their ass, is a pothead hipster fanboy, or went down on a saturday before 2pm......don't even bother at all. Seriously, theres nothing special about this place, and its food prices are ridiculously expensive.....
