Non service and employees who obviously hate their jobs and life.

Went in on a Friday, knowing this place is typically busy we were tolerant, to a point. 
When we first came in I stood by a booth to "claim my spot." The waitress snatched the check from the dirty table and gave me a side eyed look (she knows I'm there.)
We sat there at a dirty table for 15 minutes until we gave up and left. (The other server cleaned 1 other table while we were waiting and watching.) 
During the period we were seated, they were bringing other customers food, they could have said it'll just be a couple more minutes. 
When we left I went up to the bar and told the bartender, both servers and either the manager/owner that we tried but 15 minutes with no acknowledgement was not acceptable.  At this point the waitress started arguing with me that we hadn't been there that long (really?  I had been timing it because I texted as I showed up.)

If you want to be treated poorly, this is the place to go.
