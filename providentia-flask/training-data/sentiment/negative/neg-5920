Went there with friends for our wedding anniversary.  The food was okay, but waiter spilled about 3 bowls of soy based dipping sauce on my new outfit while clearing table and attempting to chat at the same time. Dress ruined!  I was offered free dessert and my wine was deducted from our bill. The manager offered to buy me a new outfit but being soaked in soy sauce and smelling like it is not a good look on your anniversary evening. Then after check came, we couldn't get our waiter's attention AT all because he apparently was very engrossed in waiting the table directly next to us and didn't see or her us saying "excuse me sir". Another server told us she saw our dessert sitting there and went to get it for us. VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NEVER RETURN.
