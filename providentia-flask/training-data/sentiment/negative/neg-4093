I don't understand how this place has 5 stars. I feel like I could have saved a ton of driving time and just gone to wing stop or made wings at home and put peanut butter and jelly on them.

My experience goes as follows. I ordered pick up as my boyfriend had a random craving for wings, when we opened our boxes and took the first bite and immediately regretted it. 

The wings were soggy not at all crispy like I had anticipated. Secondly they forgot to put sauce on my orange wings and they were undercooked. 

My boyfriend only had sauce on some of his and they were mushy as if they were baked. 

Try this place at your own risk but I will be the first to say that the reviews are quite misleading. I was expecting something amazing and they delivered nothing close to this. The undercooked meat was concerning as well. If you go here you are better off ordering the fries and a soda. Please check the reviews not recommended as there are multiple complaints about their undercooked meat. This needs to be reported to the health department. 

Response to wing time: whether I ordered take out or dine in is irrelevant as there is no excuse for the poor quality of this food. Yes you handed me my raw mush food directly to my face. My honest review of my experience has nothing to do with "you seemed like a nice person" which is actually amusing to me. The fact that I wrote a review of my experience and you make it seem like I'm not a nice person because of it shows the lack of professionalism at this establishment. I am highly disappointed. All I have to say is a picture is worth 1000 words.
