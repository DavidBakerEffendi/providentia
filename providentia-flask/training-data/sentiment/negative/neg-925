Terrible experience. Ate there and saw cockroaches crawling on the floor so I asked to move seats, away from the bugs. When I ate the chicken I found hairs in them, sizzled onto the chicken itself. When I talked to the manager/owner, he accused me of planting it. 
Would never eat here again, and do not recommend. 
Tried some watermelon also and it had a fleshy look, like skin rather than juicy watermelon.
