This is my second visit that things still seem so unorganized. Signed up for the app like all the advertised signs on the door say.  5 min later go in the store and turn out they sent expired coupon. Manager made zero effort to gain a new customer. The first visit I ordered the 4 piece and requested certain pieces and offered to pay the difference to get the piece I want and they told me they could not do that and will not do that even if I pay the difference, they even asked the manager and the manager was extremely rude. Customer service is obviously not important at this company and gaining new customers
