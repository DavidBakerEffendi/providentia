Had dinner with friends. Had the chicken parmesan if you could call it that. It was the worst chicken parmesan I ever had. I found it very odd they did not even come around with cheese or at least have it on the table. What about some good bread? I thought I was at an Italian restaurant. not some soggy piece you put on the dinner plate. And as far as your sauce, you need to get a new recipe. It tasted like straight up tomato paste. The chicken was very dry and over Deep Fried.. And for what you are charging, you should be able to give a nice piece of chicken not the paper thin size with bread crumbs that you try to hide under your so called sauce.
