Pretty upset with this place, Been here twice and got the same result both times. Terrible service sushi & is not that great. I got AYCE, I didnt get half the stuff I ordered and since I was on my lunch break couldn't just sit around and wait all day for it. Had to ask for our drinks to be re-filled & ask her if she remember to put our order in after 45 minutes of nothing. The place wasn't even busy. I left un-happy, hungry, and $22 in the hole.
