I was immediately turned off when I pulled up in the parking lot which is located behind this restaurantit looks like they haven't sprayed down the sidewalk since the day they opened. The Sidewalk is dirty and all black and you can smell the garbage dumpster just around the cornerso I went inside anyways and couldn't believe how expensive their dishes are.  I settled for a LA cart bean and cheese burrito.  It was disappointing.  They didn't heat up my burrito all the waythe beans inside were barely warm.  Food overall was mediocre.  Free chips and salsa nothing to brag about.  Service was good. I definitely won't be coming back here.  They haven't justified their high prices to me especially with the nasty appearance on the outside of this place. This is an embarrassment to Scottsdale.
