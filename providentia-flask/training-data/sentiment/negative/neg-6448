My husband, son, and I went to this place for lunch last Saturday.  The decor is nice but that is about it.  The BBQ Sand that I ordered was bland cold and dry....my husband and son split a rack of ribs and they weren't anything special.  Way too pricey for the quality of food.  The server never came back to check on anything after she delivered our food.  The ice tea had a funky taste to it I sent it back for a soda instead.  Too bad this was our second time trying this place and were disappointed both times.  They already have menu items crossed off with a sharpie.  Won't be returning.
