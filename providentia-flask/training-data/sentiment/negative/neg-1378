Didn't end up eating here because the cashiers were sooooooo slow. 

Brother and I stood in line for 10 minutes with two other people in front of us. They had simple orders but cashiers were too busy chatting it up amongst themselves. Guys cooking burgers also looked dirty, gave my brother the 'let's leave' glance and never looked back.
