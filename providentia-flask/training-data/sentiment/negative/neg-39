My husband and I had eaten their food a couple of times and I stopped by one day on my way home to get some take-out for us.  I wasn't thrilled about the food in the past.  They really water/milk down their guacamole, sour cream, and their refried beans might as well be called soup.  I could rant for hours on why guacamole shouldn't have the consistency of milk but I won't.

The restaurant was filthy, tables were sticky, trash on the tables and floor.

The food did arrive quickly and I headed home.  

At home we both discover neither one of our dishes had guacamole (which the description said they should) and the sour cream isn't cream-like... it's more like half & half.   Ew.

We are both hungry though and begin knowing full well the food looks gross.  We eat our meals and my Carne Asade doesn't really taste like Carne Asade, it tastes like it was starting to turn and a bit Lamb-y, plus it is super dry.  Oh yeah and it's about 2 shades away from being black.  

And then I get a piece that tastes like Pine Sol.  Blech!  I spit it out and threw out the rest of my dish.  

Never, ever, going back.
