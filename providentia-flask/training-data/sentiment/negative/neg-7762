Bad service, bad food...too bad...was hopeful. To explain: Waiter didn't care, server didn't say a word, manager wasn't pleasant, all disappeared when we asked for assistance. Food was just awful. Salad was over dressed with no flavor cream dressing, the medium well steak was pastey, tasted like bad liver...etc. Talked with the food and beverage manager...he was pleasant and listened attentively. He said he would talk with staff at the restaurant and offered us a comp upon our future visit to the restaurant. No thanks! We do like the Cannery, and Victory's coffee shop isn't bad...but Waverley's is a no go!!!
