Do you know what diminishes a good meal, nice drinks and ok service?

A giant roach in the filthy bathrooms. 

And the fact the servers were indifferent about it also sucked. You're seriously telling me there was no manager on the floor? It's bad enough I have to have beer mansplained to me, but do your damn jobs. And that includes finding a fucking manager when you have an upset customer.

So yeah, I'd avoid this place, and probably the businesses on the same block (roaches travel!).
