My wife and I had a dinner on a Sunday night and I honestly wasn't that impressed. To me the prices here seemed pretty high for the amount of food you actually get. Example: the BBQ Combination Plate which had the BBQ Pork, Roast Duck and Chicken.  We were excited to order it but when we received it what a huge let down. 

The serving size was pretty small and for the price (I believe it was $16.99) you'd expect it to be much larger. As far as the actual taste.....Hell, I've had better Chinese BBQ at the 99 Ranch in Chino Hills here in Cali.

Also, it had to have the filthiest bathroom that I've seen in awhile which really made wonder about the cleanliness of the place overall. 

Overall an underwhelming experience I'd say don't waste your time here.
