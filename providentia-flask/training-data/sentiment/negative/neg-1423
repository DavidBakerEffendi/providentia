The food I ordered (Chicken Fajita) was nothing short of disgusting. What was really disturbing is the waitress actually originally gave me the wrong order & aggressively argued with me to accept the wrong food. Everyone else's food looked like it has just come from the nether region of a dumpster - if you're looking to eat, avoid this place at all costs.
