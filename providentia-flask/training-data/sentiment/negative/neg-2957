PSA: If you do not want to deliver to certain areas, do not take delivery orders in the first place only to take out your frustrations on unsuspecting customers! This creature processed my delivery order and 1 hour later, wanted me to come and meet him to get it. Imagine that. When I reminded him that I paid for delivery, first words out of his mouth when he came to my door were that he won't deliver again because I didn't want to come out and meet him etc etc and then added "I am the owner" before storming off, LOL. Well, hello to you too, Mr Rude-Arrogant. To make matters worse, the food was mediocre at best and very cold! He should have just kept the food and given me a refund. No, little man, there won't be another order from me. Thank you.
