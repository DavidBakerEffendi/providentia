God these guys are so rude. It's like, it's not enough you're overpriced- but basic phone and customer service manners are non-existent. 

Called them with a simple request after regretfully spending 1200 on a BBQ from these dbags and the hillbilly who answered the phone was next level rude- do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.
