Would give this place 0 stars if I could.  I was seated with my boyfriend at a table for two outside. After waiting for about 5 minutes, we received our menus. 10 minutes later, no one came to take out order. We watched the people who were seated ten minutes after us have their orders taken promptly. We watch servers come and go, we wait and wait until we decide to leave. No one says a word. 

It wasn't particularly busy. There were empt tables everywhere, and servers were everywhere. Just not at our table. We won't be coming back to a pub with such poor service.
