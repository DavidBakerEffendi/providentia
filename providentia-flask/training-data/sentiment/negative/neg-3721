We have been long time customers of this location. Original owners rocked. Today I can say I would never recommend anyone to this location again. We had a 2nd horrible experience last night and made a strong effort to let this store redeem itself. We ordered our two favorite pies last night. Family size pepperoni with extra cheese and a family size chicago style chicken bacon stuffed with no onions. We moved over the last few months to a home further away but felt we would continue to patronize this branch.  Long and the short of it...pizza number two was chock full of onions for the 2nd straight time. The last time this happened was on our previous visit and we just let it go. My wife at 8 months pregnant cant do onions so this time we called backed to explain.  Manager said they would replace the pie over the phone.  We wrapped up the uneaten pizza and rather than drive 10 miles back waited til this evening to return it. We were greeted with a new manger un familiar with our situation. To us it was a no brainer....here is an uneaten pizza being returned after being prepared wrong.  Just make us a new pie and move on. Instead....a call to the store owner was made and a half off coupon was offered. That was it. Final answer? Yes. That is all we can do was the response. Well....that 15.00 decision made at the upper level just cost this group not only our business for good but we will certainly share this experience with members of our neighborhood and church (the largest church in the area just around the corner from this establishment) Horrible experience. We even called them back after driving all the way home stunned by this business practice. Good riddance papa murphys. We will also be following up with a call to corporate.  Bad move and acutally bad pies now at this spot.
