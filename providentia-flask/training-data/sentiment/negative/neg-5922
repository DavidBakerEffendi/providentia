I'm pretty disappointed with Tsuki's. Lately I feel like the service has been getting worse. 

Started off ok but this year I find the service really lacking. Server rarely comes by after you order or asks if you need another drink/water. 

Last time I was here we ordered 2 items (the hot pot looking ones) and the server brought one of them. I waited for my food but the server couldn't be found. When the server finally stopped by, I asked for my food and she said she only ordered 1 thing to the kitchen. By the time my food came, my girlfriend was done eating so I was stuck eating my food while my girlfriend watched. No sorry. Nothing. 

THIS TIME, my girlfriend had made a reservation for 16 people 2 weeks in advance. We showed up and they looked at us like we were crazy when we said we had a reservation and tried to argue that we did not. We had an email confirmation. 

They tried to keep us and sat us at 2 booths against the wall... and some other friends at another table. They told us we needed to wait for other patrons to finish eating before we could have the long table. 

Ultimately we decided to leave. Trying to cram 16 people in booths meant for 6 people. 

Service is totally unacceptable.
