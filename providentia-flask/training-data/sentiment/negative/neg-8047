I was happy when they opened the Tolleson location, no need to drive into Phoenix , their food was great, not sure what happened , yet the past couple years their service has slowly declined and they raised their prices. Today was a what the hell moment, i ordered two green chili burritos, they tasted like dish soap, i couldn't even eat it, my dads California burrito was cold and the meat was tough, i took them back and the casher was happy to give me the money back, he barked at the cooks in how bad the food tasted and i could see them with a shitty grin, yucking it up. never again will i buy my food there.
