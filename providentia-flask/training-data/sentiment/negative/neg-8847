Pizza took forever to arrive, left apartment code at time of order but driver didn't have it so had to give him the code again and then meet him outside since he didn't know how to find our apartment. Once outside driver was very clearly high. Called main line to mention this and was laughed at over the phone and told "that's just how he is." Unacceptable service.
