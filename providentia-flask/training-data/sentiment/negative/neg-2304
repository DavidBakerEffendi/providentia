B-A-D. My wife and I were confused, because we researched restaurants online and saw multiple good reviews of The Standard.

The food was completely and totally mediocre. Fast food Italian. 

Plus, we were abandoned by our waiter. I had to ask someone else for pepper and cheese for my pasta, and I had to chase him down to settle our bill.
