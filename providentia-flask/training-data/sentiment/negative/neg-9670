Not impressed at all. Dirty restaurant and less than stellar food. Ordered the chips and queso and after complaining that it was cold, it came out cold again. We ordered the peppercorn bacon burger which was average; and I had the Marco Pollo chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese. The sandwich was bland and the Mac and cheese was cold and runny. I couldn't even eat it. At this point, we were over our meals and wasted 3/4 of each. The server either didn't care or didn't notice. He also forgot our box twice and a refill. For $50, this place was awful. Won't be back.
