Come on guys, we recently received a deliver menu for this location.  We called to place a take out order.  Many items are no longer offered, no Greek fries,  etc.  why send out a flyer that is not correct.  The sandwiches were all bread, I was very disappointed about the quality of food and menu.  We will not be going back!  Stay clear of this place.
