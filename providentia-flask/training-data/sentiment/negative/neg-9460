The first time I came to Everly the vegetable-centric dishes were well cooked and a refreshing delight. The second visit was a humongous disappointment, this place obviously has a major issue with consistency and I will not be able to visit ever again. The brussels sprouts were raw, the forbidden rice overcooked to an unrecognizable mush, the asian chicken salad laden with clumsy inedible thick slices of napa cabage spines, and the chicken overcooked and dry. The cherry on top was that our table was covered in a swarm of fruit flies and the occasional horse fly. Sanitation issue?
