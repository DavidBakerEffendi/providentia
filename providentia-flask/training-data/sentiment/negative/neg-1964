Omg! I ordered bangusilog, I was so hyped up food was looking really good!  As I was eating I can smell something awful ( like sardines not the milkfish we ordered ) so my friend told me. " hey Jen they didn't wash the utensils well, it has a nasty fishy smell" I was like " ewwwweww! Gross ! The utensils wasn't washed well or sanitized for that matter. Must have been hand  washed with other fishy stuff. Yuck! I was so disappointed. The young lady serving us is such a sweetheart. But this issue sure does have to be acknowledged by management.
