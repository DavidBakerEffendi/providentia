So my I brought my folks here for a post-Christmas dinner. I ordered my favorite pineapple rice. Not only did they make it spicy, I found a strand of hair! So the server made us a new one. But it was still spicy. I have brought my guests and friends here many times but this experience ruined it. Makes me wonder how sanitary they are in the kitchen.
