The coffee shop has an unacceptable and horrible customer service.

I placed an order for two coffees, but one of the cashiers gave me only one. I mentioned to her that I ordered two. Suddenly, the other cashier with glasses showed up and screamed "TWO!?TWO!?TWO!?"  She sounded as if I was lying. I showed her my receipt, and eventually the girl gave me one more coffee.

The coffee was really hot, so I asked them whether they got coffee sleeves or not.  The cashier with glasses started screaming and yelling again "She gave you one coffee already!  She gave you one coffee already!"  She kept shouting and then walked away.  What's wrong with her?  It looks like that she is trying to blame the customers for their mistakes.

She has an attitude problem, and should avoid trying to pick a fight with their customers.
