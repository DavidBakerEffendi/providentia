Terrible service at this place. We were staying at Encore. We went to have breakfast here and ordered food and coffee. The coffee arrived soon afterward. Thirty minutes later, as nothing else had arrived and my girlfriend was hungry, we asked if the bread basket we had ordered with our food could be brought right away. Ten minutes after that request, still nothing had arrived. My girlfriend got up and asked for the manager. When we complained, about 2 minutes later the bread arrived and about a minute or two later the food arrived but completely cold. We figured that the food had been sitting back there for some time before delivery and only our complaint had motivated them to actually look for our food and bring to our table. We sent the food back and left. A waste of 45 minutes. The place was not that busy either. We were disgusted with the service.
