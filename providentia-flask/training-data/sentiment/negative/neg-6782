If you see the red comments that state "closes in...." Go ahead and subtract 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR from that time, because the snobby staff behind the counter will already be counting their tips and cashing out. I simply asked "can I take away an order please?" And got a reply of "we are closed now." While watching several other customers eat. I won't be coming back here.
