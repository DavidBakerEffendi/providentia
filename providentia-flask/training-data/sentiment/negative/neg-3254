I sent this email to the store manager and never got a response. 

Good Morning, 
 I am writing to you our of great disappointment. Cantina 1511 has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte since it's opening. I have since moved out of town.l However last night I met and old friend at your Park Rd location and had some of the worst service I have experienced. Our server's name was Michelle, she had red hair. We arrived for our meal around 6:10 pm and were seated outside. Michelle stopped by the table and said she would be right with us - after five or so minutes she brought us our waters and we ordered some beers. It took 10 minutes for our beers to arrive and then she walked away to help another table before even offering to take our order. After an additional 10 minutes she did come back to take our orders. I got some vegetarian tacos (so not meat to cook) Queso, and my friend ordered the Crab and Goat Cheese Croquettes ( a simple fried appetizer). We proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our dinner while the three tables that were seated after us got their meals. When we inquired about our meal we were told and I quote: "The croquettes have mashed potatoes in them so that takes a long time." Seriously - they are fried. So we finally get our food, and my vegetarian tacos come with the charro beans that have meat in them - so I didn't eat them and I didn't bother saying anything because we had already been there for over an hour. Then after we ate we waited about 20 minute for our waitress to stop avoiding us and bring us the tab. She would look right at us, and then go stop at another table, my friend finally went inside to find her and asked her to please bring our check. So in total we were at your establishment for almost 2 hours. I try not to complain, but I am just so disappointed. I understand that you establishment was busy, but this was unacceptable service.
