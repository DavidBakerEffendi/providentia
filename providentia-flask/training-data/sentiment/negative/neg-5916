I've come here on and off over the past couple of years and all my times here, except for one, has been bad. My wife liked the place when we first moved out here and I had figured that ordering the more complex dishes was just a bad choice.  I was wrong. This review is for the last and final time i'm going in there. I should have turned back when there was only two tables filled for dinner on a Friday and a waiter lazily telling us to take a seat anywhere.

The bruschetta was so-so with the lack of flavor to the tomatoes and bread that reminds me of wonder bread. The salads came next and they were anemic. Two to three slices of tomato with iceberg and a heap of cheese does not a garden salad make. I had mine with blue cheese dressing that tasted more like ranch except for the two bits of cheese at the bottom of my bowl. My wife got the wrong dressing but ate it anyway.

For the actual dinner, I kept it simple with some manicotti while my wife got the spaghetti bolognese. Sadness followed. My manicotti was on the verge of ice cold when it came out and the bolognese was really oily. 

You'd think we'd stop here, but no! We continued to dessert despite my better judgement. The cannoli shell was good with the cream being so sweet it made me feel like I was drinking condensed milk. The tiramisu was passable until the final layer, which was swimming in liquor. 

Forty dollars and tip for a meal this bad is ridiculous! If you're in the shopping center, please go into tott's instead. The service is better, the food is better, and you won't freeze your ass off in there either.
