My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place and had been talking about it for days. We were sorely disappointed. The bubble tea was ok but everything else about our experience was dismal. The place is way too small and the layout confusing. There are way too many options. They're trying to do way too much. I got the General Tso's tofu rice dish. Tasted ok but so over sauced that I couldn't finish the rice. The other dish was a pork belly rice meal. The rice was dry and caked and we were very unpleasantly surprised by a huge chunk of what seems to be ginger disguised as pork. Not to mention it's expensive for what it is. I wouldn't have paid even half of the price of each dish for what I got. I will not be going back.
