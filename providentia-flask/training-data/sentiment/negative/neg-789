Been there several times. Last time I had worst experience ever.  Recommend it to several Friends.  We were group of 6 with 5 kids on a Sunday.  Very poor service.  Server drop allthe drinks over 3 year old kid.  Ice tees, lce water it was a mess.  The lady in charge change server with the excuse that this one is new and not experienced.  So the new server a girl messed the whole order.  Kids where waiting for food.  Me I never received one.  We were waiting on food around 1 hour.  So I decide to talk with manager on duty.  So guess what there was no manager on duty.  I was told"don't worry for today service we messed up but when you come next time we will hey you best server and a $50 off the total bill.  But today we can't do much.  So that was last time I went there.  Hope toy will not have same experience.  Food is good but service sucks.
