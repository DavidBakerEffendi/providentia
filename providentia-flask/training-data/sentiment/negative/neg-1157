a sign advertising low calories and/or carbohydrates?...pizza display behind glass...pick a slice for oven reheating...paying roughly $five per slice...reheated and ready...quite thin the crust and breading...thin layer of cheese hardened on...tasting bland...sparse sprinkling of toppings for a large slice of pie...make a pizza thin as possible with little topping as possible, but explain it's low calories and low carbs...umm..no..
