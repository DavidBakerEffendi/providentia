Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! The only reason I went here was because Miller's Ale House was packed for Monday Night Football. They seemed to have decent specials, but the worst service. 

We had a party of 8 and were drinking and ordering food in front of the big screen. We constantly had to wait forever for any food and drinks and had to get the terrible server numerous times. Food sucked and tasted like crap. The only good thing was the beer. 

Long after the game was over, we were waiting for our bill and to pay which literally took us getting the manager, who was just as slow. 

Good bye! This place is done and will not last long at all. STAY AWAY!!!
