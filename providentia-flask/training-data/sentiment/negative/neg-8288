Ack.  Avoid at all costs.   My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast/brunch while in Vegas and were appalled at the terrible service, mediocre food, and relatively high prices.  

The place wasn't terribly busy, but it took forever to get menus, forever to place our order, forever to get our food, and then forever to get the check (we actually never did get the check - we ended up just leaving enough money on the table).    

The waitress was rude, and acted like our requests for bread were unreasonable.  I realize its not her fault that it took close to an hour for the food to come out, but its also not crazy of us for wanting multiple bread baskets while we wait.   We were by far the youngest people in the place (we're in our early 20s...actually I guess I should say "mid-20s"...yikes!), were dressed fairly casually, and ordered relatively cheap things, and she gave us the distinct impression that we were too poor for her classy, classy establishment.    We stiffed her - one of the few times in my life I've ever done that, but the service was beyond terrible.

The food was not terrible, but not particularly good either.  I had a Belgian waffle and my boyfriend had some kind of burger.  They were both edible but completely unmemorable.   Also, thanks to the atrocious service they were cold by the time they reached us.

There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Vegas -- go elsewhere!
