Who knew that the people working here were paid to make fun of those who didn't speak french? 
I certainly didn't when I stopped in to order some food on a regular Friday night. 

To management: I hope you seriously take a look at who you hire in the future.  Even though I don't speak french, my friend certainly did, and didn't appreciate how your staff rudely made fun of me for not speaking it. They're paid to do their job, take orders, and make food, not give their opinions on their customers. 

To future customers: spend your money elsewhere unless you want to be rudely berated. An absolutely disgusting example of montreal customer service. 

So glad I didn't end up spending money here after they insulted me. I will never spend money at another amir restaurant ever again.
