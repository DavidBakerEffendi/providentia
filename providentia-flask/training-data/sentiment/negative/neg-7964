Would not come back here because the food is extremely bland and dry. Had the southwest chicken sandwich. The two "pieces" of bacon were bite size. The chicken was so dry it was hard to cut through and just not seasoned at all. Had a side of seasonal vegetables; this included broccoli, semi-steamed and again no seasoning. My suggestion is to use salt or other seasonings. Maybe add some chipotle to the southwest chicken sandwich.
