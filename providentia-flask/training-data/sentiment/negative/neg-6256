As much as I was excited about it because it was only $30 for brunch from the minute I entered the seating area I was disappointed . 

Firstly the people who are behind counters need to wear head caps I found a hair in my food . Secondly nothing was properly filled and it really wasn't tasty . To be fair I have to say buffets are never about taste. 

The sweetest were simple and nice . I think the desserts was the best part and that gets the one day star. Wouldn't go there again! Try Wynn buffet it million times better and not a stinky room .
