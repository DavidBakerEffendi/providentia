I hope your parchment paper is edible. I ordered a large poutine via delivery. As I was eating it  I realize I was chewing on parchment paper that was stuck on all the french fries. They must of overcooked it and got stuck on the paper. I had to completely throw it out. Maybe try using aluminum foil.
