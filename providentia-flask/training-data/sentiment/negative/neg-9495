Probably some of the worst service I have ever received. 

Stood in a long line (which was growing by the second) for 10-15 minutes, and there was no host/hostess in sight. No one was taking names or anything. Waiters and waitresses walked past us without a second glance. One couple decided to just sit themselves. I finally went up to a waitress and asked, "Do we have to stand in line or does someone take our names down..and she tells us she will put our names on the list (then doesn't ask for anyone else to be put on the list). We wait another 20-30 minutes and watch as others in line become frustrated and leave as they realize no one is attending to the line of hungry people. Basically you had to stand in line, to wave down a waitress and request to be put on a list.

We are finally seated and have our order taken (we request some waters and coffee). After 15 minutes we flag down the waitress and request our waters and coffee again--seems we had been forgotten, as others who arrived after us had already been served. 

I ordered the cheesecake crepe and it was disgustingly sweet with mounds of white chocolate chips and almost no marscapone cheese. 

Overall, there was no organization or customer service. Probably won't be back here again..
