Where do I begin...Waitress seats us a table with a dirty tablecloth.I ask for ask for a clean tablecloth and wipes the dirty one off. Iced tea was old and sour, salads came, no bread or ground pepper for 15 minutes 35 minutes later entrees show up.   my wifes meal was all wrong. Lasagna was filled with some form of ground meat. New owner came over, I told him he made an error buying into this faling dump.   Would not eat here again in you paid me
