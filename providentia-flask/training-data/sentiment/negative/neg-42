Don't ever make a reservation at this restaurant! We made a reservation and they seated us and then told us we had to get up because they sat the wrong table. We had been seated for about 15 mins and they rudely told us we had to get back up and go wait again in near the door. Nobody apologized or offered any sort of empathy for what had happened. Everyone waiting for a table was appalled by this behavior. No manager apologized and nobody working cared. We walked out and they didn't even care. Do not make a reservation here if you don't want to wait and be treated terribly.
