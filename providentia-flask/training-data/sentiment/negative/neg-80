Ordered takeout from here and waited 30 minutes on my order because they "RAN OUT OF RICE".

Just came back from a event and I was super hungry. Parked my car near Yonge and Dundas, ran into basil box to grab some takeout quickly. If you know about parking at Yonge and Dundas, you will understand the extreme frustration following the remainder of my experience as described below.

After I order 2 basil box takeout, I asked the employee how long it would be. She said 5 minutes. After 5 minutes have passed, I asked her if it's almost done, she said they ran out of rice !!! Asian fast food restaurant not having rice/running out of rice. This must the top joke of 2017. 

I had already paid, I was hungry, worried about the parking meter and was informed that it will be 10 minutes until more rice is cooked.

At this point I ran back to my car to put more money in the parking meter. Ran back into basil box again to see if my takeout is ready. 30 minutes have passed and my food is finally done. 

One of the worst experiences at a takeout joint. Probably would not be coming back. 

Furthermore, the employees inside looks like they're 18 years old who couldn't care more about their job. That's probably why they didn't notice they didn't have rice until they ran out.

Imagine going to Starbucks and they tell you they ran out of coffee beans.

Very unprofessional and terrible experience. I hope they improve their service here.
