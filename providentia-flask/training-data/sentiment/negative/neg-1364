We've been to Maxwell's quite a few times and always loved it, great food and good service. It's kind of a 'go to place' where we always knew it would be good. Last nite was not. In the past, the bartender was more than happy to allow us to sample a beer before ordering it.. until last night. We were told they do not offer sample because they have beer flights.. unless this is something new, I have never seen beer flights on the menu and have never been anywhere that refused a tasting (especially when they would make more money off of us once we taste and then order it)  We had already orders our apps but at that second we decided to close our tab and we wont be back. Not happy customers at all..
