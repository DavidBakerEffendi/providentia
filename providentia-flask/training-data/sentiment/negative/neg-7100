Crap. I had a simple two poached eggs with sausage hash browns and avocado. The eggs were inedible, they used so much vinegar when poaching them that they were sour, gummy, and left a film on my teeth. The "secret" to poached eggs is actually just using fresh eggs, you dont even need vinegar and if you do use it, it's just a smidge, they shouldn't taste like vinegar. The hash browns which I swear had a (v) on the menu were actually a blob of fried and congealed cheese with some shoestring potatoes in there. I'm not vegan but I don't eat dairy so I was unpleasantly surprised when I got my food. My husband got the bacon skillet which was not as scary as my order but very greasy and although he could typically eat like a horse he picked around and left half which says something. Place was slow when we were there and the waitress was very nice and only charged me for the avocado which is all I wound up eating.
