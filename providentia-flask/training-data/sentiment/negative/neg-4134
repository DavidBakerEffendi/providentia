I had one of the worst experience here. Not only did the food suck. But the customer service was awful as well. Slow. Very slow. Our server was very rude. I went to use a gift card and she told me the systems didn't take gift cards.  What do you mean? She didn't give me a response and just said the hostess up front should have told me that. Well, she didn't so now what? I ended up paying the bill with my own money when the gift card would have covered the bill. Definitely won't be eating at Chili's for a very long time. I see why you guys have a 2 and half star rating. Take your money somewhere else people!!
