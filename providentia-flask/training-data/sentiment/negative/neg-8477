We went there to try all you can eat pasta for $6.99. It was 90% full and we had to wait 45 minutes to get our food!  What's worse,  they messed up my wife's order... 3 TIMES! When I got my dinner,  I ordered garlic and oil sauce. There was only one problem,  No garlic and all oil.  We just put some cash on the table to cover the bill and walked out.  We'll never go back there again!
