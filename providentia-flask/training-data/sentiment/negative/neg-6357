The sole reason for us dining at this restaurant was for the French toast stuffed with cream cheese and fresh strawberries featured in the online menu, but we were told by the waitress that it had been discontinued.  Ms. Westie ordered hot cakes with whipped cream and strawberries which proved to be both overcooked and grossly over priced. I ordered eggs Florentine - poached eggs with spinach over an English muffin and topped with Hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were very close to being hard boiled, the previously frozen spinach was stringy, Hollandaise sauce too heavy on the lemon and the English muffin not sufficiently toasted.  Otherwise our meals were perfect.
