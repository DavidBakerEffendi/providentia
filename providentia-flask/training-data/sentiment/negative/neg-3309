Love the sauce at Fazolis.  Two days ago my grandson and I went fir spaghetti.  We ordered our food and were going to fir down and every dingle tabke in the place had dirty dishes on it.  We had to remove them and wipe our table off with wet napkins.  How disgusting.  When wd finally got our food,  it was luke warm at most.  What has happened to that place.   It won't be open long if that's the way they are going to run it.  I had to go up and ask for breadsticks.  Gal hesitated before giving me some.   Yikes....do i want to go back....ummm maybe i can find a another place with good sphagetti!@    that place is disgusting.
