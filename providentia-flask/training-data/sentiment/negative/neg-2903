Put in for pick up at 530, come at 545 still wait 10 minutes for my order to come out.  
Get home just to find out they Forget to put to items in the bag.  I head back, and I wait another 12 minutes for the remaining items.  While waiting another party came in who was missing take out items. 
While the food is good, with 4 people working and only one table occupied, they need to get it together.  I have no time or patience for people who cannot do their job correctly.  There are other places in town that have employees that can read a receipt and put food in a bag.  Go elsewhere.
