First time here!! A little bit of food, dry rice not much flavor to the food , and 28$ plus tip. I just ordered for pick up and wasn't expecting it to be 28$ for only one person meal. I feel like I was over charged but oh well wanted to give it a try. Got home and it was a small plate of food. Dry rice and not much flavor. I won't be going again.
