used to be one of our top picks for Chinese food in the area .. that was until they remodeled .. what happened. they no longer give the "shrimp chips" w/an order of soup .. the soup was not the same as it used to be .. tasteless .. w/out any seasoning .. no more pork strips in the won ton soup & the dumplings were tough & obviously had been frozen .. the fried rice that comes w/a meal is no longer plentiful & tasty .. no veggies in it & also w/out any seasoning .. it is literally fried rice & that is it .. I will wait a few months & try again but if things have not changed for the better we will look elsewhere for future Chinese cuisine experiences in the area
