First time writing a negative review ever!
I've worked and eaten in restos all my life. I have a pretty long fuse and have never had any problems. These guys need a crash course in how to run a business. I called to place an order for a small cheese pizza which I was gonna pick up myself. Fairly simple right??! I got there, payed, and took my order home. Once home I noticed there was a mistake in the order. They gave me a focaccia instead. It's ok, no problem, everyone makes mistakes. It's what happened when I called them back to notify them that I was totally repulsed. The girl that takes the orders completely apologized and admitted several times that it was her mistake and she's sorry. Tells me that they can't do anything about it though! Says that she spoke with owner and he said they would charge me again!! Seriously??! They admit it's there mistake, yet try to milk me out of another order again! Wow, very professional! No accountability once so ever. Will never give them one of my hard earned dollars again. There's many respectable pizzerias in the area with proper management. I don't think I asked for anything extravagant..just wanted what I ordered. Get your acts together. You could have rectified the situation very very easily, but I guess you're just thinking of the short term. You guys skinned the sheep in one shot, but will not shave it everyday like a proper business should.
