This deal taco is horrible...waited at the speaker for 5min before someone even said hello, then waited another 10-15min at the drive through window. The "cashier" as she claims although her tag says manager, gave me three orders of chili cheese fries at the 5min wait then the rest of the food at the 10min time mark..got home all the food was cold and, fries seemed
To be cooked multiple times. I called the store and the "cashier" tried blaming the cook for being new however she was just standing their the entire time
Not even helping him. She gave me attitude when asking for a manager, apparently there's no managers at night shift? Left my name and my number for GM to call back.
