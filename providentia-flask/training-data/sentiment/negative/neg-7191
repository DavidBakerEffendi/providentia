Was excited to come with a group of friends after we worked out. Got there 20 minutes before close, all chairs were on the tables. There were 3 workers there and NO ONE acknowledged us. So we naturally asked if they were still open. No response... asked again and their response "I guess" with an attitude like we do not want you here. NEVER trying this place and McDonald's gives me better service. I would suggest going to greens and proteins. Much better service!!! FYI owner/manager 2/22/17 on 7:39Pm!
