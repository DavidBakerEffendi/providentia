I recently had an experience with chow time tonight , to say the least it was absolutely a trainwreck . I ordered 2 items and waited over an hour to not even receive our food . In between waiting for our food , atleast 3 separate orders that were ordered after mine were delivered , without a trace of my order in sight. He forgot our order .  I went outside of tenaya creek to check on my order and the man handed me two old chili cheese french fries loaded with jalapenos. ~That was not my order.   I proceeded to tell him that was not my order. I got a brief slam of the food truck window and the man said  " ill bring your food to you when it's f***ing ready ".  

What a horrible food experience . Thankfully I got my refund and The man said " that isn't going to make or break my night ." Ok you won't have my business or any of my friends that frequently visit tenaya creek brewery anymore . Do not recommend .
