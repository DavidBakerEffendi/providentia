Unfortunately, there is no 0 star option.
I had to write this review quickly in case I die of e-coli. 

The ONLY item I had that did not cause me to gag was the inari sushi (fried bean curd shell stuffed with rice).
The bowl I ordered was absolutely the worst I have EVER had. EVER.
The California rolls despicable.

The meat was dry. No hint a moisture or flavor. Based on the flavor, I wonder if it was even chicken. Seriously, it sucked the moisture out of my mouth when I "tried" to eat it.
The vegetables had flavor, but not a good flavor. Spoiled cabbage comes to mind. I think they cooked it last week. Out of $20 of food I at the Inari and tossed everything else.(Almost "tossed" what I did eat.

The california rolls must have been made three days ago. The rice had dried out into a solid clump of gross surrounding some rotting celery, dry artificial crab meat and avocado wrapped is smelly nori. 

Shame shame shame shame on Kyoto Bowl!!!!

Oh, it was VERY clean in the lobby...because NO-ONE comes in to mess it up.

Ef this place!
