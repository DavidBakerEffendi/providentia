Bartenders have no idea what bears they have or what those beers are.  This matters because it is craft week.  I am not a beer snob so I need to know what is out there and not just a name.  Beer names are terrible, they tell you almost nothing about the product.

If you are drinking mass produced beers then go at it.  If you want to try something new then you are on your own.  Go to flying saucer or Taco Mac instead, you will get far better bar tenders.
