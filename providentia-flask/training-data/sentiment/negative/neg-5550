This is fake Indian food. I was very disappointed after the first bite. It has no flavor at all. I ordered the butter chicken and it was completely tasteless. It was like orange food color mixed in with chicken on rice. I ordered the combo 1 and it came with potatoe and salad. The potatoe was tasteless too. This is rare. Usually potatoe should have potatoe taste. Maybe they cooked it too long. The salad was the only thing with flavor because it was drenched in dressing. 

So disappointed. I will and not recommend anyone to go back there.
