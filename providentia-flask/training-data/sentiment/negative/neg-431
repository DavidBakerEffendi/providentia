Ate here once when it opened almost 3 years ago, was a horrible experience so I did not eat at any ESM since then. Recently decided to give them a try again since it had been a few years and they were running some great promos in the mail, so I tried to order dinner online. Key word being TRIED, from a store located 5 mins down the road from my house. Got the error message saying no ESM exists near my house. Errrmm...ya it does - 5 mins by car exactly according to Google maps. 10 mins by bicycle.

They could send someone on a bicycle to deliver my food if they wanted to. But alas, this muilt-billion dollar behemoth can't even get a simple website right, so I'm safe to assume the food is still gross and disgusting. Lots of other delivery options right down the street, do yourself and your family a favor and just order from there as these fools simply have not earned your business and will only disappoint should you mistakenly give it to them.
