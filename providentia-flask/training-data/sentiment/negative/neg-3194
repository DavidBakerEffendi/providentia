The overall atmosphere was awesome, everyone was laid back and kind. The waitress we had was good to get our drinks and our order, after that, she came by once. I got salmon with mashed potatoes and shrimp with a side of spinach and broccoli. The ONLY good tasting thing on my entire plate was the broccoli.... the salmon was tough and dry. The mashed potatoes looked amazing but sadly tasted like stale water with a touch of salt. I was pretty disappointed with my food. It's the first time I haven't liked their food. After, we asked the waitress for a dessert menu, she tried just telling us what there was but we wanted to look at our options and take our time. When she was done telling us our options we still asked for a menu to which we got a huge eye roll! She avoided us after that and never came back. I probably won't be visiting this location ever again.
