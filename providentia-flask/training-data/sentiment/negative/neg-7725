After reading many of the reviews, I certainly feel validated.  I have visited JC a few times - usually when taking my mom out to breakfast or lunch. We originally tried it because they are owned/operated by the same company as Sedona - and my mom is a local. 
 
The last time was just plainly ridiculous. JOHN Cutter has an identity problem.  It is a neighborhood bar/restaurant that wants to be a HOOTERS. 

Most of the food is ok (good french toast).   It is the service and atmosphere where John Cutter fails. The bar is too dark and the music is too loud for breakfast or lunch.  To see a family with a bunch of kids or a group of lady golfers come in and then be served by empty headed young women with their breasts literally falling out of their shirts is just embarrassing. 

The worst part is that either management has not defined customer service parameters - or worse, they know what is going on and are ok with it. Fail.  I think that Bill W. is correct.

It is a drag because the area could use an actual neighborhood bar/restaurant with good food and suited for everyone. I have no reason to return.
