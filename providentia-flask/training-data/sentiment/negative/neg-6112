I picked up pizza for my family, but with Celiac Disease, I can not eat gluten. Some Pizza Hut locations have gluten-free pizza (none nearby), so I asked the manager if this location could please have gluten free. He told me that it's all in my head. He has NEVER felt the excruciating pain of gluten on a gluten intolerant system and I have NEVER been so insulted by customer "service." What an ignorant tool. I'll never order here again.
