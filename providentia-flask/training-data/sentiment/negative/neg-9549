Extremely disappointing dining experience. We booked a dinner for 8 and multiple meals were sent back due to errors and substitutions that we did not agreed upon. Even worse, the chicken was raw inside! How does this even happen at what is supposedly a fine dining restaurant. The wait staff were extremely friendly, but are let down by the cooking staff.

Had a billing issue after everything that happened and dealt with the extremely ride owner.

I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone, there are much better options in the immediate area.
