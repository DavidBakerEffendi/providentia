The remodeling job was excellent, you definately could not tell what it was previously and there were no reminders of zink... that was about it. We went close to their grand opening so it was overly packed... we sat near the bar and had people around us all the time, leaning on our chairs, squeezing by, kids running around the table... we forgave all that since they are new but the food was extremely disappointing. I ordered something that reminded me of Lean Cuisine's Chiken Enchalada Sauza... sadly the LC version is much better than what I received. Hardly any chicken, the chicken had ZERO flavor and NO seasoning.. the sauce was ok.. but that was my entire dish... the hand made tortillas were the main part of the dish... fBF had some massive combo plate... it was basically different meats/lots of cheese/tortillas smothered in sauces.. he said it was ok. We both decided that was our first and last visit. Our impression is if you have kids and want to go out someplace they enjoy and eat the food, this is your place. If you want good tex-mex and to enjoy a meal, this isnot.
