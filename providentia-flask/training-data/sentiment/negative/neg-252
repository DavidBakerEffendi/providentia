I recently signed up to be a part of The Habit Burger Grill's mailing list to receive coupons and promotions.  My first coupon after signing up was for a Charbroiled Burger W/ Cheese.  I stopped in for lunch to redeem my coupon.  When I walked into the restaurant around 1:30ish I noticed there was a lot of little pieces of paper on the floor, crumbs, and unclean tables.  It wasn't filthy but it wasn't the cleanest for sure.  When it was my turn to order, I stepped up to the register and notice how FILTHY the kitchen/grill area was.  It was a mess!  Fries all over the floor, old napkins, I noticed the top of a hamburger bun on the floor.  A worker was sweeping up around the grill while I ordered.  I thought that was gross.  There wasn't a line or anything and only 3 other people dining inside of the restaurant.  I don't understand why they wouldn't just wait until no one's around to clean up around the grill.  It was gross. 

My burger came shortly after I ordered it.  I ordered it as is but added mustard.  I decided to eat in my car because of the obvious reasons.  When I took the burger out of the wrapping it was full of grease.  That's weird to me because I don't expect a Charbroiled burger to be full of grease. I took 3 bites and tossed the rest in the trash.  The worse thing is when I got back to my desk my fingers smelled horrible.  Like I ate or touched something bad.  They smelled like old grease and burnt plastic.  It was weird.  I won't return to this location because I'm nervous of the conditions.
