I do not understand why this place has 4/5 stars. I could have gone to Roberto's and had better food. My party ordered chili relleno plate, huevos rancheros plate, chicken tamale, and cheese enchilada. This was possibly the blandest and worst mexican food I ever had. Also, to think about the fact that our food came out literally within 10 minutes was crazy. That really says how "fresh" or "homemade" the food was. Ugh, never again.
