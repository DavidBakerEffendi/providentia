Went to see a dance event and as if our seats weren't bad enough, the waiter kept walking in front of us, over and over. I understand that the bar was next to us, but there were other ways to get there without blocking our view every few minutes, and a few times he was just walking around looking lost. 

Finally came time to get our cheques. Wasn't impressed to see they had included the tip price on the receipt. and to follow that up when I paid in change/cash for my few drinks the waiter comes back and tells me I'm $0.75 short.I told him no I'm not it's a tip plus, I paid almost $0.10 extra. counted it a few times before ever giving him the money. He stood at the table and didn't leave, he looked confused, and was expecting me to pull 75 cents out of thin air. Someone at my table gave him 75 cents and he left. 

He then took forever with getting change for just 1 person at our table. Waiter just disappeared into the back again just like he did earlier in the night when he asked for ID and didn't seem like he knew how to determine if it was good or not, and fled with it to the back, and came back a bit later. 

Do not recommend this place based on this night alone. 
Had no interaction with any other server, although the manager kept standing in peoples way while admiring the show and watching his employees.
