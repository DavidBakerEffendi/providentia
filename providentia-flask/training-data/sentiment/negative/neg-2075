My 1st order was great-Italian Sub, hot, fast, fresh & as ordered. My 2nd order was far from fast-The Original was gross-sub was cold, meat gristly, nasty cheese & not as ordered. And I didn't get my cookie bite . The restaurant closed prior to Eat24 being able to respond to replacing the order. Being at the hospital with my husband the situation left me tossing it, settling on broth & jello from the sweet nurses and nearly 2hrs of wasted time. They are refunding the order, but it was such a poor experience I will not be ordering again & will be revoking my recommendation.
