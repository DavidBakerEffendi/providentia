I went here last night and as soon as we walked in the hostess said "we close at 10" well that's nice since it is only 9 ...

The restaurant only had a few tables at the time and the staff weren't doing anything, just socializing with each other...

We waited and waited after 10 minutes of not being offered a water we decided to leave, that's when the waitress finally decided to come and she asked us " are you guys okay" as we were leaving.

When we left we told the hostess " I guess you are already closed"

Overall I find this place overpriced and it's just okay, not amazing but not bad for the most part...

I won't be going back for a long time
