Maybe this is more of a dinner spot but I'm never coming back here for brunch and I would actually like (and deserve) most of my $35 (for two) back from our Saturday brunch this week.  

To quote the eloquent Lauren M... W-T-F!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The good:
- the space is nice
- The menu is very clearly labeled with vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options
- The beer options looked okay 

The bad:
- The service was very laissez-faire and I felt like the wait staff hated us from the moment we walked in.  Hey, sorry to ruin your morning by being a customer during your open hours... my bad?
- The restrooms were not clean and did not have soap
- Our food took.... over 30 mins to arrive, but less than 40 mins.  There were 3 or 4 other occupied tables.  We ordered standard brunch fare - bacon & eggs and french toast. I definitely could have whipped this up faster at home.
- They brought me the wrong eggs.  This was quickly remedied and not a big deal but other reviews have also noted that they aren't 100% with the ticket accuracy. The eggs were cooked nicely - sincerely - but it would have been nice to have all my hot food come out at the same time.

- The french toast... holy shit I am about to go on a rant here.  Forgive my creative list spacing but this deserves it's own review and I want to be sure to draw your attention to this epic ripoff of a dish.

--The french toast is 2 pieces of chemical bread of some sort (Dempsters, wonderbread... I don't know, you pick) breaded and fried (and takes 35m to make apparently). Like gross-ass 1cm thin bread.
--That's it. It is $8. it comes with nothing else.  (for comparison: the french toast at Sadies that comes with fruit and hashbrowns and 3 large pieces of beautiful french crusty bread... and is also vegan and the same price).
--To add toppings (seems like they have a topping-du-jour) it's an additional cost.  
--REAL maple syrup is available... AT AN ADDITIONAL COST. 
--Seriously, the markup on the "french toast" piece of shit that was served for $10 has to be like a thousand percent; 2 pieces of chemical bread... ~25c. batter... let's just say 50c because it's a vegan batter and I'm sure they would argue it's very pricey.  Around 75c.  At 8$ for a 75c item, even including labour, don't you think it should come with some fruit and hashbrowns and syrup? I was so offended when they put this down in front of the person I was with. I wanted to leave. 
--I wish I had taken a photo of this because it was so awful. I can't believe they could even deliver this to the table with a straight face.
--SURPRISE! It wasn't good.

- it's cash only and they have a "I get part of this fee, hahaha" gypsy bank machine prominently displayed for your convenience.

In summary, this is one of the most terrible executions (food wise) of a great idea that I was excited about that has had the misfortune of disappointing me in a long time.  The food was not good, the service was not good and it was expensive as all hell for one of the worst cumulative brunch experiences I have had in Toronto.

I hope someone else buys this business, fires these jokers and them starts pumping out some good food from the kitchen.  ONLY then would I even CONSIDER returning.

WHERE SHOULD YOU GO INSTEAD: Easy (right around the corner) for brunch and there are SO many other dinner options I won't bore you with the list.
