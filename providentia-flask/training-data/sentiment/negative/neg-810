Went to this restaurant for Dim Sum.  Asked for chrysanthemum tea...  

food was cheap and tastes cheap.  At the end, just before we left, i poured myself last cup of tea and noticed bunch of bugs came out...YUCK!  That means the whole pot of tea that we drank had bugs steeping in there.  (pictures attached).

Complained about the tea to the server, but when the bill came, they still billed us $2.80 for the tea....WTF!!!

I don't mind paying for the food, but I refused to pay $2.80 for the tea...DISGUSTING!
