The seafood soon tofu was a joke. If they don't want to put seafood in there then don't call it seafood. The pot came with tofu, two teeny tiny shrimps that doesn't not have any meat, one mussel, and one ultra tiny oyster in the size of a nail of a lady's last finger. The cost of this pot is probably less than $1 and they charge $8.99.
