The food here is okay. We like it, especially the dessert. They have a great variety of dessert, with some chocolate-covered marshmallow pops.

HOWEVER, my girlfriend and I care about customer service a lot. I've been in the retail industry for 10+ years, and my girlfriend's majoring in hospitality. Our server...well, he might be a great server to some other tables. But to us, he's certainly one of the worst! His name is Luis. You're lucky if you're a Caucasian. If you're not, you're out of luck. (We're Asians by the way) We saw him asking other tables if they were doing okay, and kept giving refills without them asking, and with a smile on his face. What about us? We were NEVER asked how we were doing. We NEVER got refills without asking. We waited for a while on purpose, wanting to see if he'd give us refills. NOOOO... He'd be holding a bottle of champagne, walking by, without looking at us at all. Finally I couldn't hold it anymore. I said "excuse me" out loud, and he gave us refills. But he had this really bad I-don't-wanna-serve-you look on his face. My girlfriend asked for some coffee. He didn't respond to that at all!!!! He did bring it out, but he never said thank you or you're welcome to us! NEVER!

Servers earn most of their money from tips. How can you give such poor service?! Well, we got some changes when we were coming in...there goes your tips, Luis!
