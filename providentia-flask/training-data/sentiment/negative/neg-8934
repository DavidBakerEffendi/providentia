I made up my mind not to return to this one, but I was on my way home last night and I went to this one because it was closer to me.  Well I really shouldn't have, the experience that I had a few days before this one can't compare to what I experienced last night.  I went in around 8:30 or so ordered my food, the guy who was operating the cash register wasn't paying attention him and the one that was actually making the sandwiches were busy playing name that tune from the loud music playing and reliving their dreams of playing in the NBA with shooting baskets in the trash can with paper.  Everything I ordered I didn't get, I clearly didn't ask for a cookie, and guess what I was charged for it when I realized that I let the guy no and he was like well ok never said well let me take care of that charge for you or anything.  So the one making the food said well ma'am I will give you what you asked for and the cookie to, I said sure what ever.  Being that you can't actually see them make your food you really don't realize what's going on, and you can't see the receipt until you get your food by then you are out the door and that's it.  Well I got home ready to eat because I was starving and I got a breadless sandwich.  Exciting I know, but if I wanted a salad I would have ordered one and being that salads aren't a part of their menu well then guess what that's not what I ordered.  I was really upset being that they really wasn't paying attention to me and now I'm super hunger and they were closed by the time I got home.  So I did complain to the company and I got an apology and that was about it.  Not a oh we are so sorry ma'am bring that food back and we will replace it or give you your money back nothing like that.  So I gave it a 1 star because you can't go any lower than that.  Believe it or not I really do like the food, but customer service should be just as great.  I will not go back. The customer service from the store and the appropiate people to get in contact with stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!
