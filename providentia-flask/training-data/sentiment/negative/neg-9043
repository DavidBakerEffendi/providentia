The worst customer service ever. Called mgr Taneisha she assured me my pizza was on the way waited an extra 40 mins before it got here. Then it got here and it was the wrong pizza. Called the store back was placed on hold for 15 minutes and then all of a sudden she was no longer there. This is UNACCEPTABLE. Better management is needed. SAD!!!!!
