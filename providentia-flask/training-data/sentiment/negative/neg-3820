My husband is out to try all the burger places in Vegas & this one left us dissatisfied.  The burger bun was awful.  Fell apart while trying to eat it & our fries/rings combo came out 5 minutes AFTER the burgers even though there was only one other group in the place & their order was on their table already.  The rings are great though & they have a nice selection of toppings but those things are NOT enough to get us back to the restaurant.
