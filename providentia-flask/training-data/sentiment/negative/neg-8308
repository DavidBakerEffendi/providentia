The food looks amazing, however we didn't get to try it. We came in sat down, then watch other people get acknowledged while the server ignored us. We went to the counter; thinking we would skip the food and just get coffee, only to be told that he was "too busy" to help us. That "someone" would be right with us.... we sat, we waited, server buzzed by once...twice... NO EYE CONTACT. No, "sorry folks, I will be right with you" when I did flag down the server, we were told, AGAIN, that we would just have to wait. Then we left. Friday night. Pretty Sad.
