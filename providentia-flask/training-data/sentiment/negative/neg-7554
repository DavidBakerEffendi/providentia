Decided to try this place one more time, after my first two, times there. Well third time is a charm. I ordered the easiest thing to make. Chicken, fried rice.  When I got it home it, was pork fried rice with added  over cooked chicken. And the rice was from an earlier order. they had made cause it was cold.
Oh did, I mention I don't eat pork our red meat. So how did I place the wrong order?

They made me another order and it was, fresh but tasted like ughhh.
Ive tried all the, places, from priest to mill on university for Chinese. I, would avoid them all..not worth the cash wasted. The frozen chinese at walmart is better than this stuff. Buyer Beware
