You might as well rename the restaurant Denny's because that is the quality of food you will get here. I was super disappointed in the whole experience. The wait staff was unfriendly and just didn't want to be there. Our sons food came out first and then 20 mins later ours arrived. We ordered simple meals. Scrambled eggs, French toast and hash browns. The scrambled eggs tasted like they came from a box and if you could make oil crunchy, that would describe their hash browns. Although we did have some entertainment while we waited, the table in the center of the restaurant was drawing up their needles and injecting themselves with which I assume was insulin right at the table. Classy place!
