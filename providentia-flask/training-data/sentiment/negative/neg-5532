Pretty disappointing. While our server was very well versed in the menu options, all I wanted was a pancake and a couple eggs. Options included protein, fruit, potatoes and what seemed to be a host of other decisions that frankly took away the joy of having breakfast. 

But so did waiting for what seemed like 20 minutes to get pancakes and eggs. When it did finally arrive, the portions were shameful.  One order of pancakes with berries came and there were 4 or 5 large pancakes on the plate. My order was 2 pancakes plus a skewer of fruit that should have been cut down to size prior to be served. It really was insane since we could have shared an order of pancakes and we still would have been unable to finish them all!  

Our server was really on top of providing anything she could to make the meal pleasant but it wasn't her fault that it took so long. It might make some sense if there was anyone else in the restaurant but it was sparsely populated. 

Finally, the pancakes had no taste which might be why they suggest you doctor their cakes with different toppings. This was a bust of a meal when it should be the easiest, tastiest and most reasonable breakfast possible. Big disappointment and wasteful too. Too many other options in the breakfast space.
