This place was such a disappointment! I love coffee shops. I love the warmth, the service, seeing a variety of drinks...coffee shops are one of my happy places & this was quite the opposite. 

First off, the customer service was terrible. The young man that took our order & made our drinks sounded like he was forced to be there, rather than enjoying his job. I said it was our first time there & he made no suggestions. I tried ordering some pastries but all he said was "we're out", no sorry or other suggestion as to what else I may like. The store lost money because after that I decided to get food elsewhere & just order drinks. 

The drinks we did order were a green tea lemonade slush & an iced chai. The slush was okay. Not great but not bad by any means. Just not something I'd order again. Their chai was where I was most let down. I personally base a good coffee shop off their chai & their chai gets 0 stars from me. The entire cup was filled to the top with ice, so I barely had any drink to drink. Also, their chai doesn't even taste like chai. It literally tastes like a watered down horchata. If I wanted horchata I would spend 1/4 of the money & get a horchata from Roberto's. 

Lastly, the rude barista never replied when I said thank you for either of the drinks & my boyfriend made a point to say bye & thank you as we left. To no surprise the barista had nothing to say in response. I would never go back here again & I know a lot of people that go to Downtown Summerlin & I will go out of my way to make sure no one wastes their money here.
