I know that the Olive Garden is not real Italian food, but every once in a while the breadsticks and salad of the Olive Garden strike a craving in me. Dad and I decided to head down for lunch, and it wound up being a mistake.

The restaurant was surprisingly uncrowded so we had a seat right away. The waiter came up after a few minutes and asked us for our drink order. He offered us an option to purchase wine, and when we both asked for water, his completely friendly demeanor vanished...as did he! He came back with our water and breadsticks, took our food order, and we only saw him one time again before he brought the check.

Another waitress brough the soup and salad. The soup, Minestrone, was not too great...Campbell's would have been better. The salad was excellent as usual, though. We ran out of breadsticks pretty quick as we waited for our entrees, which was a LONG wait. We managed to catch our waiter one time and asked for more breadsticks...and he brought us a basket containing TWO breadsticks and dissapeared again.

The waitress brought out Chicken Parmesan for me, and Spaghetti with Meat Sauce for dad. My Chicken Parmesan was pretty terrible...and came with a side of approximately 20 rigatoni noodles. There were so few it was possible to easily count them! Dad said the Spaghetti was nothing to write home about either.

The waiter re-appeared with our check sometime after the meal, and he was suddenly friendly with us again. It really didn't help his cause, he still got a crappy tip for crappy service. 

All in all, I believe that taking a trip to any number of Las Vegas' local-bred Italian restaurants is a better investment if you're looking for some good Italian food. If you're hankering THAT much to go to a chain restaurant, Carrabba's and even Fazoli's can provide you with better fare than this place.
