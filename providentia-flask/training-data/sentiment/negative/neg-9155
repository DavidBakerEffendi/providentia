It is so unfortunate that the only vegan restaurant in Calgary provides such a negative dining experience.  Right from the moment I called to reserve a table for our family, I should have known it was going to be a HUGE let down.  The owner was so rude on the phone.  I've read the other reviews and they all speak about poor service, I agree completely.  I have eaten at the Gratitude Cafe on several occasions, but only go back because I'm vegan and there are no other options in Calgary, except the Coup... which I LOVE.  The owner clearly doesn't like people, so don't go into the restaurant business! The only people out the the table of 8, that enjoyed their food were those who ordered the french toast.  It is delicious, but for $18, it better be.  And, do ask for maple syrup, they'll charge you extra.  Their prices are inflated as if it was a high class restaurant, but they treat their customers like an annoyance.  My niece did not like her lunch (it was awful) and so we told the owner who responded back with a sarcastic response and walked away.  When the owner came to take away the plates, most of the plates were full of food as no one enjoyed their meal, she berated us for wasting the food!! When it was time to pay the bill they refused to print off a receipt.  REALLY???  I've owned a restaurant in the past and you have to supply an itemized receipt if the customer wants one.  My mother wanted to take her left over french toast home with her and the waitress just tossed a tiny plastic at her (clearly too small to hold the amount of french toast we wanted to bring home)
Gratitude Cafe ... I'm completely NOT grateful for my Mothers Day Brunch.
