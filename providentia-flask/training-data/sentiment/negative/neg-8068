This place was so awful.  The husband and I had a layover in Vegas.  Luckily, we were indecisive and decided to split a burrito from here and then decide if was worth another $9 burrito.  For such high cost, I'd expect Chipotle sized, but it was not at all.  We ordered a thai burrito and it was so disappointing.  

The staff was not friendly and they charge for everything.  Pretty much if it's not listed in your burrito, they're going to charge for it - even common things like sour cream or cheese.  Pretty much, unless this your only option for food, save yourself and go somewhere else.
