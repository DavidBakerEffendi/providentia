Fine food? Really? I think NOT! Gave it 1 star based on the atmosphere but don't let the decor fool you. As it may look clean and new, the food here is definitely not fine. We ordered the chicken and beef. Both were served cold, in dry pitas with barely 2oz of chicken in one and maybe 3oz in the beef. What a ripoff! Never again. Terrible first impression on a grand opening. Save your money and take your appetite down the street to Liberty Schawarma.
