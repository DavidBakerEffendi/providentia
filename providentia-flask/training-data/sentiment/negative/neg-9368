This is my second visit and it pretty much put a nail in the coffin. The first time we came in for a late breakfast and the food was mediocre but we chalked it up to being on the tail end of breakfast service. However, the second chance did not prove redeeming. I ordered the Cali benedict and the poached eggs were beyond runny and the dish was bland. The potatoes are greasy and hard. Hubby's omelet was greasy and runny, as well. Have not had lunch or dinner but would be reluctant to come back based on both poor breakfasts. There's other amazing places for breakfast in the area.
