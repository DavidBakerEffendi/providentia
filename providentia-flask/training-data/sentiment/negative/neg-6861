We went for Aloha (happy hour) and the specialty cocktails for $5 were great as well as the calamari but the sliders were awful and the sushi rolls had no flavor. The place was pretty dead and they are obviously just hanging on... very sad to see when Flemings right next door is jam packed.  Better food and some personality behind the bar would work wonders. We would only return for the calamari and there is better elsewhere.
