We came here with a group of 16 for my bachelorette party. First thing, they seat us at a table that only seats 12. We had to squeeze in 4 more people. We had a reservation. Then we sat there. No waters, no greeting, no "we will be right with you", for almost 10 minutes.  The waiter eventually comes over and only explains the menu to one side of the table. Are we suppose to share, do you have any suggestions? He takes our drink order and then comes back with a few drinks and takes the order. Some people got all of their food before some even got their drinks. How long to make a cocktail at the bar? Then on to the food I ordered 1/2 fox oysters. They weren't even shucked properly. I had to use my fork to scrape it out of the shell! The Samba Strip roll was gross and super mayo covered. Nobody raved about their food. We just paid our $1500 check, left a 20% tip and left unhappy. Bummed. Worst Vegas meal ever.
