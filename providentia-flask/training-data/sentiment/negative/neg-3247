Don't ask me if I stayed here, because I'll tell you right now:

I have never stayed here, and I will NEVER stay here. Although it looks amazing from the outside, we went inside to go to a bar or a club, and the second we opened the outer doors, the smell hit us like a ton of bricks! It smells so bad in the Venetian, I don't think I'll ever be back to visit, let alone pay my good money to stay here. It literally smells like a staircase that has been pissed on for years, mixed with stale urinal cakes from a dive bar bathroom. 

Please know that this is NO EXAGGERATION.

We about faced and got the hell out of dodge, because there is no way that I can have a great time with friends when it smells like a port-o-san.

I'm not sure how there are people who went recently and have not noticed this problem, but it is out of hand.
