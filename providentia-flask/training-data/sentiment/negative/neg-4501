Worst customer service ever!! I've never had such a horrible experience paying with a large group, waitress was never around. Took 20mins just to order water, the place was not busy. They added 18% graditutity charge. (Way too much for shitty service) food was good but that's about it! This was a disappointment for sure will not be back!
