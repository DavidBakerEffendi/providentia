Horrible place. New management. The teen girl is embarrassed to work there so there is NO eye contact nor did anyone hear me ask questions...I was informed and then given a bill. 

First off talk to your customers....make sure all the fixans are what they want. Sorry but I don't work here....so obviously I don't know how to make your solvaki pita. Everyone makes their differently. I hate olives and I hate pickles so wtf.  Anyways never NEVER coming back to this expensive sh*t ever again. ZERO stars. Gross gross gross.
