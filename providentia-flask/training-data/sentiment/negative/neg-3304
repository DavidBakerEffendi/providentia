Sammy's has a good reputation as the familiar place you go to with friends or family, but this location is all wrong. 
The food tastes like it's slapped together. No care whatsoever. 
The presentation is deceiving because it does look nice. 
I've tried the place twice and each time ordered salad and pizza. 
The salad is fine. You can't go wrong here just have to buy and stock fresh ingredients. But the pizza is just horrible. The crust is tasteless, the toppings are deflated and molded into the crust, overall I would say it tastes like frozen pizza.
