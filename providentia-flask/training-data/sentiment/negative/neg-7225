When here on a quiet weekday and I have to say the time means nothing. The serve was horrible and the food was not brought to us in a timely manner. Quality of food was its normal fair, but the reason to go to the cheese cake factory was always for the cheese cake.
Serve was so bad we asked to speak with the manager and I must say he was a condescending jerk to put it nicely.
This location has fallen so badly i would be hard pressed to ever go there for just a cheese cake.
Too bad a good idea has been franchised and in personalize to the point where a once big admirer may never go back again.
