Came here with my girlfriend, figured we'd try a new sushi spot, and this place is horrible... Service is super slow... Chefs are slow... The nigiris are chewy which means the fish isn't fresh... The eel is soggy and cold... Waste of money but at the same time at least we know never to come back here again... At least two other tables also sat around waiting for their food longer than they actually spent eating their food... If 4 tables is considered busy to two sushi chefs and 3 servers then maybe they need to think about hiring a new staff..
