Very loud with a large crowd to match.

Came here seeking suds and we found it - we also found some poutine and other hearty fare to coat the stomach with.

I liked the flight of beers that you could get - so much that I have a hard time remember which ones I enjoyed the most. The brown ale sticks out as the best but the others just seemed like regular beer after a while.

Staff needs to be more attentive - after we got our beer, she pretty much disappeared for an hour. My friend had fun hitting the frowny face on the feedback machine for five minutes while we paid the bill.
