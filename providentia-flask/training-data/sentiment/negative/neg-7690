From the long line outside of the buffet and the overall atmosphere of it, I thought it'd be a delicious and fulfilling meal...but I was terribly wrong.

What NOT to get (-): The meat tasted really bad. They were left on the counter for a long time. The sushi was not fresh at all; they looked like they had just been taken out from the freezer. 

(+) The only taste-worthy food here was the spaghetti. They were made on the spot and customized. The fried calamari was okay too. As for the dessert, the creme brulee was the tastiest of all. The chocolate cream puff was edible too. Cupcakes were extremely sweet, so were the chocolate pudding.

Service: Our server didn't seem to care about his attitude at all. When we asked for straws or napkins, he threw them on the table and left. Reluctant to take our drink orders as well. Maybe because most people forgot to tip them since the buffet is free.

Overall: Don't waste your time. Spend a little more and eat at somewhere nicer! This buffet is a joke.
