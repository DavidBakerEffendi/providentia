First off the hostess was not very nice. Throwing our menus down and walking away. After about 5 minutes we were given chips and salsa that tasted like it came out of a bag & a jar. We ordered some chicken strips that tasted like fish! I think your restaurant needs a makeover not only with the servers but the menu as well. We will NOT be returning.
