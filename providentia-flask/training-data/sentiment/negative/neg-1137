Vermont Sandwich company was friendly about taking the order except for one major issue. I had a coupon that stated buy one sandwich and get one free with purchase of two drinks.  The person taking the order informed us that all sandwiches included your choice of side and that was also indicated by the paper menu and the menu board.  The owner in the back making sandwiches overhead the order, interrupted, and indicated that chips were not included and would be extra. I have previously used a coupon and received the chips included with the free sandwich and this was clearly stated on the board and in the paper menus. 

I understand the need to bring in business with a coupon but not honoring it competely is just bad service even though the food was outstanding.  A food establishment should not only have good food but good service to be successful. I will not be going back due to the poor service and the false advertising.
