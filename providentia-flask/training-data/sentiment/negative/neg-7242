This was by far the worst service for the most mediocre pizza!  First asked server for cheese pizza she said the closest thing was a margherita, five minutes after ordering looked up and noticed the pizza special was a 4 cheese,  didn't say anything about it.  Ok, got apps and set dirty plates on app plate.  When they took away our plates she brought our pizza but with no extra plates.  Waited 5 minutes to try to find her for more plates.  She sets them down and leaves.  Waited another couple to ask for a soda refill and cheese and peppers.  Each time she sets it down without a word.  Never asked if the food was good or if we needed anything.  And no, it was not busy.  Then we were over charged for the pizza and sodas.  She charged us $16 for 3 sodas!!!  Needless to say, save your money, you'll get better service from McDonald's.
