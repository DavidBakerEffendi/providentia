S.O.S. First night in Vegas... Went to putters and had the rudest bartender ever. Went to a bar right around the corner from my family's house. Super chill and quiet when I walked in just what I was looking for. Bartender greeted us very rude but grabbed our beers fast. He was gone for a bit which was cool but asked him about a "special" on the board that was a shot. Was only half way thru my beer. He then told me to calm down and in was a joke and he could get me a bottle of water in the rudest voice ever. Re take your TAM.
