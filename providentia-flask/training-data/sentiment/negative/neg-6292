Horrible service! I placed and order online and when I came to pick it up, they charged me for it and it still wasn't ready so I sat down and waited only for them to tell me they were out of stuffed crust and that they hadn't even started making my pizza! Oh and they couldn't give me my refund right now. I would have to fill out "paperwork" and wait to get a check in the mail! If they didn't have the right ingredients, why make me pay for something that I didn't want?!?! Now I've been here waiting almost an hour.
