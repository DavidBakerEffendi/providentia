Ate here twice (don't ask me why i went here twice - when the first time itself was quite disappointing. Suffice to say, there was a girl involved)

Go here for buffet, only if you like south indian cuisine, which is in the average to good  range. 

If you like north indian food, best to avoid this place altogether. For whatever reason, most north india dishes taste as if they have ketchup in them here. Food is unnecessarily spicy.

Avoid...Bad Indian Food.
