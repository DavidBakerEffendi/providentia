This place is terrible. It was pretty empty and signs all over the outside says happy hour. Little did we know, happy hour does not apply when it is March Madness.  That was fine but when the waitress told us there is a 2 drink minimum per hour because it is March Madness we were like WTF why was this not said before we for seated?!  No happy hour and a drink MINIMUM? They must be crazy. At least let customers know BEFORE getting seated that there is a drink minimum even if there are no happy hour deals.  Never coming back.
