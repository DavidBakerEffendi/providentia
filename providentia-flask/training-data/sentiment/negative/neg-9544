OMG, somebody slap me for trusting this place to hook me up for dinner with the takeaway option since I am house-sitting a mile away and there is NO food in this house.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad which is supposed to go a little something like this, "Sesame Salad*
Grilled Chicken, Ahi Tuna or Salmon, mixed greens, red peppers, chopped cilantro, sliced almonds and sesame seeds tossed in sesame vinaigrette."  Well, I got bagged mixed greens..you know the type, romaine with a few strings of dried out carrot and red cabbage.  There were no peppers, no cilantro and FINALLY they gave me zero almonds or sesame seeds.  Are you kidding me? Oh, it gets better, I didn't even get any dressing!!!  I also ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms...inedible.  just mush with no "rooms."  So I'm starving, I'm out thirty bucks and I hate myself.
