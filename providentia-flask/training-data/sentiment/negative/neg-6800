One of the worst buying experiences since moving to Cleveland. My son called and ordered a large pie for delivery.When it arrived I was taken aback by how small it was. Like one of those mini pizzas you get in the supermarket. The delivery guy just shrugged like he'd heard it all before. I called and the girl who answered could care less about my concern and said that was their large. $16.00 for a mini pizza. I mean really. I called back and the manager said the same. Could care less. I was cool and calm when I spoke with them but they treated me like a complaining person. Will never order from them again.
