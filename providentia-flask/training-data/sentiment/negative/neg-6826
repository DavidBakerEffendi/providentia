This place is such a waste of money. Think Applebee's atmosphere, with food that has no flavor whatsoever. I mean none. It's like they went out of their way to make everything as bland as possible. I got the shrimp tacos.. with no flavor. My girlfriend got the chicken sandwich.. that tasted like it was made before seasoning was invented. You've been warned: over priced, under spiced, and the most forgettable meal of my life.
