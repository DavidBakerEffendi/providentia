Still searching for that  great Pastrami. 
My Daughter says, "Let's go to Canter's at TI. I thought great and man was I hungry.  I order the Pastrami, my daughter orders Matzo and her boyfriend the corned beef combo.

The Pastrami sandwich was huge with Pastrami bulging out on all sides. Before I lathered it with mustard, I always take a bite to taste the natural flavors before I pollute it with seasoning.   I couldn't believe that this Huge Beast of a sandwich, didn't have ANY Pastrami Flavor. Give me a freaking break! $15 and NO FLAVOR!  And to Top it OFF, the rye bread it came on fell to pieces soon after the first bite. Upon closer inspection the bread was stale.  $15 and you can't serve fresh bread!  Never!  Ever,  will I return to to this place.  

My search continues.  But I'm starting to think it is a futile search in this town.
