My wife and I tried this new "throwback" of a restaurant from the 80's. If you like average food at high prices, than this place is for you. Nachos, salad, and pulled pork sandwich were all just ok. 10 bucks for a glass of average wine. Inside looks ok but bare and nothing on the walls. Wish it was better but will stay with longhorn as my steak provider and with a couple extra bucks saved in my pocket.
