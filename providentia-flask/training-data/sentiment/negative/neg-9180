This morning I was hopeful for a descent breakfast that was quick. Now I understand they sell pizza, however their breakfast options appeared ok. I ordered a bacon and egg wrap for $9. The wrap had 1 piece of bacon and eggs. It was sad really, I basically had eggs for breakfast, certainly was a major disappointment. Won't be coming back and I travel to the Phoenix often.
