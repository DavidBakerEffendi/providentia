I'm really getting sick of the service in this place. I walk in and ask the lady at the register if I should just grab a table..she does not even look up and acknowledge me or welcome me...they have zero servers in here..I got.my drink and told the drink lady I was ready to tell my server..I sat there for 10 minutes ..then there were screaming babies which just added to the total unpleasantness of the whole experience...I always drop at least 125/150 in here I always take a bunch from the deli but quite frankly I'm sick of their bs attitude and service..then that jerk I can't stand in the deli is screaming something accross the entire restaurant totally unpleasant and obnoxuous...and to the owner don't start sending me angry messages defending this crap people pay a lot of money to eat at your place and quite frankly it's not up to snuff.. I really don't care if you like it or not it's honest ..that's it
