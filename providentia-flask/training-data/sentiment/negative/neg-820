Service sucks! Maybe they need another person around 12pm because they were so many dirty tables when we arrived and had to wait 15 mins to be seated. I ordered tempura shrimp and that took 20 minutes. I think they forgot to put in that order that's why it took forever. The servers talk to each other the entire time when they can get tables/bar cleaned up. This place was better when it opened now it's trash. I won't be returning.
