Called in my order at 5:15pm yesterday. Was told that my order would be ready in 25 minutes. Got there to try and pick up my order and should have known it would take long when the person in front of me was waiting for almost an hour for their order. No one acknowledged me for at least 20 minutes and when I finally got someone they at first said that they couldn't find my name and I told them again and they finally found it. I was told it was only a few minutes and it would be ready. After waiting for 30-35 minutes I still didn't get my food and I tried to get a manager and that took 10 minutes to get. Finally got my food at 7:30pm. Now on I'll go to portofino's from now on. Won't get my business ever again
