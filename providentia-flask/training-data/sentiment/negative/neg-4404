Horrible service 
At 5pm the cashier was mopping the front floor with smelly dirty mop water. I stood at the front counter where cash register was waiting to order the employee continues to mop up to and around a circle of my feet.  Wet floors at dinner time that smelled horrible.  Then as I placed my order one of the cooks burned some food and I thought just leave.  Omg when only the manager could validate my coupon he told me "I got ya don't worry". I thought what is he talking about?? Sick.  Overall a terrible meal. Go to any other burger joint!!!!
