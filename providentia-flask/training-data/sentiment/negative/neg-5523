A relatively clean McDonald's, but there is just something about it that never seems quite right.  Perhaps it is the fact that this one is right across the street from Case Western Reserve University, yet on the few times I have gone in, I have never seen any college students.  Very strange, and maybe I am just not going at the right time.

The fries were overdone today, which is a big McD's no-no.
