Absolutely the most disgusting food I have ever seen at a buffet. I know its under $20 but there is a reason for that. Nobody smiles, the place is a mess, nothing is filled up properly and once you are up close to the selections, you realize there isnt much there. 

Most of the food was inedible. I basically ate cheese, crackers and salami, along with the stir-fry  veggies. Everything else was gross and a waste. 

I cannot stress enough what a waste of money this place is. Please eat somewhere else.
