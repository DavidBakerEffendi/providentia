Worst Firehouse subs I've ever eaten at and I have eaten at quite a bit, since I usually enjoy their subs at least twice a week. I've had 2 subs there in the past week, both of which have made me extremely sick to my stomach. Their tomatoes were old but I'm not 100% sure that was it.  To top it off their team members are completely incompetent and do not even know how their own reward system works. The only reason I gave this one star is because they carry funyons and that isn't a thing where I live in ENC.
