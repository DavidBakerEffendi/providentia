It just wasn't what I thought it would be...I was thinking there would be all kinds of burgers nope but they do serve everything under the kitchen sink from bacon and eggs, fish, mexican food. I was planning on getting a burger but saw the menu and got something different and as you can see from the picture it was a bad choice.
