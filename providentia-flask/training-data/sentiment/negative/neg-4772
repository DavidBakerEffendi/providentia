My girlfriend Lisa and I went here for the $22 strip steak dinners. 1/3 of her steak was pure fat!  The steak had good flavor, but 1/3 not being edible? Terrible value and ruined the birthday dinner. The baked potato was tiny like the potatoes one buys at the supermarket.  They do have good bread, the caliber of Santo's Restaurant.

We have been to this restaurant before.  We will not be back to this restaurant.   The owner was shown the long cut of fat from the steak and had nothing to say. What could he say?  Poor quality, poor steak value, but service was descent.  Complete waste of money and at best worth half of the +$50 paid!
