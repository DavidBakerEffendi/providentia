Went here for the breakfast buffet, would definitely take a pass next time.  Scrambled eggs were terrible and not much of a selection of anything.  Sausage was all burnt. The fruit that was there was in a small bowl. The buffet just wasn't good.  And the service there was very poor and slow.  We asked for refills of our drinks and the waitress wasn't pleasant about assisting us at all.  It's a decent size city, find another breakfast nook!
