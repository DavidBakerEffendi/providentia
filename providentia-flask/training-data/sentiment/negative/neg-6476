Awful is how I would describe it. 

They have been through ownership changes a lot and it just keeps getting worse. After my delivery order came an hour and a half later, I was treated to a dynamite roll that was devoid of shrimp tempura and crammed with avocado. I should have just ordered an avocado role to be honest. The spicy chicken appetizer? Yeah if you like chewing on rubber with some sauce splashed on it sparingly. How do you get skimpy with the spicy sauce??

Just don't go there. Go down the street to Sashimi Island if you must. Or learn to make sushi and just make it at home. Probably better than eating this garbage.
