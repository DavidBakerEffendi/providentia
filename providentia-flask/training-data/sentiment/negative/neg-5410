Ordered a double burger with cheese meal, total $7.50 The meal included a burger and fries.  The beef patties were flavorless and hard. The fries were dry and lacked seasoning. Overall I was not impressed with the food. Ive had better burgers from the frozen aisle. I don't think Ill return to this restaurant. FYI The meal does not include a drink.
