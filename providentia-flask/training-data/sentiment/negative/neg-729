I've been waiting for Loco to open for months. What a huge disappointment! From the server who wanted to be ANYWHERE but there to the weird pretzel bites to the tapas sized entree and a marg that had more ice than a glass should hold...I could go on and on.  I'm hoping the powers that be take their numerous 1 and 2 star reviews as a clue that some changes need to be made if they're going to survive. Good Luck!
