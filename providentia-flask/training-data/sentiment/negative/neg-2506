The service sucked,,, if you want extraa chips u have to pay for evry bowl and cup of salsa,,, the tacos and tostadas were generic... shells tasted store bought and not the good ones either.. So for 2 people to eat, one combination dinner, 1 cheese crisp and 8 beers the bill came out to $65.oo WTH...... willnever go there again,,, not if its the last place on earth....
Thumbs down all the way
