Seemed like a fun place with music & dance floor.  However, the service was really slow, even though it seemed to be winding down from the after work crowd.  We waited 45 minutes for a beef dip and a cajun chicken wrap.  The beef dip bun was burned black on the inside, it would be impossible to miss.  When the server inquired about our meals we pointed this out and she asked how they were otherwise.  We asked for our bill.  We were prepared to pay exact change and at that point she took the plate to the manager who took that off our bill.  About two hours later the stomach cramps, fever & head ache set in (chicken wrap, not the beef dip).  48 hours later I am still feeling the effects.  I don't recommend the food here.
