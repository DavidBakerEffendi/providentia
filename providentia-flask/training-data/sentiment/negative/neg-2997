I used to love Carolinas so I dread writing this review.  But my last experience wasn't pleasant and this time was horrendous.  I ordered enchiladas over the phone, that way they could be ready when I got there. They told me 10 -15 minutes wait time... totally reasonable.  I got there about 12 minutes later, they told me my food wasn't ready,  which is ok.  I don't mind waiting a few.  15 minutes later I asked if my food was ready.  The guy working said they were making it now.  But I noticed there was a to go box with a #8 on it just sitting there.  That's fine, it must have been someone else's.  Another 10 minutes roll by and I ask another girl if my order was ready. She realizes it's the box that had been sitting there that WHOLE time and gave it to me.  When I got it home it was ice cold and tasted terrible. Sadly, I will not waste any more money here.
