I was here over the weekend on 8/5/17 for dinner with a party of 17.  The price was $45 plus 18% gratuity so it came to a total of $56/person which I don't mind paying.  However, I was extremely disappointed with what they offered.  The food choice was limited and food wasn't good.  As far as fruit goes, it was nothing special they have just watermelon, cantaloupe, & pineapple.  With desert, they have all kinds of creamy desert in different color but basically the same thing.  There's no flan or cream brûlée like they had in the past.  It usual to be a decent buffet but really went downhill.  I cannot believe they offer this low quality buffet at a high end resort like this.  It really was a big disappointment for all of us.  The line was not long at all and I now understand why.
