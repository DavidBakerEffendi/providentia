Review as of 7/27/18:
Decided to stop for what used to be pretty good wings and crab legs!
.....I keep hoping for better and leave considerably disappointed!
.....So last review won't be back!

Crab legs came and "looked ok".  Ordered without seasoning.
- see pics
1) rotting parts
2) broken everywhere
3) smelled soooo bad!
Manager: no we serve them like that always.  It's not rotten.  (Oh, so the cook took the time to fry and burn the broken limb buckles!). Must be from the Angry Crab crew!
- I suggested maybe the supplier is not bringing quality.  NO - he confirmed this is how we serve them.  So I clarified are you sure this is what you represent when it comes to seafood and I can yelp that you stand by this?  He said YES!  (Okay...!). No where to go from here.  
Chicken boneless - not cooked and cold in the middle and soggy.  Also stated that was how they serve it.  Again I asked , you stand by this?  And he looked run down and didn't care much at all.  I offered to pay for gator tots and drinks but nothing else please.  He walked away and adjusted the bill.  I had to ask to have the smelly fish removed and got that done!
Wow!  I just don't understand why no one seems to care much. Side note: thank you for the managers who respond to these feedback moments and care....you all make a big difference in the quality of food and respect for your guests!!!!!    Let's see where this goes!
