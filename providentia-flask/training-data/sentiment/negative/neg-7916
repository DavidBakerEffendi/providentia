Drinks good. Apps --- meh.  Ordered the fettuccine appetizer -- supposed to be made with preserved lemon but the lemons were nowhere to be found.  It did include yellow summer squash which married up nicely with its absolute blandness.  Tasted like I just threw leftover veggies in with pasta and the green onion pesto was flavorless. Add to that a 1/2 teaspoon of buttermilk ricotta and 1 drop of chilli oil,  stir to achieve a light green mess and serve. Chickerones were good but billed that the come with 'housemade' hot sauce.  My advice charge $3.00 less and use Frank's Red Hot.  Obviously dinner did not happen.  

Current menu is a bust --- may try again after it changes but right now too veg, too Asian for me.  Off to Luxe or Spice Kitchen.
