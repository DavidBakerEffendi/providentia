For some reason, my in-laws and friends enjoy eating Carolinas Mexican food for take out and eat in.  Maybe it's because the tortillas are fresh, and are actually good, when they are fresh.  

Do not be fooled by any other review of this place, the food is awful in so many ways:

1.  So much salt! On the chips especially, but you can taste the sodium,   and probably MSG, in all the meals, and there is A LOT of it in there, trust me!

2.  If the tortillas aren't fresh, they are rock hard and indigestible

3. The beans are pureed to no end

4.  They cover their boring flavors and terrible enchilada sauce with cheese.  Everything had cheese, cheese and more cheese!

5.  Unfresh produce, with brown lettuce and mushy tomatoes. 

Never again will I eat at Carolinas Mexican food, it must be some of the most unhealthy food I have ever ingested, and if you care even one iota about your heart and your health, you probably should avoid this place at all costs!
