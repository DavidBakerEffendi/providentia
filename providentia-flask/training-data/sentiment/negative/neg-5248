Meh.... Mediocre food and service. Confusing theme and identify. Doesn't feel like a Mexican restaurant. Feels more like a boring corporate  restaurant at the Marriott Omaha Nebraska. 

The food is not authentic. Feels very processed  like Taco Bell quality. Definitely not real Mexican. We sampled several dishes and didn't really like any of it. The menu is also confusing and not very well laid out. 

Just overall no authenticity or brand. Too bad because we need a good Mexican restaurant on this side of town. Would rather have Mimi's Cafe back. 

Also, no tecate at a Mexican restaurant? Bizarre
