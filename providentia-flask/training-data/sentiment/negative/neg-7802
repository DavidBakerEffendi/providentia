I was so excited to try this place based on the reviews But when you walk in it smells of fish which isn't good The sushi wasn't that great they forgot one of the things we ordered and the service is TERRIBLE they said they were busy but there was 3 other tables of 2 people at each. Never coming back again that's for sure
