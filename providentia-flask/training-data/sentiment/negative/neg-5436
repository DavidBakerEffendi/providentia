I really wanted to give Biaggio a good review but unfortunately, they did not pull through on our large delivery order. I placed this order weeks in advance and come the day of my party the delivery was disorganized. 

First off, I was promised that for the price paid, I would receive enough food to feed my party. Plus, I was told that our delivery would be on time. He was 15 minutes late and we had to walk down to meet him near the parking garage to carry all of the food and drinks up to our hotel. By the time we ate our food, the pizza was dry and luke warm. What was the purpose of the delivery fee? 

Second, our order incorrect. The salad that he told us would feed enough people ...well...didn't. He said he would send garlic knots...he didn't. They didn't send enough soda liters...and for a group of 13 people, we got 6 forks. This was such a huge disappointment because Biaggo had promised an amazing dining experience. 

To make up for it, they offered to send us all of the missing items AND free dessert. THEY NEVER CAME! 

My fellow yelpers may say that their pizzeria is good, but I would avoid delivery, especially to the strip and on a big order. It just seems like too much for them to handle.
