We somehow ended up here again today.
We dropped our meatsacks down at the back terrace, because: Yay shade! 
However the joy of sitting in shade was overwhelmed by the puddle of putrid sour smelling vomit near us.
The waitress ignored it like a champ.
So, after one drink, we had enough of it and went to pay.
Apparently they don't take debit.
Wut?
But do not fear! They have an ATM! Oh joy!
Unfortunately it wouldn't read the chip on our card *bummer*, so now what?
Well, out came the standard portable card reader, and TADA, all of a sudden they DO take debit.

Shifty hipsters.
Needless to say: We won't be going back.
Ever.
