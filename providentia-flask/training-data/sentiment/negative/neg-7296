So far I have had two poor experiences here and I still have yet to eat here. The first one was with Lisa L when we came in shortly before closing and were given nothing but expletives from the cook who then decided to make a lot of noise closing the kitchen. The cashier said "sorry" in the least apologetic tone and didn't seem to know what to do or care. Needless to say, we left pretty upset. I came by again on Wednesday at 11:45 to find the place closed. The sign says closed on Mondays. There were employees inside ignoring us. The only thing I can think of for why it was closed was the rain but that doesn't make much sense since every other establishment in the center was open. I have yet to use my Groupon which expires next week and after the last few questionable and annoying experiences, the only reason I'm going to bother is the fact that Groupon probably won't refund me at this point.
