We went here on saturday morning and the place was not busy, yet when we walked up to the hostess stand the young lady said she would be right back and proceeded to walk around the restaurant. So we stood there waiting and she came back and left again. If it weren't for the coupon we purchased at Localflavor.com we would have left. Another waitress came to the hostess stand and did not say anything to us. Finally the young girl came back and seated us.
Our waiter was nice and my husband ordered the Rib Eye skillet which said was shaved beef but was really more like ground up steak, the hash brown potatoes which were not good were served on a separate plate. They give you a lot of meat but the eggs were over cooked and this was the worst skillet he has ever had. I ordered a veggie omelet and it was just okay. But the wheat toast was gross and they serve it dry with country crock spread. At the table next  to us the lady couldn't even eat here breakfast so the waitress took it off the bill. I have no idea why anyone eats here when on Sunday we went to Butterfields and had the best breakfast ever.
