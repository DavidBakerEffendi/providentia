Oh God, this place was awful. This is hands down the worst Korean food I have tasted in my life (no exaggeration). This is what Korean food would probably taste like in rural North Dakota (no offense, North Dakotans!). I really have nothing good to say about this place. 

This place is expensive and serves significantly smaller portions than typical korean restaurants. The $15 seafood pancake (which had very little seafood and  tasted very fishy/gross) was half the size of what would typically served. The $10 soft tofu stew was bland and came in a very small pot (almost like a small bowl); the beef in there was extremely tough.

Our server (very likely the owner) was inattentive and stingy with side dishes; we had to ask him to refill twice because it was simply not enough. The portions started off small, but only got smaller and smaller as we asked for more.

If you want decent korean food, drive a few miles south to Hodori.
