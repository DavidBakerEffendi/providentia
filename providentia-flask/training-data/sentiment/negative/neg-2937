Ok so I wasn't going to post this in yelp but I tried emailing the managers/owners privately and have yet to get a response.. ok so DONT eat here!!!!! My wife and I go here often until last Wednesday. I got my usual bld burrito and was packing up my left overs when I started to pour my sauce on my burrito there was a sucked/chewed on mint in my sauce! Seriously like the prep cook lost the mint while making the sauce and couldnt find it so just kept on making the sauce! Well it was in my food.. I was in shock that this was actually happening so we brought it to the bartenders attention and all he did was make jokes about it.. then he comped my meal and made us pay the rest of the bill... I couldn't believe what was going on. I was so unbelievably grossed out because this was pretty much somebody spitting in my food. I couldn't believe this was how this situation was handled.. no manager came over nothing! As soon as I walked out of their doors I began to throw up from being so grossed out. Later that day I tried to email the owners/managers and days later I have yet to hear one single word from anybody! Which is even worse for being a privately owned establishment you would think that somebody would respond.. I will never return to this establishment again and i will most likely be contacting the Heath department about this.. it is SO GROSS and unsanitary of a place!
