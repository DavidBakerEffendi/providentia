Who on earth do you think you are? Decent cocktails. ALL the rest is so average & disgraceful. Nothing of the elegance of Italy, over cooked pasta and the prices. Scottsdale at its finest. Appalling.
And the sound.. your hipster architect has no idea how to buffer sound? C'mon I can't hear myself think about how I'm wishing I was anywhere but here!
