Where do I begin?

The welcome was warm and inviting.... friendly. Then the chips came with 2 kinds of salsas. I am a bit confused. They're American Cantina chips. Where's the authentic deep fried tortilla chips???? Negative 5 points. The salsas were mediocre. I didn't taste the authenticity of the flavors. 

Now, many will rant like crazy about me:"you're Asian, what do you know about Mexican food?" Let me tell you to--PAUSE, hold on to your tas-tas, and let me finish my review. When you grow up in TACO FLATS USA-California, your expectations are set high. Why? Because Juan, Jose & Maria's grandma used to do a lot of Latin foods. You definitely could even go to Sal's little taco stand and receive the best Buche taco and never looked at it any differently. Yes, be spontaneous and allow yourself to go balls deep into trying everything once.... enough said. Muchas Gracias! 

Pros:

Great customer service 
Big portions for what you pay for
Open bar
Family friendly 
Clean


Cons:

Lack of authenticity in Latin flavors

Chips-cantina style
Steak over cooked (ordered med. rare)
Salsas lacked flavor


#chipotlebeatsLosCucos worst part..... I HATE CHIPOTLE FRANCHISE.... I am all about small joint places and support local businesses! 

So, I warned you. 

You're welcome.
