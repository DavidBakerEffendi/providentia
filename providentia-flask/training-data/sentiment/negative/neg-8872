Very disappointed in this burger company look good and i thought it might be alright but it was terrible! My burger was so cooked its possible it wasnt beef, that and the menu had so little options all the burger choices are boring and bland. It was dry and way too expensive for the quality i would definitely recommend going to Five Guys or In & Out instead way better options for way better burgers and cheaper too.
