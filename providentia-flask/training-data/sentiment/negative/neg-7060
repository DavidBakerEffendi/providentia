Don't come here if you're expecting decent sushi and good service. If I could give them negative rating I would. Food was mediocre to horrible (fried California roll was gross). We sat across from where they make sushi, and they kept looking at us. They just stared the heck out of us and didn't even turn away when we looked back. It was a really uncomfortable experience and the service was pretty slow too (had to keep asking for water and napkins). Never going back and don't come unless you don't mind some stares and horrible sushi.
