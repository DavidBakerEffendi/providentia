I stop by once a month to remind myself that, although close to my house, this place is still lame, poorly run and the customer service sucks.  If your playing on your phone when I come in, can you please wash your hands before rubbing them all over the lid of my coffee... which is average at best.  Oh and this is a new trend you may want to try, when I hand you my money, you reply by saying Thank You.
