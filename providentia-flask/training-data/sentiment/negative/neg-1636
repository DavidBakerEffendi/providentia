I was super excited to try this place out, so I ordered the big katuna with what turned out to be too high expectations. There was wayyyy too much sauce on my bowl, all I tasted was salty ponzu. Apparently mine was made by a new person, since she kept asking questions to another staff about how to put the ingredients together. I took it to go which was saving grace since I was at least able to mix it with other non salty things to finish the toppings. Didn't eat the rest of the rice, too drenched in ponzu.
