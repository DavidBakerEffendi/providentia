This place is TERRIBLE. The service and food is so bad that it's unbelievable. I've never been to a restaurant with such bad servers. They are rude, forgetful and slow. I had to ask for water 6 times before they brought it and expect an average wait time of 25 minutes PER ROLL. At the end of my meal I had a few pieces left because since I had been waiting for my whole order for 2 hours, I got full, and the server had the nerve to get mad at me and demand I pay for each piece. 
How is this place still in business!?
