Not worth it. Don't come here. Ever. Please don't even think about doing so. 

So let down by this place.
Got the pulled pork sandwich, mac and chz, and bourbon baked beans.

You want to talk about the driest, lukewarm pile of sad pork I have ever had. I had to drown it in sauce (which all taste the damn same) just to choke it down. You can tell it sat under a heat lamp for a few hours.

Mac & cheese? No. More like soggy noodles & cheese flavored water. They were so tasteless not even the crappy crushed saltine crackers on top wanted to be in it.

And these baked f*kn beans. Listen. They threw any beans they could find,  added some pork in it and tossed it around in some water. Then said *voila* slapped a baked beans name to it and figured no one would notice. NOTHING ABOUT THESE DAMN BEANS MADE THEM CLOSE TO BOURBON BAKED BEANS.

The staff is incompetent, and it's not their fault. You can just tell they were not trained properly or long enough. I can see why they have a craigslist ad for new management, because they have no leader. The shift manager tonight was as clueless as his staff. (Sunday, November 8th, 2015, at 6pm) 

The only reason. THE ONLY REASON this place deserves the one star I have to give is that they have Frost top root beer on tap. I love frost top root beer.
