OMG, I just can't believe the great reviews. My wife and I stopped here because of the reviews. Unfortunately,  it was awful. The tacos al pastor were mostly liquid with very little pork. The rice was flavorless.  The beans were nothing more than unflavored unseasoned mush.  The huevos were so runny as to question if we were going to be sick. So we asked for scrambled eggs as a substitute.  They then charged $5 for 2 scrambled eggs with some sort of seasoning that tasted like sawdust. Sorry but this was awful.
