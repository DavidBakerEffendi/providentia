My family stays at the Silverton for a week at a time a couple of times per year. We have always had a good experience until our most recent one, and will not be back. Due to extremely noisy guests next door, my family was unable to get sleep for two nights. Repeated phone calls to the front desk from not only our room but from guests in other rooms as well resulted in little to no response from both security and management. I spoke with security and a manager directly and nothing was done, even after a security officer told me the guests would have to leave the hotel if more complaints were made. We were very disappointed in this recent stay.
