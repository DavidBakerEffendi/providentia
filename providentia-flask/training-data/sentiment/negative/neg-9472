Basically a Subway with a pita. Ill take subway,  more meat and cheaper.  4 tiny slices of gyro mystery meat. Meat was flavorless and mushy.  And paul the owner is commenting saying its premium meat...  yeah right.  How do you get perfectly rectangular gyro meat?  Looked like the slices you buy at a grocery store.  They say they grill it,  no sear, no flavor.  Won't be back ever.  Paul the owner thinks his pitas are the greatest thing ever.  I made a better sandwich for lunch,  and didn't cost me 8 dollars.
