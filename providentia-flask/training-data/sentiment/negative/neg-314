This place offers so many specials and coupons, yet they seem to be very picky about using them and redeeming them. We had gotten a groupon deal but when we were paying they said they couldn't accept the groupon because wasn't in their database yet and we would just have to pay and they would email us another one... never got that email of course! :-/ 
Although this did happen we went during the lunch buffet and it was pretty good, but $16 for an indian lunch buffet is way too high and there's a lot of competition in this town. We only went here because we had the coupon and it ended up costing us extra in the long run! Super annoying! Rarely complain about places, but I won't be going back there...
