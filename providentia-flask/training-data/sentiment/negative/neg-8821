Allow me to paint you a picture... It is a crisp Saturday morning, not a lot of people are out, there is snow in Prince's Island Park, the sun is shining and I am enjoying the company of a new friend going for a walk.

Everything is lovely, despite the cold, so we decide to head to the River Cafe - now, I have never been here for brunch, so I am entirely unsure of what to expect, my new found friend has never been here, ever.

Let me fill in another part of the picture... a picturesque cafe, nestled in a lovely park, looks like a cabin, and is extremely homey... Until you tell them you are just enjoying coffee and pastries.

I know, I know, the River Cafe, coffee and pastries? Must be insane right? That was what our server thought, apparently. Service was fantastic at the start, we ordered coffee and their pastry basket... Out comes the lovely Kicking Horse organic coffee, out come the delightful pastries (I could have eaten ten of the fantastic apple cinnamon danishes); we talk, we laugh, we enjoy the coffee, the pastries and the atmosphere. As we finish up the pastries, our waitress looks positively puzzled as we say "No, just some more coffee, thank you"... She tops up our coffee and our bottomless water without leaving the second bottle (funny how that works), and proceeds to leave us to our conversation... For TWENTY minutes... Empty water glasses, empty coffee cups... We were ready to go anyway, but to wait 20 minutes, and to have the waitress presumptuously bring us the bill?

Apparently I was wrong about this place... They weren't at all busy, and I have never been pushed out the door when I have a big bill... Such disappointing service at the end. Oh, and I particularly loved the host NOT getting our jackets from the coat check for us. That was the icing on the cake.

All in all - good food, good service until they realize you are not dropping $100. I will NOT be back any time soon.
