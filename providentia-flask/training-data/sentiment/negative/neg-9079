Thoroughly not impressed!  We arrived at The Venetian and looked at all the offerings.  We found Chica and the pictures looked awesome; however, the Food turned out to be a complete disappointment.  My husband ordered the halibut which was good but came with nothing.  I ordered empanadas with a dude of plantains.  The empanadas were hard and lacked taste.  The were not served with anything to boast the flavor and our server disappeared so no questions or requests could be answered.  All in all I was not impressed with our $100 bill, the small beer, the ice tea that never got refilled, or the food.  There was just nothing good to write about Chica.
