BEWARE!!!!!!  Wo Fat was featured on dirty dining on KTNV.  I went there last week with my mom to eat and that night we were sick.  I should have know because the food wasn't like it was before.  The fried pork chop was over cooked and the vegetables in our dishes didn't seem fresh.  The news report showed the food not safely being refrigerated and the restaurant used old outdated food such as the tofu.
