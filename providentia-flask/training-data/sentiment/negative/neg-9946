I just called this place to make a reservation for around 12 people. First time I called - Someone actually took the call and hung up the second they took it. 

Second time I called, I was making sure it was 12 people and before I confirm it, he just hung up on me. This is for a company Happy hour and you guys sure lost a good business. Not even planning on going to this place LIKE IN EVER. RUDEEEE!!!!

Hopefully if the manager is reading this review - please ask the man who just attended my call ( On Sep 12, 1.28pm) to be less rude to the customers. God such negative energy this guy has created. You sure lost all my business, Fibber Magees. I'll find someplace else where they respect and listen to what I actually speak. Can't believe this.
