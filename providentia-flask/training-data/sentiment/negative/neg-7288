the guy that invented those slushy machines may not actually be the spawn of SATAN but i'm pretty sure they're close personal friends. still, i have to confess i enjoy watching frat boys stumble down the STRIP (or passed out in the gutter) clutching those yard long long plastic glasses of nearly frozen, neon-colored concoctions. 

i had the pina colada. couple sips in, overwhelmed by the sweetness, i found myself wondering if there was any alcohol in the mix. but i hadn't had breakfast (even though i got up early) and by the time we sat down it was early afternoon and my tummy was empty. like a ninja assassin, silent but deadly, that bad boy got the best of me. it wasn't till we got up to leave that i realized i couldn't feel my feet. 

our server whose name has been changed to protect the innocent (that would be BARRY since truth be told he's guilty as hell) called the daughter "PRINCESS POOPY PANTS" and the boy "STINKY." couldn't seem to make up his mind so alternated between "COUGAR" and "GRANDMA" for the wife unit. he was relentless in the DON RICKLES bit and we all laughed till our sides ached.

but everything we ate was freezer to fryer and generally nasty. all things considered pretty much the worst food ever but the floor show was worth a star.
