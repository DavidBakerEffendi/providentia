This is by far the worst. I like how it still have the authenticity of rolling carts with food. But the food quality is not good and service is bad. I asked for service for 2 times in a row and because of that, I was given attitude cause I asked him to get water once and sauce the other time. Because of the rolling carts food sometimes comes out cold.
