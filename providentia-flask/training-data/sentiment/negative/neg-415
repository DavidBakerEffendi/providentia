We ordered 2 of the burritos Carne assad plate the burritos were cold and they didn't even heat up the flour tortilla and the over salted the meat, they did even put pico de gallo in the burritos like the other Roberto on Decatur does...it's sad this is the closest Roberto to my house and the second time I have ordered there and it will be my last
