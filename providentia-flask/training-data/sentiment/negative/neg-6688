I  was interested in trying the "Toda La Experiencia". I asked the hostess about the designated card for that drink, and she had no idea what I was talking about. She told me to go talk to the bartender (in a dismissive manner). I asked the bartender for the card, and she couldn't find it. I was disappointed since I went to the Venetian to try this experience.
