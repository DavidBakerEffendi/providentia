Wow.  Not worth the drive. We ordered our food only to be treated badly by the lady behind the counter. She appeared to be having a bad day or was just extremely rude. She was very snappy and not very nice. The food was horribly over priced and not very good. We ended up getting it to go to avoid dealing with cranky staff.  I saw the DDD show and thought it would be a  neat place to go. I went out of my way to take out of town family and I'm sorry I did.
