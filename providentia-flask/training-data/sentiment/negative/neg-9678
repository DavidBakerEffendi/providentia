Meh. Supposedly "trendy" place.  Long wait on a Friday evening, but that is to be expected. The food certainly wasn't great. Not bad, but certainly not all that good. Our waitress clearly didn't want to be there. And I'm sure there are plenty of friendly and hardworking waiters and waitresses there, so I certainly don't mean to group them all together in one blanket statement. But I'm pretty sure our waitress hated us.

If it's on the menu, get the corned beef ball. Avoid the risotto, the chicken ball and the government cheese mac n cheese.
