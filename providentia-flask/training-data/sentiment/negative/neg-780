How are you still in business?!?  Manager walks around be in open toe shoes cleaning up trays. But not the dining area. Not one table is clean as he sits on the table people watching after dropping off 5 trays. And all the staff is moving at a snails pace. There were only 5 people in line. Took 40+ minutes to PLACE our orders
