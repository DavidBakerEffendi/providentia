Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner. I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.

The bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.

The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.

The crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don't see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.

We stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category.
