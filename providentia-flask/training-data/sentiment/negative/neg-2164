We went on a Sunday evening, and initially only a few others at the restaurant.  
We were seated quickly, but had to wait about 10 minutes to have anyone bring menus or drinks.  Once someone showed up, service was quick with bringing drinks.  We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer.  Food and appetizer came out at the same time, very quickly, but wouldn't have ordered the chips had we known they would bring them with our dinner.
I love Mexican food, and have never had chips and salsa that was bad...until now!  They were so bland, I had 1 taste and yuck!  Tried one more and still  awful.  Salsa was without taste, just substance.  Chips were rubbery.
I had 3 tacos (shredded chicken) beans and rice.  It was not good.  Shredded chicken was not very shredded, mostly big chunks and spiced hot, but no flavor.  Rice and beans were adequate.  All very bland.  My husband and I both said  a few minutes into the meal Taco Bell is better.  
No one ever returned to the table.  No drink refills, ( taco's were hot and finished drink after 1st one). And then when we were done could not get anyone to come by with bill.  Kept signaling waiter, put on coats, stood up with arms crossed and keys in hand, no one came by.   After 15 minutes or so, went to cash register and paid.  The guy who checked us out apologized that we had to come to  cash register, and was very nice.  
Disappointed, restaurant is close by and would have went frequently.  But food is  bland, and service was terrible.
