This place lost 3 stars as soon as I ketchup, Heinz. Or so they advertise. This was almost water. So if it is the best they sure water it down a lot. It should be shut down for just this reason. It list another star having to hear the manager yelling non-stop in the back. While walking around chopping on a burger. She also would rather finish her conversation then wait on the people trying to order. They kept a star because my order came fast, the burger was warm and dry. But I got a whole order of onion rings in my combo and they we're hot and fresh. Just to bad I had nothing to dip them in. Next time I won't something to eat in the area it will be Waffle House next door for sure.
