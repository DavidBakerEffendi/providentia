I went with a group on saturday night, and most of us had a travelzoo voucher.  Our server was friendly, and service was quick and attentive.  We shared three appetizers - the meat and cheese plate, salmon carpaccio, and guacamole and chips.  They were nice for starters and not too large.

We each got a salad, mine was average - butter lettuce with a viniagrette, good but not great.  

For dinner I had the salmon, most people got steaks - all were tasty.  The meats were cooked to a good temp, the salmon was moist.  

One unfortunate person in our party got the chicken and shrimp.  He wasn't unfortunate in that it tasted bad, I think it was good.  He was unfortunate in that he got a bad case of food poisoning - vomiting and bloody stools.  And that's the reason I had to give the place a 1 - I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone because of that.
