One star for decor and good service. 

For tapas in Pittsburgh, this is the worst. There's no focus with it....they simply seem to be firing their tapas gun in every direction...and when you try to do everything you usually fail. Strange flavors (not good strange), bad/sloppy presentation, and very overpriced for what you get. 

Walk down the street to Ibiza on Carson, or Dish Osteria Bar on Sarah St for great Tapas and equally good atmosphere. Southside has a decent amount of great tapas......Tusca is not part of that group.
