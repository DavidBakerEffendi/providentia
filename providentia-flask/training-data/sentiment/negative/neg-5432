This is my 3rd time getting food from this location and let me tell you it is very different than other Paramount locations. I am extremely disappointed at their customer service, food and pace. 

Customer Service:
The sales associates they have working there are really awkward, they just stare and some seem like they have no mannerisms. 

Today, the cashier forgot to charge me for chicken.. the manager came back and made him charge me $1.00 on my debit after i was about to leave to pay for the chicken. Where is the customer service in all of this? YOU forgot, I left and you had me come back :S What?!

Food:
I got the fatoush salad about 3 times since opening, today they forgot the pita chips AND the dressing. How the eff, do you forget the pita chips? Thats the main part of the salad. On top of that they serve the salad in a shallow plate - not even a bowl - literally 10 bites. 

Pace: 
They are not trained to work fast. When there is a rush hour, they work very slowly. After 1 PM - all 10 of them are just standing around in the serving area. Management needs to better schedule their associates so there isn't an overabundance of people standing around after rush hours. 

Overall, this Paramount doesnt compare to other Paramounts. Either step up your game or bring on another eatery. Horrible experience.
