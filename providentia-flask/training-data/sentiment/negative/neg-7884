Food was excellent and servers (sky and Richard) were awesome!!!!! 
They were professional, attentive, and great at their jobs as they had a full section including our table of 8!
When we had to settle the bill, we were redeeming a coupon for a free appetizer! 
The server informed us that the manager had to adjust the bill.
When the manager (JON) came to our table, he informed us that we could not redeem our coupon because it was not printed. We pointed out on the coupon that it reads "to print OR show to server" he said, "we needed to show the entire email, or bring in a printed coupon.
So rather than being rude and surf my email in front of my guest. We settled our bill and took care of our excellent servers, however, we all agreed that the manager handled the situation very poorly and single handedly turned  a wonderful dining experience into a unpleasant embarrassing experience  we will not likely patronize again!
