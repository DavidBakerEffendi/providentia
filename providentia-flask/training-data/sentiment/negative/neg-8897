So let me start by saying that I knew as a vegetarian I didn't have many options to choose from... that being said.

We were a group of 5 sat outside and we're having a good time having our cocktails and we were reviewing the menu- I found the scrapple- and read the menu thinking it had PORT as it was printed as such versus it actually saying PORK.. not an issue. We asked for further clarification- and we come to find out that it has pork and not port.. this wasn't the actual issue- the issue was the first person we approached they were quick to answer back and say "no it says pork on the menu" before even checking the menu... he takes my plate and doesn't suggest an alternative. So I'm sitting at the the table while the rest of our party has their food. Our actual server finally comes back after maybe 15 minutes after my plate was taken and as I begin to ask her if I made a mistake or what... and she leaves me mid sentence to run and get the menu to prove to me that the menu says "pork" instead of "port".... and by this point while 2 people are trying to prove to me that I read the menu wrong- they have yet to suggest anything.. by this point, Im over it and not really in the mood to even be in this restaurant. I would have happily ordered something else but when 2 people are trying to tell the whole table at this point that we are wrong- she should have gotten the manager to actually handle this situation a bit more smoothly. This being said this was my first experience at this god awful place. Would not recommended to anyone. 

Who condones this type of behavior to customers? Not I.
