So me and my girlfriend are walking along looking for a place to get a bite to eat and a nice beer.  She says let's go to the 3 brewers I haven't heard anything about the place.  I say ok... Vital mistake!  We get in at 735 and I must say that I am not a clock watcher I just happened to notice. Our server finally comes and we are really hungry so we order a couple of beers and a star platter, this happens at 7:50, our "star" platter comes after a reasonable 10 minutes ten more minutes and our beer arrives.  Almost a half an hour for our first round drinks!  The star platter had 3 mozzarella  sticks, a little handfull of onion "scoops" and 4 feeble sickly  potato skins.  So we ask for the bill, she brings it fairly quickly which was a pleasant change of pace, I pay and she then produced incorrect change, only off by 40 cents, and I know that sounds rediculous but still.  

The beer was really good though!
