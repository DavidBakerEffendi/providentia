I was so underwhelmed by Chick Rotisserie that I do not care to ever return. I went as part of a party of 5 last night and we all wished we had just gone to the Grind instead. If this place makes it, it will be a miracle. 
What is good:
Its a really cute space with a nice bar. I was excited when we walked in.
They have wine, and lots of it.
The mashed potatoes and your choice of 3 toppings for them. I love potatoes!

What is not:
The menu is bulky and heavy and requires flipping back and forth between pages. It is also super confusing! 
The chicken is all on the bone.
The sauce you pick is not for dipping, its just what your chicken is cooked in. 
The "chicken and dumplings" on the menu is apparently a typo?? Seriously? Our server said they could "probably make me something like C& D". Gee, that sounds awesome. 
The one fish selection is served bone in skin on. In a dark restaurant this was really fun for my MIL. Who makes their patrons pay and WORK for their food?? Chick does.
They dont have fries to go with their sandwiches. How many guys do you think want to order a side salad with their sandwich? None of ours did.
The bacon on their cobb salad is like eating bacon flavored rocks. Hard bacon flavored rocks. 
You cannot get un-fried garbanzo beans on the cobb salad, even if you ask for them.
The cobb salad is a sad interpretation of a cobb salad, even if you add chicken.
Want a hot sandwich? good luck.
The unisex bathroom floor was covered in sticky pee footprints. There are two bathrooms, why not make one for each sex and not make me look at or dance around a urinal?

This place was an utter disappointment to our entire party, And it wasnt a cheap disappointment. I'm just glad its over.
