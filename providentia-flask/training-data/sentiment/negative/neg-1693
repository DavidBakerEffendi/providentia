I know they are a newly opened restaurant but my experience has been anything but good. How can you call yourself a Chicago pizza place and have the deep dish pizza as your signature dish and tell your customers once they are already seated "sorry we don't have the oven yet"? Besides the lack thereof pizza, the poor service was enough to make you scream. The restaurant was dead yet we couldn't get our waiter's attention... The whole service staff was too busy chatting with each other.
