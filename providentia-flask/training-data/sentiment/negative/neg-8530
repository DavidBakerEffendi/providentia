Use to be an awesome place to come buy a beer and play a board game. Last time I went I felt very unwelcomed. They have a lunch time I've never heard of where apparently if you are sitting down with friends and not ordering food you are "taking up space" as the manager told us. By the way, their was plenty of space. I understand if it was packed and need more tables inside, but he could of at least been nicer about it all. 

Not sure if they changed management but it's no good lately. Honestly the food is over priced for what it is, and the music at times is way too loud for the place.
