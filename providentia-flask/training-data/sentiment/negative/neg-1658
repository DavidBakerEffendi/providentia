This has happened to me too many times so I felt the need to put them on blast. Went through the drive-thru and when I got home the order was not right. There's nothing worse than being hella hungry and finding your food to be not what you wanted! How f-ing hard is it to read an order and make it correctly. This is the last time I will be forced to eat something I didn't want. Drive-thru customers beware!!  Check your order-inside and out-before you leave.
