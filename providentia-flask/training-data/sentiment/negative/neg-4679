At first this place reminded me of NJ pizza
But over and over I keep getting disappointed.
Tonight we ordered wings ( frozen thrown into the fryer) mozzarella sticks ( cold pieces of rectangular hard cheese) and a large pie, 1/2 plain 1/2 sausage, mushroom and onion.  The onions were raw thrown on top, I think I may have counted 4 bits of mushrooms total and it was over loaded by slices of sausage ( not ground what is what Were use to in NJ) and the overall crust was soggy!
and all this was almost 50.00!!!!! Seriously!!! 
I wanted to like this place, but this is my last time ordering from them or going to the restaurant.
