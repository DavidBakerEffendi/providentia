This review is just for the dumb girl answering the phone. We had no chance to actually try the food. When first calling we were placed on hold... and hold... and hold... finally she answered.  My wife had to give her phone number not once , not twice but three times. Then the fun of trying to give our address .... which took my wife spelling the 4 letter name of our address 5 times... then trying to spell their name of our cross streets..  nope done. Wife told the idiot never mind and she got all excited saying OK GREAT THANK YOU ! And slammed the phone down.  Great people working here.. not. And now seeing all their bad reviews im glad we didn't get them order through.
