Oh boy.  Where to begin.  We came here for dinner before the 3 Doors Down concert and did not have a pleasant experience.  We ordered a bottle of Querceto.  The first bottle was corked and our server agreed.  We got a new bottle and this one was corked as well.

At this time the GM came over and presented a "special bottle" he had.  It was Match Chardonnay.  You could just tell by looking at the bottle it was nothing special.  

The dinner was OK.  Food was nothing special but our server was definitely trying.

We then got the check and the manager said he would just "price match" the Chardonnay to the $44 bottle of Querceto.  I thought this sounded suspicious as I didn't think the Match bottle was $44.  We then asked for a menu and sure enough "Match Chardonnay" isn't on their menu.  The GM then came over and said he would do their "house Chardonnay" price and on the new receipt it said "Match Chardonnay".

I work in F&B.  I know how menu items and button requests work.  The Match Chardonnay on the receipt said $33.  The unethical GM was trying to nickel and dime us when we had 2 bad bottles of wine.  Is this real life?  

We are foodies and have met several other foodies out and about and have shared our story at any chance we get.  As a general manager or ethical human being your job is to wow the guest and to turn around negative experiences - not to rip the guest off hoping they wouldn't catch what you're trying to do.

This same bottle of wine is offered at Pizza Rock at GVR for $36 or so and they have half off wine night and their wine isn't corked.

Everything about the experience was "meh" but the experience with the GM was absolutely ridiculous.
