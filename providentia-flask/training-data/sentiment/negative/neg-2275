The guy that answers the phone his name is Alexandre! He rude and annoying and have no respect to customers or to the place he works for. I have asked a simple question and all he replied back saying was "really" !!!!!!???!!!! It's definitely a bad experience that doesn't match with brand name. This message is for Dominos pizza management team please make sure you you monitor your staff!!! It is an embarrassment that you have people working like Alexandre.
