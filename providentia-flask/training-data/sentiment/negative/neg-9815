Was completely d√®isappointed...... waiting time was unbelievable long..... arrived 615 sharp. In the dark by 630. First course came 730!!!!! We finished appertizer. Super heavy dressing !!!! Few pieces of green that's not fresh!  my friend and i need to use washroom . By the time it's 755.  we came back WAITED longer. Main course arrived ..... the meat was super tough Napkins was super thin and rough...... like cafateria quality Napkins....I saw onoir replied in comment their napkin is thick and premium quality but that's not true at all.....table were sticky !!!! Cutlery were low quality . Sounds was so loud can't hear my group talking as more people came in ........ finally dessert.....way too much whip cream....and that chocolate cake taste dry and old......server took on wayyyyyyyyy too many table. Never came back to check on us !!!! At the end , when we go outside to pay for our bill  the staff that check us out say to us 18% is uaully the tips standard  !!! I am like .......I don't even want to pay 5 % tips with this experience !!!!!can't believe they have the guts to demand 18 % of tips!!!!!. I really think if onoir can improve on food quality (((that's the main thing to start!) I will still go back. I can put up with cheap napkin, sticky table, long waiting time for food. As long as the food is super delicious. Atmosphere I still give 5/5. Food quality 0/5. Our server 3/5. Staff that check us out 0/5. I honeslty would pay $100/person cost if the food is excellent , even with the same quantity of food i am getting. Hope owner and management really considerate our comment.
