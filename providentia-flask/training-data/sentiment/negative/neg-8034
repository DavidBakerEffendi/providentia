Absolutely gorgeous mural at their stall but absolutely disappointing food.

I shared the trio tasting platter ($16.99 I think) which came with the Reyna Salad + Lebanese Tacos (we paid extra $ for chicken & falafel) + Lamb Baklava.

Reyna Salad: Bland AF! It was like eating raw cabbage and radish. Where the flavour at? Where the dressing at?!

Lebanese Tacos: They recommended the chicken, which my friend had, but I had the falafel so I can't comment on the chicken. BUT the housemade flatbread used as the taco shell must've been the same...it was COLD (like came outta the fridge cold) and crumbly nasty. Flavour was OK.

Lamb Baklava: Mindf*ck because we left it to the end of meal thinking it was baklava for dessert... nope. It looks like a really pretty nest baklava with sweet pistachio on top but it is actually savoury with pulled lamb in the middle. The lamb was pretty good but the green pistachio looking syrup on top tasted kinda weird. It was also COLD.

They didn't look like they had a proper kitchen set up and everything were in a container so my mistake for picking this place! I'll give them benefit of doubt for this but I will not return especially at their price point.
