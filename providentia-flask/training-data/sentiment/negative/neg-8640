I went here with my family on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, the waiter was rude, and everything we got was inedible. I got the pad thai, and it was terrible. The chicken was deep fried, and 90% fat. I can safely say that Giant Eagle's pad thai is eons better. My brother got the hibachi, and it was slightly better than mine, but still dismal. The vegetables were mush, and the fried rice was burned to a crisp. One star is generous for this place.
