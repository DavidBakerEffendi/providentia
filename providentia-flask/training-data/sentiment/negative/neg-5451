Ooooo boy Gratitude. I really really wanted to like you.

Even though I did enjoy the food, I've thought it over and I can't justify giving more than one star. As many other reviews have mentioned, I will not be returning thanks to the awful service. There is no excuse for the level of rudeness here.

To start, my sister arrived early and waited at the door not knowing if she should seat herself as there is no sign indicating what to do. She ended up having to go up to the counter and ask if she was supposed to pick her own table to which the person replied in a less than pleasant tone "you can sit anywhere... but no one is going to help you for awhile. We're really busy."

The actual dining experience was uneventful other than overhearing one of the waitresses making fun of a customer for asking what the healthier options are. Apparently "it's all vegan... so it's all healthy" is an acceptable answer? Except there is a obvious health difference between a vegan pizza and a salad.

The biggest issue occurred when we were ready to leave. Instead of bringing over a copy of the receipt, the waitress only brought the credit machine. When my mom said she preferred to have a detailed receipt before paying (which by the way they legally HAVE to give their customers if they request it), the waitress threw a tantrum about how she wasn't going to "waste paper". She actually made my mother get up and walk over to their computer to look at the details on the screen, all the while lecturing her about wasted paper. Not exactly the most professional way to close the deal and ensure a good tip (or any tip for that matter).

I get that you want to be eco-friendly. No one recycles more than I do. However, if a customer requests a receipt, you do it without question. No one wants to go to a restaurant to be berated by the staff.
