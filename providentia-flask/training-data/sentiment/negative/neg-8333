Never ever will I ever come back here during dinner time... my friend and I came at 6:15 and we still waiting our main dish to come out!(it was about 7:40 by the time our stir fried noodles came out) The food is good but the service here not good at all!! They tried to blame what we ordered took the longest to cook!
