This place charges $2.50 for glass of pop with 3/4 of it being ice. No refills. doesn't inform you either that there's a charge.

The steak I had was plain. Pedestrian.  Didn't come with any side as they expect you to order extra and pay more. For the price I paid I would have had a set dinner at the keg. 

Holy rip off!!!

WILL NOT BE BACK
