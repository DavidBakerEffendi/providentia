Last Wednesday we decided to go for a cocktail after work. They weren't very busy, maybe 20 people total. We sat at a table right next to the bar and waited about five minutes without being acknowledged. We ended up going up to the bar to order drinks and we each got an appetizer, mini chimis. We sat back down and about ten minutes later, someone brought out our appetizers, set them down on the bar, and walked away. We sat there for about five minutes waiting for the bartender or a waitress to bring them to our table. Again, had to get up to go get them ourselves. My husband ate the mini chimis but not the shredded lettuce and tomato garnish that came with it. I ate the chimis and the garnish. Excruciating stomach cramps are what woke me up on Thursday morning. I was sick until Saturday. My guess is that the shredded lettuce hadn't been washed properly and sat there, probably in a little puddle of water in the bottom of a container, stewing in bacteria, before they put it on the plate. My bad for eating the garnish, I probably should have known better, but regardless, I'll never eat there again. The place's cleanliness already looks a little questionable, but this sealed the deal.
