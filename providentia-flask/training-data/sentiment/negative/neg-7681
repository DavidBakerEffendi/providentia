Is this place now under new ownership/management?!?!...WTF?! I have been going to this place for 15+ years, and now the service is HORRIBLE! 1. Half the number of staff. 2. No one taking orders for 10 minutes. 3. Flies everywhere inside. 4. At least 20 minutes longer than normal to get a simple bagel with schmear.  5. One-third the normal amount of schmear.  Time to find a new bagel & coffee shop.
