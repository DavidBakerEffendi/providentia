Crappiest place ever. Being going to Sam Woo in LA Chinatown since the late 70s. This place is such a poser. No one dish is half way decent. The prices are bay area prices for strip mall cheap eat, which one would expect with Sam Woo. The jook lacks flavor with out a traditional broth base and tofu skin. It tasted like over cooked rice with added hot water. The salted fish fried rice was without the Chinese anchovy which make it tasted like cardboard. The chow fun lacks what Alton Brown calls "wok hay". It was more like fun with soy sauce and sprout.
To top this, they are a cash only business.
How stone age can this place be?
