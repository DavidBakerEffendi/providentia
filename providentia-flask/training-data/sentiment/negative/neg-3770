We were a little early so waited until 11 anyway. We walked in and the hostess said oh I'm sorry I forgot to lock the door back. I said don't you open at 11? She replied well I don't have a cook here and I'm not sure when I will. Maybe probably an hour or so. So can't review the food but service was a joke as you can read. We won't give it another shot.
