As a diehard Packer fan living in Phoenix, I have been going to Casey Jones' for 4 seasons almost every Sunday.  Each year has progressively gotten worse than the last.  Service is appalling, food quality is dirt poor (except for the wings), everything is filthy, and the hospitality, overall, is terrible.  A week ago I went in; it started the season off on a bad note... I even called the manager over to explain that I am a loyal customer and hadn't seen it this bad EVER.  He didn't have much to say as I gave him some gentle feedback on my experiences, he didn't even apologize or thank me for my loyal business.  I pledged to myself I will never drop another nickel in that place again after that.  Not even for a DIE HARD Packer fan...
