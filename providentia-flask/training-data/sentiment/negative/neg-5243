I really have some expectation for this place after knowing this dessert place is from Hong Kong.  So my friend, hubby and I wanna give it a try on the 2nd day of its soft opening.  Sorry that I must say it's really bad.  All of us ordered traditional Chinese dessert to give it a test-Black sesame walnut sweet soup with dumplings, walnut almond sweet soup & black sesame red bean sweet soup.  Here's our comments:

-hot dessert should be hot not room temp
-black sesame doesn't has its aroma, bitter in taste
-red bean soup and almond soup were watery.  Almond soup same as black sesame doesn't has almond taste at all.  Even the instant almond drink I have daily taste a lot better.
-Dumpling seems like undercooked, hard inside.
-no water being served (actually included us, there were only 3 tables, so no excuse being busy)

According to my hubby, he saw some desserts were reheat by microwave.  

The only thing we like it's the decor.....

One of the waitress asked us for comment and we did tell her the truth.  She told us another customer also complained the dessert not hot.  We received a $10 cash coupon valid till Feb 12, but do u think I will go again??
