Omg I wish this place Stop makes me disappointed.

First, they changed owner.
So don't expect pre-owner's nice services from new owner. 
I went this place at 10pm. 
And I got my food at 10:40pm.
There was one big table ( looks like owner's friends) and one other table. ( they came later than my table but they got food faster than us) 
After that, I was about to ask a check to owner but she didn't answer at all so I decided to walk to her to get a check. 
Ridiculous part is she smiled to other table and handed to them and tell thank,plz come back again.
But she just threw the check to my table without saying anything
Okay bye I will never come back
