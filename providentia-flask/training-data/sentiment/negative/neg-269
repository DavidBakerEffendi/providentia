I'm not a big fan of all you can eat sushi  and I didn't bother coming back to this restarant anyway. What shocks me is the complaint about the cleanliness of the restaurant came in January 2014. It took one year and a half to fine the owners...... What other places the population of Montreal is visiting without suspecting there are similar problems.
