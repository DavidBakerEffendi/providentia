Second time coming here and had terrible experience with the service both times. I don't care how good the food is, the manager there was a joke. First she told us we couldn't use the free appetizer voucher that was issued by the hotel and the hotel "doesn't know anything" her words, because they are 2 separate companies, and then told us we need to have minimum of $10 purchase, which we did: me and my boyfriend each had $20 restaurant week tasting menu. We truly didn't care about the $13 appetizer, but she was so feisty about the whole situation that we felt like our dining experience was completely ruined. Her last word was: I will take care of this, but I just want you to know that you weren't supposed to use this, and then she stormed away. What a great job to take care of your customers! I would never come back here again because of the treatment we received, and I recommend anyone to stay away.
