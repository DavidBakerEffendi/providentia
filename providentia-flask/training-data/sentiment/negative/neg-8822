All hype I say. All. Hype.

To start, we ordered the Paella Arancini ($13).  Our waiter brought out 3 round crusted balls... wha??  It turned out to be really good.  A lot of flavor, it's like eating a bite-size version of paella.  Nice start.

We both opted for salad... I had the BLT Salad ($11) while my boyfriend ordered the Beso Beso Salad ($14).  Nothing fancy or unique that made these salads stand out.  The bacon was thick and salty and somewhat overpowering over the rest of the salad including the bleu cheese dressing.

For our  main entree, since they were out of the Kansas City Strip (a steakhouse out of steak on a Saturday  night???), I had the 12oz Filet Mignon cooked 'medium' ($42) and my boyfriend ordered the Crispy Striped Bass ($38).  My steak was dry... even the center was dry... perfect shade of pink, but dry.  The striped bass was crispy alright, but rich in salt.  Very salty.  Personally, I like salty foods, but anyone can pan fry a striped bass for less that what Beso charges.

We also had the Asparagus ($10) and Mac & Cheese ($9) for our sides.  I enjoyed the aspagarus as it was sauteed in garlic.  The mac & cheese was just ok... and me being a self-proclaimed mac & cheese connoisseur, I was disappointed.  It was creamy and rich but it was lacking flavor.  Just bland and soft... nothing more than cheese & pasta.

I was extremely disappointed with my experience here and will most likely not be returning.  I think I'll stick to restaurants owned by well-known chefs than well-known actors/actresses.
