I'm sorry but I cannot figure out for the life of me why they have so many good reviews.  Seriously, where is everyone eating at that they think this place is so great? My only thought is that all of the good reviews is due to the fact they have so many gluten free and vegan options, which I assume is hard to find at restaurants.  

Went in tonight for dinner around 5:30pm and although there were only 4 tables filled, it took 10 mins to get seated - including 3 employees all passing by saying they would be back to help us.  Our waiter had no personality and was invisible most of the time.  We ordered mozzarella sticks to start but never got them  (I know he heard because he asked if we wanted 6 or 10).  He finally came back at the end asking how my drink was... I just wanted our check and pizza packed up so I didn't tell him how awful it was - hence the reason it was barely drank.  

We got two of the smallest sized pizzas to share - Bianca was decent but tastes exactly like every other pizza places version of it.  Thin crust pepperoni was very blah.  We have at least a full pizza worth that will probably end up going to my dog or the trash in a few days.  No interest at all in eating it - not worth the calories.  

I'm quite annoyed that I wasted $50 for dinner tonight.  My daughter and I always try to go to local places and want to try new places when possible.  Bad customer service + bad food = FAIL!
