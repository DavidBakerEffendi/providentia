DON'T GO TO THIS CHEESEBURGER CHEESEBURGER LOCATION...... NOT EVEN 1 STAR WORTHY!!! 
Gotta say this place is the worst. Waite staff is scattered unorganized. Took 2.5 hours to get seated order taken and brought to table. Order was wrong and terrible quality. Had to get up 3 times to go to counter and ask whats the problem. Three tables of people and they said they were so busy. They didnt get the orders right at any table. Charged us for things we didnt ask for. Didnt get shakes till we were leaving. And quality was disgusting. Super expensive to be helped by staff that seemed spun on meth. Kept saying sorry as the service got worse. #1 worst places in all clark county. 40.00 for terrible food and worst service. Never ever again. This location doesnt deserve a second chance. Maybe a DEA raid.
