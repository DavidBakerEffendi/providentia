Being a local we came here last night on Halloween to chill since we didn't want to deal with the craziness of the strip or even Fremont St. The place is clean with reasonable drink prices and human size games which is a nice twist. 
We got there around 9:30 and was able to find some seats in the backyard patio which was nice because there was a live band and a bar outside. Besides that we had 2 waitresses serving us so that was pretty cool to not even have to leave our seats.
Around midnight a staff member named GiGi approaches us to let us know that we were sitting in a VIP area and if we wanted to stay there we would have to pay $600 for bottle service. I told her that we've been there for hours and have probably bought 8 rounds of drinks without the servers ever mentioning to us that we were in a VIP area. Her excuse was the waitresses were "NEW"and didn't know. I'm sorry but that is not our problem when you can not train your staff properly, you don't have any reserve signs, nor is the area sectioned off with a velvet rope or security, and on one of your busiest nights of the year your staff does not know where the VIP section is. 
GiGi thank you for ruining our night. If we had known before we had already bought all those drinks through your waitresses and at the bar this review might have been more  pleasant. We went there to get away from the lines and bottle service bs. Plus no where else in the whole damn place did I see bottle service.

Update: Some of my  friends stayed and said no one sat in their "VIP" area at all that night. If you didn't try to force bottle service on us we would have spent more $$$$. Oh well maybe you'll be more prepared next year and train your staff properly.
