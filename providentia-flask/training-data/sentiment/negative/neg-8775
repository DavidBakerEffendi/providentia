We had a terrible experience with this restaurant. The woman helping us seemed annoyed to be there. When we ordered our food we told her we wanted our chips and salsa to go but we woukd eat thd frybread in the restaurant. She responded by saying "ok". When we received our order, she forgot our chips and salsa so we asked her for them. She then proceeded to give us chips in a bowl and salsa in a squirt bottle. We sat down with the chips, took a few bites and then decided to ask for a to go bag for the chips and a container of salsa since we had asked for it to go in the first place. When I asked the woman helping us for some salsa to go it was as if she turned into a monster. She told us emphatically that she has to charge us additional money for salsa because she only charged the in house price for salsa, not the to go price. After listening to her rant ABOUT A SIDE OF SALSA we decided to take the high road, thank her for the food and leave. We will never visit this establishment again, nor do I recommend that you waste your time walking in that place.
