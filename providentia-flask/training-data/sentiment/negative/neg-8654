This place has the worst customer service ever.  The employees would rather be doing anything, but helping customers.  They always have their back to the door and the counter, so they don't see when customers walk in, or when they are standing at the counter to order.
 I was there last week, and to walk into the restaurant, I had to walk by 2 employees taking their break outside of the store.  They were sitting at the tables (for customers) along with 4 other people, smoking  right next to the front door.  They were inches from the NO SMOKING sign issued to all chandler businesses, and were wearing their Einstein bagel uniforms.  This is so unprofessional.  
 You can definitely tell they do not enjoy their jobs.  The customer is not a priority to them, we as customers are more of a bother.
