Unfortunately the experience was horrid , I  walked in the walls were painted black with black light bulbs I was glowing . The temperature was very warm ,sweating made me  feel uncomfortable. The table was extremely small and confined... plates didn't fit . Service was mediocre at best and the food was not authentic .
