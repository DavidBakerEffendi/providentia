Waited almost 40 minutes for food. Food came out cold, like it was in the refrigerator. Asked for no tomatoes in both meals, both came with tomatoes. Physically watched waitress touch 2 stacks of pancakes, with bare hands, right after she had wiped a table down. Needless to say, we will not be coming back.
