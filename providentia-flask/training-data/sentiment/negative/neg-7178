I will keep this short and simple. This is probably one of my worst experience in a Chinese owned restaurant. I never expect much service from a restaurant like this as I go in for the food primarily. Food was decent however here came the problem- we were first timers. We ordered 1 to 2 orders of certain items, however we had no idea  "4pcs" on the menu means 4 skewers per order. At the end approximately 50 skewers plus rice plus baked scallops and enoki mushroom came to the table. When we handed in our order to the server "apparently manager" he did not inform us the fact we over ordered. Knowing when you punch in $144 worth of skewers for 2 people, any server seeing that should have noticed the fact or at least just simply ask "are you sure?" That would've raised a flag. Our bill was $144 and they had the decency to ask for tip. I gave $5 for the kitchen staff and others that weren't involved as I know they are a pool tip environment. Honestly, my night was completely ruined during and after that. Table was already small, and they literally PACKED the table with skewers I didn't even have space to eat. I know Chinese owned restaurant don't usually have "the keg service" but come on...make some common sense for your customers at the least.
