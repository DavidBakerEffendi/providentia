This is probably one of the worst Chinese place in town. Overpriced dish and not enough food in each. Went there for the high ratings, was very disappointed with the food and service. The noodles taste average, and taste like MSG (you can feel the thirst after MSG). They do suspected tax evasion practice too, asking you to pay cash over card with a discount on the price as incentive. Won't recommend it to friends and family.

To the response from the restaurant:
Your defensive & passive aggressive response reflects the way you treat your customers: hostile & irrespecutful. Also, you can stop lying about MSG. You know you use MSG in your food. Taste buds don't lie. Using MSG is Okay, lying is not. Again, I am not recommending your place. Your attitude to your customers is as disastrous as your business.
