I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.  We took the whole family there for Mother's Day brunch, which was advertised to have carving stations, breakfast buffet, dessert table and more!  I could of taken my money and stayed all night at the Holiday Inn and ate the free breakfast Buffet and had much better food and presentation.  The food looked and taste like it came from Costco.  It was a complete waste of my time and money.
