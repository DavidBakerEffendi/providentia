Really disappointed in the Taphaus. We were excited to finally try it on Sat during the Wild West days but won't be going back. The service was not good, slow at best. We ordered chicken tenders and pretzel for starters, both were obviously frozen pre-made crap. I wouldn't have cared so much if the pretzel and really really terrible cheese weren't seven freakin dollars! The same pretzel is cheaper at a Dbacks game. Don't know how this place will stay in business much longer which is a bummer b/ it's a cool place.
