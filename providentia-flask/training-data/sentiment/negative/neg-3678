I really wanted to like this restaurant after seeing all the great pictures and reviews on Yelp. I was here on a Sunday night and the kitchen was slammed. They were sold out of the pasta dish I wanted and it took an hour (not exaggerating) for our plates to arrive. 

My friend told me you should never order seafood in the desert. Now I know why, because my salmon was so overcooked and dry that I had to ask for extra lemons just to make the taste bearable. My colleagues had burgers and a kale bowl and only 2/6 of us enjoyed our dinner.

Maybe it was an off night during our visit, but our experience was really disappointing. Although our server tried to be nice about the slow service, he did not really do anything to make up for it.
