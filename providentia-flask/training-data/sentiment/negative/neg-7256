Sunday brunch - with a reservation for 7. There was another large party that arrived at opening with a reservation as well. We kept being told about a "large birthday party" the night before as the reason for nothing going right. While the food was GREAT, our cocktails took over 20 minutes, more than 3 requests to get lemons for waters that never got refilled, our appetizers arrived after the entrees, and everything was slow. We greatly enjoyed the food, but won't be back.
