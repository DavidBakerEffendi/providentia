The resto has no patrons at 6pm on Sat. There's no Bud light when they advertise it mainly up front. The staff is not Japanese, has poor communication skills. Told them not to put mayo and still served the dish with it. They were friendly though, with clean surroundings but with generic decor consistent with other Korean owned sushi restaurant in Los Angeles. I don't get it that they open a sushi bar not knowing how unagi sauce should taste like; they watered it down and added thickener. Their "deals" on their happy hour are all rolls with nougat-y rice loaded with MAYO(?). They have 4 big TV screens in silent mode. No music and all you can hear are the staff speaking loudly at each other in their native tongue. They didn't welcome any feedback so they will never have a shot on getting better.DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. Not worth it.
