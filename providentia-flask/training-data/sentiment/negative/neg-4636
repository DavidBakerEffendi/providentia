State street brats has a dress code that openly discriminates against marginalized communities in Madison. When this was brought to light on social media, outraged patrons began to write reviews expressing their anger and feelings. As their ratings dropped, Brats responded by removing their ratings and reviews from their Facebook page. This establishment is no good and will not address the concerns of the community. This is a racist establishment an no one should give them their business.
