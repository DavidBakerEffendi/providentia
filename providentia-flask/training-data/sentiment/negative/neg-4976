Let me start by warning all potential visitors of the prices. I paid $4 for a 22oz fountain drink. The pizza was priced more reasonably at $14.95 for a 12 inch pie and additional $1.50 for toppings. Overall the pizza was extremely bland. I have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store. I ate a slice and dumped the rest. There are lots of options around the same area of the strip - you're better off going elsewhere.
