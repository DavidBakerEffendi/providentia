This location doesn't work well under pressure, waited for Kung pao chicken while the chef continually cooked the same orange chicken over and over again although it was full. Now don't get me wrong I know orange chicken is there most popular dish, but why make me wait well over half an hour for my kung pao if the rest of my food is sitting under a heating lamp. I wasn't to pleased and don't get me wrong the staff was not rude at all good attitude just not good at multitasking.
