I bought 2 9-grain bagels and I must say they were the hardest, driest bagels I've ever eaten. My husband raves about how good the blueberry muffins are at Wildflower, and I was craving a bagel so I decided to give them a try. Not only was I completely ignored by the staff, but by the time I got home and tried the bagels I was definitely ready to get back in the bed and try breakfast again another day.
