I seem to be let down every time I make an attempt to go. I ordered he bacon burger and I feel like I could have got the same thing for half the price at a Wendy's. We sat for about 5 minutes just looking at our food because we were not given silverware or napkins. It's not quite summertime here in AZ yet the AC was blasting and it was freezing at 9:00 pm. The table behind us had their poor little kids in coats .
