I've been to this chipotle about 15 times since my wife is obsessed. There are literally 100 other Mexican good places in this city but this is what she likes. Normally I deal with it because we're able to get in and get out. Tonight was probably the worst service I've ever received while coming to this place. Right before me a customer was told that he had to wait for chicken because they ran out. I guess he waited about 15 mins and they never called him to tell him it was ready so they sold it to other costumers. I waited in line patiently and then tried to order. The girl making the food made me repeat myself about 20 times...no exaggeration...because she was talking to people on the line. Then I tried to order and she laughed because they were out of soft taco tortillas. They only gave me two. Who I assume was the manager did nothing. As I tried to leave the door was locked..I asked if someone could let me out and they pointed to a side door and laughed at me like I was an idiot because they locked the door. I will never go back to this place..The way the manager treated the person in front of me and myself should warrant at the very least disciplinary action. Extreme poor representation of the brand, restaurant, and the company.
