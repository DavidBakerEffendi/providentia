So, I really wanted to like this place. Family run, in the neighbourhood, and the reviews were positive. 

Unfortunately, this was one of the worst experiences I have had in a restaurant. 

Where to begin:
1. It was raining and cold, yet they had both the garage door and front door open. It was freezing inside. Most people kept their coats on.
2. Once I had ordered my meal and it was brought to me, I was informed that the maple syrup I had asked for was not available. I was offered some substitute, which I did not want on my French toast (which I had asked for on brown bread, but came made with white). They offered to bring me a different meal. In the interest of keeping the peace (I was having breakfast with 5 other people), I accepted. 
3. The meal that was eventually brought to me was less that mediocre, and much to my dismay, I discovered part way through eating it that the bread on my plate was mouldy. At that point, I was done. The fascinating part was that I had to inform them that I would not be paying for the disaster that I had just experienced. 
5. The Crossfit going on upstairs felt like having breakfast under a jackhammer. 
4. Everyone at my table was seriously unhappy with our experience. We will not be visiting again.
