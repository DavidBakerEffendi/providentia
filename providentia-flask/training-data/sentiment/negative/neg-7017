Definitely should have read the reviews about this place before coming to try and enjoy a lunch here. 
HORRIBLE! 
Absolutely horrible. 
The food was so disgusting. I got the Baja burrito with chicken. I wish I would have taken pictures but I just had to throw it away. My burrito was so soggy I could barely pick it up with out some kind of grease dripping down my hand. And the chicken was not even cooked all the way. Some chicken was hot some little cold. The chips were okay. Tasted very stale and chewy. As for the salsa, NO.  
As for the customer service big thumbs DOWN! Who was ever working March 18, 2017 around 4:30pm, has such an attitude problem. And she was disgusting eating her food at the register while she taking our order. That there in itself should have told us to leave. I'm at least glad my friend didn't get anything to share in this disgust of a good place. 

Just don't eat here. Plan and simple its horrible!!
