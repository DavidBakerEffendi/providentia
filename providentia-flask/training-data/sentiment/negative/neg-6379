Terrible service.  On my way out somebody cut in front of me to check out and the cashier just right on let her do it.  Also for the money the food was way overpriced.  I paid $15 just for their crummy bare bones breakfast with two eggs two strips of bacon and hashed potatoes with coffee.  Not worth it for sure.  It's like a rip off.  For what I was paying for the food wasn't that great.  For what I paid it should of only cost $8.00 even with cash.  That way there would be more money left over for a tip
