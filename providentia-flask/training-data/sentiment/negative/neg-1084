Surprise Surprise, the food quality at a Chinese buffet is less than stellar, I know, big shock.

We went here on a holiday so there was promise of crab legs and lobster in the buffet.  These things were in the buffet, but they were not good.  You can't expect seafood to be perfectly cooked if it sits in a steam tray for hours.  And the crab legs and lobster were not pre cracked, and they do not have the proper utensils for guests either.  All the flesh  was impossible to get to, and was shrunken and clung to the shell.

There was also no rhyme or reason to the placement of things in the buffet.  The chocolate pudding was found beside the potato salad.  The sweet and sour sauce was with the salad dressings that were beside the soup...

The only good things I had from the buffet were the won ton soup, and  the pork dumpling.  They do have a made to order stir-fry station that looked promising however I didn't get that far before I was full from over-fried, over cooked, over battered cheap food.  Only took 2 trips, as I avoided the section with french fries and onion rings.

Hardly worth the $54 for 2 people including soft drinks.  Make sure you have a coupon.
