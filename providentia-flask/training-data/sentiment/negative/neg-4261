Let me start by saying I work in this mall and have taken my lunch break numerous times here and never had a problem. But today, we took our hour lunch break here during a very slow time of the day and sat in Larry's section. Not only was the server rude and couldn't muster a smile the entire time, but our food took an hour to come out. We tried explaining we were on break and only had an hour, only to get eye rolls in response. The end result was all of our food having to be boxed and taken home to eat after work and we ate bread for lunch. Not a pleasant experience, literally all our server had to do was apologize for the food taking longer and smile. Instead we left with empty stomachs and a bad mood.
