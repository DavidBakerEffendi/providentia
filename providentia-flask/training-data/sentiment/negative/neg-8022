Not that great food. Overpriced. The chef RM (had never heard of him before) has created a recipe that mixes bacon beer and mussels (who eats that?). The sturgeon I had was just blah. The papaya salad was average. The price of the farm raised (which I confirmed) sturgeon was $42. The price of papaya salad $12. I think the food is overrated and way overpriced. I accidentally discovered on google it was rated 4.5. Trust the yelp reviews. Summary: overpriced and food that you can find cheaper and better in the Midwest (I guess most tourists in Vegas come from Midwest and south).
