This place is misleading.  Wineburger is a great concept and name, but the place is nothing more than a strip mall burger joint.  Like other reviews, it's 95% bar, 5% restaurant with a cheers type atmosphere. 
Went on a Wednesday night and all the TVs were on a infomercial channel.  When I asked if they could put something else on, the middle aged Persian bartender told me that the cable was out and somehow we were stuck with a P90x drone .  Another flaw, the ventilation is so poor that you smell like you actually  fried the burgers on your stovetop. 
Many better places in Phoenix
