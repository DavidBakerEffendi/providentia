Terrible place. Nothing good to say, and we eat out all the time and are easy going. Beautiful atmosphere and wine room but the wine came out bad. Service was terrible and waited so long for water glasses to be filled, actually had to go to the bar for water refills. I had the chicken, guest had the fish. Both were dryers out. Like they had been precooked and under a heat lamp. And to end the night, the bill was $200.00. They better work on their service and quality soon or we will looking at another Scottsdale Resturant available for rent.
