Great food. Great service. However, we used a Living Social for two dinners with two glasses of wine... We upgraded our wine to a bottle... The manager did not grant the correct price discount. We had to argue the price difference. Shady! Just take advantage of your voucher and get out! Mary, server, was awesome.
