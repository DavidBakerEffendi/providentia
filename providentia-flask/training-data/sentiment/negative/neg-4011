Tonight was my first time at this place and my last! I go to bosas faithfully. I happened to be on this side of town so I stopped here. Something told me not to just from the area. And I was right, the donuts were hard and horrible! They tried to tell me the donuts were just made which was a lie! Then they charge almost 1.00 more for their nasty ass donut holes that taste DISGUSTING! They are lucky to even get 1 star outta me!!
