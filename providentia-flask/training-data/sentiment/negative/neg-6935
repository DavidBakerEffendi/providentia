Wow! what a disappointment. We were treated to the hostess's butt; she never did turn around. Then it took forever for our server to get to us. The food was good but when we told our server that one of our shrimp was chicken, she laughed and didn't do anything about it. The rest of the service was very very slow and half way through our meal our server said she was going on break and we had to cash out. When we said oh well no more drinks or dessert, she said she could ring in our drinks, give us upside down shot glasses and we could flag someone down when we were ready and she could get us our dessert now! Woo hoo! The manager came over to take our money and when we asked her how short staffed was she, she said she wasn't and walked away. She sent someone else  over with our change so she wouldn't have to talk to us again. No wonder this place has lousy reviews.
