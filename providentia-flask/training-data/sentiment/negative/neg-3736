Last night, my girlfriend and I made a reservation via OpenTable for dinner at Parallax. It came highly recommended and we were excited to try this place. When we arrived, the entrance and bar were overflowing with patrons. We approached the host, who, without even asking if we had a reservation told us "I'm on about an hour and a half wait". I mentioned that we had a reservation, and he asked the name. After finding it, he continued by saying "So you do. As I mentioned, I'm on an hour and a half wait and there are people with reservations from an hour ago who haven't been sat yet". 

The bottom line is that we never got to experience Parallax, nor will we try again. Clearly their staff has no customer service training, and either they're incapable of running efficiently or drastically overbook their capacity.

Save yourself the time and energy...go elsewhere in Tremont. We ended up eating at Fahrenheit and it was outstanding.
