They botched my order for a burrito bowl and made a (very loosely packed and lightly filled) burrito. Not a big deal, petty really. The solution was to dump the insides into a bowl. The end. No effort to make a new one, and a couple ingredients were left out too. Airport food is already overpriced, and this was dreadful. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE. GET A BAGEL 10FT AWAY.

In summary:
- terrible customer service
- small portions
- poor problem solving skills
- missing ingredients
