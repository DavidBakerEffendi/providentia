employees are less than friendly.
has management ever heard of greeting customers ?? ohhh wait that would mean you need to take your face out of your cell phone and stop texting. New employee completely not ready to be left alone especially not at lunch time. Third employee grunts when you speak to him. If you all hate your jobs that much GET OUT Otherwise remember you work in a service industry put a damn smile on your face and fake it till you make it!!!
