Horrid Service, iffy food

NY Style, pepperoni pizza - bleh. Salad was actually pretty good. Teeniest chicken wings I've ever seen.

Delivery only brought part of the order. Took another two hours to get the wings.

Then it turned out they charged us 6 times on our card - $150!!! Went to their place twice, called multi[ple times. Still trying to get our money back.
