Big disappointment. The Hibachi is cooked then covered in teriyaki sauce which is not on the menu. The chicken was cooked plain then dumped into the teriyaki sauce. The waitress forgot the soup and salad. When I told her that the teriyaki was not on the menu and is not typical for hibachi. She came out with the more traditional sauces and said dip in that. I would not come back here maybe try the sushi. The mixed green salad was only ice berg.  They have us 10% off. Would give zero stars.
