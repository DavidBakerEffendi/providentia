OMG this was the worst sushi experience I have ever had.  The reviews seemed ok and I live close so I thought it would be worth trying even though I have several sushi places I usually am willing to drive to.  This meal was a complete waste of money.  I have had bad sushi before but never where it was spoiled and unable to eat it.  I sent my Amaebi back to the Chef and not only did the staff not find some fresh shrimp to replace it with they didn't even mention it again.  I didn't ask for it to be replaced as I was so turned off from it I don't think I could have eaten it if they did give it to me. Several other types of fish they served was smelly and fishy but just starting to spoil and still edible but not enjoyable.  The rice on the sushi was warm and the fish tasted like it had been unthawed.  I inquired about the rice being so hot and the lady told me the health department makes them do that.  I eat a lot of sushi and nowhere else have I found rice like this.  My daughter had chicken teriyaki and they gave her very little chicken and it was completely dried out and overcooked.  Waitresses seem nice when you sit down then tend ignore you when you want to order more but I could live with that if the food was ok.  Complete waste of time and worst restaurant experience I have had in Vegas in over 20 years of living here.  This place will be out of business soon.  If you can't even eat or slightly enjoy a meal it doesn't even deserve a 0.  My wife enjoyed her desert a lot and said the coconut tempura shrimp was pretty good but thought her sushi was no good. You will resent eating here.
