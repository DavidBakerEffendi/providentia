Do not come here. My group and I did not like the experience here at all. First, we didn't get our waters even after we asked twice. I had to flag one waiter down again just to make sure we got them. They charged us $14 for a combo of  roast pork and chicken, and the plate was small! The fried rice was mediocre at BEST. The tea was not great and our server should not have been given a tip but this place automatically adds the tip to your final bill. What kind of restaurant does that? Never coming back here.
