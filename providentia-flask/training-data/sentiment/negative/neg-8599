One star because can't give 0 stars. 

$21 for a large meats calzone. The thinnest lackluster calzone I have ever received. Way over priced for crap. $9 for 3 chicken tenders. Expected the largest meatiest tenders ever. Instead. Received paper thin microwave would have been better tenders. For $9 could have gotten a caniac combo at Canes and also received fries, Texas toast, coleslaw, six meaty tenders and a drink. 

This place is a disgrace!  If you can't make a calzone or even serve a tender that is thicker than a piece of paper you shouldn't call yourself a pizzeria. 

Never again will I waste money on this craphole again. Disappointing. Disgusting. Ripoff. Stay away!
