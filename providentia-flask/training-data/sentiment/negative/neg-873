So the Healthy Greek shut down and 1 Love Kitchen opens advocating healthy Caribbean cuisine. I was very excited to try their curry chicken so that's exactly what I ordered on my first visit! 

I was disappointed not only because of the small portions - the curry was on top of a very thin layer of rice - but because everything tasted watered down, including the curry itself and the coleslaw on the side. I've never tasted coleslaw that wasn't creamy so the watery taste was quite unpleasant. 

The layout has not changed from when the place used to be the Healthy Greek, but they need a lot more lighting - it is way too dark inside if you're eating in. The McDonalds style garbage disposal added to the fast food ambiance, but for the price to portion/taste ratio, I would prefer to go to Mickey Dees.

It's difficult to create delicious food with healthy cooking and 1 Love Kitchen definitely needs improvement. I'm not sure why there are raving reviews, but the food here definitely lacks flavor.
