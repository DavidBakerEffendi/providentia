I do not like writing bad reviews as you can see from my previous entries. Upon checking in, I wrote a review that expressed the beauty of this property- from the large rooms, to the variety of slots and of course the feel of being in Italy when visiting the Canal Shops. However, during my stay I have never been so poorly treated. The customer service here, even for elite invited guests, which we were, is horrific! To start, housekeeping is loud, intrusive and they do not clean your room! I could hear them all the time from my room yelling across the hall! Next came the dealers and pit bosses. We are high players and stay in the Wynn every year where the service is impeccable! One Chinese dealer, on the night shift, by the name of Jennifer. made our playing so unpleasant that I had to leave the table. She yelled, falsely degraded our ways of playing and threw out winnings when we won. Not to mention she kept snarling and saying things in Chinese to another friend that was not playing, but yet sitting in the table and referring to us while laughing and glaring at us. Never have I had such a terrible experience playing in my life. The pit boss, Mary, was uncooperative too and tried to ignore the situation. Never addressing the dealers unprofessional and demeaning behavior. Lastly, after all this, and the amount of money we contributed to the Venetian, they did not comp us completely and made us pay in the end for our invited stay. Terrible, horrible experience here! It's a shame because the property is very lovely. The customer service- the worst in Vegas- from top to bottom! Will not stay here again and highly discourage anyone else with the myriad of excellent hotels and service minded staff on the strip.
