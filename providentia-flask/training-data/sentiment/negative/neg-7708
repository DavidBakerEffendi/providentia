Ewwww Ewwww Ewwwww besides the long wait and trashy looking non- organize establishment that is ran by 1...yes 1 employee, who was so busy and had no clue what he was doing, he also had his phone on the same work station and prep board where he makes the wrap and taco. Pretty Gross, my husband a 20 year combat marine veteran actually even had to sit down because of the long wait. He even told to me that he should hurdle the counter to help the kid out. Wow, we bailed out without getting a smoothie we didn't even got recognized for even walking in there. We didn't realized we  had super powers ,! And didn't know we can actually be invisible. Other than that......my husband recommended we go to to the tropical smoothie on sunset and Stephanie who has a least 8 employees in a very much smaller place we still got served  quicker despite the traffic and congestion of people in the area. This place need more employee and a good mgr. to run it.
