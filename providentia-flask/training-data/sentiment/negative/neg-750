The server was nice and they are Filipino but that's the only thing this place had going for them :(

Had the pancit it was supposed to come with chicken and shrimp instead it came with very fatty almost inedible pork, and a couple shrimp.

It was flavorless and I couldn't even bring myself to eat the leftovers.

The portions were great but the food was not. 
 It was also a little frustrating because we ordered and about ten minutes later a Filipino family walked in and received apps and their entrees before we received our food. 
It was a clean place and they have karaoke.
