The pics looked great ordered dinner for my family at 4th of july that they were completely unprepared for. Over an hr for a couple sandwiches and chicken tenders. The WORST french dip ever. It looked like leather that had been left in the Las Vegas desert. All fries were still frozen. The 2 chicken tenders had been so left out and dry no one would touch them so my kids and i ate my leather sandwich. (We were starving) But was worse we all got food poisoning from it. Never again! Be safe don't do as I did and eat from them.
