Wow!!!! I came here with high hope for delicious Korean food and boy was I let down or what. First off, the place is dead when we walked in. AC wasn't really working very great. We ordered Korean BBQ meat and rib to cook it ourselves on the grill. It's $20 per plate with 2 order minimum. We expect to see lots of it and the portion was so small. Kim chi is not fresh and I didn't end up eating any of it. Then I saw a spider at the top corner of the store. 

Service is great. But I sure will never come back here again. It is a big let down for me and I love Korean food.
