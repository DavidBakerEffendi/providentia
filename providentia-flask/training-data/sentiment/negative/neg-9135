This place sucks.  Maybe our meal was cursed since we ate there on Fri. 13th.  We came for an early dinner, most of the dining room was empty yet someone thought it was a good idea to sit us outside?  Ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and it looked thrown together and improperly cooked.  The presentation was horrible, it looked like a tomato explosion with some Calamari on top.  The batter was still soggy and pieces were sticking together.  We also got the Albacore Tataki, something on the description about it with jalapeno sold us on it.....but when it came out all it had was some jalapeno julienne'd and off to the side.  The Albacore was over-seared and tough.  I ordered something with Kobe beef and I pronounced it Ko-Beh like it's supposed to be, and our server actually had the gaul and said "Oh you mean Ko-Beeee".  Actually, no I wasn't talking about Number 8 on the La Lakers, I was talking about the food.  Imagine a cocky, pompous ass, who now has the opportunity to work for a Signature Restaurant.  That describes our server in a nutshell. The rest of the meal was forgettable.
