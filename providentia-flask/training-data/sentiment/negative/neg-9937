The manager working the cash charged us for 2 drinks on top of our combos. The lineup was very long and we didn't have time to go back and argue once we noticed. Very inefficient and slow staff and the entire place was dirty with garbage bins full and overflow falling on the floor. Area managers need to do some more spot checks at this location.

Check your bill as soon as you receive it.
