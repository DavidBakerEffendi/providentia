This is not my favorite pho restaurant by far. Came here on a late night dinner run as it was the only pho spot open past 10 in the area. I ordered the lamb congee soup and when it arrived it was nothing like the congee soup I've had at other places. It had lamb bones taking up half the bowl and came with a questionable plate of shredded cabbage like vegetables but it wasn't cabbage. I attempted to eat it but had a hard time swallowing it after 2 spoonfuls. I asked the server if there was anything we could do as I could not stomach my order and I was still hungry. His unsympathetic response that nothing could be done turned me off of ordering anything more off the menu. 
I will definitely not be returning and would not recommend this place even to a stranger. If you're in the mood for Asian food and it happens to be late night.. Don't let this spot be an option. Unappetizing and unempathetic hosting.
