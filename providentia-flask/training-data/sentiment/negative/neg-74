Poor service - ordered a dessert toast that never arrived. Asked after waiting for 30 mins to the same waitress & she blamed that we didnt order it. It was the first item we ordered for 3 ppl. 3 drinks & 1 dessert. She also could barely communicate in english. Food and drinks are mediocre for a hefty price tag. Will not come back
