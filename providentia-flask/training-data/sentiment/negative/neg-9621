Used to love BLD but since the change of ownership it has gone steadily down hill. Wait staff doesn't quite grasp the concept of customer service- no personality, no checking on drink refills, no smiles. Bartender/manager on weekends is completely useless. And the cooks can't make a simple fried egg.  Seriously, how difficult is it to fry an egg?  So...bad food, bad service and bad management ... save yourself a headache and just go to Oreganos, Nandos, The Ivy, or Cold Beer and Cheeseburger-they're in the same shopping center. Personally I'd  be surprised if BLD is still open a year from now.
