Update - It has been 10 days and still no word from Sandoozles on their website or social media about re-opening. People have commented asking questions, but the Sandoozles team has suddenly gone MIA on social media. 

At this point, not sure if they will re-open. I have been in contact with groupon and I suggest others do the same if they are worried about losing money on this "deal".
