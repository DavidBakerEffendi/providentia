We went here because my in-laws have fond memories of it, and have been going for years.  They still rave about it which I don't get.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve quest blanco--Los Olivos only has the yellow queso which the server even said is "just Velveeta."  If you expect salsa in a bowl, or to have any bowls for it think again.  You get a plate for salsa, and the chips are stale.  I had the Mexican pizza which was cold, greasy and average.  We ordered a cheese quesadilla for my 2 year old and it came out on a pizza dish--it was huge greasy and the tortilla part was crusty and hard.  While I respect my family's fond memories I will not go back if I can help it.
