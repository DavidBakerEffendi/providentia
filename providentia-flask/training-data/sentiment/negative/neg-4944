After an hour by boat from Cleveland, hunger sets in. We had a 20 minute wait, many tables were open which did not make sense. After a cold beer, which is why the 2 stars, we inquired about our table - just a minute was our response. 10 minutes later we were seated. 

We ordered the lake perch - and while our waiter tried to steer us away from the heavily panko crusted lake perch, we ordered anyway - mistake.  4 pieces of fish, good Cole slaw and cold French fries. I scraped off the heavy breaking and ate three of the Luke warm fish all of the Cole slaw and a couple of the fries.  I have never left perch uneaten on a plate. 

So sad to see them go this far from eatable. I did not even turn in my frequent dining card for points as I don't think I will be back - cold, nasty fish, Luke warm fries - but the beer was cold and we had fun getting there. 

Recommendations- go somewhere else. Sorry pickle bills -
