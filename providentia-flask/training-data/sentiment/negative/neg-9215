This place is terrible, your better off eating McMuffins than here.  

First off the welcome hosts if you wanna call them hosts, are not the friendliest.

I'm almost a 200 pound male, and I was asked to sit in this tiny miniature single booth.  I turned around and asked if they were serious.  You have to be probably  a kid or under 120 pounds to fit in that tiny booth.

My order took a while to arrive and not correct.  The fries were super cold.  And it also took about 20 minutes to get my 1st coffee refill.  

I would strongly not recommend this joint.  Extremely disappointed.
