If I could give zero stars I would. I came in today around 10:45 am. Asked them if they could throw together some easy fixings for approximately 10ppl. They stood there in awe that I would ask. Someone came over and I asked them again if they could put something together. I said I really don't care what it is. Maybe just some rice n beans and maybe some chips and salsa. The manager was sitting at a table and refused to even talk to me. He kept sending one of his Staff to tell me to have everyone order Individual meals. Well that is out of the question to stand in line and get 10 separate meals. I was ready a day willing to spend over $200 for their food. I will never again go to a cafe rio. Mind you, there was no one in the restaurant except staff and myself. I am appalled they wouldn't even try to accommodate my request. I do catering pretty frequently and spend over  $2000.00 a month  on food and entertainment. Never again cafe rio....never again .
