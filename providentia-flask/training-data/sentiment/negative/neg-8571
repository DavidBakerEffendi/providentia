I've never written a review for a fast food joint, but this was so ridiculous that I had to tell. 

Went through the drive-thru with a friend, and upon receiving our order, checked if everything was there. Of course it wasn't, but we were only missing some sauces. I got down and walked in with the receipt, and simply requested to get what was missing. Some lady wearing a striped shirt (presumably the manager for night time) insisted with a hint of irritation that it was in there. She proceeded to make her co-worker tell me the same exact thing she was saying. I explained to them that my friend and I had both just checked, and it wasn't there. But to give her the benefit of the doubt, I called my friend in the car to make her double check. She did, still non-existent. I said we're just missing these last three sauces. She looked at me with a face and said it was in the bottom of the bag while promptly slamming the sauces on the counter. She told me they cost $0.27 or something and I got annoyed and walked away. I won't lie, I yelled some obscenities about them needing to quit if they didn't like what they were doing. But honestly, I WAS ASKING FOR MISSING FREAKING SAUCES LADY, NOT SCAMMING YOU FOR EXTRA FOOD. 

My friend later called this McDonald's for me because she saw I was upset. She asked for the manager and her name. Some lady, presumably the same one and presumably giving the wrong name, said she was "Demaris". My friend told her we were just there, and she said, "Oh. I can't speak to you." And hung up. 

And this is how management of this McDonald's is run. No wonder you have less than two stars.
