Horrid food pretending to be what should be succulent and aromatic Indian cuisine. 

What is Chicken Biryani? What it's not is chicken pieces marinated in tomato pur√©e laid over insipid orange coloured rice. Dry potato side was tasteless. Boiled potatoes have more flavour!

I feel bad for the lovely asian ladies who take care of this cruel play on the mispelt word 'Tandori' named outlet.
