We used to enjoy it here. I'm sorry to say that things have dropped to an unsatisfactory level that we won't come again.  The restaurant has progressively fallen into disrepair and even dirty.  Service today was very slow. Not only the service but the amount of time it took to get our food. A few items were forgotten so needed to be made which took even longer.  There was a very visible hair on top of my daughter's skillet which made it impossible to eat once seen.  I can no longer recommend The Rustic Cafe.  Sad.
