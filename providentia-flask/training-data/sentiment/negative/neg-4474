I took my nephew there, he is 22 and ordered a drink, Kristin E. questioned it and asked him his Zodiac signordered a draft beer and a mixed drink.. took forever.. the Bartender was too busy flirting with some old loosers at the Bar.. Took our order, got it wrong brought us our food and check at the same time...I'll take that when you're ready been in Scottsdale for 40 Years.. The Bartender was still trying to bend over for the 2 Old Loosers at the Bar......Dierks must be a Looser to employ these Tramps!!!!!!!!
