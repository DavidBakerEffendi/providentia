I have been going to this place one or twice every two months. One year ago, I would have said the quality of food was decent. With increasing customers and popularity I find the food quality dropping. This weekend the quality of the food for the price I paid for was ridiculous. My coffee is not refilled, fruits are ripe and poor service. Not coming here again. My word of advice: provide quality service or not serve at all.
