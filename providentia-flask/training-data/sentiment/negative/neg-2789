I'm still here at this horrible hotel and cannot even wait until I leave to write this review! 
The checkin service was the WORSE checkin experience of my life! The lady was like as dumb as a box of rocks! You know every single time I've checked into a hotel I've been told "2 nights with a King" or whatever. Nope. This lady! I get to my room, 2 doubles! Gotta go back and move to another dang room! 
I get a the very last room in a hall. What happens? My key doesn't work! I call to tell her it doesn't work! She says well you gotta come back and get a new key! WTF?!?!?
I take that long a** walk AGAIN! 
The cafe food sucks and the service is HORRIBLE! Server knew absolutely NOTHING about the menu! I ask, is the ribeye bone-in or boneless??? "Ummm I don't know, I have to ask".....I ask if the calamari is strips or rings, tentacles??? "Im not sure, I will ask!!!!" What kind of management runs this awful place?!?! Room service!!!! Omfg! You gotta be kidding me!!!! Lady on the phone is also an air head! NOBODY in this ENTIRE place knows anything about what they're selling! 
This is the WORSE hotel EXPERIENCE of my life!!!!! I want my money back! I want every single penny! I know that will more than likely not happen, but GEEZUZ!!!!!! What a waste! Lesson learned, I will never cheat on the Palms Place again to experiment with something else! Ridiculous! 
Oh and that $16.99 per night fee for using my pillows on my bed! Are you flipping kidding me?!?! And a free mermaid show that anyone can watch other than hotel guests! What a joke!!!!!!
