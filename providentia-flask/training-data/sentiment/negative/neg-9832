I brought my husband first time, & not happy with the service & loud music.  I always come here with a good friend of mine.  My review is changed because pizza was burnt, and owner talking about a customer who brought in a man helping in a film. First of all the customer was me & as a kind person that I am I treated this person to lunch as a thank you, I do all the time, owners should not talk about people, cause you never know who they are, & badmouth staff inappropriate.  Now, I & many of my Well known friends all over will not go. Think about you business.
