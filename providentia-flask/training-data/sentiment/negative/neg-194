Went in for a late lunch on Friday, the food was pretty crappy and the service at the bar was worse.

The bartender kept telling us her problems about cleaning and stocking the bar for happy hour so she could go home on time 

We couldn't get refills on our drinks, salt, pepper, paper towels or plates. 

I was served warm Oysters ... when I asked the manager, she responded that's what you get for ordering them in Az in the summertime... ridiculous and offensive

Both should be reprimanded and re-trained 

Wings were still bloody ...Avoid this dirty and poorly run restaurant

Normally, I'm a fan...  but not this location 

Our bill with tip ... almost $100 - what gip!
