By far the WORST Panda Express experience EVER.  The owner of this establishment should be embarrassed to have the employees working for him that he does. The service was horrible.  Their customer service even worse.   Most of the food looked like it had been sitting there way too long, especially the vegetables.  They were obviously more suited to be in the trash and not sitting there waiting to go into someone's lunch.  I threw my lunch in the trash.  A total waste.
