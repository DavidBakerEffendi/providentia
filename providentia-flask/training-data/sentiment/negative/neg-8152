Wednesday night. The set up was really cute. Had live music that wasn't too bad. My friend and I sat outside in the back. We ordered drinks which took a little bit of time to come even though there were 5 tables totaling 17 people for both inside and outside. and yes I counted!! We ordered dinner 40 min passed not one waiter checked to see if we would like more drinks or anything. I flagged down our waiter and he said "Oh let me check". he apologized and returned to see if we wanted more drinks, we ordered drinks. The food came another 15 min. later but not the drinks. I ordered the tofu dinner which my noodles were extremely hard and the tofu was ice cold. The lamb wasn't well done but burnt. I explain this to our waiter and he apologizes saying he spoke with a manager and they would comp us for the dinner. My guest and I went to speak to the manager. I told him I would pass on the comp but dinner was really bad it like they just threw some food together without taking serving temperature to consideration. We all know that could result in food poisoning, illness or death. I understand every place of business, person and or establishment is entitled to an off night. However I would not recommend this place anyone due to the service alone.
