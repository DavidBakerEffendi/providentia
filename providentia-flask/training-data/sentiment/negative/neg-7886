So as many of you know three are several really fantastic pizza spots on  this side of town. This place is not even remotely close to one of them. How they were able to get a yelp to eatery is well beyond me because this food was plain awful! But ill get to that in a bit because I have to begin with some of the other reasons I will never go back to this establishment. We got here a bit earlier they open so waited till 10:30 for the place to open and when it did finally open we were greeted by a vey unhappy unclean looking gentleman who informed us of how unhappy he had been to receive a customer at the opening of business with an unwelcome glare and some scoffing comment as we walked in. Regardless we proceeded to order and it was then the smell of this place hit me and when I looked around I realized just what a  unkempt area the restaurant was! But even so we got our pizza and wings and headed out the door hoping for decent results only to be greeted by some of the most tasteless greasy wings I have ever seen and a pizza that lacked in flavor and density the likes of which I was taken aback by. Literally like putting tomato paste on cardboard and sprinkling some Wal-Mart brand motz on it then calling it good. Honestly just stay away from this place way to many options around here to waste any money on a tragedy like what's being peddled here.
