We always loved this place. We ste here at least once every time we came to Vegas. Are there last night and it was horrible! I sent back my blue cheese burger and my husband barely ate any of his country fried steak. It was grisley and hard to chew, even the mashed potatoes tasted like they were sitting around all day. The only reason he didn't send his back too is because he worried they would think we were just trying to get out of the bill. I don't know if it's a new chef or new management or new supplier, but if that's the norm they will be shut down soon.
