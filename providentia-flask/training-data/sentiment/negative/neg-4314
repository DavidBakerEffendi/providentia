Let me start with the positive - the service was EXCEPTIONAL.  Very friendly and attentive.  The margarita on Happy Hour was very good and the prices were excellent.  Now, for the negative: the food and the atmosphere.  The atmosphere is horrid.  As other reviews have mentioned there are kids running around during Happy Hour (really?!) and it is very sterile and lacking in ambiance.  The food was mediocre at best.  Definitely won't be making a return trip which is too bad as the service was wonderful and I love Cork,
