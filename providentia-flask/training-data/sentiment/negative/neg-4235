It is hard to isolate the single worst thing about Hob Nobs.  Is it the shabby management?  The filthy cook?  Or the hipster emo counter staff?

Amber, who took our order clearly thinks customer service is beneath her.  We ordered cesar salads and a sandwich.  The salads were served fairly quickly by a cook who's uniform was clearly encrusted with a week's worth of food debris.  Gross... but where the hell is my sandwich?  After 17 minutes of waiting for the sandwich, I asked the soccer mom behind the counter, to which she replied, "Hon, they take a few minutes."

After another five minutes, I got pissed.  It is a sandwich.  Nobody asked them to make a rack of lamb.  Bread, meat, cheese, garnish, and a few condiments.  Pretty basic stuff, right?  

When I finally complained to the bald guy in the bad Hawaiian shirt who apparently runs the place, he simply said, "sorry" and made the sandwich in front of me.  Amber, the emo counter girl, started to complain to me that they were busy and someone had  called off.  Bad Hawaiian shirt guy sent her out to smoke.  I watched through the window as she commiserated with filthy cook guy, and then returned to work without bothering to wash her hands.  Gross again.

I would eat daily at the Phoenix Rescue Mission before setting foot in Hob Nobs again.  At least there the staff is nice, and want to help.
