Gave the guy a $5 tip and he didn't even say thank you. The staff are not friendly at all and it sounds like all they are doing is arguing with one another in Chinese. Lemon chicken has too thick of a coating and the lemon sauce is bland. The pancakes for the Moo Shi are heavy like tortillas... what's with that? 

The menu is very broad but our take home boxes never made it in the house.
