I want to like this place so bad because it's so convenient, but both times I ordered this is very much below average food.  Your typical Americanized "Asian" food.  Very disappointing and over priced to boot. 

Last time I called the owner/manager was so rude on the phone, I cancelled my order and will not be back.
