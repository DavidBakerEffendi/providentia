Bad food and bad service. Don't get the pho. It is flavorless and overpriced. That's typical of most pho on the strip, but I was desperate for some hangover food. Barely ate any of it, but I wouldn't recommend it. Also, the beef noodle soup is the highly recommended dish, but it was disappointing, overly spicy, and I know what good beef noodle soup tastes like! One of my friends got the beef chow fun noodles and it took so long for them to make it, by the time we were almost done eating his dish came it. It was piping hot and greasy, but better than the pho or the beef noodle soup. It's probably safe to say that if I come back, I better be sober and ready for some pan fried stuff to leave satisfied.
