This place is getting worse and worse. On Saturday i order a California burrito through the drive through. When I got home the damn burrito was not even close to be warm, the potatoes were partially still frozen,  what little meat there was seemed old and tuff like its been sitting all night  and it was drowned in pico de gallo and guacamole, like they were trying to cover up the fact that there was hardly any meat and not fresh what so ever.  And the cheese havent he started to melt. Ive had a few bad trips here before but it was here and there. This was the worst one so far. Im gonna have to give this place a rest or stop going all together. It sucks cause this is the only type food around here, but u cant keep serving food like that to people and expect them to keep coming back.
