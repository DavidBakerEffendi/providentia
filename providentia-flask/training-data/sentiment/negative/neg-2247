Ordinarily I wouldn't go here, but since it was walking distance from my hotel and I had no desire to drive on the snowy roads, chain food became acceptable fare.  
I want to know why this place has Cajun blackened mahi-mahi on the menu when they don't cook it with an ounce of Cajun seasoning?  I got a plain grilled fish.  The cauliflower and cheese side was nearly indistinguishable from the mashed potatoes.  Only small chunks of cauliflower which probably had all the nutrients cooked out of them signaled which dish I was eating.
