I was really hungry and needed some food quickly . They ran out of biriyani so took the three item thali . I have never tasted something so bland in my life . 

Only pros the girl who gave was nice . 

They give you frozen pita in place of a naan . For me why even bother because I  won't eat it . 

Don't waste your money
