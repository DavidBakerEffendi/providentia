This is the most garbage Daves Cosmic Subs I have ever been too. The tasty bacon was a tiny crumpled piece of bread hardly six inches long and the pickles look like they have been left in a sauna. The people who work there are kids and do not value their jobs or customers that give them business. This Daves makes all the others look bad and needs to be shut down. Oh and the bread is past due and very stale. DO NOT GO HERE!
