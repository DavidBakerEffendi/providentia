As I'm writing this review...I am in my car in the drive thru and have been waiting for 15minutes for an iced mocha! There was no line in front of me. I called while in my car and talked to a manager...all he said is they're trying to fix the chocolate pump for my iced mocha!...i ordered my drink at 2:49 and it's 3:08 and still waiting!
