Had to wait 45 minutes to be seated for a group of 5, which is understanding, since it was a busy night. After being seated an getting our orders taken, it took them almost an hour for them to deliver our food to our table, by this time it was almost closing time. A couple of people ordered chicken pho, which takes only 15 minutes to cook. I and a couple others ordered simple meat dishes. I got the shrimp curry and they only give me 7 pieces of shrimp with a side of cold rice. Really!? If the owner can't cook rice or how to keep a dish warm why is he even in the kitchen? Leave it to the professionals. After we complained of our issues, they sent over a bus boy pretending to be a manager. However, he gave excuses and didn't act upon them. Really showed incompetence and lack of any type of managerial skills. I would not recommend this place, considering incompetent employees, unskilled owner, and lack of quality service.
