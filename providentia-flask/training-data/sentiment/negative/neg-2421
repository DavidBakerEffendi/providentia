Gave WG another chance due to a gift certificate from a horrible experience at another WG. Well I should have declined. The price and quality do not match. The prices are Morton's but the food is Eat and Park. The pumpkin ravioli was flavorless and room temp. The side salad greens were limp and lacking any pizzaz. The beer menu was decent enough but after three chances on food and three really disappointing experiences I'll take my money elsewhere.
