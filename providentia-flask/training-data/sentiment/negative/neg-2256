We had be wanting to try city BBQ and we finally did. If they want to survive in the future they have work to do. The person who takes your order was not very friendly nor did he give the proper attention to the customer. While taking our order he was having a side conversation with someone else. The restaurant was dirty, they have bottles of sauce on every table in squeeze bottles that are transparent however they clearly do not clean the bottles, there was dried old sauce on the tops and in the tip were the sauce comes out. They have a fixing bar also with sauce and it is not very clean either burnt sauce caked in the open containers. See my pictures..... the food was not hot at all. You would expect being a new restaurant that it would be very clean but that's not the case at all. Very disappointing!!!
