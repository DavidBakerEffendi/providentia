The only things edible in this place are corns and crab legs. Yes you have unlimited drink&wine but the quality was so low that I'd rather pay to get some more decent ones. Other bad examples I remember: the vege with huge leaves (don't know it's name) was like presoaked with some chemicals to keep it from rotten. Sushi rice was undercooked. Beef rib was tasteless and not well cooked - what a waste for such a big chunk of meat. Wonton soup was full of msg so good luck with your stomach 2 hours after you drink it.
