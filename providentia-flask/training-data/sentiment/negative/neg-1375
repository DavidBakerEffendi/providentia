Very unwelcoming reception. We had made reservations for four adults...oops,we  forgot to include our 8-year-old grandchild, whom they refused to accommodate with one more chair inside..so we were all relegated to outside seating, where it was completely empty, yet were seated in the corner where it was a mere 99 degrees from the blasting overhead heaters. When we expressed our apologies to the owner that we had made a decision to leave, we were told "we turned away people because of you!" rather than we're sorry or please come back another time. Needless to say, my husband's birthday dinner was celebrated at another Italian eatery.
