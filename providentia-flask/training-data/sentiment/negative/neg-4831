If you're coming here for dinner you need to get there 30 minutes beforehand. There's a lot of people that comes so there's a long line and they do charge extra for holidays other than that the restaurant is cheap. There food on the trays of the best fit are cold. I got a ravioli and the chicken I marinated chicken in it was cold when I got to my table it did taste good though. I do recommend if you go make sure the chef makes you something fresh his cooking is really good on the spot. The desserts was the same as any other buffet  They had  little  pastries  it was a cannoli . It was really good .
