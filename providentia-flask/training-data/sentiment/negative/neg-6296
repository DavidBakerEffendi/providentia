A bit pricey. 4 people  get out of there for $50 , less if you order water or share drinks. I am not a kid but used to order from the kid menu because it's sufficiently sized for me , last time i was there you can't do that. This used to be the pick of the pack. The Arrowhead area has some stiff competition for dining. This location has lost it's identity and pizazz it had before. I would state the name of where I've been going mostly , but don't want to be flagged for being spam. Until there are some major changes I won't be back. 

A few ideas : Lower prices , better arcade , just to start.
