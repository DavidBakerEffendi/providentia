You know I have tried to like Sir Edmond's, I really have.  I've gone there a bunch of times, and I really like the outdoor patio seating, especially the big cherry tree that has such beautiful blossoms in the spring and would be the perfect place to take a chick on a first or second date, and they do have a descent selection of brew on draught, I do like Ye Old Speckled Hen, but well, their food sucks.  The last time I went there I ordered the fish and chips, mainly cause this is a pub and I was feeling nostalgic for my days in London, so I wanted some fish and chips, and thought they might actually be good...Wrong!  The fish and the batter were uncooked, and I had to send it back not once, not twice, not three times, but four times, and on the last time, it still wasn't right I just didn't feel like sitting there anymore, and my brother had already finished his burger, which did look good.  Did the waitress offer me anything for my trouble, nope.  Which brings me to my next complaint, the service and the whole atmosphere is really kind of rude, and stuffy, maybe I'm just not cool enough, but they always seem to busy to serve me, and the whole low ceiling basement bar thing is not my bag.  Other people love Sir Edmond's, I know I've heard rave reviews for their burgers and their lamb sandwich, this place just isn't for me.
