Late after a night out, decided to get food from here. Had a coupon for a mile high bacon cheeseburger, which they don't have on their menu anymore, um, just got this coupon a week ago. They gave me the new menu item that replaced it, asked for extra crispy bacon. Got home and guess what, almost raw bacon, a burger on a pretzel bun, um, not what I wanted, you would think a change in bun would warrant telling me that. Also ordered onion rings, never again, all batter and undercooked, threw them away. Criss cut fries were subpar, but the chicken tenders my husband got were delicious. $20 to only eat $5 of the meal, I feel like Carl's Jr owes me money, you do realize you're competing with other fast food companies, oh maybe that's why you will never be on the top. Never eating here again and will share that decision with every one I know. Coupon or not, it's not worth it.
