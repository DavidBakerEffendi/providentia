Hm. So I've never heard of this place. I was browsing through eat24 and Moe's showed up on the list of nearby restaurants that delivered. What caught my eye was what type of food they prepared. Eat24 currently lists: Burgers, American, Late Night, Chicken and Waffles, Dessert. I read Chicken and Waffles and immediately craved it. Also delivering and open till 2:30am? Although there are/were no reviews (as of right now), I went ahead and ordered 2, one for me and my mother.

Delivery was estimated to be 45-60 minutes, nothing out of the ordinary. The driver took a little under 2 hours to arrive at my door step. I did call beforehand why it's been over an hour and they said they were busy, no problem. The driver looked like she was in a rush and she also delivered the food in an UberEATS bag. Is that normal? Still tipped her 20%.

Two different to-go style boxes, the typical styrofoam "have a nice day" box and the other a clear, plastic style. The food was wrapped in tin foil, good way to seal the warmth. I opened the food and was thinking, "wow", and not in the good way either. The Waffle didn't look or taste homemade, It was like the frozen kind that you stick in an oven. The chicken in my plate were pretty much in the same category, the stuff you buy in bags down the frozen foods aisle.

My Mother's chicken on the other hand were chicken strips, while mine were like chicken poppers. The syrup was okay, no complaints and beneath the waffle was butter, all melted. Perhaps the driver got lost on the way to the house? Or maybe they ran out of chicken and had to buy some from the store. I don't know. Either way, I've definitely tasted a better chicken and waffles. Very disappointed, nowhere near worth 13 bucks a plate.
