Actually wish I could give this pizza place minus stars. 

We ordered a large pizza and chicken fingers. 
The order arrived 60 minutes later...
Pizza burnt and I can say I have made better freezer pizza. Chicken fingers awkwardly disgusting. Nor regular fingers like a villa pizza or metro pizza. Just plain disgusting. Not buffalo sauce but some weird seasoning blend. GROSS

Driver- rude 

Do yourselves a favor pick another pizza place. We won't be returning simply based on burnt pizza, gross fingers and they forgot our fries that come with  the special indicated. Just thought of that. My order was wrong at 30.00 a pop! :(
