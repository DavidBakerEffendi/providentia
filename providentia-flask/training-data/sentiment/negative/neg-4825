The one star is due to the fact that food here is delicious,however the service and delivery is horrendous. We have ordered the food on a couple of occasions to have it delivered to our place of business and the wait time has never been under 2 hours.

The "manager" has a tendency to lie about wait time or driver whereabouts, assuring you "the driver is right around the corner"..then 45 minutes later you have your food.

That is no way to run a business.

I say, if you plan to try this place out, eat in and save yourself the irritation of waiting hours for your food if you get it delivered.
