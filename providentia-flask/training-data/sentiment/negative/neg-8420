Saw all the good reviews on yelp and decided to try. Al pastor has no flavor. Chicago style fries are terrible. On top
Of that got the food to go and ordered 4 grilled jalape√±os and they forgot to pack it. I called and told the worker you charged me for them, it's cool they offered to give them free next time but unfortunately, there won't be a next time. I'll stick to tacos el gordos.
