I'm a regular grocery shopper at other stores, but this Food Lion seems like it is stuck in a different era.  What I did see of the store, was that it was kept fairly clean, but everything else had this dated feel to it.  I'm sure the products are just as new as if you had bought them in a competitor store, but I would not trust the produce or meat based upon Paul H's previous review and the lack-luster customer performance I experienced at the cash register.

In the middle of the day on a Tuesday, there was a line about 6 people deep with equal number of employees up at front... why it took so long to recognize they needed to open another register was beyond me... but what annoyed me the most was that the register that opened up decided to take the last person in line!  I was in the middle, but waited my turn.  When it was finally my turn (I ended up last since I was in the middle) the cashier seemed a little angry like I was holding him up from doing something.  The last thing I need on a weekday is to be held up during my lunch hour and given attitude.
