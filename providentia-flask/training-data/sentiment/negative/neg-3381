I'm an employee of IHG wasn't able to get a discount for my stay of 3 days 2 nights. Payed full price and still had $29 a day fees that I was not notified for. I spoke to Kaila the supervisor she wasn't willing to do anything for me. They gave me a really bad view I asked to change rooms they said they couldn't it would be an additional $100 a night. Everything made my sons 5th birthday way more stressful than it should.
