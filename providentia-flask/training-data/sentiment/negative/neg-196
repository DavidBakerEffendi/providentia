Being Vietnamese I'm a little more picky when it comes to taste but the reason I gave it one star is because the food is ok.  Nothing great but not horrible either.  

The service on the other hand is the WORST.   It's a Saturday lunch time and there are only two other tables beside us and there are 4 people standing chatting at the register.  It took over 10 minutes for them to bring me a coke (which I had to remind the server that I ordered). My family also ordered the special Jenni drink which is buy 2 get 1 free ... so after they brought us the coke I asked how about the 3 Jenni drinks we ordered when we got here ?  He goes and checks and comes back and tells me they are all out.  It would've been nice for someone to tell us instead of just sitting here waiting for it.

Literally the only time we saw the servers is when we ordered the food and then when they served it to us.  If you want a refill on your drinks or napkins or anything else you better flag someone down because they sure aren't the ones that are going to be checking on you.  

I live in the SW part of town and the JenniPho on Rainbow is awesome so since I was on Spring Mountain I decided to try this location and let's just say it will be my first and last time.
