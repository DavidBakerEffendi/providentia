Food was great, the server was great. We get there and there's a 45 min wait and we had a larger group so that's expected. After a bit we are told that we will have to wait 1hr 15min for a table outside in the shade, which we are still okay with. We decided to get bloody marys at the bar while we waiting and we see a party of 7 who had been there for maybe 30mins get seated in the shade outside. The hostess then tell us that our table is almost ready and points to one in the shade. Alright!  5 mins later they move the umbrellas to a different table of 7 leaving ours in the sun.. Really!!? We ended up waiting almost 2 hours for a table in the shade. I wouldn't have cared where we sat but my friends from Chicago were in town and really wanted to sit outside. Then the manager tells us we would get a discount since we were so patient, which they never gave us. This is not my first visit here and I'm disappointed we had this experience with our friends who were visiting. Again - great food, great server - just poor management.
