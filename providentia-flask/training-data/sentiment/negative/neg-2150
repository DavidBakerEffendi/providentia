It is indeed a sad day when I have to give a Mom and pop store the absolute minimum. But that I feel is the best I was willing to do after the experience of eating here.  There wasn't a single redeemable factor in the whole experience. I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen ($9) on the menu supposed to come with 2 nigiri sushi.
I got a horrible mess of a soup and super sweet inari sushi. The tonkatsu was composed of chunks of napa and bok choy and imitation seafood sticks and some old chicken. The broth was thickened with egg whites rather than pork bones and the whole thing was saturated with MSG. Needless to say it tasted horrible. Every ingredient in the bowl was old and of low quality including the ramen. 

Avoid... even the service was non-existent..
