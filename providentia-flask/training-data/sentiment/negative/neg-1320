Between mandatory coat check and music cover charge, I had paid $14 before I even sat down at my special, young adult table; conveniently located obnoxiously close to a floor speaker.

The food was of a price that I'd expect from Baton Rouge with a quality and selection I'd expect from St. Hubert. Thank goodness I had a coupon off a deal site for this place. I managed to avoid wasting an obscene amount of money on the dining experience and instead opting for only wasting a moderate amount. 

The service was way to slow for 2 dishes (one being a salad). However, my waiter extremely helpful in notifying me, using a beautiful assortment of circles and arrows, that the tipping is to be done on the original amount, not the discounted one.

I had high hopes for this place but it's clear that the 20-25 age group are looked down upon here. When the service goes sour, the food isn't good enough to be the sole justification of dining here.
