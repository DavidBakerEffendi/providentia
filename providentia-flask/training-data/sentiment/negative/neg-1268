Well I have to say we were excited to see a new shawarma place opening up near our work.  We tried it out today, now that it is open, and were let down in a big way.

The nice glossy menu shows HUGE portions of beef and chicken atop a great looking salad, also 5 various wraps over flowing with meats and vegetables.  Well I'll tell you that you don't get what is advertised.  A slim version of what you see.  All sorts of flair and glam in the restaurant and no show.  

The flavour was OK but it really is just a snack, for the price (Liberty Village $$$$ Price) of a full dinner.  You will be left hungry and going elsewhere for more food.  Go elsewhere first, don't waste a stop here.

I don't recommend this place to eat.  You can do MUCH better at other local establishments.
