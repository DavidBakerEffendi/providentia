Went there for the first time this week, and it was below mediocre. The waitress we had actually thought it was acceptable to yell at us as customers. Perhaps my humor isn't the same as hers, but chastising paying customers wasn't part of the experience I expected. The food was alright, but mostly the service was deplorable. Later when I called to complain to the manager he was very polite about it, but further worsened the situation by saying he would "try" to talk to the staff, but there was really nothing he could do. 

If you want mediocre bar food and a dingy environment with poor service, by all means go here. Otherwise, eating lunch from a brown paper sack would be more enjoyable.
