Usually 45 minutes to grab breakfast prior to boarding is plenty of time to grab a breakfast sandwich. Not here.  It was almost 10 minutes before I was acknowledged by the wait staff.  When I am finally acknowledged, I put in my entire pretty simple order. Orange juice, bacon, egg and cheese croissant, and a banana.  I get my banana and orange juice pretty quickly, but waited 25 minutes to receive my breakfast sandwich.  I immediately attempted to pay my bill before taking a bite, my credit card set on the table for almost another 10 minutes.  Oh and my sandwich was either heavily microwaved or sat under the heat lamp forever, the styrofoam plate was so warped it barely sat flat on the table.  Such a weird experience.
