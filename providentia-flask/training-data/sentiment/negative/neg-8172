Passed it up because of how small it is and had to circle back.
Walk through the front door and head to the underground.

started with the san remo shrimp and escargot appetizers. 
The shrimp was good but probably wouldnt order it again.. Tried escargot for the very first time and thought it would be something i would never try but it was pretty good, might order that one again. 
ordered the beef wellington for my main dish and didnt enjoy it, the meat itself was good. when we placed our order the waiter was a prick. he misspoke about the sides and we questioned what he said and then he said it correctly and was saying he didnt say that, we just started laughing because we all heard it and i think that made him more mad. so 1 star because of the waiter, probably only a 2.5-3 stars if he didnt act like this.
