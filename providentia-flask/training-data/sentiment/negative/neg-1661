I came here for lunch with a friend, and enjoyed it. 

Then I came again with other friends to get a bite to eat, at 910 pm. This shouldn't have been a problem since I knew their huge sign outside claimed they were open til 10.

The owner of the restaurant himself told us they were closed. There were several other customers inside as he told us this. We had gone out of our way to come to Trente-Cinq, so we were all pretty turned off and offended by this treatment. We went to Lisa G's next door instead, where they seem to actually appreciate new customers.

I'm not a huge fan of false advertising. One star.
