Would not recommend and don't plan to return. 
Service was slow. They only have one waiter. Tables that required clearing when we arrived have not been cleared even when we had left. The waiter was friendly but she could only do so much. The place was about 1/3 full and she was having a hard time keeping up.
The food was all cool when it arrived and it was pretty poor. We ordered the fish tacos (worst I have ever had), enchiladas (edible), guacamole (average). For two people the bill came in over $40. Not worth it at all. Had an upset stomach after the meal. 
Had better food at fast food mexican places. Very disappointed and would not give this another try.
