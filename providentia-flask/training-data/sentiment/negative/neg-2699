I've been eating here for 4 years and everything I've eaten has been awesome great proportions beans were perfect even the salsa and peppers... However, the last 2 times I've eaten here it has been crap!! The salsa Verde is like water the beans are dry and dark brown. The chicken was over salted and very little sauce on my enchilada. Horrible food! I regret not going to wingstop!!! Will never eat here again!
