Last night's dinner took 50 minutes to get out to us (4 of us).  All the tables around us had eaten, paid, refilled with new diners, and they were eating.  The server came to us 30 minutes after taking our order and said she didn't know what was going on in the kitchen, but "here's some chips and salsa".  I'm on a very special diet and can't eat chips.  No one ever asked us if they could bring us something to munch on that was healthy.  45 minutes into the wait, I called the manager over and told him he had 5 minutes to bring us our meals, or we would walk.  Our meals came 5 minutes later and my steak was raw.  I showed the manager and he took it off the check.  The entire incident could have been handled better.  For instance, why didn't they put our orders to the top of the list when she realized we'd been sitting there for 30 minutes?  By the 45 minute mark, the Manager should have been to our table without us having to seek him out.  Horrible experience!  I will never visit that location again!
