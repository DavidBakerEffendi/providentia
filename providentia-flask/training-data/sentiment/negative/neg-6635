My neighbor took me there last night to meet his brother and a friend, had been waiting since 6:30 employees everywhere but they couldn't seem to figure out how to get the people waiting to actually play?  We had seen open areas to up to 20 minutes before they got filled we left at 9:10 frustrated and disappointed.  What a joke get your shit together what horrible organization.  I don't understand for a franchise that is suppose to be successful fail on so many levels.  When we complained on the way out everyone was apologetic but did nothing to make it right. The parking was a joke as well.
