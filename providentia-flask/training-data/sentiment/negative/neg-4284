Everything was way too salty!  The fries and the chicken!  With a bone and without.  Even having them fix it a second time, it was still over seasoned with salt.  Manager was friendly and cooked again but even after changing the hot sauce and asking for very light seasoning, it was still overly salted.  Manager offered no reimbursement so we basically aid $20 FOR 2 SODAS!  I will be disputing this charge on my credit card.  It will be worth the hassle to know my money does not support this type of cooking.  It would be good to note, I love salty food, but this was like taking the salt shaker and pouring it into your mouth.  I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN.
