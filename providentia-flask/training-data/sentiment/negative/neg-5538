TRUST ME... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Go to Caesars Palace Bacchanal buffet, it's worth every penny. Hell, even the Red Rock buffet is better.  We went for Saturday brunch.  We got there at 1230pm and they were already out of lamb. They stated they would not make more! I thought this was a buffet? Over half of the buffet was dedicated to breakfast. Chinese food was garbage. Sushi was simple.  2 omelette stations.  Only meat at carving station was ham, Turkey and prime rib.  Lots of oatmeal and grits.  No good soup.  Mimosas were $15 aycd. They should be included free to make up for the subpar food! This place is cramped and the food is unimpressive. Such a shame for a beautiful hotel. I can't say enough bad stuff... The head chef should be ashamed!
