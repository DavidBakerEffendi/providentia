Paid for $30 for bland carne asada tacos. Who uses lettuce on carne asada?? Cabbage and purple onion would have got better!! Also, the owner was monitoring how many salsa cups were given to go.  Needless to say, if you are going to give me 4 small plastic cups of salsa for 6 tacos and then you complain because I ask for lids on my salsa.  Your customer service was horrible and you ran out to get plastic bags from the liquor store next door.  Will not return.  If I spend $30 on food, I should have salsa for all my tacos!! Especially since it was needed to cover up the bland taste of your tacos and rice!!
