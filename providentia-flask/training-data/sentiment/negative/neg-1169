The hostess was very nice and welcoming. Everything else was terrible. My husband and I got the mixed fajitas for two which is hunks of meat on a bed of onions and plate of guac, lettuce, and pico. On the side was two flour tortillas which were way over toasted. They were so dry and thin it could not hold anything in them.It looked decent but everything was salty(rice, beans, steak and chicken,the sauce) the salt was so overwhelming I could only eat a few bites.  I didn't want to send back the plate because our server seemed  so inconvenienced by us.he brought us refills for our drinks just once and left the empty cups, chips and salsas on the table making the table cramped. After we received the check the server did not come back for several minutes. So I walked up to the hostess and she had to go grab him so I could pay. Honestly you could get better food and service from Roberto's.
