Im surprised Dennys CORPORATION lets franchise owners embarass their namebrand this way. This location is so beyond disgusting and in need of a desperate overhaul. Literally it needs torn down amd rebuilt. The building is shit. The parking lot os shit and full of holes. Trash everywhere outside cigarettes all over. It literally smells like an ashtray near the doorway. For many years this location has gone downhill. Not even sure how theu can afford to stay open because everyone in the area knows not to go here.
