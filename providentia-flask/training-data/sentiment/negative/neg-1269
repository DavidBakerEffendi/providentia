So we went here a couple years ago and it was such a bad experience I must of blocked it out of my memory. But I just saw them featured on an episode of Dirty Dining and it all came flooding back. 

 I'll make this short. They sat us next to a table where someone threw up. All over the floor. They knew there was vomit all over the floor and they still sat us there. Then they proceeded to argue with me about it. Too the point it got really nasty and they were even cursing...at me! Who the f*** wants to sit next to vomit while eating? Why does that question even need to be asked? So they're on the brink of losing their restaurant? Good. The kitchen sounds like a disgusting nightmare.
