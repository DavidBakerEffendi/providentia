So I went to this McDonald's for some food and then I see one of the managers almost scream at one of the employees in such a rude way it made me so angry. Management needs to be better I cannot believe that this is how managers are trained to just scream at employees sometimes they even scream at the customers I've seen it before. I'm not just saying screaming they also cuss them out using bad language and that is not good customer service how are the employee supposed to learn from the managers when they  are so horrible themselves. Honestly somebody really needs to re-higher management they do not treat their employees or customers how they should employees are great and they look like amazing people but managers they just don't seem like qualified people to be running this establishment. Especially Jose he was horrible.
