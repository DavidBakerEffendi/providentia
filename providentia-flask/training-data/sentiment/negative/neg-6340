Rating:  Two Tum's Down, as in you'll need two tums after eating here. 

Service: was great,  gave us the 8 samples and i would've felt bad for walking away after trying them.  so despite my gut feeling, i stayed

Ate: the jerk chicken seasoning is pepper...and lots of it.  had orange chicken quesadilla, jade chicken burrito, black beans, and chicken fried rice.  taste is like panda express threw up at taco bell.  

Pros: painting of panda wearing a sombero eating w/ chopsticks while  sitting on a rickshaw pulled by a donkey. try to wrap your head around that for a second... 

Cons: my stomach hurt so bad it was hard to work after lunch. order up a handful of antacids to remedy the situation.  in a moment of weakness i ate the leftovers a few hours later and was pleasantly surprised by the same pain again for dinner.  

i will never eat there again.
