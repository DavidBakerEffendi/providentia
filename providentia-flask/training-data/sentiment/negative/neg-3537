It's a shame. We really wanted to find a great place in South Chandler, but we'll have to keep looking. The one star is for the great location and patio. Aside from that, there's nothing.  Food was ordinary at best. Lackluster and overpriced. Service was awful. Manager was walking around but she seemed not to notice the unfulfilled drink and dinner requests all around. Since when has there been smoking allowed in restaurants?  Patron on the patio with smoke wafting in our direction. Food tasted even worse after that. Nothing seems to last in this location.
