If you don't feel like eating anytime soon this is a nice place to come relax on the patio. Sad when a party of 6 can't get proper service. Waited over two hours for dinner. Dinning room was half full and there was three tables taken outside. Ooopss make that two, one couple got up and left after they didn't get any service. Kept asking our waiter to have the manager talk to us and he kept saying that they were busy. Come to find out there is no manager, only the owner who apparently didn't care enough about her customers to come out and apologize for us having to wait so long. On top of having to wait we had to track someone down to refill our water. Food might be good, we don't know because we never got to eat and we won't be back to a place where the owner can't come out and say "I'm sorry"....which is all we really wanted...and waiters who have to be tracked down to do their job. Hope the remaining staff are looking for other jobs, because this is a sinking ship. If she treats her customers like she treated us, then I am sure she treats her staff even worse.
