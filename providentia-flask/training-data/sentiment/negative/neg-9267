I love wahoos!! The fish tacos are great I wanted to order something new off the menu since the fish tacos were what I've always ordered. I called in an order for the first time. I ordered the Maui bowl (steak, rice, & beans.) my fiancée ordered the chicken Maui bowl. I ordered extra teriyaki sauce in case it needed it. When I went to pick it up, the girl at the register was nice but the guy (teenager) who took my order smarted off to me when I asked for more teriyaki sauce. (Just so you employees of wahoos know, the customers can HEAR what you're saying in the kitchen.) Lol *SMH* anyway, when I checked the food this is what I got... (See pic) the steak was dry, plain, and NOTHING I would even pay for. Once I saw the food I asked for MORE teriyaki because I KNEW it would need it! The rice was hard. Not like uncooked hard, more like it'd been sitting out-kinda hard. I was so hungry I didn't care tho I didn't eat very much of it & my fiancées was the same only he said the chicken tasted better than the steak. I've been to wahoos in the day, the vibe is so different and the service is much better. I wonder if the Maui bowl would've been better too but I know I'm not ordering it again! Still love the fish tacos & ONLY ordering that AND only in the day when day staff is there!
