The staff is pleasant, the management cordial. The nachos are a crime against humanity.  But don't believe me, I'm only on the interwebs so what do I know about such things. Allow me to take you on a trip.... Imagine if you will a plastic salad bowl from Wendy's. Piled low with small bite sized stale chips in festive reds and whites (because we all know corn tortilla chips are naturally red in color).  Dancing playfully upon this stale stage of sorrow is a 1/3 can of Hormel beanless chili. Nothing says Nachos like Hormel! Yum! Drizzle the trough with AMC Theater brand "nacho cheese" to make it authentic and show the whole dish three black beans and BAM! Ultimate nachos for the reasonable price of $8,75! Best.Dish.Evah! Sad when Nachos at Taco Bell are more authentic.
