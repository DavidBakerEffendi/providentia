Ordered spring rolls and there was no sliced pork. I ate them anyway but advised the waiter. They acted like I was making the whole thing up then I ordered bun. Anyone who eats traditional Vietnamese food knows the noodles should be room temp. The noodles were boiling hot and instead of beef they brought me pork. The waiter agreed it was pork and the owner said it was beef. I know what pork looks like and tastes like...then I was accused of not wanting to pay for a meal I did not eat. I have been coming here since they opened and have an autograph cook book from the owner. I ask you why would I want this relationship to end? Poor customer service and misguided accusations just lost them a great customer that has introduced quite q few people over the years. It is still a good place to eat, I will never enter those doors again as a result of the owners wife's handling of the situation. Unfortunate situation for both of us really.
