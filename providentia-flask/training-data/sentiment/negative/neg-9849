Horrible customer service! I was home sick with a sick baby & couldnt leave my house. The guy who took my order couldnt find me with my phone number I said are you sure & gave it again...still no  then he asked for my address ...after over an hour with no pizza I called only to be told that he must have entered my address wrong but that he tried to call me...MY PHONE NEVER WRANG ONCE! Lies!!! After telling me they would remake and resend ...I said no ..I asked for a manager (Dylan)he said he was ...then he hung up on me!!!! I called back to find out what was happening ..was I getting my pizza ?...was I being refunded?...why did he hang up on me? and the girl said because I was being unreasonable..I gave the baby a bath & PUT her to bed...then I called Pizza Hut ..What I should have done in the first place..got my pizza in 20 minutes easy peasy...
