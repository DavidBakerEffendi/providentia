Poor service. 
Waited nearly half an hour for our order to be taken, nothing. 
Looks like it would be a fun place if there was service. The staff at a 7-11 are more attentive.
Overall I was really sad, really wanted to eat here, but couldn't get any service.  The wait staff just stood in a circle and talked with each other. 
We drove all the way down from North of town to come eat here.  Cannot even express how disappointing it was to drive all that way, drive in such a cool looking place, and then get no service.
