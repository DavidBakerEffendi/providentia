Worst experience. If you're visiting from out of town just understand that the locals seem to be given priority. I came in with a party of four, place was busy was told wait time about 10-15 minutes. I saw bigger parties waiting. A waitress cleaned a table suited for 4, not a couples not for 5 or 6, for 4. So I thought I'm next after waiting the suggested time. The. This older guy with a much younger female come in and a very old looking waitress kind of gave them a wink and waved them in. Mind you this couple was at the desk waiting to check in and the old waitress had them skip when the young hostess wasn't looking. I was annoyed because they took the table for 4 and now I had to wait, i suppose twice as long. I'm sure they didn 't miss me but I will never give them my business. They should either teach their waitresses to respect all customers or replace them with some who will. Also be mindful that we as customers are are expecting to have the best treatment, earn your tip.
