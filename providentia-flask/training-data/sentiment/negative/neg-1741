Been coming here for about 2 months straight on Wednesdays for all you can eat wings with a group of 6 people. 

After last night we have all decided to give up on Hooters. Every single time we get wings they are undercooked and rubbery. Some of them are still pink. We started asking for them well done and nothing changed. 

The wings last night were not edible. It was gross. Complete waste of money.
