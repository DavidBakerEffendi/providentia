Food is cold and either bland or bad tasting. Had the Classic Benedict and the French toast and egg. Service is polite and nice, but super slow... My coffee, water, orange juice and whole breakfast was long gone before someone finally showed up to ask how everything was. Tiny place and still didn't see the staff during my entire breakfast time. Was told like 3 times I'll get a refill of my coffee right away... That never happened.
