As for many things in Vegas, disappointment comes from over-priced, mediocre food complete with tacky neon lights. 
The food there was bland and uneventful. I had the chicken pesto sandwich that could have been decent if it weren't for the pile of dry mixed greens smashed on the dry bread. There was cheese in there somewhere and little globs of pesto, but paired with a gristley piece of chicken I was far from impressed. And I know what you're thinking- it's diner food, right? Well, I've been to my fair share of diners and had some really decent meals. This was not one of them.  I got fries on the side which were, shockingly, also not good. Some were cold, some were warm, but all of them mushy. Gross. 
My husband got an omelet with turkey and cheese and hollandaise sauce. He seemed to think it was okay, but not great. The egg was overcooked and made for a hard, chunk of omelet. 
The best part of this mess... oh wait, there is no best part... the bill was $28 for the two of us and that was without drinks. 
I give this place one star for tacky, over the top, quintessential  Vegas d√©cor and ambiance. Also, the waitresses wear these terrible tie-dye colored outfits where you can basically see their asses. Except these are not asses you'd want to see.  And then cocktail waitresses come out from the fire side area wearing formal wear to take your drink order. This place is a mess and I recommend it only if you're desperate to go broke for crap food.
