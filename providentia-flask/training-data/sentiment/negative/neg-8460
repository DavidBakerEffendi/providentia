Unfortunately, our experience didn't live up to the reviews we read. We were the only customers in the restaurant when we walked in. During our entire experience, the owner was sitting across from us and didn't acknowledge the poor service we had. We ordered the pizza and meatball sub since we read all about it on this website. Pizza came out and it was ok. Nothing special. I grew up in NY and it's definitely not close to what you get there. So our next hope was the meatball sub except it never came! Once they brought the pizza out, no one ever came back over to refill drinks, etc. When we finished eating, the waitress finally came over and my husband said "so I guess we aren't getting our meatball sub?" She goes oh and walks away, says something to the owner and he says to her "you took the order". We ask for our bill and walk out. There was no apology for the oversight from the waitress or the owner. Needless to say, with subpar food and poor service we won't be back. An experience we were looking forward to definitely ended up to be pretty disappointing.
