I ordered Pastelim to take to a potluck and they were not fully cooked. So everyone put it back in the container. The next day i re cooked them in the air fryer but the coating was so thick there was very little filling and no one really ate them. I dont know what the other dishes were like but i wont be going back. I want to be supportive of a new business but this dish was not edible.
