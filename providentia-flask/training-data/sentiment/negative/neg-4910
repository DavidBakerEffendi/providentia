At first I gave this place an average review.. Most of it is still valid.. Great band and atmosphere with little ventilation.  The security staff  needs some work.  The kicked the bachelor out of his bachelor  party  because he was having too much fun and the when 2 completely sober friends tried to ask why one of them was pushed down a flight of stairs by a bouncer.  Unacceptable by the security staff lead to our bachelor party to take our business  elsewhere.  There loss but businesses like this don't deserve a good reputation.  I hope I see the day this place goes out of business
