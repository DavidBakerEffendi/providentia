First not really good for kids, no boaster sits or high chair. This was my second time coming and it will be my last. I don't know if they are under new management or if they have a new cook but the food doesn't taste the same as it did before. It was under seasoned almost plan and I ordered the hot and spicy seafood ramen. It was a little spicy but the flavor of the ramen has gone down a lot, very disappointing.
