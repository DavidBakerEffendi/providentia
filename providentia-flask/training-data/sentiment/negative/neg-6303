Taking into account though the positive reviews, menu, and location of the restaraunt, I thought this might be a positive dining experience.  The service was wonderful, but the food left a lot to be desired.  I found the style and description of the menu to be both misleading and inaccurate.  Nothing really came out on the plate the way it was described.  The food in particular was extremely over salted - almost to the point of being inedible.  The quality of the ingredient was average at best.  The plating was clustered, busy, and very sloppy.  Flavors were very disjointed and lacked balance.  I would have rather had dinner at the Whole Foods salad bar.  I wish I could find a positive note to make me come back for a second try, but I just can't find one.  The food was just not good - in fact it was pretty gross.
