I would not recommended this buffet to anyone.  My husband and I had Sunday Brunch there and it was horrible. Most of the food was extremely cold, prime rib was extremely cold along with all the veggies.  I asked for the staff to heat up my food and was laughed at by the buffet workers.  My husband and I left since the food was so bad and left hungry!   We paid $34.00 each.  We will never return. We had eaten at the Mirage Buffet earlier in the year for $12.99 each and it was 5 stars better than Bellagio.
