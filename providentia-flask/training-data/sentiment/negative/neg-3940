Prior to this incident, I already have previous incident with this casino like two months ago.. my Mom was playing slots and i went to the table Games.. the pit boss are rude as hell accusing me of hiding my own Chips and wont let me buy another chips..

Today same incident the Pit Boss here are so Rude as Hell.. 

This will be the last visit in this property..
The Pit Boss at Rude No Customer Service and Doesnt Value The Customers at all..

The Dealers are not Knowledgable of the Table Games that they dealt like Paigow He doesnt know whats the Policy of the Casino.. Some Dealers Doesnt even look on the Hands and just pays customers instead of King high Paigow he paid the Customer with Flush cause all same colors.. 

Some Dealers are Rude as well FYi the Tip is Individual here so Some are Vicious on getting tip.. 
fyi tip is being earned if they deserve it.

The Slot Machines are Tight and you can even win anything here

The Restrooms are Filthy as well 

The rooms are not updated and old and smelly..

The only plus point here is the Mermaid Show for Kids other than that Bring Your Business to other Casino Like Southpoint and M Hotel

Good Luck again Avoid this Casino
