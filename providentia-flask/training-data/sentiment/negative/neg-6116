Where to begin... let's start with the order. I ordered off the yelp app. It charged my card and said it would be here in an hour. That hour passed so I called them and they immediately placed me on hold for 20 minutes. Which out checking in mind you. They clearly forgot about me. I hung up and called back in to them having time to take my order. I explained I was on hold for 20 minutes and there was no apology. Just "what's your name" and back on hold I went. They came back to tell me they don't have my order. I have them the order number and they have no record. She was clearly trying to get me off the phone and I told her my card was charged I'd like my order. She sighed and asked me what it was and they could make it for me. I told her large penne with garlic bread. Back on hold I went. She came back and magically found my order and said it would be delivered in 20 minutes. Never have I see complete lack of ownership from an establishment. She refused to acknowledge I was on the phone on hold for 20 minutes. Without arguing I wouldn't have my order. I'm currently waiting for my food now. Hoping that all this hassle was worth it. I will follow up.
