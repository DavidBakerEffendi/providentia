I arrive and am greeted by a charming waiter who is looking for the hostess. He checks the computer and tells me my date has already arrived and is seated. Then, oddly he and another continue to search for the hostess for 5 minutes, then take my jacket and seat me at a table ALONE, telling me they'll find my date in a few minutes. I spy him across the room, sitting alone so I tell the waiter and move.  My man tells me he asked for the drink list 5 minutes ago, the water glasses are empty and he's been there 10minutes. I take a look at the menu (and realized this was not the place we had wanted to dine- I mixed up the Winterlicious menus somehow(!!) but decided to make the most of it- my date was awesome and I'm not cooking! 

Winterlicious Prix Fix...  
The 'Stuffed Risotto Balls with Buffalo Mozzarella Tomato Ragout & Salted Cucumber' appetizer was akin to a deep fried mozzarella stick, glamorized with bland rice rather than batter and sitting atop what tasted like pizza sauce from a can. 
I had the Seafood Paella as a main- the rice tasted like it was bathed in cheap chicken broth it was so salty, four clams, two mussels,  two shrimp and a scallop gave it some texture but I could not distinguish any flavour other than salt! I didn't finish it- and that's not my style!! 
Dessert, I got a trio of sorbets- electric orange colours, very very sweet orange, mango was pretty good and a third flavour I couldn't distinguish- and no one mentioned. 
The highlight of the evenings meal was a glass of NZ Sauvingon Blanc and my great date!
