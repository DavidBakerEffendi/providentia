Why would a person want to go into a place where they virtually never get your order right.  How does an order for 2 large pomegranate smoothies with wheat grass blended in become half a banana with a side of wheat grass and a small pomegranate smoothie with a side of wheat grass?  What is worse when the fellow making the order argues with you that the order is right and you are wrong?  This is typical of the place.  A friend likes to go in there or they'd never see me again.  I make them read back what I order or they don't get my AMEX,   You can make then print out an itemized receipt.  I'd suggest it.   In all fairness, I can tell you they have gotten my order correct one and a half times.  That's not saying much is it.

The company could also spend a little money on some sound proofing this place.  I agree with Nadia C, with all the mixers going and the music, it's not some place you want to be for long.  But, they could spend the money to train their staff to learn how to ring orders properly, so making the place a little more quiet obviously is wishful thinking.

The parking leaves a lot to be desired now that the Verizon office is a few doors down from them.  You'd better be fast when there is an empty spot or it can really become ugly.

The best thing I can say for the place is they have good oatmeal.

I have truly enjoyed writing this review!

If you really want a much better smoothie go to Robeks on the NE corner of 16th and Camelback,  It's cleaner, nicer set up, and they have a magic ability to get your order right.
