Had to wait to be seated, hostess/cashier doing both positions, waitress finally comes over to advise us she will be with us in a few minutes. Place order to find out we would be substituting items because they ran out. Items were not brought out all at once leaving part of the meal cold. We will not be returning for a meal. Haven't had a problem with picking up pies. Disappointment, I have been eating here since they opened, looks like IHOP is our new spot when it opens.
