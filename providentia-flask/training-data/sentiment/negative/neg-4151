We were so excited to try this place out. The wait was an hour, which is fine, it's opening weekend but the staff didn't move at a pace that would suggest that they cared they were slammed. We ordered the Egg Salad Sandwich and the Bacon, Egg and Cheese (no sauce). I excepted the buns to be warm, although they were nice buns overall. There's no where to sit so we ate our food at the Chandelier Bar and went home. About three hours after eating his Bacon, Egg and Cheese sandwich my boyfriend began puking and has been ever since. I'm so glad we waited an hour in line only for him to contract food poisoning. Thanks Eggslut!
