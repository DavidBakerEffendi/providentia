I always thought of this place as the go-to meetup spot at night because it's iconic. The back patio is actually pretty nice. Now, I understand people getting kicked out for causing a ruckus and being extremely belligerent (they SHOULD get kicked out).  But both consecutive times, security kicked out my friends for very ODD reasons.

The first time was back in January 2016. We were sitting down chilling with our drinks. One of my friends was sitting down with us, but he was just to the side, not really interacting because he's a pretty reserved guy. Security came up to him telling him "You need to leave" without any explanation. What??? Kicking him out because he's not doing anything? OK............... [Insert Waka Flocka meme here]. 

The second time was recent (5/18/2018). One of my friends was told by security to leave because "she looked lost and was wandering around." UMMM WHAT??? It seems like Gold Spike is yearning for people to be surrounded and interactive with other people, and for what? You can't let someone just go to the bathroom by themselves????? LOL [Insert blinking white guy gif here].

If you want to come here, you need to babysit your friends. Don't let them look lonely, and don't let them wander around. Don't let them go to the bathroom by themselves. They're not only concerned about belligerent people; they apparently see people who can't find the bathroom by themselves a threat as well.

If this establishment wants to kick out people for certain behavior, they should post the standards of conduct in a public area. I'm trying to look for it on their website, and I see nothing. If you look at all their low-rated reviews, most of them are about situations with security. 

Besides that, overpriced drinks & food, weird music until midnight, and just strange vibes all around. I am never coming here and spending money here again. 

Tip: Go to Commonwealth and Inspire instead. :) Both have rooftop bars and play amazing music!
