I ordered sushi last night, I got horrendous food poisoning.  I have eaten sushi for 15 years and this is the first time I became violently ill.  I became horribly sick within the hour. The cramps were excruciating. The other food is ok, but the sushi is so sub-standard even in taste, I am amazed they can keep their doors open.
