Let me start by saying we went out of our way to come to this establishment because we enjoy the food. We came here expecting a wonderful night with my friends and we got a 2/10 experience. They literally forgot one of our friends sides (chili) and then proceeded to completely forget it was my OTHER friends birthdays.  I would have walked out without paying if I didn't have a conscious. The waiter did not deserve to be tipped. Sad I won't be returning.
