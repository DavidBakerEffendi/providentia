My wife got some biscuits and gravy. The sausage appeared to have been crumbled coarsely and added to a gravy. Not good at all. My wife also got some coupons at Fan Fest. Tghe girl at the drive-thru advised that they didn't honor them. I can undetstand that,m but it was the rude way that she spoke that aroused my ire. I will not be back.
