Nothing gourmet about a roach coach meals on wheels place. This is construction worker/carnival food. Oh wait, nothing gourmet a hot dog..(lower-grade muscle trimmings, fatty tissues, head meat, animal feet, animal skin, blood, liver and other edible slaughter by-products)and all that other nasty stuff in hot dogs. If you're into eating garbage food, go ahead about your ways. I will be staying away from this "gourmet" hotdog cart/stand and if they have a location I'll stay away!! Ewwee!!!
