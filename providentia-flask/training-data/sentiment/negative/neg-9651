After my second visit to D & Y sushi, I've decided that I'm not going back. The place seems like a front for some other business, quite frankly. The atmosphere/decor is thrown together and generic. There are rarely many customers, so the staff all congregate in a booth near the back of the restaurant, tapping on their cell phones.
So you're in a random, empty sushi restaurant. Once you finally get seated and get a menu in your hands, you then get hit with oddly high prices. Doing a quick online menu comparison, D & Y sushi is totally on par price-wise with high-end Toronto sushi restaurants such as Yuzu no Hana and Fune. Even more perplexing is that none of the main sushi rolls are accompanied by miso soup and salad. Those have to be ordered separately, adding up to an additional $7. 
The staff are more attentive towards their cell phones than they are to you. Once it gets late enough in the evening (after 9pm), they are all served dinner in their booth from a big bowl of food that looks way more delicious that what you've just been served. They will not be moved from their table while eating, even if you and the only other table of people in the place are waiting to pay your bill.
I guess the food tasted good enough, which is why I'm giving one star.
