Horrible customer service that serves cold food and refuses to replace it. Our Biryani was cold and rice gains were really hard. When we requested for another batch, he got pissed off and said see I can't even dip my finger in it as it is so hot. I told him that you have just contaminated the food. Anyways he took the platter away and came back after good 10 minutes and he could barely even hold it too. I touched the platter it was piping hot as it just came out from the high temperatures of microwave. The rice were microwaved; therefore, rice became even harder and dehydrated. Seekh kababs and naans were burned. Our mango milkshake was not even chilled; it was almost like room temperature. People here singing praises for their BUTTER CHICKEN and Garlic Naan. LET ME TELL YOU both BUTTER CHICKEN and Garlic naan should never be a caliber to evaluate Pakistani food, as they both are not Pakistani delicacies.   Staff is extremely rude. We never went back ever since and we won't be going ever again.
