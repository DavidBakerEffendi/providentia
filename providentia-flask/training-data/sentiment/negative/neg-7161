DO YOU EVER MAKE A DECISION AND INSTANTLY REGRET IT?

Yea, that's how this turned out. Running around doing errands. Busy morning. Needed breakfast. Ok, Jack in the Box. Never had breakfast here before but here goes.

Order a breakfast sandwich, hash brown and coffee. 

Sandwich forgettable.

Hash brown overcooked, greasy and gross.

Coffee, whatever.

Place dirty.

And I don't like that they hide where your food is being prepared. It just magically appears through a side window. Like, what are they doing back there?

I'll go hungry next time.
