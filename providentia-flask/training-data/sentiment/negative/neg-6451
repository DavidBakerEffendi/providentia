My wife and I went here based on the hype and reviews by other Yelp users. The parking situation is not ideal but we were lucky enough to find an available street parking. We took a look at the menu and I ended up getting a combo of Shrimp Egg Foo Young + Fried Rice and my wife ordered some noodles with pork and squid + rice. They served the food within 15 mins but the problem was they gave my wife noodles with pork and squid.. without any squid. The lady at the cashier asked the cook what happened and he said they're out of squid. (Now they tell us!) It would have been nice if they informed us first before cooking the food and serving it. Other restaurants do it, I'm not sure why they didn't. To make matters worse, they gave me a bowl of plain white rice, when their menu clearly said I was supposed to get fried rice. We didn't want the food to go to waste so we just went ahead and ate it anyways. Not coming back here again..
