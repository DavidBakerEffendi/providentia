Food was very average, spring roll was still frozen inside, dumpling looked like someone step on it, flat  and no taste, previous owner Diamond china was far more superior. Service was average, nothing spectacular to warrant 18% gratuity. This is not a good suggestion for the owner, I guarantee they would be out of business in next 12 months. The place had one other customer, that should have given us a hint before we sat down. I would not recommend this place. Food express on Decatur and Sahara is also very bad since the new owner took over.Both businesses with old owner was excellent. They were in business for over 25 years.
