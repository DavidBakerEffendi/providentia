I have given this place a fair chance. I have eaten here three times...tried three different things...and all have been bad. Bad bad bad. First time- Chicken Alfredo. The chicken was okay, had a little seasoning...wasn't the worst chicken I have been served. The alfredo?Zero taste. No salt. No seasoning. It was the most bland pasta sauce I have ever had in my life. I had to load it with salt and pepper for it to even taste like anything. Large portion though. Second time- Chicken fingers, loaded potato. The loaded potato is the only thing from Landmark that I would eat again. The chicken tenders were tough. Third try today- turkey triple decker club sandwich and onion rings. OKAY. This seemed like a safe choice. WRONG. The turkey is a "carved" turkey....and it is disgusting. It smells like bad lunch meat packaging. Its white and large chunks, and the cheese is abysmal off brand cheddar slices. I asked for mayo but no condiments on the sandwich. The bacon/lettuce/tomato is decent. I wish it had been a BLT. The onion rings are okay, and the ranch is very good thankfully. Really..if you have any self respect at all about what kind of food you spend your money on...just take the money you planned to spend here and go elsewhere. Or cook at home. It will be better than this place.
