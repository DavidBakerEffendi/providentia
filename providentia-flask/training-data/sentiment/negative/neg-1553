The setting and service was fabulous, however if you go there for food and drink think again.  $18 for about a two ounce martini, I don't think so!
The stroganoff was 90 percent noodles with a few mushrooms and a little tough beef strips.  The chicken enchiladas were really a pile of glop with also almost no chicken. $250 for  2 salads, chicken enchiladas, trout and stroganoff, none of which was even average.  The great setting does not make up for what a restaurant should do, serve good food and drink at a reasonable price.
