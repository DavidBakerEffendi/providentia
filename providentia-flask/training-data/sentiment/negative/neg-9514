My husband could not eat the bread on his pastrami sandwich, it was drenched with grease. When he complained to the waitress, she talked to her manager and they said "that's the way they make it"! I got the chicken Caesar salad, worst salad I've ever had for $16.00! Oh and $4 for ice tea! We will not be returning!
