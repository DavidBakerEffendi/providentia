Never ordering from them again! I have been a loyal customer of theirs for 2 years now, their ranch was love at first bite! I always get their pizza & garlic knots combo & sub the marinara for ranch ALWAYS! Well the last time I did the exact same thing for a work function saw what I thought was ranch wrapped in foil only to open it & it was marinara sauce. I understand we all make mistakes so I call & let them know that I didn't get the ranch like I requested. The lady on the phone said well you ordered this & this so where in there are supposed to get ranch cause neither one of them come with it. I told her I requested to sub the marinara instead the only reason I order from Angelina's is their RANCH! She then told me id have to wait 30 mins, for freaking ranch are you kidding me?! So I did and guess what they never showed sat around starving having my pizza get cold for nothing! So I'll take my business elsewhere to somewhere that appreciate their customers.
