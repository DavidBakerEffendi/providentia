What can I say, the service was absolutely ruined anything good regarding this place. We came her on Thursday 5/25 about 10:30 we had a group of about 6, however our server, I think his name was Eric, completely ignored us up until the other table across the restaurant had left. Twice I had to get up and go to the bar to get drinks because the server had not come around for more than 20 minutes or more. I think about it now and that's probably the worst 60 dollars I have wasted. Thanks for ruining our night, appreciate it
