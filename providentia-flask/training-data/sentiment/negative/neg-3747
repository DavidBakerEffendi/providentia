STAY AWAY !!!!!
This place is the worst!  Waited 20 min to get my food, to find out the made me the wrong plate.  Then all the meat was so dry, I couldn't even eat it!  I told the manger and she just looked at me like it was my fault lol..
This place is the worst! Please stay away, save your money.  I got sick to my stomach 30 minutes later.   Nasty food, nasty place
