Me and my daughters were the only ones in the place. Our pizzas took over 20 minutes. I ordered the 5 cheese pizza. It was so salty I could barely eat it.  As if someone poured salt on it. My waiter was very pleasant and interacted with my girls as if they are young ladies.... which I really liked.  Had I not been so hungry I would have sent the pizza back and left. It was that bad.
