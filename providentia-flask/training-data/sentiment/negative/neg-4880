What in gods Jewish name is the problem with you people and the service of breakfast coming out sooner than later.
"Mama it's so sad they don't have thintastic bagels any more." What is with you people.... 
PLEASE PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER? 
Where is our food?!!!! 
I ORDERED MY FOOD 25 minutes ago!!!


You people are so nice. AND there is always an issue here.



Because you "no longer have thin bagels" you have to cut the big ones down! WHAT?
AND then, the deal is, you run out of Everything bagels in the morning, a "fresh" batch comes out and the "bagels are to soft to cut," this was the issue with our breakfast this am.

And then you there at Einstein Eastern, you seem to sell out of bagels when we go at least once a week- YOU SELL OUT OF BAGELS BY 9 AM...? WHY? Isn't this poor planning? WHO BREAKFAST BAGEL PLACE SELLS OUT OF BAGELS FOR BREAKFAST? 

This is getting old Einstein Bagels. 
Why do we keep going? 
My 16 year old loves the thintastic egg white, mushroom and asparagus creation you serve... Plus, the service is lovely, minus the lack of food you run out of. 

You are always apologetic and so kind... It's quite amazing. 
Is this pour management when a breakfast establishment runs out of Bagels? WHAT IS IT? 
Is it possible to correct it once and for all?
