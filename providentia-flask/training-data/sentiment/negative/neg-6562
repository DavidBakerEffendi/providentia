So priceless. Customer service for the Wynn leaves me message here on Yelp wanting to "help". I contact them, a month later they actually call. Guy explains he just wants to help. He's SO sorry, so VERY sorry about my horrible experience. Wants to know what day I was there, where did I sit, what EXACTLY was my order. What time of day was it? What color socks did I have on? I take 20 minutes of my day for this guy so he can HELP. He gets off the phone telling me he will check into it and get things taken care of and made right. Calls back next day and tells me that he can do absolutely nothing. Nothing. Nadda. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Thanks and have a great day.

That's twice these clowns have robbed me of my valuable time. I feel like I should send them a bill.

Do yourself a favor. Stay across the street at the Palazzo. That's where I always stay and have never had a single issue. Except that is for the day I decided to walk across the street to the Wynn.
