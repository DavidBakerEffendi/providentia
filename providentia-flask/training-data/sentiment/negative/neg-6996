Don't even bother. After being seated, we were asked for our drink order. I asked if they had my favorite vodka. No, they didn't but they had a reasonable substitute. The waiter then runs off without asking how I wanted my drink. I had to chase him down and tell him. He then returns to our table and informs us that we have to pay an extra $10 per person for the expanded menu. I tell him I'd like to discuss this with my wife. His answer? "No. I need to know right now." That should have been the first clue. 20/20 hindsight, we should have bolted then. 
The drinks arrive. Mine is so weak, I'm not convinced he put any vodka in it. There is also a few anemic ice cubes floating on the top. I ask for a lime, he takes my drink from the table and returns with a brown lime down in the glass. Nice.
The "buffet" is pitiful. The dishes are all covered, and with nowhere to set your plate to uncover and serve yourself, it took teamwork between my wife and I to serve ourselves. The "salad bar" is lettuce, cherry tomatoes and artichoke hearts for the most part. I wasn't going to risk the potato salad or Cole slaw. 
With a plate of "buffet" items we have no room to put the meat, so I head back and get a couple of plates for the meats. 
The meats were overdone, fatty but plentiful. The poor kid who was cutting and serving the meat was working his butt off and was surprised when we asked for the check after just a few minutes. 
Not worth the Groupon price, even. Thank goodness I had it because if I had paid full price for that I would have exploded. 

It's no small feat for my wife and I to get out alone to a dinner and a few drinks. Our night was ruined from the first snotty demand out of the waiters mouth. 

Don't waste your time or money.
