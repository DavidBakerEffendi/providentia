Don't come here. The staff doesn't want you here. I sat in the drive thru, with no response for three minutes. I decided to go in to order since there was no answer at the drive thru. The signage was turned off, to deter anyone from believing the store was open. I walked in and waited for 60 seconds before I was told someone would be right with me, then was never acknowledged again. Someone even came out of the bathroom, walked right past me and went into the back. It's apparent I'm not the only person who has a low opinion of this establishment. Tropical Smoothie has definitely been on a decline in the last couple of years.
