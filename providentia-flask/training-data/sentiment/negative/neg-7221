First time visiting Pittsburgh in love with the city . Decided to visit this bar in my birthday and the worst customer service. First i went to the rooftop and after 10 min order my drink they close down the bar at 10:45pm . Still i wanted to stay went downstair to finish my drink and order more with our friends. Few people at the bar nice music. Request drinks and the bartenders for drinks and said i would be there in a sec . Call her attention saying in a polite way and the reply was always I would be there in a sec. Still has been 2 hours and yet no one has come to serve us .
Hope that the two young ladies serving the bar learn to have good manners and have the best customer service.
