Chicken was dry. Over cooked and the honey mustard wasn't honey mustard like us southerners expect. And well the prices are big 28 for a burger and strips combo. That my fly in Connecticut but it Def won't here. But the manager did check on us and offered to fix my food but I was mostly done already. So props on good service and management but and f for cost and quality
