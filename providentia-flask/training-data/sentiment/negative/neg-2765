Have been avoiding this place for the last year, due to repeated bad experiences.  Thought we'd give them another chance, and see if things have improved.

At the restaurant, we noticed that all of our side dishes were lukewarm, almost tepid, even though we watched them serve our meals fresh from the steam table. This was between 6:30 and 7:00 PM on a Sunday, so not just before closing time.

Unfortunately both me and my wife got food poisoning.  Again.
