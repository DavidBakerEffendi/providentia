Don't get anything other than the bento cuz it's a ripoff if you must visit this place. The portions (other than bento) are extremely small. Even then, all things on the menu are quite expensive and quality is not actually better than its competitors. I would say it's at the level or a little lower than All You Can Eat sushi. The non-japanese food is  mediocre and not worth the price. The bubble tea is nasty, don't even waste your $8 on it. It's powder mixed with water and very watered down. I couldn't finish it.

Found hair in my bento and in my drink as well. Not impressed.

Service was terrible. We wasted 40 mins waiting for our food. Our waitress was nowhere to be found so it was tough to even get our water filled. She messed up our bills 3 times (we all wanted separate bills) and had to go back and fix it again and again. This process took another 20 mins.

Avoid this place if you can. There are many better places with better prices and better food.
