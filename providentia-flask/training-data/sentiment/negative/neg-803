Enter at your own risk.  After waiting for twenty minutes, they served me overcooked goop of drunken noodles.  It was so bad that when I took my fork to eat,  the noodles were all stuck together.  And even after I complained, all the manager could say was "sorry".  This place is the definition of SORRY FOOD and SORRY CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
