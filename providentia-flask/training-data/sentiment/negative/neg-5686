One word: No.

The food is awful, you can get better and more authentic greek cuisine in a food court. The service was dreadful, besides the hostess who was pleasant. 

Overall, we did not feel welcome and left as soon as possible after literally choking down our entrees. They use those processed " __% meat protein" frozen chicken breasts for their souvlaki! Not acceptable.The salad was probably the best thing about this joint.
