Tricked....tricked again.

I went in today to KFC and the service was better this time. When I receive food that is wrong it throws every other good aspect out of the window. 

I ordered a Hot Nashville chicken lil and a Hot Honey chicken lil and when I got back to work they were, get this, plain!

Please. I want KFC to be good. I know whats possible! Think of the Colonel. He set standards. As a commissioned colonel i see it my responsibility to call upon the mistakes that are made here. 

Be better, do better, and dang it make sure the order is right.
