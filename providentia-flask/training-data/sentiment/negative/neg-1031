Waited 10 minutes to be seated. Wasn't even busy. No hello or anything just looked very upset to see us. Waitress looked very annoyed and no hello or welcome. One pound of wings is only 6 and very tiny. I asked for a coke three times and it never showed up except on my bill. I should've read the reviews before coming here.  I've been to other St. Louis bar and grills and they haven't been that bad but this one is the worst. I wonder if the owner even reads these reviews and realizes how bad his restaurant is.
