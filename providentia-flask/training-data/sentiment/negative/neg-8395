Went there several months ago and haven't returned. I ordered a bean burrito and husband ordered a taco (don't remember exact one). The burrito was pitiful, if they are able to make money on that then I should go into business! The beans were ok but the tortilla was from a package. The taco was better but not worth going back. The only thing for us that was good was the service.
