If I could give this place a zero I would. HORRIBLE food! My boyfriend and I paid $40 for just him and I, no drinks, other than the 75 cents they charge for water. We ate a hamburger and chicken nuggets (like we are at a kids restaurant). The food is worse than Mcdonalds. My bf's hamburger tasted as if it was cooked in the microwave. Very limited selection on the menu that is EXTREMELY over priced nasty bar food. The more I think of the concept the more stupid I think is to actually pay someone to be an asshole to you. Save your money go eat somewhere nice that actually has decent food and go to that show you always wanted to go to. I will never return to this ridiculous place.
