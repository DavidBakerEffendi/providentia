I loved this place once upon a time. It was cleaner, bigger and friendlier than it's northern parent. Been coming here for years and in the past had rated it at 5 stars. 

The last few times though, it's dirtier. The staff appears to be immature high kids. The service is much worse with every trip having some kind of service failure. 

Tonight I came for my birthday. At an hour before closing half the tables are covered in chairs and the place reeks of bleach. The prices are raised, but that has to happen sometimes. When our food is served it's wrong. Replacement food takes about :20 to get to us, after many patrons that arrived after the concern was raised got served and a reminder. My burrito was torn, and my quesadilla looked like a cat with a seizure prepared it. The only reason I could eat them is because they were almost completely empty. 

So... in short I'm not going back. I understand raising prices, but not while simultaneously subtracting service and potion size. Bye panda, I'll miss who you were when I first met you.
