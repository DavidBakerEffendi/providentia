This place gets one star, that star is ONLY based on the fact that it is a rooftop bar downtown.   Other than that single fact, this place blows.  Drinks are insanely expensive and the food was ridiculously expensive as well.  

The worst part about this place was we went on a rainy night and they had the roof covered. It was so hot and humid in there I was miserable! I mean really, is it too much to ask for a little AC or at the very less a fan? I'm paying $13 a drink over here, people!!! 

Go to the bar a couple doors down. It was a dive but they have drink specials every night of the week and cheap food. I can't recall the name but it is directly across from the Marriott courtyard, some sort of Irish pub/dive bar.  My husband and I shared a massive plate of cheese fries for 7$ and several 6$ martinis!
