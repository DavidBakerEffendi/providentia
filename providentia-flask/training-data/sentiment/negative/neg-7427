Our "dining" experience at Mango Thai ranks right up there as one of our all time WORST! Arriving at 7:30 on a Saturday night, and the ONLY car in the parking lot should have swayed us away, but already there, and in the mood for Thai, we ventured in. We ordered 3 Samurai Pad That with shrimp, and an orange chicken. While waiting for our meal, we took in our surroundings noticing several cloudy/merky and open fish tanks, electrical cords taped to the floor, and just an overall "dirty" feel to the place. We've enjoyed some amazing meals in "humble" hole in the wall restaurants overseas, humble is one thing, but there is no excuse for DIRTY! My teenage daughter even remarked  "Gee, let's play count the number of health code violations"... :(                                                                                                                                               The waitress also sported this same general 'who cares' attitude, as our meals arrived one at a time, with 10 minutes or so in between, and without comment. (We were the ONLY people in the place, so no "rush" in the kitchen) My Samurai Pad Thai consisted of half a plate of  plain undressed iceberg lettuce with a couple threads of carrot (was that an attempt at salad, or a very large garnish?? Not sure.)  The Pad Thai was very oily, void of vegetables, no peanuts, and basically just a half plate of noodles with a couple pieces of cilantro tossed in. Four small breaded shrimp adorned the plate, and after adding a hearty dose of chili to flavor..was just above eatable as a whole. I'd eaten half my meal before my friends dinner arrived. 
                                                                                                                                  
Our bill arrived with a mysterious additional $13 charge added. When I inquired about it, I was curtly told that 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill "because people are cheap and don't tip". Wow..really?!?!  Tacky, tacky!!  (Free clue: If people aren't tipping well, they felt the service was substandard or POOR!) Obviously, no interest  here in creating loyal and happy customers, OR a decent dining experience, just a 'penny wise-dollar short' mentality. Yuk!

VERY BAD experience overall!!  With "Thai Chili" just down the street at Val Vista & Baseline..sporting GREAT food, a nice ambiance, CLEAN, and excellent service for the same price, WHY accept THIS nasty bag of nonsense for your evening out???
