i didn't even want to give this place 1 star. i went in around 11:45, i asked if i could get some food while the bar keep was bringing out fucking food. he declined me food without even checking with the kitchen staff of a hot dog joint. then i still tried to give this place a chance and ordered a beer. i didn't leave a tip but, oh was i surprised when i got my bank statement. the fucking thief of a bar keep gave himself a tip. so you have been warned never go to happy dog and use your bank or credit card because they will rob you!
