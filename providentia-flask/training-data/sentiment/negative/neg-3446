Second time out of three that I ordered a breakfast burrito and it never got made. When I asked what was the problem, the cook said they never got my order. This happened TWICE out of 3 visits. I will never, ever, ever go there again. I would caution anyone else also, unless you have the patience of Gandhi.

That and the first time this happened, they said I never even ordered the food. Funny I got charged for it. I left passed off and said I would not go back. Shame on me. Had to go to Starbucks next door, not that good but at least they get the order.
