I'm giving this place one star because the food was decent. That's it, DECENT. The service was unbelievably bad. I think I would've enjoyed it more if I was eating it at home. The owner suggested we take the platter and I told him I wanted my own food and didn't want to share. He said that's not the tradition and gave me the look! They had single meals on their menu but he chose to ignore my request and brought us a platter anyway. I wish it went that smooth! We got there at 7:00 pm and we were starving. We got water at 7:15. They took our drink order at 7:30. They took our food order at 7:45 and we finally got food at 8:10! And it was a damn platter! It's not like they cooked to order and we had to wait for our meal to get cooked. I was starving so while waiting, I asked if I could try their salad. The owner said there's salad in the middle of our platter! He didn't sound or act like the owner. He acted like someone who's really mad at the owner and wants to drive him out of business. My girlfriend asked for orange juice and he went to the bar, opened a bottle of half-full minutemaid, poured it into glass and brought it over. All right in front of us! lol
The food was ok. Nothing amazing. Honestly after waiting for so long, I would've eat ANYTHING. 
If you're taller than 5'10" forget going to bathroom, the ceiling is so low, there's no way you don't come back with head injury.
I'm a huge coffee drinker and was excited to try their genuine Ethiopian coffee. Huge disappointment. Tasted like dirt and over roasted. Almost burnt and sour. 
This place it very small, very dark and has the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. They act as if they're doing you a huge favour by serving you food. I'll order if they start delivering as long as I don't have to deal with their arrogant owner and their incompetent staff because as I said I didn't mind the food.
