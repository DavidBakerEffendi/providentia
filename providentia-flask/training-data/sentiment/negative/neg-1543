I walked in with high hopes of finding some local vegan options, but left unable to try any food.

I have a severe dairy allergy and asked the two girls at the front counter about dairy being included in the chipotle spread. One looks down and could not answer and the other said "it's all packaged so we don't know what's in what, but I think it says processed with dairy". That works, but made me want to ask about the bread. I then was told that Gluten Free means no dairy. She repeated this 3 times and got louder each time and could not answer a simple questions without being argumentative when she's clearly ignorant.

They need to train their employees to know simple ingredients. I explained that I would go into shock/die if I ate dairy and they continued to say gluten-free means no dairy. It should have been embarrassing for them, but I just put down the menu and left. Basically, DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE SEVERE FOOD ALLERGIES.
