Doesn't compare to Villa Madina in the food courts. I crave for shwarma once in a while and always hoping to get that same flavour combination I get from Villa Madina; fresh salads, pickled veggies, hummus, garlic sauce, etc. This one was a disappointment and I felt gross after eating it. All the sauces melded together and the chicken was not tender. It was one hot mess. Oh, and the interior is super ghetto.
