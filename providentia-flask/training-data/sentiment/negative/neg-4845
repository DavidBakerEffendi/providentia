If your looking for cheap sushi thats under quality this is your place. I work in the restaurant business, and my previous position was at a sushi restaurant so I know sushi. The sushi is mediocre at best. It's a conveyor belt style so you get what you pay for. I tried ordering off the menu some nigiri and clearly it wasnt fresh considering they served it to me about 30 seconds after I odered. When your order nigiri it comes in 2 pieces on the same plate (priced on the menu as 2 pieces) but they serve you an empty plate under the sushi place which establishes you had two pieces of nigiri. Not understanding why they served me and extra plate under the nigiri I put it aside. They charged me for the 2 pieces of nigiri and they extra empty plate. When I asked why I was double charged they said they only charge the top plate. This was very confusing and not worth arguing the extra 3 dollars. In the end there are way better sushi places. I recommend seskan, sushi & cocktails, ahi revolving sushi, and ninja sushi. Cheers! Happy eating!
