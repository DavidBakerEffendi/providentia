Went there sunday afternoon at 1245pm! We were the 3rd order in line. At 13:25, the owner came to us and asked if we were order #47, our order were sitting on the counter for the pass 5 mins! Unbelievable! The girl who took our order actually looked at the bags several times! 
In my opinion, its NOT a good burger, the patty was super dry, outside of the patty was abit burnt too! For the price of fresh cook burger I had a much higher expectation!
