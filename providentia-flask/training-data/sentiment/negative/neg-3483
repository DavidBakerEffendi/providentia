I can't stand the owner here after a few short or I mean alot of short comings here I finally complained brought my pizza to them after being delivered and they are a total rip off and all the owner could tell me was"THIS IS MERICA BABY" THAT'S WHAT WE DO! This place is total b.s. And they wouldn't remake my pizza after I complained one of my extra toppings I paid for wasn't on the pizza but then again he did pick his hands through my pizza and found one... Lol UN believable then told me to take it back...I told him I wouldn't even feed my dogs his pizza keep it and left
