Called to make an order at 8PM they said it would be ready in an hour I go wow a hour okay maybe it's really good. I got there at 9PM server said 10-15 more minutes. I wait 30mins passes and she goes couple more minutes. At 9:50 I ask her what's going on she goes let me go back there and check...comes out 5 mins later and tells me oh he's having issues with the oven I'm not sure how much longer it will be. 9:55 I'm at McDonalds writing this review. Yup I'm pretty much not coming back. 
Tip: Ask them if their oven works before you order. Zero stars if I could coz I really didn't get anything from them ZERO!
