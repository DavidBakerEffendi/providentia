This place is disappointing for a brand new franchise. You would think after investing all that money they would want to hit it out of the park. The quality of the ingredients is sub-par but worse than you would except from a Domino's. I ordered the thin crust pizza and it came out like a giant cracker. Possibly one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. Zero reason to return or order from here again.
