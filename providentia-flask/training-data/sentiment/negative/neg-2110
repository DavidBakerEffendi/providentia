I don't complain about my food much however a review is necessary (it is my first), I can only compare this place to Chipotle and it doesn't even compare.

When you go in they have a size menu to how big you want your burrito to be, so if I were you go with the small to try or big if your hungry, I did take the huge and it was pretty big maybe a little bigger than Chipotle but not a huge difference.

Like I said I'm comparing this to Chipotle because I love how homemade it is, the process and all the flavour.

First of all they don't have saut√©ed peppers and onions, and the beans are fake, came from a box like a bean fake spread you can buy at the grocery store nothing unique about it.  The rice was cooked alright. The toppings are your usual toppings nothing fancy, even though the guacamole is free they are scared to put any on, while in Chipotle if you get charged extra they make sure they put it on every where.  

Overall the taste of the burrito was bland, it was lacking flavour and seasoning.  It's called salt and pepper none existing, cilantro as one of your toppings really? Caned salsa and bean paste as well.  Also the taste of the tortilla itself wasn't great at all.

Not to mention while your burrito is done, you have to wait an extra 6 minutes until they heat it and give it grill marks on the flat top.  Why would I want my sour cream and guac heating up? 

I paid roughly $11 for a chicken burrito with tax for a HUGE, I would pick Chipotle any day of the week for $12.50 with the guac.

PS I can make a better Burrito at home as I cook alot, can't see this place sticking around for long especially when people were going in NY Fries and not The Golden Burrito
