Didn't try the food.  

In fact, I went as they had their grand opening with the thought of ordering food for the family.  As they are picky eaters, I looked at the menu.  The menu was not  as diverse as some, and knowing that some restaurants will special order food for you or modify a recipe, I asked if they could make something that was not on the menu.  Rather than saying they could not, the comment was made with a very rude tone, "My chef is an authentic Chinese Chef and what you are ordering is not Chinese, but something made up for Americans.  He won't make that."  It wasn't what he said, but how he said it and with such disdain that I will never darken the doorstep of this restaurant again.
