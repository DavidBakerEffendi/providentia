After seeing this place so many times figured we would finally try it out. The service was good food was not worth the money at all. The chicken has little to no flavour and the portion size was very very small for the price. I could barely find the teaspoon scoop of guacamole on it. We ended up having to go out for more food after (and we don't have huge appetites).Toronto has much better Mexican fast food locations.
