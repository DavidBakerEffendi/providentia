Let's get the good out of the way before getting into this 1 star. Food good, beer? Great. 

Ok. Now service. We've never been so insulted at a brewpub. Our tab was $46, with taxes. I threw $5 on for tip. Our waiter, who came by once to get our first order, 2nd to bring food (2 bowls of soup), and 3rd to bring next round, proceeded to tell us that we did not tip enough. Seriously?! This entitled millennial is griping over $1!!! Not to mention this joker was on his phone and drinking beer behind the bar! Just looking at some of the other reviews on here, I'm not surprised with this behaviour! It really is too bad. We sat there tonight really enjoying the beer and said we'd come back tomorrow. Not now!!! We'll give our money and justified tips to other establishments in this city. This was embarrassing and deflated our evening! Perhaps get the hardworking staff in the back to run front of house; the condescending tool you had out front tonight was an elitist twit that will turn away customers!
