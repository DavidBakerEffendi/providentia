Let me start off with saying that the number one thing this place needs to fix is the Attitude of its serving staff.  The comments, facial expressions, and total lack of enthusiasm to help their customers is what will truly be their downfall. Everyone from the hosts, servers, bar staff, and Managers really need help on just being nice to the people that come to your establishment to give them their hard earned money.

From the outside, the location is hard to find because the sign is written in black letters on a black wall.  I really do not know what they are trying to pull off there, but it does not work.

The ambience is nice.  It is your typical supper club.  They serve dinner until approximately 10pm and then it turns into a nightclub after.  

The food was decent but not worth the price. I did not get my dessert and when I told the server this.... the first words that came out of his mouth were "well I put them down on the table somewhere." Immediately I gave him a nasty look and promptly replied that I just wanted to let you know that I did not get my dessert.  Thats all.  Another example of attitude is when my friend ordered a drink that never came, the server gave him a smart ass answer and asked my friend "do you want this to be a good night or a bad night?" 

There were many other examples throughout the night of our less than subpar service as well but I will talk about some of the good things here.

The music and DJ was on point and he was playing some great mixes! The bottle service selection was good and our host was actually nice to us.

Bloke & 4th needs to change a lot of things in order to keep customers coming back.  I would not recommend you go here for supper but feel free to go have a good time at their night club.
