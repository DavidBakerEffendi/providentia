4/6/2018 I went to place an order total $47.19. The order was so much food that I did not realize they had not given me my shrimp dinner until I was half way home. I called to let them know I have not received my shrimp dinner, they had me on hold for about five minutes. When they finally put the manager on the phones she informs me that they didn't even make the shrimp dinner but she sees the order. She then said it will be about ten minutes to make the order. Meanwhile the other food is getting cold that they already gave me. She then says 'Ma'am I apologize. I will give you a refund for the meal. The server comes out with the meal, I ask him how they were going to do my refund since I used a credit card. He says hold on I didn't know anything about the refund. He runs back in, comes out about five minutes later. The other food is still getting colder. He comes to the window and says 'We will return your money THIS time but we don't do refunds. I said this was not on me. My server owned up to not giving me the dinner. Plus I had to turn around, and my other food was getting cold'. He said with an angry voice 'Ma'am we don't give refunds'. Remind you the manger offered me an refund. I will NEVER return!
