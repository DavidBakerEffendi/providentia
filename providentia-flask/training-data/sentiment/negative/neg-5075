Came here because of the good reviews on Google mostly and for a dire craving of granny's homemade Trini food. Not only was I extremely disappointed but also somewhat insulted that a restaurant would serve anything like this. Ordered the chicken roti.. The roti shell was sad and reheated in the microwave for so long that it began to harden and there was only about 1 tbl spoon of chicken inside not to mention the all the water oozing out, once again from reheating in the microwave. The sauces were watered down, the doubles were soggy and the worst were the beef patties courtesy of Loblaws, featuring yes, Chef Microwave again!! $50 later all I'm left with is an empty stomach and bleak hope for humanity. Please stay away. Real Trini food is not like this at all.. Not even close. Please change the way you do things or close down already Jean, spare the people. Otherwise, maybe this review will.
