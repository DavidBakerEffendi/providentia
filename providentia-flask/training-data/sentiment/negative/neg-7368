We go here every year when we visit Vegas.  Never again. 

It's entirely possible our server was just awful however he took quite a long time to arrive to take our order, didn't return once for 15 minutes to refill drinks, etc (we had to leverage 2 other waitstaff).  Finally returned to deliver 1/2 of food to table.  10 minutes later we had to ask another server to find him for the rest of our food.  Our sever returns shortly thereafter with food, which isn't ours.  When confronted with the fact that he messed up the order he became enraged, left our table, threw the plate of food in the busser cart with a large crash and audibly announced to everyone that he would not return to our table...all because of his own mistake.  Good riddance to him.

Get new staff, you can't have an attitude like that when you work in the service industry.
