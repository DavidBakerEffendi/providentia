If I could give 0 stars I would this place got me ill from their shrimp also the service SUCKED with a capital SSSSS ..  and they waited on like 5 other tables before us and we were seated first I think they might have been racist which doesn't surprise me or the old man who runs this joint needs to hang up the apron and let the young bucks handle the waitressing it wouldn't matter though because the tasteless subpar salsa and greasy chips wouldn't be worth coming in for anyway
