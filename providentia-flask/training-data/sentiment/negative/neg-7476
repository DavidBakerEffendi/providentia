The service was very poor. Walked in and was not greeted by hostess to be seated. We had to walk up to someone cleaning a table to request to be seated. Asked if we can sit on the patio. Waited a few minutes and I believe it was the owner or manager came out to us and said the entire patio is reserved for a private party and is not available. Which is interesting because my brother had called earlier to make a reservation but was told they don't take reservations. Hmmm. Interesting. When I brought this up to the worker, she stumbled through her words and said the reservation was in an hour so if we will finish our brunch in an hour she can sit us in the patio. We said fine. Reservation for this mysterious private party was at 12 noon. It was now just past 11 am. We were given a time limit for our brunch. Rude but whatever. Around 11:30 they sat a couple people out in the patio. Around 11:45 another group with a dog was also seated. But wait.. wasn't there a private party reserved for the patio at 12? That's why we were originally denied the patio but now all of a sudden other people were being seated there with no problem? We ended up leaving around 12:15 and guess what, no private party ever showed up. Not sure why the lies and why we were denied the patio originally when other people got seated no problem. The food was okay. Chicken and waffles was actually pretty good but because of the service I don't expect ever going back there again.
