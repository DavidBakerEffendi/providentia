My hubby and I went in to have some dinner and well he ordered his usual 4 al pastor tacos with pineapple and they were mediocre at best well I decided to try the new steak nachos they added to their menu and well sense they're NACHOS I asked to get NACHO cheese on them and the cashier said it would be $2 extra for NACHO Cheese on my NACHOS I told her that I didn't want the shredded Mozzarella I only wanted the nacho cheese and she went and asked one of the cooks if it was extra for the nacho cheese and he said yes and I explained that it didn't make sense that the steak fries were $10.50 with nacho cheese and the steak nachos were $10.50 with the shredded mozzarella and all I wanted was for her to switch the cheeses she said that they couldn't do that and that it was $2 extra which equalled $12.50 for a medium portion of steak nachos never have I paid so much for nachos and they were not that great not only that but sense the cook got my order wrong and I returned them and asked to get my order exactly how I wanted them sense I did have to pay extra he got mad and gave me the most unappetizing nachos ever the first order look delicious and I was excited for them and then I noticed they got my order wrong so when I returned them I could hear him yelling in Spanish saying what the fuck it's just cheese and why are people so dam picky and come on if I pay for something and end up having to pay extra for It I want exactly how I ordered them! I honestly regret buying them and going there for dinner they have really bad customer service and the cooks are assholes the cashiers laugh at people that come in and they're all around mean they lack customer service I really hope they close this place down!
