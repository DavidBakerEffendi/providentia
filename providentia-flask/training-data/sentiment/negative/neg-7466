just left there w dad n his friend. Restaurant was not crowded and took an hour for our food. Dad got steak and shrimp and the excuse for taking so long was the baby steak. A steak that small does not take that long to cook. Very disappointed. This location has only been open a couple of weeks. Very disappointing
