This restaurant definitely does not live up to standards... I don't know if Bob Taylor is still around but if not I can only assume he is rolling in his grave. They need to lower their prices by a long shot. The environment felt crowded and like we were all sitting on top of each other. The waitress we had was more of a Tuesday brunch waitress and definitely not a Friday night. She was slow and didn't take very good care of my wife and I and it didn't really seem like she had very many tables to account for it. The food we were served didn't have much flavor and was not worth the money we had to pay for it.. I couldn't even eat a good 40% of my baked potato because it was so burnt. And if you like a little bit of salad with a bowl of ranch you won't be disappointed. My NY strip was cooked correctly but still wasn't very good... it lacked flavor and I couldn't even eat close to 4oz of my 12 oz steak due to the quality of the meat itself. My wife ordered the chicken cordon bleu and ended up not eating a quarter of it. It seemed as though they forgot it was in the fryer for a good 3 minutes past done and decided to serve it anyway. To put it simply the food lacked flavor and definitely quality and at the prices they should definitely have better quality waitstaff and food. I will not visit this establishment again unless they start selling the steak for about $6 a plate... The atmosphere didn't scream $30+ a plate cuisine either.
