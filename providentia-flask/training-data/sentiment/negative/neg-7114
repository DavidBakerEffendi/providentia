I've had this restaurant on my 'places to check out' list for quite a while now. I finally got there for lunch the other day, and was so disappointed that I decided to write a review. The ambiance was great, place was nice and clean...and there was plenty of cute ASU girls in there...but that wasn't enough to distract me from how awful the food was. I was under the impression that this was a good restaurant for light, healthy fare, but that really wasn't the case. For $12 I got a tuna melt and potato chips. The tuna was more like coleslaw, and there was so little of it that I probably could have stuffed the entire portion into a shot glass. The bread was soggy with grease and butter. There was so much liquid that I could have filled a cup and drank my lunch. Gross. I would have ordered something else, but the line was much too long and I had a limited amount of time. I actually ended up stopping at a place around the corner to pick up a 2nd meal that I could actually eat. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. My friend got the cobb sandwich and wasn't thrilled with his either. Maybe I'll try again with the breakfast.
