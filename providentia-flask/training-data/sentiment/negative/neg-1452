We walked in and looked around. It was quite busy. We thought it would be fun and give it a try. As we were waiting for a table, one of the people in our party went to the bathroom. On the way to the restroom, one of the waitress' was walking and she turned around abruptly and happened to smack her in the face. There was no real apology and she moved on. My friend was super stunned and did not know what to say. She then got really mad, went up to the front told us. We talked to the front person and she didn't seem sympathetic at all and brushed it off. At that point we decided to leave. My friends and I would never go back because of that callous attitude by the staff. And by the other reviews on here, why would anyone frequent a place that has high prices, cold food, rude wait staff and long wait times. There are so many more options in that area
