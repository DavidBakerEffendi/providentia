I'll start off by prefacing this review by stating that we went for the buffet, and perhaps the made-to-order food is better. That being said, if you're a restaurant and you're offering food to customers, it should be good, regardless. 

To keep it short: Sushi was disproportionately rice-heavy, the rice was sort of mushy, and the ingredients didn't taste fresh either. This definitely isn't my first "low-quality, high quantity" sushi buffet, but this was the worst I've ever had. 

Having just moved to Charlotte and left behind all of my favorite restaurants, I was excited to go to the "best" sushi spot in Charlotte. We left unsatisfied and sort of grossed out, though, and have not given them a second chance, as the first was bad enough.
