Really just isn't good. Used to be one of the better seafood places around town but the 2 times I've been forced to come here in the past 3 years its been awful. 

The only reason I go is because my 85 year old grandfather with dying taste buds remembers how good this place was 10 years ago and he still thinks he likes it. 

Order the lobster or order the crab and I swear to god it's been dead for a week. The best place to get 25 dollars worth of food for 150 bucks.
