I'm a HUGE fan of the Paramount near the Eaton Centre, so when this place opened up near work, I was super excited.

It's very disappointing.

The bowls and plates are not generous. At the Yonge location, you can order way more than you can eat for so cheap. Here, not so much. Everything is very carefully measured out. Tt seems much more expensive.

When they announced that they were opening here, I figured they'd be selling me lunch 4 or 5 times per work week, no question; instead, I went twice and then never again. :-/
