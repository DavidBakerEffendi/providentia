Horrible experience! My sister-in-law and I went for our birthday dinner. I called at 10:18 am the morning of the dinner to book a reservation (yes I know the exact time because I had to show the guy at the front (presumably the manager) my call log). The person I spoke with took my name, number and amount of people in my party. So imagine my surprise when I get there to discover there is no reservation. They advised they would get us seated in about thirty minutes. Annoying but a few people in our party were running behind so I didn't make to big of a deal about it. we grabbed drinks while waiting for a table. Well time continued on and all 16 of our party members corralled around the bar, at this point starving so eating chips and queso, whilst standing and seemingly aggravating the wait staff that walked by us. Finally after waiting over an hour, we are seated. Determined to have a good birthday I press forward. Unfortunately, there was only one server assisting and she seemed to already have multiple tables in addition to ours. She never took an actual table drink order, just brought out water, and if you could catch her walking by you could request an alcoholic beverage. Every time a question was asked of her, the tone always seemed annoyed that we even asked as opposed to wanting to be helpful. Our food took over an hour to come out and no one's food was hot. My boyfriends fajitas were so cold that he could put his hand directly on the cast iron skillet. He described it to me as "refrigerator cold." Management offered to give us 3 free apps for the table. I had to flag the waitress down to order them. Unfortunately the first two appetizers I wanted they were out of, so kind of had to take what was available. All in all, I would describe the experience as chaotic, unorganized and completely disappointing.
