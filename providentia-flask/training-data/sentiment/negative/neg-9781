Disgusting service and horrible food. Would never ever go back. There was a blonde woman as a hostess; completely unprofessional and rude. We had a very large company order which I understand takes time to complete but the rudeness of this woman was unwarranted. Food was cold and burgers were soggy, tasted like frozen burgers, the mozzarella sticks were of the frozen kind and were half cooked. The hostess had to ring up each order separate which she complained about each and every one and said to me I assume no tip and told me over the phone I just want you to know we personally prepare this for you and other snide comments were made. Will never ever go back
