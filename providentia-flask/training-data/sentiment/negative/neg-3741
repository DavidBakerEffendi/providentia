In all fairness this could be a 2 star review, but I was REALLY put off by Fred's Not Here. This restaurant relies on its location across the street from the Princess of Whales and Royal Alex theatres, rather than quality food and excellent service. 

The food sucked. My shrimp cocktail had 3 shrimp that had seen fresher days. My mother's scallops were like rubber. I had the tuna, specified I wanted it SEARED, and it was brought to me cooked medium rare.  I question the attentiveness of the sever.  I sent the tuna back and they made me a new one, and it was okay.

Our server was short with us and rude. She gave off a strong vibe that said: "I'd rather be somewhere else." Maybe she was having a bad day...


Fred's Not Here has a very touristy vibe. I advise the tourists, or anybody, reading this review, to go somewhere else. There are much better places to dine in Toronto's theatre district.
