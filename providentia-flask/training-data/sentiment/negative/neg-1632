Bad food, not so great service... I will definitely not be going back to this restaurant! The location is clean but the food was no where close to what you would expect. I ordered the Mojito Chicken and could not find one piece of chicken on it and it did not taste good. Plus the guy working there seemed like he didn't want to be bothered so that added more negativity to the experience. Do yourself a favor and go to Fry Bread House off of Indian School! It's delicious and better priced than this place. Well worth the drive...
