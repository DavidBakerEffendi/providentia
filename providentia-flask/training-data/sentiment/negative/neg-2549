Came in here for breakfast. Food was meh. Hash brown and sausages seemed commercial. Eggs were eggs, a bit bland. 

But this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I seated my napkin was a bit crumbled and there where some unused packets of syrup. (packets, really?)

It was obvious they hadn't cleaned the table completely, yet the hostess just took the napkin, and I had to call her attention to the packets.

Basically everything was ok (not good). When I was done I decided to wait a few seconds and watch them clean the table to my left. They just picked up the dishes and napkins and wiped any area that was not covered or hard to reach. Since there were to big placemats they were not cleaned or anything and all the crumbs were left on them. Also the area that the check was on was never wiped, nor the other diagonal side because that would have meant walking around the table to clean the other side.

So it get's 1 star for less than minimum cleanliness required.
