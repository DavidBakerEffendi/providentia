Just stayed at the Serene and it is no resort. This hotel had a friendly staff but the room wa as run down mess.  The shower was really gross and not cleaned properly. The toilet paper holder. The towel holder and the blinds were falling out of the wall. The faucet in the bathroom was broken and loose.  The room smelled like cigarettes when we walked in and the furniture was run down. Not a great experience at all and will not be returning 
As i said. Friendly staff but they did not 
accommodate for the rundown and dirty room
