This was my second (and final) visit to this subway. 
The first time I went to this location I ordered a veggie delight to go and the bread was so stale (when I got back to work) I had to throw my sandwich away without being able to eat it. Major sad face! 
Today I decided to give them a second shot and the kid that was making my sandwich was so busy turning around and talking to the other teen employee, he had to ask me everything 2-3 times since he wasn't paying attention to me. After watching him ruin my sandwich, I decided I was not paying for that nor was it edible and said so to the older lady (was she a manager?). She stood there just quiet, not a word, but the teen girl ( the object of affection of my sandwich maker kid) and she rudely said to me they would have to remake my sandwich ... ummm yeah that's what I want...to pay for an edible sandwich that isn't all wrong and also with the top half of the bread fallen off completely . She was so rude with me (yet I was being completely professional) about it and I decided I'd have enough of this awful service , I told them that they wouldn't have to go through the burden of making me a new sandwich since their customer service was very poorly lacking and I left.
