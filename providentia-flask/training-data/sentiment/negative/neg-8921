Invited by my bff to see Pluto for Planet Thursday night...VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! We were the ONLY bar guests when we arrived...we felt like we were a burden to the bar staff. Very no personal staff...we ordered fish and chips and Shepard pie...food was AWESOME but down played by bad staff!!! We came to see Pluto for Planet...paid our tap.  Went to the patio to see the band. NOT ONCE did any staff member come by to see if we needed a drink etc...We went inside to the bar.  LADIES working the bar took 15 to 20 mins to stop flirting to even notice us ladies needed a drink...I had to  move twice to even be noticed!!!! I ordered a double Macallean 12 on the rocks...bartender pulled bottle and glenfiedich as well...turned her back to me and poured the cheaper scotch BUT charged me for the Macallean...what bs!!! REALLY??? My 1st time to this Pub and I will NEVER come back thanks to the horrible bat service and pouring a lower price scotch for a top shelf one....I do work in the restaurant business and I have NEVER seen Women ignored like I did the other night ! Great food and atmosphere  but staff needs to be aware of how they are treating female quests!!! Could have been a tip the bill but nope...whole bar staff left such a bad taste....do better!
