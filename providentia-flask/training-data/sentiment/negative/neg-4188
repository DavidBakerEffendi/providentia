I wish I could select "zero"stars but I'm forced to chose at least one... Thursday afternoon, 4:40 PM... Place is empty... Me, My wife and my daughter. My daughter does not enjoy Japanese food so, we brought her own subway meal. When I told the female server is just going to be two eating, she gave me a disgusting face, and star moving her head saying not here... I said, she can eat this here right? Pointing to her meal... And she just move her from left to right, giving us a disgusting face again and pulling the menus away from us.... We turn around and left. I guess they prefer an empty restaurant than receive revenue from two customers. I really like to support small business but this attitude really kills it. My daughter felt bad as she couldn't enjoy a meal with us, eating what she liked.  Way to go!!!
