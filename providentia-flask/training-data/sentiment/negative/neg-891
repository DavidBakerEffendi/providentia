My wife and I have dined at Mimi's Café many times over the years. The service in the PAST was great! HOWEVER things have changed!!! 

It was decided to update the menu which resulted in a big change. I attempted to order my usual Swiss Cheese omelet with bacon. The new menu did not list this--oh they had omelets but with ingredients I do not want with eggs. I attempted to order the Swiss Cheese/Bacon omelet but was warned it would be costly. I would have to order a plain omelet with added cheese and bacon. Ok, I thought for a minute and ordered one of their omelets with all the stuff I did not want BUT had them REMOVED everything but the cheese/bacon. Toast and hash browns were included.

The order arrived without the toast and hash browns--they'll be right out---I was told. NOT! Do I leave the omelet to get cold or start eating? I decided to start, the toast arrived when the omelet was half way gone but no hash browns! Oh, the kitchen is making a new batch, really? They arrived when I was finished with my meal.

The moral of this review, if you have a restaurant with a good working menu and want to destroy your business, change the menu into something that just doesn't work. We will NEVER return to Mimi's Café!
