Why? Why did I give them another chance? Oh, right... Because it was the only buffet actually on the Tix4Tonight dining pass.  They had several buffets on the list at their booth but when I then pulled the list up on their website (they did not provide me with an actual list), the only buffet there was the one at TI.  Stupid me, I went there. Awful. Simply awful. Hard to think it possible, but it was even worse than two years ago. How do they stay in business?
