The place is terrible! Every time I go there they make a mistake! They can't keep my order straight even when I order online and give them my telephone number today they tried to charge me $104 for a $38 order! The other times I go for take out they don't know how to use the cineplex card to pay for the order or they have a deal with CAA for 2 can dine for $15.99 and they don't understand it. It takes me 30 mins or more to get an order that was ordered online and not because it isn't ready because my food was cold when I brought it home and I live 5 mins away by car. It is absolutely ridiculous. I can understand the odd mistake but not every time I come there! Today was the last straw never coming back!
