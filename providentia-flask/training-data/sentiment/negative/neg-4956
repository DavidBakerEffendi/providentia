It is very frustrating to get my order in.  I see it get incorrect and try to fix it but the employees do not hear you.  

To make things worse, my order was switched with the lady in front of me. I gave up because I was hungry but let the girls at the register know.

For the record. I ordered a burrito enchilada style with fire Chicken and green sauce. 

What I got was burrito enchilada style with shredded chicken and red sauce. 

I was very disappointed and frustrated. 

Also your assembly line was so chaotic and loud it was hard to get your employees attention. 

The lady making tortillas taking orders did not communicate my party's order correct either. That is where the problem ultimately began. 

I was so excited to have my work friends try Cafe Rio however I am now embarrassed as they all had a bad experience here.
