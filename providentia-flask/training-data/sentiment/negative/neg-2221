I go to this market some time. The good thing is that they open until 12 am so I can stop by this place late night. The bad thing is that those hispanic workers are very unprofessional.  I do speak Spanish and understand what they are saying in Spanish inside the store. My experience today was the worst... Three of Mexican workers were using nasty cursing words in front of the customers assuming that no one understood what they were saying, such as "puta(Bitch or whore)' or "chingado(F--- u)." Those are extremely nasty & disrespectful cursing words and I was totally grossed out. I told them that they shouldn't use those nasty words in front of the customers then one of them joked, "Puta means pretty in Korean." Of course not.. That really insults Koreans and their culture. I was totally disappointed in their unprofessional act and attitude and would like to stay away from this store for a while. It doesn't matter what language they speak, but they should NEVER use disrespectful cursing words in front of the customers. End of the line.
