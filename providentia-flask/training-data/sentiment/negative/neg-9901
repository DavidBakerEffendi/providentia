I am going to start this review by saying the some of the staff we have dealt with have been friendly and TRY to at least make things right. However, the quality of the food really kills this place. 

My wife and boys really love donuts and we tried to make this our Sunday morning spot. However, after consistently getting food that is either cold, undercooked, over cooked, stale, rubbery, with hair on it, or weird shades of gray, we can't do it anymore. 

We tried and tried Dunkin! You let us down. I don't want a refund. I want you to fix the system in your store that is broken. 

In all honesty, if you need a donut, go across the street to Bosa Donuts. Support a local business and actually enjoy your food. Sorry Dunkin...get your life together and maybe we will come back.
