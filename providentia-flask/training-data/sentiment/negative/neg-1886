Incredibly disappointed with how I was treated by the female manager who took my complaint regarding not one, but two messed up orders. My husband and I have loved the food from day one which has kept us coming back. I called management to discuss how the two most recent take out orders delivered by Grubhub were completely messed up and it affected my kids eating their meals. I expected perhaps an apology or at least someone sounding like they cared about my experience. NOPE. The manager only made excuses for the kitchen, and continued by informing me that if I wanted my order correct I should've called the restaurant AFTER placing my online order to check for accuracy. This manager left an extremely nasty taste in my mouth and obviously didn't care about losing  my business. I therefore will take my business elsewhere...we're in Vegas where there are many restaurants from which to choose. Just having good food doesn't justify spending my money at your establishment.
