Not your typical Vibe or crowd for this area felt more like something that should be on Mill Avenue. Food menu was extremely underwhelming service was horrible never got an actual tab just took my cash and gave me a change and the incorrect change at that. Don't waste your time here there's a lot cooler bars like undertow and the attic nearby.
