Go here if u r drunk and hungry after midnight and need to fill the belly...I guess you have no other choice if you are in the east end...

other choice is going downtown.

Do not order the dumpling  with soup.it's dry. They have no idea on keeping it with the soup. I was foolish to expect quality food from here.

Price was too much. 

If the owner of Congee Queen reads this...I suggest you try keeping the Kennedy Sheppard location open 24 hours from Friday until 5 am Monday.  

I would travel 45 minutes go to there instead of this dump.

I guess when your choices are limited and your drunk enough and taste doesn't matter....this is the Perfect Place to eat.
