This is some of the worst Mexican food in Charlotte. Being from Colorado, I'm a little picky, but this just isn't even Tex-Mex. I had the enchilada and chalupa combo plate. The sauce on the enchilada was just plain gross. The rice was dry, the chalupa was eh, at best. 
And then there is the noise level in the place - LOUD! We were a table of 8 and couldn't even hear the person that was sitting across from us. Our table was basically in the aisle, so constantly having to pull our chairs in so the servers and people could get by us. Who has a seating arrangement like this?
Every single one of us said we will not be back. Azteca, Don Pedro's and Paco's Taco's are much better! If you know your Mexican food, stay away!
