This is the first bad review I have left for Five Guys.  This time they served us cold fries and screwed up our order and we were customer number 4 and our bill totaled over $40.  They did remake the order, but by the time my burger came out the rest of my party had finished their meal. This a considerable failure on Five Guys' part.
