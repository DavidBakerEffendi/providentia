I had such high hopes in this place. The customer service was the worst. They didn't make eye contact when I picked up my Togo order. I ordered the southwest salad and it was sloppily thrown together.  While I was in there the place was filled with smoke. They either didn't have vents or did not have them on. Their was over flowing garbage and garbage on the tables. The staff only seemed interested in talking amongst themselves. I'll never go back.
