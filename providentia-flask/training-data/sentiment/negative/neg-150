This IHOP is just like every other IHOP except for its proximity to ASU campus. I have eaten there so many times that I cannot even count them. All due to proximity and availability, never due to desire. 

This is the only restaurant I have watched someone get sick in. It is packed after the bars get out at 2am. It is busy all night. Often with those who are under 21 but over 18 drinking coffee and acting as though it is their living room. 

Go here for sustenance only!!
