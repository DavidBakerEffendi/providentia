Yikes!

This place has a great beer list and cocktail menu but that's about it.  The staff here were RUDE and scared at the siight of 8 people at one table.  Everyone ordered a beer and one person ordered food (me) and apparently splitting up the bill for this was a huge task.  Also may I mention that the restaurant was quite empty so it's not like she was super busy and didn't have time to print some separate bills. 

Besides the rude waitress, the bartenders and other staff members were equally as rude, unfriendly and just had some ridiculous hipster attitude that no one ever likes to encounter when eating or dining out.

As for food, I ordered the wings, fries and buffalo cauliflower.  The cauliflower was actually very good, but the wings were disgusting! They were fatty and had no flavour, they tasted like they were microwaved.  The fries were generic and boring.

I will not be visiting this place again.
