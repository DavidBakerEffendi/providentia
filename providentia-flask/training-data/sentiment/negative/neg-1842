I wanted so badly to like this place, I really did. But the food is just a sloppy mess.

The owner was really nice and I enjoyed that it was a simplistic no-frills kind of place. Those places are where some of the best Greek food I've had come from. However...I came in with high hopes that I could fulfill my Greek/Mediterranean food craving, but they don't even sell chicken gyros...I mean if you're close to a university, you have to understand that not all people eat lamb. Maybe it was the upbeat middle-eastern music that made me expect greatness like what I've had in Greektown in Detroit, but no.

I got the chicken shishkabob and I don't mind a little black, but it was like eating pure charcoal that was overdone. I got four tiny pieces of chicken, I mean TINY, the rest was filled with mounds and mounds of lettuce and a couple random pieces of pepper. It was sloppy trying to eat as the sauce was really runny. It was just nasty. My fiancee got the lamb gyro and it was messy and mediocre. 

If you like it, keep buying it because the owner seems really nice. But if you just want some really good food, no bs, I wouldn't try this place out if you're really hungry.
