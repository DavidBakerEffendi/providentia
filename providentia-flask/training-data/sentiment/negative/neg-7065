Made a reservation for 8:00 on a Saturday for 10 for my wife's birthday.  It was busy when we arrived but nothing out of the ordinary for Saturday night.  We waited for almost an hour to be seated while the staff kept saying the group before us was here for almost 2 1/2 hours and that's why we weren't being seated.  The entire time we stood at the front door we watched the back room where there were two sections of tables with seating for 10-12 each which were fully set and nobody was at the tables.  We asked several times if we could be seated there and were told yes those were our seats but they couldn't find anyone to seat us.......um why can't one of you who keeps saying we can't find anyone to seat you?  When we were finally seated the gentlemen walked us half way to the back and then pointed and said those seats on the left our for you.  Thanks for making us wait 45 minutes for that.

Our drink orders took almost another 45 minutes to arrive and when they started one person at the table received their drink twice and the rest of us were still waiting.  The table next to us who sat down after us was so fed up they started walking up to the bar and were able to get their drinks before our table was served!  

When the food finally arrived around 10:30 it was horrible and outside of the steak and meatloaf ordered everyone at the table was disappointed.  Needless to say my wife was unhappy we chose this place for her birthday and would never want to return.
