Ordered medium spiced yellow curry, it was so spiced the sauce was turning red from the amount of red chilis. Lips have been on fire for a while. The drunken noodles were even worse. I love thai food often ordering spicy items but this was extreme.
I contacted the restaurant and they offered to take $2 off the $30 cost of the meal but would not consider replacing it. 
This is unfortunate because we've had fried rice, drunken noodle and masaman here before and  never had anything prepped as medium come out this spicy.
The cucumber salad was good.
