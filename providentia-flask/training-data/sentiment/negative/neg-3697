Beware of FRAUD at Chica! After coming back from Vegas I checked my credit card statement and discovered that I was charged $109 instead of $101. The only way to charge $109 to my credit card was to "correct" the tip. Since it's impossible to have $13 mistaken for $21, it was obvious that this was done intentionally. Despite of that, instead of reporting the matter to the bank, at first I called the restaurant. The lady who answered the phone told me that she would pass info to a manager, but didn't allow me to speak to a manager directly - she told me that a manager would call me if he needed more information. I waited for a couple of days, but neither I received a call, nor a credit, so I had to report this to the bank, which solved all this in a matter of seconds.
