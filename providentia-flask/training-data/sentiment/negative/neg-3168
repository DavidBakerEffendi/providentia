I always see coupons for this place and today I found it and gave it a try. My first impression walking in was "eh" could be better, could be worse. The service, however- Couldn't get any worse. I've had days when I wanted to be anywhere but work, but this chick behind the counter was so angry/annoyed to be there it was coming off her in waves!

 I ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was BLECH!!! Nothing good about that thing. I also ordered a mini steak quesadilla. She made me a full sized instead. This turned out to be a good thing since the burrito was awful. The quesadilla was pretty darn good! Needless to say I wont come near this place ever again.
