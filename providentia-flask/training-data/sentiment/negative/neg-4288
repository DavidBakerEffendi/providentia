I would not recommend this restaurant. The veggie wrap was slimy, wet, and soft of the outside making it difficult to grab with my hands. The contents inside were mushy and not appetizing. 

The line was very loud and the staff were carrying their own conversations making it difficult to understand the ordering process. 

This place needs some help.
