I really don't think management knows how to own a Poke place. The lady who was managing the team seemed rude to her coworkers when I went. 

Also, the portion of meat is so sad! I've had the poke bowl and sushi burrito from Kung Fu Tea and they give a generous amount of fish! It's so good there. However, when I tried out Poke Lab I was unimpressed. It's so confusing even just going down the line. Management needs to get it together because right now, it's not that great. Good customer service, bad planning.

As for the bowl itself, the taste is very americanized in my opinion. The sauces are not that great. Also, some topping options are weird and unfitting in my opinion. I want to like this place, but I think it could be better. 

Also, there's no fountain water, just bottled water. So if you're eco friendly ... then remember to bring your own water!
