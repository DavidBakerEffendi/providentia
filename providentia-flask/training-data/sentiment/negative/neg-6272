I was so hungry when I came in. The service was very slow considering I was the only customer. Every time I said thank you to the waitress she just walked away. I finally got the hint and avoid saying anything at once. I basically felt like I was bothering her. I order 3.1-pho combo. The broth is usually my favorite part of pho but this broth is different. It was greasy, clear broth and had no flavor to it. It tasted like straight chicken broth (the low sodium kind..lol). Even though I was famished but I only take 5 sips of the broth and tried to tolerate the rest. I gave up because it was just terrible.
