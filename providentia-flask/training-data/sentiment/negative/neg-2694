Well, something is wrong today. I have eaten at Wahoo's many, many times, both at Las Vegas & California locations. I always get the same thing. They screwed up too many things today. Enough that I am moved to write a bad review. 
- weird person taking orders, acted bored to death, like I was bothering her.
- wasn't given, or even offered my receipt
- got my fish order wrong
- when given my fish back "corrected," it was not made to order, simply sprinkled the spice on. I have had this spicy fish many times, it is prepared blackened & saturated in spice. They didn't redo it.
- salad had no tortilla strips
I would like to tell management but there is no one walking the floor. When it is quiet & mid afternoon, that's when a presence by management should be made
