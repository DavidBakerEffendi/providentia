From the start, you call in for a 7:30pm reservation and no one acknowledges you until 7:45, and you don't get seated until 8pm.  

Then they tell you the $50 groupon only covers half of the meats and you must pay another $20 to get the filet mignon and other meats seems deceptive.  But we go ahead and pay for it.

Then you get to the buffet bar (if you could even call it that), and they have no rice, no mashed potatoes, and by the time the meats actually get to you, you've already finished your buffet plate.  

There were several meats that were so overcooked I had to spit it out.  It's bad when your 7-year old says the top sirloin is too chewy.  Oh and getting charged $21 when my 7-year old eats one plate and says his stomach hurts after eating from the buffet.

To top everything off, the owner comes by saying he wants to please one table of obviously drinking customers and do we mind if they put on music BUT starts doing horrible karaoke, I'm done.  

You would do better to pay the same money at the end at Texas De Brazil or even the Brazillian place in Planet Hollywood.  If I could leave a penny for tip, I would have (Groupon says you have to leave 18% top).  Groupon needs to really go to these establishments before representing that was a deal
