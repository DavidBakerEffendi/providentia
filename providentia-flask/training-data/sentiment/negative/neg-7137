yikes. ordered from front site gun training facility. the girl messed up the order- sent me round looking for 15 minutes for me and my sons lunch and it was labled wrong. now dealing in such volume i understand the mess up. how ever it wasnt the mess up it was mariahs attitude was just awful. food was decent when it was correct service isnt there.
waited a week to call talk to mngr/owner robyn. called got a kid named rocky. she said owner mngr isnt there and hung up on me with out even asking what i was calling for. called back spoke to robyn who quickly offered excuses about them being young and a free lunch. i dont want a fee lunch. just be be treated like a human being. nice lady. but they shouldnt hire snotty assed kids. i will say two of the trailer girls were nice. very nice. cant handle the heat the the f out of the kitchen.
service is everything. they wont be seeing my money ever again. i wont be taking up robyn on the free lunch either.
