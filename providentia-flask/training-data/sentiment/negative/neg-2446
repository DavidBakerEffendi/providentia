First of all the owner needs to take a chill pill and let the customer decide on what they want to eat, instead of rushing them with try this , try this, try that...

Ordered  a Large Pizza thinking it might have some desi touch to it...

But it was the WORST EVER PIZZA i have ever had.  I think even a freshie would make a better Pizza than these guys...

The Pizza dough was all soggy and very thin, not properly baked....
It tasted like a thin under-cooked bread overloaded with cheese making it to chew a lot....

The above rating is only for the Pizza at this place.... The owner claims to serve one of the best Nihari and Biryani. Will give it a shot in the future and update the reviews if any better...
