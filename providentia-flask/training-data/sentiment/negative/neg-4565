We decided that we wanted sushi on 8/13/2018 and found this place down the street from where we lived and decided to give it a try..... 

We arrived maybe an hour and 15 min before they close soon as we enter we were greeted but ALSO told they close at 10 and last call for food is at 9:30 ... which I thought was rude your cutting off at 9:30 but you close at 10 seems rude don't have a time and cutt of 30 min earlier not good for business 

We stayed anyways .... I got the super white tuna sashimi and a 6 piece chef choice sashimi order.... which came out super quick

I don't exactly know what my date ordered 

My food was yummy..... but I was definitely very sick later in the night sooooooo that was not very fun
