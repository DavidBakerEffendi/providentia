Yuck! Can you say, you say yuck? We went in to try a chocolate chip cookie my buddy said was the best he ever had. They were sold out. But 3 of us each ordered a pizza. The crust was PAPER THIN. They were out of mushrooms. The taste was that of I'd rather eat the box feeling. The staff was should I say........ lacking. Very slow, I felt as if I was getting my oil changed not ordering a pizza. The tables were dirty and the place was empty. SO much wrong I don't know what else to say. Yes I do, NEVER AGAIN. Blaze is SO MUCH better.
