This store is disgusting!  I just left this store my friend ordered a tuna sandwich the Asian guy asked him 4 times if he wanted cheese?  Not sure if there was a language barrier.  But the same knife he cut The bread with he then mashed the tuna into the bread with it.  When he was done he cut his sandwich all with same knife.   He went to make my sandwich which was not a tuna sandwich and was about to cut the bread with that same  dirty knife.  I asked him if he could use a clean knife I was not having tuna and didn't want my food been cross contaminated and potentially get food poising.  He gave me a big attitude walked in the back and literally left me standing there for several minutes then he came out of the back with the same knife wiping it off with the a subway napkin?  I told him will just take the one sandwich he already made paid and left.  I went down the block to port of subs and got my lunch there.  I will never go back to this store.  Service has always been terrible now it's just disgusting and dangerous to your health.  No thanks!
