Customer service, horrible. My biggest factor and they bombed. No welcome and I had to practically beg them for attention. I felt like an inconvenience to spend my money there. The 3.99 turned into 5.73, lots of tax but whatev. I waited for the pizza to finish this. NOT impressed. The box was huge for the size of the pizza, it was a comical we got screwed feeling. Taste: I would agree with the little ceasers comment. Prettt darn close, the pizza and crust was not homeade as you would expect for a mom and pop. One slice had NO SAUCE on half of it. The little sauce that was on the pizza was actually good and similar to "Crust" in north scottsdale but there was so little on the entire pie,im probably reaching for something good to say about it. Peperoni was spicy and good, cheese quality was average nothing special. Over all. Ill go to little ceasers and petet piper and be happier. Good drunk food though I imagine. aparently their most impressive dish is a colossal burger that has pastrami on it. Not sure if I would go back to try it. So far 1 star
