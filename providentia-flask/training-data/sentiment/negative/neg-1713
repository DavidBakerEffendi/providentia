So.. Being a BBQ Chef and all around BBQ snob, I thought I would check this place out.  I can at least say I've tried it.  

Pulled pork: tasted like they just thawed it out after running to the grocery store and buying pre made.

Brisket: smoke ring?? Nothing.  Very dry.

Ribs: now the ribs I can get behind.  Very juicy and tender.  They didn't fall off the bone when you looked at them but they also didn't have to be tugged on by your teeth.  

Take it or leave it, but this is just my opinion.
