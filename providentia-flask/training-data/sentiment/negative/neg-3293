Pasquales is an overpriced pseudo-Italian eatery that caters to an unsuspecting crowd that bought in to the "Let Me Spoil You!" billboard a few miles back.

The food was mediocre. Underdone penne pasta in a tomato sauce that managed to be both sour and bland at the same time. The waitress was okay, but looked worn out and barely cracked a smile the entire time.

We ran in to Pasquale himself on our way out the door, sitting at a table surrounded by newspapers. We tried to say hello, but dude refused to give us anything but a sneer and his backside. Which makes me think that the smile on his billboard has to have been photoshopped. Pasquale is incapable.
