I spent over $30 for two half sandwiches, two half salads and a cup of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was good and the salads were okay but the sandwiches were sub par. Airport prices are always high but it still seemed excessive. It also didn't help that both sandwich orders were messed up. They forgot the bacon and avocado, which were 2 of the 3 main components, of my girlfriend's sandwich.
