The food's great (the enchiladas are, the cubano sandwich, meh) but the service sucks. They give you a hard time to use coupons or deals you get online even if it's something they offer on yelp or restaurant.com so I have one more certificate from them and I'm going to exchange it for another restaurant because although I absolutely LOVED their enchiladas they were so rude I'm not even going to bother going back and trying to use that certificate.
