This place was the ABSOLUTE PITS!!!
I've been to Great China many times in the past, but my last few visits definitely left a NOT SO G-R-E-A-T taste in my mouth. 
In particularly my visit to them last night, 06/23/2009. 
The place was closing in an hour, and being a buffet I assumed that had NO BEARING on the quality of food or the customer service value. 
When we got there, there was NO food left in the trays, NO sushi and the beef and broccoli was nothing more than a garden of broccoli. 
When I asked for more food to be placed out, it was like pulling teeth as I waited for them for at least 15 more minutes to put out some more food. When i got the food, there seemed to be a gelatinous goo (beef sauce?) covering the beef and broccoli! 
When I finally said something to the lady at the register, she replied, "Well, did you eat the food or not? If you ate it, you pay, and if you don't like the food DON'T COME BACK!" 
You can BET ON IT LADY!!! 
I will NOT be back EVER, and I will NEVER recommend "NOT-SO-Great China" to anyone!
