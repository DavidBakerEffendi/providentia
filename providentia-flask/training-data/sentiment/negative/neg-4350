Was looking forward to the ribs but when they came they were so tough and undercooked we couldn't even cut them off the bone with a knife. Pink inside too. The waitress was very nice about it and didn't charge us. Ended up leaving and going to another place for ribs.... Moosehead's in Olmstead Falls is the best for ribs!!!
