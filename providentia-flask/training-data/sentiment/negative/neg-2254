Came here with a group of friends last time. It is usually good so I'm not sure what happened. We came on a weekend during yum cha hours where they push carts and should have everything ready. Their siu mai is pork and shrimp and it was raw. We sent it back and they gave us another one... which was also raw. We went it back AGAIN, and it came back AGAIN RAW. You can't serve raw pork to ur customers. Luckily my friend checked it because I'm sure most people don't and just eat it and get food poisoning later. The jelly fish we ordered , they Gave us the end of jelly fish which was hard and not edible. We complained and asked them for a new dish but they refused to give us a new jelly fish order. I would give it 2 stars because all my other experiences were great except this one but honestly, giving it one star only because the siu mai came back raw 3 times and that's just unacceptable.
