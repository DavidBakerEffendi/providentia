The sushi here is great. That said we will not be back. When we arrived we were one of 3 tables. Our order took over an hour to finally be delivered to our table. This would be frustrating wth a table of adults but was nearly unbearable as we were with our young children. They are pretty good in restaurants but you can't ask any kid to wait that long. There was one guy making our sushi and despite the fact that we were waiting and my husband and I were taking turns with the kids outside so that they wouldn't bother everyone in the restaurant, he vanished from the bar for about 20 minutes... (and I was timing at his point, I was so angry). When I gave a poor tip for this, the waitress had the audacity to ask for a larger tip, which probably also means the staff are vastly underpaid.
If you're childless and have the whole evening ahead of you, enjoy. It's the best sushi in the 'hood by far. If you have children, or somewhere to be, go somewhere else.
One final note: portions are very small and pricey. We ordered what would have easily been enough at our usual restaurant but left discussing whether or not we should grab a chicken on the way home. Spent about $70 (no drinks) and we were all still hungry.
