I was really looking forward to eating here based on all the reviews. But my husband and I were really disapointed. The food was just okay. The oft raved about dumplings were so greasy we could hardly eat them. We tried a wide variety of food, but nothing really wowed us. 
  I forgot to add that while we were sitting there a cockroach ran across the floor. O.o
