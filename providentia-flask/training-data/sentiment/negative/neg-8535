Because we have a kid, we frequent Denny's and are known by name at our local one so we thought we'd get a quick meal while staying in Downtown Vegas. We were greeted by a friendly host and sat immediately.  15 minutes later, we had not been greeted.  My husband checked in with the friendly host who apologized, took our orders and brought us drinks. 10 minutes later a server walks up to retake our order because the host "didn't ask the right questions".  Um...right...we gave him the same order we gave the host (we're Denny's pros...we KNOW how to order).  The kid apologized profusely, several times, but I negotiated our stay with a free milkshake because at this point, I was about to walk out.  When we finally got our food we were like, "um...where are the fries?" I mean, there were like six there, but again...Denny's pros here, we know what to expect... He tried by bringing out more fries but at that point, we were a little put out.  An hour later, we were finally out the door.  We thanked the host and found out that he GOT IN TROUBLE for taking our order and trying to make things right.  He was the only one who understood "service".  

I get that this is "just" Denny's, but this wasn't even the minimum.

Note: This was New Year's Day, I can only imagine the hangover these kids had.
