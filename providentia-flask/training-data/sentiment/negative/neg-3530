I know what a fresh pattie tastes like. I ordered a cheese burger and I got a burger with old meat that had been sitting out all day somewhere kept warm. My burger was cold and tasted nasty. I went back the counter to ask for a fresh burger. They said they would make another one "fresh off the grill". Instead I got an old pattie that was thrown in the grill to make it hot. How do I know? Because I was watching and by the time I came back to my seat right by the counter, my burger was already out. 

So disappointed. And I really like Lenny's. Not this location anymore. For sure, I am sorry for cheating on in-n- out. This place ALWAYS makes your order WHEN YOU order it. Not sitting in a container keeping it warm.
