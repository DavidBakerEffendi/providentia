Apparently they got new menus? Well they suck. My boyfriend and I both ordered chicken sandwiches, mine had buffalo sauce on it I wanted to add blue cheese for a dollar, it came out with a side of blue cheese dressing. Uhhh ok, ill just dip. Chicken sandwich tasted like they sprayed that shit with windex the fries were colder than ice. We both thought it was odd the sandwiches came out so fast. It was like they were hanging out under a lamp. Gross! For the price you pay here for food I was extremely annoyed. Go here for a few laughs, couple drinks but don't waste your money eating here.
