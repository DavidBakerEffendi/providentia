We made our second attempt at this restaurant in three years this week.  I was quickly reminded why we stayed away for so long, especially given that we like to support local businesses.

Basically, the food is mediocre at best.  The waitress we had last time needs some lessons (such as, learn about the beers, especially the specialty Cajun ones, don't go to the table every minute asking patrons if they are ready to order if they are still looking at the menu, ask if they want another beer if their beer is empty, refill water glasses), the cook needs to not smoke and walk through the restaurant.  The items that we had we not good.  I can see how it could be a cute little neighborhood bar, and I would probably hang out at the bar to watch sports and drink the very delicious Abita, but I will not return for the food.  

From now on, my Cajun fix will be taken care of by my own two hands or a drive out to Baby Kays.  It's a bummer.
