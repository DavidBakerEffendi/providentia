Seating not a problem. We sat outside under the awning where flies bite you occasionally, but we got over that. Service was fast, but server should bring more items at once rather than make so many trips. No
Music...though speakers are hung. Lots of jet skis and sailboats going by. Salad just ok. Cole slaw fresh and good. Fried dough ok but just "junky."  Lobster mac n cheese just ok and no salad included(?). Lacked flavor. Seafood sampler just ok. With panko you can't taste the fish. Prefer beer batter. Pricing seems high for level of satisfaction. We figure there are better places. In fact we know it. Guess we're done here.
