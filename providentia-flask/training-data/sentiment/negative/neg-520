Went here tonight because we had a gift card. The bartender was great. Prompt service, cold drinks, very friendly & chatty. If I went back it'd be to chat her up. No seats were available at the bar though. 
Service at our booth was poor. Fries cold, undercooked. How do you screw up fries?! My salad, which I had before, wasn't good this time. I actually ended up having an allergic reaction from these "sweety drop peppers." I had this salad back in the spring and remembered it being good. Not this time. Disappointing experience. We agreed we'd rather spend the extra money and go to the keg.
