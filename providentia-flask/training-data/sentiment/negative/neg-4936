Ok, I don't know where Tosca F. ate when she wrote that review, but it could not possibly have been this place. I actually trusted that review, and went here with my mom and my sister while I was in town. All three of us are TRUE foodies, and we had a very different opinion.

Bleck, the food was so bad, we didn't even tell the server because it was so inherently flawed that we didn't see the point. Chicken was so salty that it tasted like canned tuna, and seafood that should have been tossed out a few days ago. All three of our meals where underwhelming, at best, disgustingly over-salted or spoiled at worst. 

The menu is all over the place with Italian, Asian and American "influences". I don't think that a place has to pick a focus to be a good restaurant, but at least a theme would help. I feel like they are trying to do a lot of things and the food turns out at a mediocre level. 

The only positive point was that the server was truly friendly; I will give them that. 

I feel bad because this is a part of town and a city that needs good restaurants, but I couldn't keep quiet. Don't waste your money here.
