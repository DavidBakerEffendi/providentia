This review is based on food and drinks. Horrible service, mediocre product. If you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you. 

I'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club. As for the food and drinks so many better places worth exploring. I'm going to put this in the same category as Tao it will be fun to party at (anticipating) but better eating elsewhere.
