When my friend and I got there around lunch time, there was a group of guys have been waiting for a while. We waited for the lady who is a cashier/chef. She didn't seem happy and was very rude to customers. We understand that she was all by herself, at least she could be nice about it and apologize to people about the an hour wait. She kept taking more orders as people walked in and telling them it's half hour wait, but just couldn't keep up with it. Very few people in there, we all have to wait for an hour to get take out. A customer was kind of pissed off. During lunch time, this is not acceptable. 

The place is very sketchy. As for food, it's ok. Not worth it waiting for. There are better Roti places. We will not go back for sure.
