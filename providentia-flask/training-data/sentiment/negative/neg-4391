The boy working there, not friendly and he was more interested in his friend who came to visit him. The bathroom lock was broken, no paper towels, and a burnt out light bulb. Okay, so what. Me and my nanny babe were there to get some frozen yogurt. Well, Serious lack of topping and some of which seemed just old. 3.5 year old was satisfied with the banana froyo and some sprinkles however. Which is all that mattered At the time. We'll be finding somewhere different to go next time.
