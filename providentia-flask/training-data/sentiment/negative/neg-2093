I got food poisoning - twice! Yes I said twice!  The 2nd time they where super cheap with portions too and filled in the box with white rice on the bottom to make it look full!  
     The first time I had food from here I was actually impressed. The food was tasty and still relatively warm after the 45 min wait. But then I got the S**!. I didnt put my finger on Yummy Yummy right away  but thought it was suspect. 
     About 6 days later I wanted to give it another shot. This is when they gypt me out of the food as stated above. However, the same night and next day - I got the sh^*! Again! My guts hurt as I am writing this since I am on day two of not holding down food. F*!# This Place!
