Don't do it. Just don't do it. I went with some co-workers for lunch. We waited over half an hour just for our food to come out, and the place wasn't even busy. Our server had a horrible attitude the whole time since and when we asked why it was taking so long for the food, she replied "we aren't McDonalds" and slammed our checks on the table. My chicken patty came out like a brick. It hurt my teeth to bite into. I got sick from it as well. It was my first and my last visit to this establishment. Just don't do it.
