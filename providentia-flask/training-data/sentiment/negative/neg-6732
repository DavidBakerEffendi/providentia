Panda Express food is AWESOME as it ever had been since I tried back in California, When I saw that they were now here in Cleveland, I jumped with Joy!! All was great! Except the employees, they are rude, they made fun of a gentleman just because he wanted more soy sauce in his plate, the girl went to her manager mocking that they did not have gravy at that location! Talk about culture shock for this girl!! Even though I really like Panda Express, I will not return to this location cause of the rude employees! Learn to appreciate your customers and  their culture!
