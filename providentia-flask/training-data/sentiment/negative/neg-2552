This is the worst McDonald's, and restaurant I have ever visited.  And after speaking to two managers to try to solve the issue, it was like they didn't even care.  

This is a busy location right on the highway.  I received my drive thru order and proceeded to the highway and shortly after noticed several items were missing.  

I called the store and they told me I had to come back to the store for a refund.  I was already gone down the highway.

I will remove this review if the owner of the restaurant contacts me and sends me a cheque for $2.69.
