I was led to believe I had a reservation for a corporate seminar event booked in their private room.  I called and they told me they had me down.  Then I went in the first time and they assured me it was reserved, we would do a contract as we got closer.  I found this odd, but we had booked the same event the year before and there had been no problem.  Yesterday, I called with some planning questions.  They told me they weren't holding the room and if I wanted it, I had better get in and do a contract ASAP.  So today, in went in to do a contract.  The GM, Tom Blake informed me that they had a weekly group that used the room every week on that day and I needed to find another place.  I am very frustrated as I had already sent invitations with their location on it.  But, I understand people make mistakes sometimes.  The reason it is one star, is because Tom was an unbelievable jerk.  He could not care less or deliver any sort of an apology on the matter.  This man has a nasty attitude problem and lacks the basic people skills that should be required of his job.   I have already rebooked my event at another similar restaurant close by.  But I will not soon forget my horrible experience with this GM and I will never dine at Hickory Tavern again.
