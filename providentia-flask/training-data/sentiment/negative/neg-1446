Disgusting!  I had the chilli cheese fries and Buckeye Dog for lunch and spent the rest of the day wanting to vomit.  They covered the dog with a garlic mayo that smelled and tasted like  a nail salon.  The bun was dry and broke apart, the dog nothing special.  The pork belly was barely warm and under cooked.... overall I will never go again.  Hint: go to Costco, buy a couple dogs from the food counter, take them home and add your toppings to your liking. Cheaper and far far better!
