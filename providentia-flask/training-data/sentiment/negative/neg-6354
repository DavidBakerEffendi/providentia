terrible service. terrible food. salty, salty, salty! we ordered sisig nachos..n 20 min later the waitress comes back and says 'we do have nachos, but no cheese!'  wow...it took 20 min to tell us that.  we had to settle for sisig fries.  when the fries came 10 min later ....it had cheese on it!?!?  how the fries had cheeese, but the nachos didnt have cheese is a mystery to me.  first bite of the fries, all u can taste is salt... and more salt.  the rest of the food came another 20 min later n was all loaded with fat on the meet. i had tapsilog and 50 percent of the meat was fat.   
service was so so so sloooow.  please note we went in on a sunday at noon.  we were the only table there n yet it took forever to get food.  to add to the slow service we had to deal with the band doing microphone check for the ENTIRE time. 1) u would think u would do that prior to opening so customers dont have to hear 'mic check ...hello hello mic check 1 ..2...1...2..'   2) u gotta love how professional they were while doing mic check...  'mic check 1 ...2..tuyo...tuyo hehehe joke lang...joke lang'  real cute to hear then crack stupid mic check jokes the entire time. 
on the way out (just less than 2 hrs)...they were STILL doing mic check and we did not even get a thank u from waitress or the manager as we walked right by them.. they were too busy and too good for us as they  stood and listen to 'mic check tuyo tuyo...1 ...2  tuyo"  horrible!
