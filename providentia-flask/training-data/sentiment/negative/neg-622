Dirty, sticky, and messy on the inside. I've been in fraternity houses on a Friday night with a cleaner floor. The water tasted like I stuck a straw up a frog's asshole. Service was very very veeerrrrrrrryyyyy sloooooow. The server handed us our forks by the fork end, not the handle. The chop stick holder was all sticky and looks like it had never been cleaned (see pics). 

I wish I could review the food but sadly I'm still waiting for it. 

Worst. Place. Ever.
