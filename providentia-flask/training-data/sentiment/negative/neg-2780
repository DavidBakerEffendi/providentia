This place is now horrible since the renovations. The food was barely edible. I have never had such poorly prepared sushi rice. It tasted like Uncle Ben's with too much water. Utterly un-sushi-rice-like. And the staff kicjed us out after 1 hour because there was someone else wating, even though we had a reservation, and there were only 2 people in total waiting. I have never been kicked out of a place before.
