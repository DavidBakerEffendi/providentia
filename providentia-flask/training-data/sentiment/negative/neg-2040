The food is always delicious. But this trip was horrible and now we will never return. First of all it took 3 trips from the server to put our drink order in bc he would walk away as soon as we said one drink. Then after waiting 45 mins for our tacos, my wife left to go back to work. Then our food came and I asked for a manager. When I told the manage (Adam)what was going on he took our food off the table including taking the food out of my 6 yrs old and 4 yrs olds hands and telling me on Friday lunches it takes 40+ mins to get your food. FOR TACOS!!!!! Then handed me a bill for $12 for 4 drinks. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Will not return
