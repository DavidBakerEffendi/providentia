Low quality greasy spoon, compensating by overpricing.

The service - better than you would expect for a place that warns you when you enter that they feel the pointless need to be crude.  The servers and bar tenders are just a bunch of failed wannabe actors and comedians that say "shit" a lot and put a paper had on you with an insult that will get plenty of chuckles from drunk frat brothers or wedding guests stumbling by in the Casino section of the Excalibur.

The food - no better than the much cheaper fare served in the food court of any of the Strip resorts.

The drinks - Badly overpriced.  For a 20oz Coors Light in a POS plastic keepsake pilsner glass, I paid $15.

Save your money and bypass this crude attempt at entertainment.
