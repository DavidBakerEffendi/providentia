Yep!  I am one of those "yelpers" when someone pisses me off! See the date on this review? This place is a joke. I had a flyer that said FREE DELIVERY when spending $30 or more- so I call and order my food and mentioned the flyer, I was put on hold and was told my total was $31 and some change and that it was an hour and 20 min wait, I said i would come instead and the girl said $28.08 was the total (so they ended up charging the $3 delivery charge anyways) whatever, right?? So I go up there and the dummy said total was $31 whatever and I was like are you kidding me, one of you guys said $28 freaking dollars- the girl started saying some bullshit about the printout of the receipt not having a delivery fee, once they brought my food out and I knew it was safe I told the re-re off and explained you can't tell a customer over the phone that it's 28 dollars and try to go back to the 31 for delivery. She must have been really slow or delayed cause she kept talking about the receipt so once I got louder they honored the $28.08. I could say so much more about this place since I know some people that work/ have worked here, but I won't besides the girl with braces is a dumb bitch lol
