They got my husband's order wrong but made up for it, giving him what he actually ordered and letting him keep what they gave him.

I found the food to be underwhelming and overpriced. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to the Olive Garden, but that's what it reminded me of - just more expensive and no salad (boo!) - also not as good. Pretty bland. 

I guess if you're a suburbanite who wants a "fancy night out", and you don't like complex flavor, go for it! 

The atmosphere is really nice. Underwhelmed by the staff and service. The server we had was training someone that night - awkward. 

Overall, would I go back? Probably not, especially given all of the other options in the area. 

Try out some other options in the area!
