What a horrible experience. I had not been here in several years after my last dissapointing experience . Tonight was worse. They sat a party of 8 in the direct path of bright sunlight .One of my co- workers ordered s salad which came after  his meal and after he asked. I specifically asked for no vegetables and then they brought my baked potato covered in green onions. No mention was made of anyone wanting a 2nd cocktail, bread was brought after most of us had eaten. 7 + minutes between the first person getting food and the last . At the end of the meal the server dropped the check, we had to ask for a dessert menu. 

I cannot imagine ever returning .
