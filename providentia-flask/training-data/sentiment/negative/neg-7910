Went here for lunch with my partner. and were told booths are only for 4 or more guests. The restaurant was empty besides a few people, one was a couple sitting in a booth... There were 8+ booths available at the time. We were seated at the bar which was uncomfortable so we walked out. Lost a sale and further business for the dumbest reason.
