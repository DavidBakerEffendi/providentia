Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, "Why do I come here???" The staff often has the  "GTFOH" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed "that guy."  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit...
