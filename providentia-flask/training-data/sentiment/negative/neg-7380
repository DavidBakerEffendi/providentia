So this place sucks and lacks proper training on dealing with customers. I order a burrito and empanadas. I pull up to the window and the lady tells me my total I hand her my card she swipes and charges me. Then asks me to pull forward and wait because they needed to cook another empanada.. I ask her how long she had told me 6 minutes.... I tell her just refund me the money for that one empanada. Another employee tells me I'll just give you a dollar back. I told her that 1 dollar is the cost of it but that's not the total after taxes. She gave me the biggest eye roll with attitude and said here it's 1.08. I understand this is Taco Bell and that it's not gourmet but what ever happened to quality customer service? You lost business here from me for good. Oh and another thing I noticed...Why is it that the machines are always broken when it comes to happy hour for the breezes? Then after happy hour is over it seems to be working again? Hmmmm....,
