Save ayour Money go somewhere else :)

First, I want to start with the fact that the food was not good. The food did not taste good and it was overly priced.  The service was horrible.  The cashier tried to charge me for extra guacamole when I thought it came with my shrimp nachos.  They gave me this little small guacamole cup and charged me 2.50 insane.  I will pay that if I wen to a fancy restaurant but not this restaurant.

I went to this restaurant because of the good reviews it had. But let me tell you this people have not tasted real good mexican food.  I will never go back or recommend it to anyone.
