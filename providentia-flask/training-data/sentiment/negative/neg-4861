Bought a groupon for a mani & pedi and struggled to get an appointment because of limited availability on my end and inconsistent answering the phone on theirs. I assume fellow groupon holders and clients (if they have any) were overwhelming their schedules so had to book in a month in advance. I went to my appointment and the place is nice aesthetically speaking. Staff are personable and even though I was 15 minutes late (damn navigation) they were quite accommodating and took me back. Here is where an early Halloween came into play. 
1. They have colors bought from drugstores and Sally's it seems not an opi on sight, no premium salon quality polishes one expects. 2. My nails were filed with the roughest nail file and had sharp edges which I had to ask her to correct. 
3. The color I chose was too thick and my technical immediately added acetone to the color to 'thin' it. So I had terribly uneven polished toes. I could and did a better job.
4. I chose another polish for my hands and the color was new but due to an untrained tech my color has lines and is uneven. I attempted a correction but the correction still looked like a high schoolers polish job. 
I won't be back for my nails. Not even if it was free until they get some trained professionals in there. The nail room chairs need to be wiped and the polishes need an update and a few nail polish representatives. They seem to do great hair. The place is nice. The technicians are very pleasant. But do ur nails at home or at your regular salon for a good job. Save your money y'all (Paula Deen voice) it ain't worth your money right now!
