As a regular customer at the Texas Roadhouse establishments, I was not pleased with the service that I received this evening. We happily came to celebrate my sisters 18th birthday, but our night was ruined by a balding, 25 year old male, who looked like Francis from Pee-wee's Big Adventure (not an exaggeration). He threw napkins and straws at us if it was hay and we were a herd of cattle being fed for the day and when we kindly complained to the service manager, she said, "I'll do the best I can to fix his mistakes, and will give y'all a different waiter". When we told "Francis" (real name Chop, I know right?) he was not our waiter anymore, he shouted out in glee, "yay! that is AWESOME!!!!". We were sat at a booth that did not fit my party, so a chair was added to the end of the table. This gave an opportunity for the vulgar waiter and his friends to rudely bump into my aunt, and slightly spill water on her. This made us to take it up to James, the general manager, and he told us, "do you want to stay here, or want me to throw you out. I have the best servers in the world, and if I saw anyone of them do that, they would be FIRED on the spot". We told him we'll just enjoy the bread and cinnamon butter, with his red, flustered, sweaty face that gave the look of disgust and walked away. If my sister was not craving a 20 oz prime rib (which they did not have) we would have left, but we stayed because she also wanted a steak. Jordan, a nice girl, who looks like she is going to gain a pharmacy degree and a 4.0 GPA was then assigned as our waitress. Not once did she hesitate with our request, if James would show leadership, I would have gave 5 stars just for Jordan! when it came time to say the famous "YEEEHAAAW" for birthday guest, Jordan was the ONLY one who came and announced the birthday. I have the snapchats to prove it. Jordan was the only server who met our needs and went above and beyond with everything she did. Jordan exudes success and she should be promoted.
