I used to love El Rodeo at this same location-- nice staff, good Mexican-ish food.  Now it's a Don Ramon's.  While the decor is mercifully toned down, the food is really mushy and bland.  Whether you order an enchilada or a burrito, it all tastes the same, slathered in the same orangey-pinkish sauce.  Not even good for suburban Mexicanesque food.
