I was very excited when this location opened. However- this is the worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever been to.  The customer service at this location is the absolutely awful.  They never get your order right and when they make a mistake they give you attitude.  How can you mess up a coffee with cream and sugar?!?!?!? I have had several bad experiences here and chalked it up to new people, bad days, etc. However, I can no except it any longer. I was there on 5/28/16 and Priscilla was so rude. After messing up my order twice and still giving me the wrong coffee. I look her straight in the face and presently said thank you. She looked at me sucked her teeth and pulled out her phone and started texting.  I will never go to this location again. I've made several complaints and nothing has been done. Furthermore- they charge the highest prices compared to the locations on South Blvd and Kings Drive.
