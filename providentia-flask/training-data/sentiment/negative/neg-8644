My husband and I stopped by for their Happy Hour, starting at 2 pm....  very over syrupy "house margarita" featured at 1/2 price....  with very little alcohol... only beers at happy hour prices were Mexican beers....chips with the nachos were so thick... fish tacos were good...  Everything served on plastic plates with a plastic fork... asked for a spoon and they 'didn't have any".....  very disappointed.
