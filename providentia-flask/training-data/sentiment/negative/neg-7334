The Venetian is a fun place but I have to say the high-pressure sales people that hit you up at every turn are so annoying I will not return.  Get me back to the Wynn or the Bellagio please.

I also made the mistake of using the restroom near the food court. This was worse than any rest area bathroom I've ever been in.
