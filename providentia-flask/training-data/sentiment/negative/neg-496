Worst burger I've ever had. One of the worst and disappointing dining experiences I've had in Toronto.

I had been to Cardinal Rule a couple times before, and it was pretty alright. Tonight we went to try their special for burger week on the eve of the last day. It was the 4th burger I had during the festivities, and by far the worst. It was really tiny, really dry and really charred. My girlfriend could only get through half of the burger, and regretted eating even that much, and both of us left with charred tastes in our mouths. When we were there, we also got two sides. The brussels sprout slaw and fries. The brussels sprouts slaw claimed they were shaved (they were not, they were roughly chopped), and claimed it was tossed in a honey mustard mayo, but it tasted more like pure mayonnaise, and it really needed some acid. I will say the fries were pretty good. Though I felt like I paid 25 dollars for a bowl of fries.

The server we had was quite nice, and she was doing the best she could, but they were extremely under staffed. I think I saw one guy in the kitchen, and one girl serving. We had to wait a while for everything the entire time. It's the closest I've ever been to dining and dashing.

It was such a disappointing burger, we ended up going to Rude Boy afterwards because we didn't want to end our burger week off on a sour note. The burger we had there was fabulous. It was like night and day. I don't think I could ever return to Cardinal Rule sadly. For their sake, and their customers I hope they improve.
