Had chicken ravioli appatizer, was horrible. I complained, they didn't care. I ordered soup and salad no onion. It was full of onion. The waitress acted like it came out of her personal check when I ordered a second bowl of "all you can eat" soup. When I ordered a third I thought i was going to have to get it myself! Soup was good though.
