I probably would have given this establishment another star but since I tried  communicating with them and it was in vain they now must get my not giving you a break review.   I have frequented this restaurant on many occasions when in the area.  I remember Jacks's from the day of Otto Mosher, Corkey and Lennies, as the Corn Beef regime.  They had your real Cornbeef and as you can see, it lasted in my over 60 
years of great memories.   However I was in the area about a month ago and decided to treat myself to a Jacks delight.  I was greeted by an affable young man who  commenced to making my sandwich.  However when I got home after a 30 plus minute drive I was excited to tear into my lunch.  I opened it up and find Corn beef crumbles instead of slices.  I did not know what to do with it.  I conferred with a caterer friend who informed me that it seemed as if the Cornbeef was over cooked and that created the crumbling.  I then wrote a very nice letter to the manager and told of my great memories with Jack's and how I often stopped there when I was in the area. I never heard an apology, I was not requesting free food, just an acknowledgement that that day I stopped somebody goofed up.  Well Jacks I might have given you another chance but since it appears customer services doesn't reign supreme I shall move on to make new Cornbeef memories elsewhere.
