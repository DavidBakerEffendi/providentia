My noodles where flavorless as there was no sauce on my food. I ordered shrimp with teriyaki noodles.  The shrimp was delicious and had great flavor. My son ordered the same thing except the kid version and his noodles were a completely different color because he had teriyaki sauce in his! I asked for some more sauce. I was told sure no problem. I sat for about 10-15 min while my noodles got cold. Still no sauce. The server I asked had run to the bathroom and was in there for about a good 15-20 min. Before he came out I asked someone else. Same thing they said, no problem I'll bring it to you. Still no sauce. So I ate my cold noodles and left.
