so big fan of buffalo wild wings. I've been to the tempe location many times and as a sports bar they have games on and play the sound from the games. This location, they were blasting club music. Even after we asked if they could play the sound from the game or atleast turn the music down they said the first week management wanted music way up. I think I still have headache from being there. At some point they will figure out what they need to be and thats a sports bar with good beer, wings, and sports. I am willing to amend my review if things change.
