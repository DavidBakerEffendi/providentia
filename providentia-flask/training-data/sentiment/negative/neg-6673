I came to pick up some pre-ordered food (3 items) at 11:20am. It was supposed to ready by then. I didn't mind the wait. But all of a sudden at 15 people came in and left with their order before me. Ok, now I'm getting annoyed. Someone else came at 12 noon, for their pre-ordered and got it! Wow I will never come back here again.
