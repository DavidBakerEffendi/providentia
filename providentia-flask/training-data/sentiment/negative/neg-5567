So normally I can walk in and be greeted in a timely manner by someone.  
Well today I walked in alone and waited over 15 minutes and no contact with a server, bartender, or even the male expo walking around. 
I have had my fair share of wonderful service at this place, maybe it was because I was alone and the server was did not care or the fact that she was the only server.  
Not typical of this location but I won't be traveling past 5 other eateries anymore to come to this one.
