When I show up well-dressed to meet my supplier inside, you do not give me attitude with fake BS excuses that it's bottle service only a quarter-after-midnight with the place half-empty. I party a lot in downtown Toronto about 2-3 times per week and haven't been treated this bad since Cheval six years ago. Get over yourself.
