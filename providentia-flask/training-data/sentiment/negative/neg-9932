Ordered to go two pho combos and one pho meatball. They said it would take 25-30 mins. By the time we got there it has already been 25 mins and we still had to wait an extra 15 mins before it was ready. When I got home one of the orders was wrong I got a beef stew instead of pho combo & my pho meat ball had hair in it. I won't be coming back.
