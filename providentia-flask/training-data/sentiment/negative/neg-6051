I would rate this buffet a zero stars. I used to visit here frequently and in its heyday, it was among the best buffets, however, it has gone downhill in quality. I went on a Saturday night, the buffet was nearly empty. The crab legs were either not fresh or had a bit of freezer burn. The same with the lobster, it was very hard, even when dipped in butter. The lobster is also miniature. I let the manager know about the crab legs after my visit and he really didn't seem to care, believe his name was Mike. I went to sister properties Paris and Ceasers for buffets same weekend and they were fantastic and the crab was great, unlike at Rio. Also, other hotels serve king crab, however, this place did not. I would strongly avoid dining here, it is a waste.
