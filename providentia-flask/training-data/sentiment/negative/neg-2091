BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.

The cakes in the store looked so pretty, and the girl at the counter packaged them so nicely in little cardboard boxes, I had such high hopes (it was $5 for a small slice of coconut cake so I thought it HAD to be delicious). I sat down to take my first bite and it was like a desert in my mouth - DRY TO THE BONE. Disappointed, I decided to keep eating, hoping that maybe only that one section was dry, but no, the whole slice was dry! Not even eating the parts with frosting helped to add any moisture.

I had bought two slices of the ooey gooey cake for my coworkers as a treat for them, but now I feel embarrassed to give it to them in case it sucks as badly as the coconut cake did!

I don't understand how a bakery can operate like this!
