So freaked out right now. We asked for a lime with the corona and after working the register, he grabbed the limes with his dirty fingers. After the chef heard that we put a happy hour order in, he screamed 'no more happy hour' and started banging things around. Then the order came out with refried beans instead of black beans. Fly's are buzzing all around our food. I am too freaked out to eat this and just spent  $17.46. Should I risk it, and try this food?
