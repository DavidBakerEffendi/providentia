Have been going to sauce for years.  Have always ate the pizza and pasta.  I should have just stuck with tradition.  I ordered the Roast Beef and Smoked Mozzarella Panini.  It was awful.  I Didn't eat half of it.  It really had almost no flavor.  It was a completely odd experience eating a roast beef with no flavor.  I had my wife even try some of the meat and she was perplexed as well.  Also the meat was really cold and the mozzarella was cold and unmelted.  Kind of expected a panini to be warm.  I was wrong.  My wife had a grilled cheese and tomato soup. While the soup was good, the grilled cheese was also awful.  The cheese was nowhere close to being melted.   Like i said, lesson learned.  Stick to the pizza and pasta.
