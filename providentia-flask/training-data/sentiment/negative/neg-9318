The food and atmosphere is great! But the servers are SO rude I had to go with 1 star. We had a group of 7. 1 person, who ordered a 20$ drink, wasn't hungry so the servers told her she needed to sit in the bar while the rest of us ate. For 7 people to order over 200$ I expect better service. I'm really disappointed because this is one of my favorite stops.
