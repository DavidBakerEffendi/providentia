Alright. Let me step on my soap box. This place isn't worthy of your time or money. Let me tell you why. 
But first, I'll tell you the best thing about this place...their sauce for the calamari. Okay. Now back to the crap. 

Food was terrible. Ordered a medium done burger, got charred well done. Partner ordered a well done burger got medium rare. Friend got a chicken sandwich, chicken was dry as a bone. Shrimp was slimey and garbage.

Don't waste your money. I know it's convenient being in your hotel, but seriously--I wish I would've walked down the strip more and spent my time at a place that has better service and better food. period.
