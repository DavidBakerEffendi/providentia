Update: this 5 star review was left for Chef Desyree...not new owners. Shady to try to capitalize off her success!

My husband and I have made several visits, and never have we left disappointed. 

The owner is extremely sweet and helpful. From creative flavors such as roasted pepper or Gorgonzola and pear, to more mainstream pistachio, everything is handcrafted with care, and delightful. 

My husband always gets cookie butter, but I like  to branch out- tonight's 1/2 almond nougat, 1/2 cinnamon toast crunch was fantastic. I can't wait to bring out of town guests here!

Parking can be tricky, but (knock on wood) so far we've always found a spot.
