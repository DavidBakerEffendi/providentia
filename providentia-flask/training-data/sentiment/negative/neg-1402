Below is the complaint I wrote to IHOPS Corporate headquarters:
We came in on the above date for lunch. We walked in and there was a party of like 8 in front of us who were waiting for a table. The hostess comes to the front, does not even acknowledge us and tells the party their table is ready. Ok so she seats that party and we continue to wait. After 10 minutes we walked out she never came back to the front and never even acknowledged we were there. The location was pretty empty also so being busy is not an excuse. She was a young thin girl with brown or black long hair and I think she was wearing a black shirt. I guess IHOP lost my business I will go to Dennys from now on. She should be fired. This was the location on Ray Rd right off I-10 in Phoenix. So tell me why should I try IHOP again?
