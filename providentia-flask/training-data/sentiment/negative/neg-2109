Okay so normally were not big AYCE people. We prefer sushi outings that involve us selecting a few quality rolls and unfortunatelly resultign in us spending around 60-70.00 after all is said and done.

On this particular night... we were HANGRY and we wanted copious amounts of sushi and sashimi and noodles and appetizers and everything. So we googled and googled and came across this gem. The menu soudned expansive and full of variety. The reviews mentioned a few gems like Rock Shrimp and Treasure Island. Intruiged off we went in search. 

First of all. The reviews do not lie. Service is atrocious. The servers have no interest in exchanging common politeness - like hello or thank you or your welcome or anything more than "okay". The tea was COLD. how can green tea be cold? Regardless, we ordered...

The rock shrimp was essentially battered shrimp covered in a honey sauce. Meh. The treasure island was a mess of sashimi heavily loaded with sauces. and more honey. the gyoza was a disgrace. slimy and barely filled. The 5 rolls were ordered were unimaginative and lacking in flavious. All of them also tasted like HONEY. What is up with all the honey? 

The salmon sashimi was not fresh at all. so thats where we stopped ordering sashimi.

One of the items was FOUL. We ordered spicy white tuna roll and the fish actually tasted off. we left the entire roll and proceed to ask for the bill as we had a feelign we were going to get very sick.

My most favorite item... the green tea icecream. cause seriously...how can you mess that up? Ohh i forgot by giving me a plastic wet spoon. kinda gross.

Dinner on a sunday ngiht was 19.00 (they dropped the price from 21). Total after everythign was 50.00. We both ended up with horrible tummy aches all night and 50.00 poorer for no damn good reason. 

Honestly... maybe were nto AYCE people... but this stuff was bad.
