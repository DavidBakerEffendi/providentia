First visit $130....Swarma ....dried chicken and stale rice tabula salad was inedible loads of salt... two weeks later thought we would give it a second chance .....as first round at least the baba Ganush was good.... bad idea ... beets were bubbling with fermentation ... eggplant salad same.... fermented and the lid actually blasted off there was so much potency...  Red pepper bad as well.... tabula salad was completely flavourless. tasted days old ...$72 later ....2 dishes out of 7 were  edible ...never going back.... just not worth the long wait, high priced expired food ..terrible and disappointing ...
