Tried to order for delivery for tonight through GrubHub, was told that there was an additional $2 charge for the distance and an additional hour before my food would even be ready for delivery. That's fine, when I called to cancel the order, however, I was told "we're downtown" *click*
Whoever answered the phone, literally hung up on me when I was trying to cancel my order. I won't be ordering from them again, thank goodness for GrubHub, or there would be a very angry couple when the delivery man showed up and then an angry delivery guy who wouldn't have been paid for the trip.
