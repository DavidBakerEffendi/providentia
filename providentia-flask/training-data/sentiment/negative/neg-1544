I needed to grab a quick bite before jumping on a connecting flight.  Fresh Attractions was right next to my gate and quicker than the Phillips Seafood (which is a million times better) on the other side.  Huge mistake.

I ordered a ham and swiss panini thinking a hot sandwich would be nice.  What I got was some sloppy, barely toasted mess.  The lady making the sandwich didn't care, the register lady (who overcharged me until I corrected her) didn't care.  The entire place didn't give a shit since honestly they're never likely to see you again.

For the random traveler passing through CLT a craptastic sandwich isn't too bad, but for road warriors like me a shitty food joint must be avoided at all costs.  Don't go to this half-assed place unless you are starving and even then I'd think long and hard about it.
