Ugh, I feel so bad. Me and this Filiberto's location used to have a good thing going on, but something has changed. For the worse. The only thing I can imagine is they have changed their bean supplier. Ever since September 2014 when I order my usual bean and cheese burrito, half the time the beans aren't cooked all the way so you get grey-ish-slop colored beans, with a dry or sandy texture, and an old-water taste. Or you get what I got last night, which were runny, grey-ish-slop that tasted more like day old oatmeal with a hint of rubber. It's so gross. 

Please fix your beans and call me! Otherwise, you have lost a devoted customer.
