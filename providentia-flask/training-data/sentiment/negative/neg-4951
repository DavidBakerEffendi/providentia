I was eating my burrito bowl and bit into a rock that was in your food. I was confused when I bit down because it hurt like hell and it damaged my tooth. When I pulled the hard object out of my mouth I saw it was a small and very sharp looking rock. My teeth are now sore and I can't chew food on my right side of my mouth. This is complete bullshit and absolutely unacceptable. Not only was my meal a stressful experience now I have to go to the dentist.  I am very hesitant to eat at any of your resturants again. I will make sure to warn everyone I come in contact about my experience with Chipotle. Is it that fucking hard to make sure no forgein objects are in the food you serve??? When I went into the resturant they were not busy so I am not sure why this could happen. I have a picture of the rock in question that I will try upload with this comment. I hope we can come to an agreement on a way this can made right
