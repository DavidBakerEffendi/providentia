Came to pick up some food today. Immediately the guy had some attitude. I kindly ask for extra napkins and was told that there's already napkins with the utensils. You know, that one small napkin that comes in those small packets with forks and knives. Anyway, the guy starts serving other guests behind me, handing food to them across my face. Very unprofessional. I wasn't even done signing the check. Handed about three  people their food across my face as I was getting my food and signing the check. Food will be cold from this place because hot and cold items are kept in the same plastic containers.
