Wow, I just walked in here sat down at the bar.... five minutes later I walked out. 

The bar tending girl half heartedly says hi after I did, then walks away.... pretty tattoo boy standing in front of me wiping out a glass never makes eye contact or acknowledges me in any way. Across the bar from me, stands two female servers chatting up a storm, the dark haired one glances over then continues talking apparently blinded by her ridiculous fake eyelashes. The female bartender walks past again as if I wasn't there. There are a total of 2, that's ' two' others at the bar... the place is empty and apparently no one cares about serving a middle aged, balding patron without visible tat's.
I could have look past it all if it hadn't happened the last time I was in about 6 mos. ago. It's a shame management doesn't notice. No one in the restaurant would have known any different if I hadn't said something to yet another server blonde and hostess on the way out. To their credit, they were both apologetic... "let me buy you lunch".... "thanks, but I just ate". Thank god there aren't mirrors in there.
