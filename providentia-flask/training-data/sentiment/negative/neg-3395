Tried a 2nd time, This time for lunch. NO crazy crowd this time around, none in fact, But still we got the same Crappy service. Last time we were here it was an evening and it was crowded. I understand the glitch in service with a heavy crowd. But the 2nd time was ridiculous. We waited for more than 30 mins for a Baby corn fry, ended up cancelling the order. 

They spoil the mood and feel like you are eating there for free. 

Food: 4/5
Service: 0/5.
