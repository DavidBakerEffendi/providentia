Very disappointed in the "new" concept.  No buffet, but pre-cooked food, think school cafeteria.  All the downside of a buffet, with none of the upside.  Same item as buffet but choose either two or three items combo with some rice and naan.  None of the good fried stuff.  No cucumbers or vegetables or chutneys. The serving was mostly sauce and over cooked. Styrofoam plates and cups. We would go a few times a year to this place before the change.  Will not be back.
