Ouch!  Really, this was painful.  Ate here for their Sunday Champagne Brunch.  First of all, they're serving J Roget for their champagne.  The stuff costs $4 a bottle so be ready for a headache if you're going all out on this stuff.  We did not as my wife and I both know better than to drink cheap champagne.  The buffet was weak in our opinion.  There is absolutely no ambiance to the place and it is grossly overpriced.  Thankfully we had a $65 credit as part of our room package so we only spent $10 with tip for the meal.  I would strongly suggest visiting the "Pantry" around the corner for breakfast or a different resort for their brunch.  If you do want a highlight to try out while you're there check out the cinnamon buns and the tiramisu, both were very good.
