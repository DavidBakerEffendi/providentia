Giving this particular chipotles a 1 star because of their customer service . I go to this particular chipotle a lot because I work close to it. I ordered what I always order which is usually 5 bucks and the lady at the register named jalon told me 12 dollars . So I was like what? And she was trying to blame it on the guy that made my food when I saw him make it correctly. Plus she was trying to make me pay for a bottled water that comes with my meal because a drink comes with this meal and I have never been charged   For in the past . I order the same thing every time and am always charged the exact same until today. And she was arguing with me about it when I come here all the time , what happened to the customer always being right, no instead she basically accused me of lying about the price I am normally charged . I still like chipotle but customer service sucks at this particular location .
