This place has a great menu concept with terrible execution.  Mother's Day brunch service was deplorable with more than an hour of wait between order and food delivery. Only a single order ever came out and we had to cancel the other three and leave.    Clearly this place isn't ready to be busy.  With such great food and service options in Toronto I can't recommend this place for anything.  The location is great - so perhaps it will find itself occupied by yet another new business that understands the importance of quality AND service.  1 star is generous for this level of service experience. Unfortunately the whole restaurant was full of people with the same tragic experience.  The worst part is that after all this they decided to still charge us for the drinks and single entree.
