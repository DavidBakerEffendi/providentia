Yelp should really have a zero star rating! ONE star is being way too generous!!

Let me share my horror story with all of you! My experience with this place was horrifying and i want to make sure none of you food lovers will have to ever experience that!!!

Yesterday (Sunday) it was the 13th and my bf and i were doing our pre valentine's day lunch since we had a busy evening we wanted to stay dt and grab sushi. I'm not generally a big fan of ayce but i do get random cravings.

after surfing on my phone i found this place and decided to give it a shot. As we got there the place was pretty packed the menu was decent not a whole lot of selection for ayce places. it was ok. $12.99, did not complain for the price.

we were told to write on a piece of old receipt for our orders and the food was totally NOT FRESH at all. The fish salmon sushi tasted extremely off!! i couldnt eat it. my bf ate all of it and to let everyone know that WE only ordered once and the only food we  left was yam tempura, edamame and 3 pcs of sushi that we could not finish.

As we proceeded to order our ice cream, the owner/ manager (GIRL) she YELLED at us for WASTING HER FOOD..(in those exact words)
She demanded that we finish our food OR else we would have to pay full price and not get our dessert.

A few moments later, i asked to speak with the manager then..The server came back and told us that the girl was the owner and to finish our sushi and then we would get dessert. 

GOT my dessert left it untouched NO TIP and never returning!!

Thanks for the horrible experience...

im sure ill be seeing this place going down and/or new owners in no time!!
