We went to Blue 32 for our daughter's 18th birthday and were pretty disappointed.  The waiter was condescending, but we initially just laughed that off.  Food was ok, nothing really wrong, just not great.  Still within the happy hour window, I ordered their well bourbon on the rocks, advertised as $5 on the menu.  When the bill arrived, I noted that it was $8 and change, so I asked the waiter about it.  He said he would take care of it and came back a few minutes later and said to me sarcastically "I took that 75 cents off for you," like I'm cheap.  When I asked about the 75 cents vs $3+ correction I was expecting, he said rocks pours are always doubles.  Huh?  How about asking me if I want a double?  He was adamant that anytime someone orders rocks, they just automatically charge a double.  Given the small glass crammed full of ice I received, it sure didn't look like a double.  After he left and I was signing the check, we noticed that my wife's salad was $18, when it should have been $11.29 + $2.50 for the added chicken she ordered.  These prices were on the menu, so I have no idea what 'Ace' was keying into the system.  We thought about saying something, but after the first experience in flagging something to our waiter, we decided to vote with our feet and never come back.
