Lack of customer service made a slitely annoying situation into an infuriating one.  

I do not like pizza Hut pizza to begin with,  but the gf and I decided to try the cheesy bites pizza.  We ordered online and when the order arrived we received a cheese pan pizza. (which is 10.59....ridiculous)  when I called the not so friendly representative informed me that he "didn't know what to tell"  me.  Because we did the order online the error wasn't theirs he said.  He had a complete lack of empathy or customer service at all.  
After a couple tries of making him understand how I felt,  and getting no where, I told him I didn't accept his answer and I didn't want this pizza.  The phone went silent....  "are you still there?"..............  More silence.  Just as I was about to hang up and drive down there to speak to a manager he came back.  Apparently I was on hold?  He then informed me that his manager said they would replace the pizza,  but they would be picking up the original pizza.  Ok by me,  I don't want it,  but the accusatory tone just made me even more upset.  
Thank you for solidifying my dislike of pizza hut, now there never has to be a question  as to whether we should try it out or not.
