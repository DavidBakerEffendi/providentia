I am giving this place one star because ZERO is not an option this has to be the worst family event location. They harassed me and my children and the manager Meghann Mcbryan was using foul language around my children and then they had the nerve to kick me out for ordering pizza from somewhere else and I only did that because their food options were Terrible. I expect to hear from someone at this business because we spent good money here for some woman to insult me.
