If I could give negative stars I would! Disgusting! Ok, so Yelp is requiring me to write more.
We asked for a table to relax, they gave us a bar table the size of a dinner plate.
Two minutes later they open the comfortable seating/table section.
Then, ordered BBQ Wings and Honey Wings that must have been dropped in coating over and over, when I scrapped the coating and bit into the chicken, I had to spit it out.
Ok enough said! Not going back again,
Urban = Gangsta!
Not well managed!
