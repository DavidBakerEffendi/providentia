This was the worst buffet I've ever eaten at in my life, including local chinese buffets, golden corral, etc.  Many different and spread out stations, each with only a few bad choices.  Italian station was some kind of spaghetti, meatballs, and then the rest was pizza, all of it was bad.  Most of the stations had two hot soup options and/or dips and spreads that appeared to be there just to take up space and make it look like more variety than it was.  The prime rib was overcooked and seriously under seasoned and the crab legs were ice cold and ruined by being sliced in half long ways so you had to dig out the meat with a fork, not to mention they were small snow crab legs to begin with.  Even the cocktail shrimp were very "shrimpy" tasting, not good.  I would have been disappointed with this buffet even if it was completely comped.  There was not anything that was worth eating, I'd have rather eaten at the food court in the Fashion Show Mall.
