So, I'm here ordering through the drive through! I'm told no large drinks and no ice cream!!!! So, confused!   I see ice cream and shakes on the sign!  I'm once again told no ice cream all though I see thrifty by the gallons.  I decide to go inside once inside I speak with the manager Angel and he  explains to me they are out of large cups and they prepackaged the shakes with the thrifty ice cream.  I explain to him that I just wanted some ice cream  Angel says that's just not the way we do it, she told you that.  I responded I will take it to the internet!  Angel said what ever!!!!  Sign says hand blended ice cream.   Hand blended shakes.    One would think you could get some ice cream and maybe a shake!
