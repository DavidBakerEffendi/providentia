They have attitudes beyond belief, they opened at 7but when i came in at 8 they didn't have any soup ready. i stood at the cash register for 3 minutes before the lady topped talking to another worker and actually took my order, i was never greeted. ordered to go and opened my bag four hours later to the salad only have filled and no extra croutons like i paid for. wont be back.
