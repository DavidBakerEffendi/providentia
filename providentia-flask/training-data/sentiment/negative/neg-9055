Not sure why or how this has so many stars. I ordered the Tortilla Soup and it was horrible. I returned it because there was at least 1/4 of oil sitting on the top of the bowl.  It had white shredded chicken in it in a flavorless brown sauce with nothing other than large tortilla sticks out of it. I also ordered the tacos. They were bland with no salt. All in all, a bad experience. The service was ok. Girl was nice but my son had no utensils and he had to get some from another table.
