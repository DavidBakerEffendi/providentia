If I could give zero stars I would.  We ordered Pepper Steak, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops and Beef Chow Fun w/ black bean sauce.  Everything was served quick, and I mean very quick.  Which immediately made my spider senses tingle. Well it tasted that way too, as if everything was just thrown together and brought out.  Flavor was non existent except for the MSG on the pork chops.  And, really, how can you screw up steamed rice??? Do not go here please!  If you value your taste buds, STAY AWAY! Let me put it this way, the Pepsi and fortune cookie was the best of the meal. Only got Chinese on this visit so perhaps the sushi is better? I don't know, but not even going to give this place a 2nd chance.
