We were at the Palace Station ... the food and service were terrible.  We have eaten at Feast Buffets at Red Rock, Green Valley, Sunset Station, and Santa Fe and they have all been good.  This place was by far the worst.  Meat dishes were dry and tough.  Selection was very poor.  The kitchen staff sounded like they were having a fight with the pots and pans.  We will not return to this place.  It was really terrible.
