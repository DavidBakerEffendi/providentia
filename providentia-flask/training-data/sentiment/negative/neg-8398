Food bland, service slow.  You would think that an establishment with Beef in their name would offer prime beef products instead of poor quality food at prime prices.  

If you like frozen pre-formed hamburger patties and dry bland cheese steaks, then this is the place for you.

I'm done with Beefs and will not be going back.  

Teakwoods is the place for excellent service and consistent quality foods.
