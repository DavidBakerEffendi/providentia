We were regular customers when they first opened the food was great. But we quit ordering when the food quality went down hill fast! We would order our pizza with extra sauce and they would have hardly any sauce or cheese. Toppings used to be on the pizza's quite generously but now hardly any at all. We took a chance and decided to give them one more chance after many months. We ordered a medium Taco pizza extra sauce and and a create your own with extra sauce. Both came so dry. Taco pizza had some brown lettuce on it and my other pizza had maybe 1/3 cup of cheese. I firmly believe in supporting local businesses but this is one that I will no longer waste my money on.
