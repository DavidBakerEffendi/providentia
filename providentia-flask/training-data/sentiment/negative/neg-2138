Worst place for mariscos. Food wasn't  good at all; extremely bland and Service was terrible. We stood there for a good 3-5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. The waitresses passed us by and just looked at us without saying a thing while we stood there waiting to be seated. We asked for drinks along with glasses of water and when the bill was given to us we discovered we were charged $3 for the water. This place always looks busy and I don't understand why. Phoenix needs more GOOD mariscos restaurants!
