Friend and I decided to try this place on a busy Saturday night since there was no wait time compared to the other Greek places.
Boyy was that a mistake! Restaurant was half full and we ordered chicken souvlaki's (w/ salad, rice, and potato). Service was really slow for all the customers nearby even though there's plenty of front staff. Took like 20 min for bread and another 20 for the salads. This is after the server checking up on us twice to ask if we received the salads yet. Chicken souvlaki dinner was bland. After our meals, we both felt a bit sick in the stomach and I felt like puking. Upon walking past the kitchen to the washroom, the cooks looked miserable...doesn't feel like the food is made with care here and will not be going back. 

Sometimes it's worth the wait at a good restaurant than try to satisfy your immediate hunger and risk the potential food poisoning. An hour after we felt okay so it's not a big deal. The staff seemed pretty courteous; still would not go back though.
