Won't be back! Went there for Breakfast and the place was only half full, and a zero wait on a Saturday Morning...You think we would be ecstatic right? NOT! Everything was downhill from this point. I noticed they were using wait staff to seat people and check people out, this is fine for a small mom & pop, but not for large chain restaurant. Where was the hostess and manager...no where to be seen, that's where. This should have been our first sign. After being seated, it took 10 minutes before they took our drink order. I had to ask twice for a spoon for my coffee. Probably the worst cup of coffee I have ever had. After placing our order, we waited 30 minutes, then decided to walk after noticing our food sitting under the heat lamp for god knows how long (while our so-called waiter was checking people out). Be warned...stay away.
