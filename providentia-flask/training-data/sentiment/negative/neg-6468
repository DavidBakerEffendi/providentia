HOW ON EARTH DO YOU MESS UP A WAFFLE?!?!? I never thought the day would come, where I would taste a waffle that I didn't like. And not only did I not like it, it was so displeasing it was inedible. I asked for it to be extra crispy, it was soft as a pillow. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked in burnt grease. This plate was a disaster. Actually not a single person at our table enjoyed their food. The Salmon Bites tasted like they took canned shredded Salmon(SHREDDED!!), balled it, breaded it, fried it with no seasoning. We all left hungry. We also all left still waiting on a drink we ordered as soon as we'd arrived that never made it to our table. The waitress brought us our checks without the drinks on it and said if the bartender still makes them before you leave, i'll bring them over to you for free. Did not believe for a second that the bartender was still working on our drinks. Especially when we saw people at the bar getting drinks pretty quickly. How do you prepare bar drinks before your diners? Doesn't make sense to me. Horrible experience, will never return for any reason.
