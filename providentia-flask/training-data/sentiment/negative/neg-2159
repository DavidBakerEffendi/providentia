First of all, maybe some of the "steaks" might be delicious.  But the "sirloin" is definitely not.

I took my kids there last night for the first time ever, because the other place we wanted to eat was closed on Mondays (surprised) and OutBack was nearby.  /regret.

My daughter had the "kids meal sirloin" and it was not good at all.  Dry, with very little flavor.  She disliked it so much she asked for steak sauce, which she never generally asks for.  THEN, the waiter forgot she asked, and I had to ask a different server to get her some A1.  My daughter's words:  "I can't believe any kids like this steak."

My son had a garden salad with Ranch, and he liked that OK.  ( Hard to mess up a basic salad. )  He also liked his baked potato.  But he also had a sirloin, and did not like it much either.  Both kids had leftovers which I decided to take home, hoping maybe to add the steak to something else like a stew or soup.

I had the filet  ( which was kinda like a prime rib cut ) with mushroom sauce, a baked sweet tater, and the vegetable medley, which was snap peas, yellow squash, carrots, and broccoli I think. It was decent, but definitely not worth $14.95.  The potato was the best thing on the plate.

I had never really been impressed by OutBack the 2 or 3 times in my life I had eaten there, and this trip confirmed my suspicions.

Will not go back - ever.  Overpriced and just not tasty food.
