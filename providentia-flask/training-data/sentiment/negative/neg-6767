AWFUL! We have been here MANY times and have spent hundreds of dollars here. Matt is the best bartender around because he is a personable, hard worker who is AMAZING at his job. Tonight was a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT with someone named RICK behind the bar who boasted that he is the owner. Our skinny margaritas this time were LOADED with ice (see photo) & when my friend asked for less ice on our second round, Rick said that that's the way they do it and they should never do it differently. REALLY???? We were shocked!!! $10 per glass of ICE!?!? Again, see the photo. Shame on you, RICK. Matt is amazing and he puts half the ice in. Upon asking where our regular bartender Matt was, Rick became agitated, said he was the owner, and angrily proclaimed that Matt is making him lose money. What a horrible thing to say! Especially when your drinks are 90% ice and his are actual "normal" drinks. We will never EVER come back to this establishment because Rick is completely incompetent in dealing with his customers and we do not want to support him. He was rude and cheap even on a Tuesday when it was dead. Matt should find a better place to work and WE will find a better place to spend our money on High Street...easily done. Rick was the rudest person we have ever encountered in a business we used to frequent and to find out he was the owner was shocking. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE! Go across or down the street for better drinks, service and to support great local businesses. NOT this one who's owner who doesn't care about his customers.
