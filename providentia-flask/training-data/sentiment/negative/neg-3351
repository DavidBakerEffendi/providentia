Terrible service. Firstly, waited to be greeted...was met with zero friendliness nor apology from waitress. Waited way too long for our beverage refills. Waited way too long for our check. Messed up on my order twice, but did not say anything the second go around because I gave up and ate it anyway. Syrup tasted stale...just off. And as the other reviews stated...why is it so cold inside?! My coffee was cold within minutes. Go to Steve's for a prompt, warm, tasty breakfast.
