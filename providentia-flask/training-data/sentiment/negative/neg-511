We have been wanting to try this new burrito place down the street from my house. 


FINALLY hubby goes and gets me a veggie  burrito. 

The first thng I noticed was how small it was. I usially go to Whole Foods or Cafe Rio or even Qdoba , so I know my burritos . This was WAY small. For the same price as the others listed.

The second thing I noticed ..


The veggies inside were WAY to salty. I couldn't even finish. 

I am a vegan , so I.am pretty good with spices amd salt seasoning my food. 


Sorry guys we won't be back.
