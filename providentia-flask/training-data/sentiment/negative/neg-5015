Me and some friends  went there to enjoy some drink and try some middle eastern meal. We waited almost an hour just for the waitress to ask us for a drink. After hour later waitress came and ask us what we like to drink soon is drink came we left the restaurant.Terrible service , feels like they only serve people they know inside which is from their own country . Never will go there again.
