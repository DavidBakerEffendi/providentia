5 stars for the concept... i have never eaten in complete darkness
1 star for the food.  Everything was salty and tasted like we were eating cafeteria food.  I was not "surprised" by the "surprise" meal, it was kinda of boring.  
1 star for the decor, it was a stuffy basement restaurant (not in the actual dark dinning room, but in the entrance bar area)

We ate late, so when we left we noticed that one of the servers who was leaving at the same time was actually not blind (not that it was advertised that she was but she was wearing dark sunglasses in the restaurant)... again Im not accusing just highlighting.
