When they first opened we were like, this is a great alternative to the others. Pizza was good, orders were complete. Fast forward to today, order took over 1 hour 45 minutes, pizza was COLD, wings were soggy and we were missing our sauces. 

This has happened on the last two orders. We called to speak to a manager about our dissatisfaction and how this has happened two times in a row and the manager proceeded to call my wife "Rude". No empathy at all. Just a, that's the way it is attitude. 

Good luck to your business. Your Corporate Office  will also receive this feedback.
