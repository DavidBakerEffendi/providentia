I tried, I really tried to find something that would get this place another star but I couldn't stretch that far.  This place has about 50 tables of which 4 were occupied when we got here. Literally the whole main dining room had two tables filled. Our server was less than attentive. She was not friendly and everything we needed we had to call for her to come by. The food was anything but edible. The fried shrimp ( remember the restaurant name has Seafood House in it ) was over breaded and tough. How can a chain as Landry's mess up shrimp and fries especially at $22 dollars per plate. 
We mentioned it to the skill lacking server and she said she was "sorry about that". She got one plate removed from our bill but told me I had eaten to much of mine to have the manager remove it. I ate the fries first so the plate looked like I had eaten more. I am a local and this place reminds me of a tourist trap. Unfortunate as I have eaten at laundry's in other cities and been pleased. 
Eater beware!
