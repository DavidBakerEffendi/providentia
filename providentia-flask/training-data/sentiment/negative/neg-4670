My boyfriend made a reservation last night for 2 at 8:45pm, we walked in and he told the host he had called and made a reservation but seemed like she didn't write it down or knew what she was doing. She didn't even greet us or nothing and as she walked us to the table she was talking to another customer instead of asking us how we were or anything...very unprofessional.  On the other hand our server was great, very sweet and caring but this stupid camera guy came up to us and just stood here didn't say a word then says "would you guys like a picture, it's free" we took pictures I bought 2 and he was just so weird and awkward I felt so uncomfortable then this kid says that his feet hurt...I told him he has an easy job and he should be fine. I don't think anyone should complain about an easy ass job like come on. My burger wasn't even that good, my boyfriend got steak worth $30 he asked for medium rare and it was over cooked...we left and of course left. Good tip as always but this restaurant seems like the managers don't know how to run it we left and no one said goodbye. Food is extremely expensive for shitty food and horrible customer service. I would never come back...also my boyfriend got extremely sick because the food was bad. Worst experience ever.
