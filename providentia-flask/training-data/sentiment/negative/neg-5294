Misaki...  Might be the single worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I felt sick to my stomach almost immediately afterwards.  

Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted with what I would call mass confusion.  We were handed of 3 times before we were finally seated.  Ok so what, maybe the foods good.   Not so....  The sushi had a film on it like it was sitting out for hours, the food was cold, selection was horrible and what I did eat tasted like it was frozen just hours before.   

Once the experience was over I was told by multiple wait staff members that I had to wait to pay my bill as my waitress had to "take care of something" in the restroom.  Not only that, the manager asked me how everything was to which I proceed to explain my experience.  I was shocked when all I got was a half assed explanation and was made to pay the full bill.  

I can guarantee I will NEVER return and will do everything I can to keep others away from this so called restaurant.
