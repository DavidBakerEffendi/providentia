I tried this location when it first opened. The shawarma was pretty good, but kept falling apart the way it was filled. The dips are good, but not the sandwiches. There are no traditional fillings to add to the sandwiches. I don't know which owner the other posters met, but the one I met was rude with an attitude problem. I have been there 3x, but will never go back. There is a MUCH better Shawarma place at Markham Rd & 14th avenue. They make everything homemade & fresh.
