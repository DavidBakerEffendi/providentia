Walked in and they weren't very busy. Seated promptly to a filthy table. Took over five minutes before our server came to take a drink order. After that we never saw her again. Literally sat at the table for an accumulative 12 minutes before just getting up and leaving. Never stopped by anyone on the way out and walked past multiple employees while leaving who were standing around not doing anything. How do you forget a drink order consisting of a coke and a tea?? Probably won't ever be back, terrible terrible terrible service.
