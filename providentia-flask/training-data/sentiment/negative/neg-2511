Food is good, but I am giving a one star review for the hostess on duty on 7/3/2015 at ~11:40 am. We have 3 adults, 3 kids between 7-10, and one 2 yrs old baby in stroller arriving the entrance, the restaurant was about 1/5 packed, I asked "do you have seat for 7 ?", she answered me right away: "No, we don't" even without turning her head over to take a look at the seating area.  I was surprised and shocked at that time, because it was obvious that there were plenty of seatings available.   I stood there until a waiter came to me and greeted us to the seats.  Well, we enjoyed the food here, yet do not appreciate the attitude of the hostess, when we walked out she didn't even look at us, let alone giving us the "thank you, good bye" that I expect to receive from most of restaurants.
