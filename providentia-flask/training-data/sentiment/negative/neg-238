NEVER AGAIN!!
If you like to be served by Snobby women, who only chat you up when you are paying your bill then this is the place!!!

My Husband took my to dinner to Celebrate my new promotion at work, after we seated on the patio we began to wait.  She had 3 other tables on the patio, so not busy, but after 5 min with no menu, we also had no acknowledgement from the waitress, when another table for three walks in and she begins to serve them promptly!!! What a great celebration it was to wait another 10 min before she came over to drop off menus!!! she didn't even take our drink order!! then she rushed us on our food order, when she hadn't even brought our drinks!!!

There was nothing good about the service! Our steaks we so grease and dripping with excess oil, we wouldn't even give the leftovers to our dog! I hope the table of 3 she served before us, made up for the tip she didn't NOT receive from us!

I will never come here again!

BTW: your beer size in CC is really an 18OZ pint, but your charging as a 20OZ.  10% mark-up on a smaller drink.
