Where are the dancing girls we were promised?

Stopped by last week while we were seeking out now happy hours in Towns Square and we were told "you have to come next Tuesday! It's like first Friday but indoors with drink specials!"

Whoa! First Friday on a Tuesday? I'm in. 

We arrive to no people, the drink specials were vodka out of a plastic bottle and bud light drafts. They should call them "shit no one drinks specials". 

The one up side was the food portions. The food was pretty good and you got a lot of it. I would have been content if it wasn't for what sounded like someone finger banging a cat and holding it up to the mic. 

The have a single acoustic singer who was mediocre at best singing his own songs. If the music is going to be bad at least make it something I can sing along to. 

Doubt I will be back for whatever event this was.
