Third time is not the charm. Sorry guys but your waitress was rude and sarcastic (and not in a good way either.) I'd love to come into this restaurant and have a friendly vibe but it just isn't happening. Water is not filtered and you can taste it. Hot chocolate was neither sweet nor chocolately. And hey, is it really so hard to put the hollandaise on the side? That's what I asked for but that's not how my benedict came to me. Set in front of me with no apology like I just have to eat it this way or nothing. And that avocado mush - what is that? No flavor added to the bennie at all. Whatever - There won't be any more chances here. Really sorry - I tried to like you.
