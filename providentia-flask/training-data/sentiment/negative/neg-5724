I went to Liberty Noodle two days ago and ordered the tonkotsu ramen. The portion wasn't impressive as it left me hungry and unsatisfied. The flavour was bland and the the pork didn't taste fresh. Within an hour after my meal, I was feeling nauseous and since then, I've been stuck at home with stomach issues. I wouldn't suggest eating here. There are many other choices in the food court.
