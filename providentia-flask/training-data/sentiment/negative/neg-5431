Definitely the absolute worst experience ever in a restaurant. We made reservations on 2/13. A day before Valentine's Day. We come to find out that the restaurant is have a preset menu. 

To begin, the server does not even put out what the pre-mixed menu is. We find out woth the table next to us that 2 of the few dishes on the testing menu is Abalone and Uni. 2 dishes my girlfriend and I don't eat. So before we order anything we nicely tell the server that we are not interested in dining and that we would pay the cancellation fee for the reservation.

She comes back n demands the whole dinner price of $250 and says you have to pay even if you don't eat. On top of that the manager becomes argumentative! 

Bottom line he was so mad because they only had 3 sets of clients eating there. 

Please refer to all the negative reviews. They all had the same thing about the staff and management and basically trying to force you to pa for food that you can not eat.
