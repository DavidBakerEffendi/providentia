Not sure why the quality has gone down. Crab legs were the skinniest I've ever seen and the temperature of the food was warm at best. The Asian section is being renovated but that should not impact their standards. If it does they should inform customers or reduce the price. I have always enjoyed it before and looked forward to eating here. 
I won't be back. There are many other choices!
