Sadly I can't comment on the quality of the food because we never got seated. We put our name on the wait list, we were told 15 minutes and it was pretty busy so after 20 minutes we were still understanding. 30 minutes came around and all we saw were people leaving and not one person was being seated. We asked where we were on the list to be seated and they said they had tables ready however they were expecting a party of 15 to arrive so they couldn't seat anyone. We were already there waiting but they were holding tables for people who weren't even there?? That makes no sense. We left along with several other parties after they heard that.
