I ate here two times: My first time and my last time.

Walking in and seeing only three other tables occupied, and not being greeted or seated promptly is not really a good start. 

It's also annoying to wait nearly 10 minutes for your server to greet you and bring you menus.

A taco salad does NOT consist of greasy shredded steak that you'd find in a Philly Cheesesteak, mixed salad greens, sweet dressing in a greasy taco shell.

When said "taco salad" was pointed out as not being a taco salad, having a waitress try to tell me I didn't read the menu right and that's how it comes was laughable seeing as though the menu described it as having: ground beef, pico de gallo, sour cream, black beans and guacamole.

The only saving grace was that I only paid $4.99 for that joke of a taco salad (Happy Hour). Yes, I still ended up paying for it...

It may be Rhodes Ranch, but even Taco Bell can make a better taco salad.

Thanks but no thanks!
