We have eaten here on two separate occasions, both of which I was extremely let down by the service. The staff seemed uninterested and disingenuous. We waited entirely too long to be served and even longer to get the drinks we ordered Really just a pretentious vibe and a slack-effort staff. 

The Food was that of any other gentrified restaurant popping-up in Arcadia. 

Best part about this place was leaving.
