The lighting is so bright that I  feel like a celebrity eating izakaya. Way too many pot lights and they gave me a headache. Moving on, we ordered one bottle of sake and small sake with snacks. On the bill, the total value doesn't show the 18% but when they return our change, they took the 18%.

They did not disclose this on the menu but the waitress verbally told us gratuity is 18% for party of 6 or more.

They hardly provided any service and never asked if we needed to refill water, no service and expecting an 18%?!?! I don't think this is acceptable. 

My friend was asking for a mocktail, even that they didn't seem to understand. The waitress's response was "I am new"  The chicken karage was poorly battered, it tasted like the Chinese fried fish with corn, except this is chicken with no corn sauce.

Overall a poor experience not even deserving of one star! Ambiance, food, service, I can't find anything good.
