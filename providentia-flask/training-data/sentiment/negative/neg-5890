I normally don't write reviews. Other than positive ones. But this incident, warrants a review and more. I walk into this location Tuesday night with my 4 yo... Starbucks closes at 10-11pm so I didn't realize they were about to lock up. @730. Otherwise, I try not to be "that lady" who comes in before close. The blonde who took my order didn't smile once and made sure I knew how annoyed she was that I was there!!! Lol whatever.
Anyway, I order and pay. I set my phone down on the shelf to fix my sons milk and leave. I make it less then five feet out the parking lot & realize I left my phone!!!
I run back and both the doors are locked, both the girls are standing right there and I gesture phone, point to it, I can see it thru window... She walks right by us gives me a nasty look and they both walk in the back. I can see my phone!!!!! Unbelievable!! 15 min of knocking on the window, an outsider helps & tries to call them. Nothing. 25 min. Later! A cop pulls up, I tell him the deal. He laughs "love getting called for nothing." Finally the blonde walks out and opens the door. I just want my phone. I say "you walked right by me. You couldn't hand me my phone 30 min ago?" She says, "I'm not allowed to open the door once it's locked." 
But, you just did...?... Cause me and my toddler are so intimidating. 5'5 112 lbs of petite. Ordering lattes with my designer handbag. Needless to say, HORRIBLE C. Service. I will never go to This place again!! I can't say I've ever been treated like that after I drop 15 bucks on coffee.
