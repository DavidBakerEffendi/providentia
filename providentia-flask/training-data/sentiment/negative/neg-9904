I can't understand why anyone would eat here.  I've been there 3 times and simply put this place is awful.  The potstickers are tasteless, but that is better than any of the noodle dishes.  Those noddles taste as if they were made from wallpaper glue.   
Totts Asian diner is right there and sooooo much better.  Yuphia thai is down the street as well.  Both are much better choices.
