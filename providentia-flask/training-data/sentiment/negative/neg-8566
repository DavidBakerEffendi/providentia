We had great food, and inexcusable service. We had a reservation for 2 couples. We ordered salads and a sushi appetizer, and 2 bottles of white wine. Neither bottle was ever put on ice, nor was it offered. The ladies had sushi, and were given small bowls for soy sauce. However, after the sushi was delivered we had to ask for the soy sauce. We had to ask to have water glasses refilled. We then listened as the server berated the assistant for not filling our water glasses right in the middle of the dining room. 

When ordering, our server told us about a special for the evening...a surf and surf. We asked about the price and were told it was $70. Most things on the menu are $35-$40, so this was not completely out of line. The ladies ordered one to split, and the server suggested we get 2 'small' ones so that the order came in seperate bowls, and it was half the price each. Each of the guys ordered their own. The food was good, but when the bill arrived it showed $70 EACH for the 'small' orders of the special, and $140 each for the regular. Not only were we pissed at being lied to, but the food was not anywhere near worth that much. The server protested and we asked to speak to a manager. The manager took quite a while to come over and then said he was sorry that 'you misunderstood' the server. He changed the bill, but only changed the price on the two full orders from $140 to $70, leaving the 2 small orders still at $70. For $35, he ensured we would never ever return and bought himself this review.
