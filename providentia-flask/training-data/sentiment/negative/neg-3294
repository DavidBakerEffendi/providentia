The place is really big and has some nice TVs inside. The food and service on the other hand were awful. Came in early afternoon and after placing my order it took them over 5 minutes before they even started making it and close to 15 minutes before receiving my chicken Shawarma wrap. After tasting the wrap it tasted how I imagine cardboard would taste. The chicken was really dry, the wrap was really hard to chew. Overall I highly recommend NOT going here.
