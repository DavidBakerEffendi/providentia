Ok Wow it blows my mind this place has 4 stars. I just ordered $40 worth of the most regrettable indian food of my life from this place and I don't even know where to begin. I'm not even Indian. I don't even KNOW what authentic Indian food is, and even I cannot believe this place has the audacity to call itself Indian fine dining.

Here is what was wrong

1) I ordered aloo (potato) parathas - supposed to be rolled flat breads with stuffing rolled into the bread. What did I get? Stale, nasty naan split open and stuffed (totally different thing)

2) I ordered onion kulcha - this is supposed to be a specific kind of naan with onion stuffing. Never mind that the same stale bread was used as in the paratha - the onion kulcha and aloo (potato) paratha had the same filling! WTF?!

3) I ordered chicken tikka - aka BBQ chicken - instead (I wish I could attach a photo - so nasty) I got tiny pieces of chicken that were so clearly made in a frying pan and NOT EVEN BBQ FLAVOURED OR CRISPY! They were yellow. and the pan was full of watery chicken juice. Such a disappointment

4) I ordered chickpea masala. Maybe I'm just so disgusted with the $40 I just threw away I'm being nitpicky but this was just not good. Canned chickpeas tossed in a nasty sauce that was dry on top (like you know when you leave smth out and the top layer dries out? like that)

5) I also ordered some yoghurt sauce - which was ok, and mango chutney which wasn't the greatest (too sweet, clearly store bought)

I'm TELLING you, go to some other place - tons of amazing options on Queen W and King W less than a block from this place. Unless you want truly overpriced food that isn't good, or what it is suppose to be! 

If you have any lingering doubts the entire restaurant was totally empty when I picked up my food. Always a bad sign.
