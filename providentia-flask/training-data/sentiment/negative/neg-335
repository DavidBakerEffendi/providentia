Don't make the mistake of ordering from this place. It took close to 2 hours to receive my food via their delivery service. They were way past the time(45-60 minutes) quoted through Yelp. The Yelp customer service reps tried to help me but they couldn't get anyone on the phone with the restaurant either. 

When it finally arrived the food was clearly almost 2 hours old. The food wasn't warm. The ranch dressing wasn't cold. Absolutely awful. It looked like bad bar food. The only reason I even tried this place is because it was late and the delivery options are limited. That was a mistake. I would've been better off buying a gas station hot dog.
