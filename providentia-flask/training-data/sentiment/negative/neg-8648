I used to love this place and went there all the time with friends to play. I would put up with the wait every time. I even recommended the place to many of my friends. I do find them a bit understaffed though. Sometimes you have to wait ages for someone to come and explain that board game that you are dying to play. There were many times when we haven't found anyone experienced in the game that we had and so we figured out all the rules ourselves.

Then there is this one experience which just destroyed all my good memories of this place. We had to drop off our friends at Bathurst, so we told them we would be back in 10 mins but when we came back they were like we have to wait again even though there were at least 2-3 tables (which were reserved for someone). I was ok with the fact that they had other customers on the wait list and so we would have to wait a bit. However, when the host made a nasty comment like "you guys were here for 4 hours and didn't tip us well", that was the last straw. It was our friend who had paid the bill and we were just dumbstruck. I was pretty sure they got a tip they deserved.

It's not surprising that I never went back after that. Frankly if we just buy the games amongst us, it works out to be much cheaper and that's what we do. Also, we are not obligated to buy any of their mediocre overpriced food/drinks either.
