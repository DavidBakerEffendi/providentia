Extremely rude/snobby salespeople who treat you like a second class citizen when you return/exchange something.  I have never been treated so poorly at a retailer.  It's as though you are a big inconvenience to them when you want to see a product.  They would rather stand around gossiping.  The customer service is MUCH better at Nordstrom. I will never spend another dime at Neiman Marcus.
