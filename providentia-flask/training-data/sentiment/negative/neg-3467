My Mothers Day Experience here was very disappointing. Our server was very uptight, unfriendly and not very customer oriented. I feel bad because my sisters and I talked it up to the rest of our large group, after our wonderful experience (because of our server) in Bullhead City, and it was a flop. Server was less than mediocre and food was still cold internally. 
My sisters and I have determined that this visit has pretty much determined Black Bear Diners existence for future dining options.
However I will make the exception when in Bullhead City.
