We should have known when we walked in that the place was empty for a reason.  It used to be packed all the time.  Now, there are no Asian sushi chef's, no Asian gals like they used to have.  We asked if they had changed hands and they all said no, but something has changed drastically.  We will not go back again.  The sushi were these jumbo rolls that fell apart when you picked them up with chop sticks. They were not tightly wrapped.  The crab mix inside the roll was very strong tasting.  We also ordered their calamari salad that is always  or was always one of my favorites.  The dressing has changed...and not for the better.  We specifically asked for no deep fried chiles, and my husband swallowed one by accident.  There were a total of 4.  Server was inexperienced, not well trained, and I just don't understand how a restaurant that was with waiting lines all the time for lunch and dinner has managed to lose all their staff, and to change what worked so well before.  All I can think is they got greedy and didn't want to pay their staff well enough and they took off and didn't train those new chefs how to do things right.
It was a bomb.  We will not return.
