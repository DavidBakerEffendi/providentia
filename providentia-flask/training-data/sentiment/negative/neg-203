Wow, I'm sooo disappointed in their food, it forced me to write about them.  Greasy, extremely untimely, horrible food.  NEVER AGAIN.
Here we were at home, and I asked my bf to get something other than his usual from another restaurant.  We decided to order from this pizzeria because it was somewhere we haven't tried before.  We asked for delivery, and the lady was very nice over the phone.  Then we waited for well over an hour.  They finally contacted us an hour and a half later and were very apologetic.  That was nice of them to call, but as 2 hours rolled by we finally got our food....yay.  Except for the fact that my bf's poor sandwich looked fit for a malnourished boy...where was all the meat?  That's all he asked for on his sandwich, yet they couldn't give him more than a morsel's size worth?  His fries were greasy and soggy, okay it happens.  My fried pickles looked like they sat in a grease tub soaking all night lonng.  They were dripping with oil and very mushy.  Oil just oozed out when I poked at it.  This will be my last experience from here, but I feel terrible for convincing my bf to try this place, when he knew of a very good pizzeria himself.  The moral of our story is stick with what you know is good, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  SORRY Honey.
