Ordered 2 larges. One all dressed one plain. Received pepperoni instead of plain with giant air pockets. When called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy, I was told that it was a mistake. Yes I agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with giant air pockets in it which is also 2 inches in diameter smaller than the large ordered in the box isn't a mistake, it was intentional. I have posted the picture. Replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold. Thank, never will we order here again.
