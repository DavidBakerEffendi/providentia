I keep giving this Pizza Hut chance after chance but every time I order delivery my pizza arrives cold or undercooked. I am 12 minutes from this Pizza Hut and it took 25 minutes from the time I received a text saying my pizza was on its way. I don't even bother to call and complain anymore, a credit for another cold free pizza does nothing for me. Unfortunately I'm going to have to take my business elsewhere, it's a shame because I really enjoy Pizza Hut Pizza when it's done right.
