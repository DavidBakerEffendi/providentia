I'm done with this place. Their customer service is terrible and every time we come here the food gets worse. This is the second time that I've tried to order a souffl√© they have in the glass case only to watch them put it in a to-go box and tell me they were out of them....You would think if you have a good selling item you might make sure you keep them in supply. My husband got such a stale bagel served to him that it broke the plastic knife he used to try to cut it. Done.
