$42 for three vodka/tonics???  These were NOT in a mason jar, just a normal size.  What a ripoff.

There was an average (at best) band playing and an overcrowded dance area (that could have been made larger if they moved some tables).

There were tons of drunk people.  I mean really drunk, like people had to hold them up.  

I will not be back.  I really wanted to like the place but just wasn't feeling it.
