Very poor service. The wait staff came and took one of our menus (there were two of us) away before we decided on our main course!! We only sat down for 5 minutes. No, they were out of menus, he just stashed it back onto their full stack. One of our appetizers was sashimi salad, which we didn't finish cos the fish was fishy. We didn't order maincourse in the end and went to another restaurant for our proper dinner instead
