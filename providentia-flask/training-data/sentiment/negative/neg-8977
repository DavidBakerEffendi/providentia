Trying to find a parking spot should have been an omen.   This place was the worst.  Brought my daughter and her friend who we're visiting from Austin to what I thought would be a great tea experience for the two tea lovers.  First of all the place is filthy.   I wonder if the health department knows of this place.   I believe if they did it would not be in business.  There was a huge pot of something sitting off the burner  not being properly cooled.  The person taking our order waited on customers, prepared food and took money all without gloves or hand washing.   Totally turned me off .  I do not recommend this place to anyone .   We left without our tea
