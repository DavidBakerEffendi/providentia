Without a doubt, the worst McD's in Brampton...

Feels as though the management couldn't care less about customer service or quality of food.  Don't risk getting sick from this place.  Go to the Queen and 7 location.   It's run a lot better and is actually hygienic even though it's the same owner.  

Assembly of food here is terrible and its not like this is considered cheap fast food anymore either.  This location should be seriously re evaluated with a microscope by head office and the manager should be fired.
