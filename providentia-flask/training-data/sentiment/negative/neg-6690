How anyone can give this place a good review is beyond me. We had a 7:15pm  reservation and we arrived early. We waited to be seated and finally a man with a hat from behind the counter asked our name and if we had a reservation. I told him the name and he yelled you are 20 minutes early from behind the counter He acted like he had to rearrange the room for us and there were only 3 tables with people seated there. Finally he brought us to the table and we waited awhile for water to be served. Meanwhile I looked around the room and it looked very messy and unkept in my opinion.  There were 4 men 2 cooks a waited and someone talking to people about wine. They all looked unkept to me. The wine we ordered was very good. Then my friend asked for a separate check when we ordered and he told her it was too busy to do that. That was with 3 tables there...
My husband ordered Foie Gras and there was one piece on top of something  ground up and he didn't know what it was. His main meal was soft shell crabs and they were so over breaded he couldn't eat them and he loves soft shell crabs.
I ordered the lamb and the chops were very small with one a tablespoon of orzo and cut brussels sprout and had no taste. There was no salt and pepper on the table, we had to ask as the food needed it. Our friend ordered the lamb and was told by the waited there were 3 chops. When hers arrived she only had 2. She felt the same as I about the lamb dish.
When it came time for desert she and I walked up to the counted to see what they had. She asked for an eclair and the man behind the counted yelled to the young boy to see if they had any in the back. I ordered the creme brûlée and we carried them to the table????? what was that all about.  My desert was very good but the eclair was just ok. The coffee was good.
The concept of this restaurant is unique but it is lacking in so many ways. I try to give a restaurant a second chance but I will not return to this on.
