I was so excited to try this place! I didn't read any reviews prior as not to sway my opinions or thoughts on this location prior to trying it. 

First this place is really expensive for what it is. 3 chicken tenders will cost you nearly $13! 
It does include fries but still pretty expensive! 

The chicken was really nothing special. It was ok but really pretty dry!
The fries and chicken were both greasy and lacked seasoning. 
They have a few fun sauces to try but that's not enough to persuade me to return. 

If you want chicken fingers you are much better off at raising canes or even getting the Tyson frozen chicken fingers from the grocery store. 

I was very disappointed and won't be returning.
