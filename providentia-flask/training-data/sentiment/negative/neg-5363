Took 20 minutes before we got our waters, 15 minutes to even take our order and right as the manager was going to come speak with us he helped another guest and I saw him walk out the front door and I didn't see him for the remainder of service. The table next to us waited 20+ minutes just for a side salad. 
Service was severely slacking
