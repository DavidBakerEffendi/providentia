Me, my boyfriend and his mom went here for dinner last night.  When we order our food my boyfriend order biscuit and gravy with his dinner he had to wait ten minutes after he ate his omelet. When he finely got the biscuits and gravy, the gravy had no flavor to it and it was like water. The biscuits tasted like it was old.
