This was the worse service of a restaurant I have ever had. The waiter waited 20 minutes to take our order for drinks. Then he took another 15-20 minutes to refill my wife's glass of water. The food once it came was NOT worth the price. The portion size was small and the taste of the food was of a 1 star restaurant. The temperature of the food was horrible and so was the waiter. We will NEVER eat here again!
