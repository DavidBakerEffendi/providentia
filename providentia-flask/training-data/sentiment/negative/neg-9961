I was very disappointed in this restaurant. My boyfriend and I were staying at the Radisson, next door, and we were going to order room service. Little did we know that the kitchen closed at 9pm. Who closes their kitchen at 9pm on a Saturday, especially in downtown Cleveland. 

The next day, my boyfriend and I got breakfast there, before we went home. We were also disappointed in that. They only offered a breakfast buffet. I got a bagel and wanted it toasted. The toaster wasn't even working. My boyfriend's food wasn't even hot.
