Oh so bad. The food is horrible, like really really bad. We had five people and each person either hated their meal or would have liked it but it was stone cold. And the drinks are WAY over priced, like LA prices but on Indian School in Phoenix. It wasn't as busy as we expected but the servers just seemed so over worked and like there was no system in place. Our server was super nice but you could tell she was used to the complaints on the food which made me feel bad for her. Seriously one of the more terrible dining experiences I have had in a long time.
