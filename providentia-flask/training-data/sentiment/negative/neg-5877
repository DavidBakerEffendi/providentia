We were ignored for 20 minutes after arriving at our table. Normally I wouldn't be so bothered when I have good conversation at the table but the fact that tables that were seated after us were having their drink orders taken and delivered before I had even seen my waiter was irritating. I had to go find a waitress a total of three times before the hostess decided to just come and take our order herself. Our food came out about fifteen minutes later and our drinks finally came out an additional 10 after that (sadly I actually kept track). No one ever came to refill any of our drinks. The only thing that made me feel a little better is that I wasn't the only one who  was receiving this type of service. Three other tables also had to either get up and find someone to take their orders or find someone to print out their checks because they weren't being attended to. Maybe this was just a bad night for Noodle Asia but as far as I'm concerned with horrible service and mediocre food I don't think I will ever return. 

Nooooo Thanks. I'll get my noodles somewhere else.
