So....they changed their prices. One star because the girl at the counter was sweet. I used to get the grilled chicken pasta for 9.00 and now it's 15.00! I can't afford to go back. I think loyalty supercedes trying to make an extra buck. Be loyal to your customers and they will return. I would have been sympathetic to a dollar more, but that's too high a jump. The pasta is good, but not Olive Garden in California  great. I'll never understand why food tastes better in Cali.
