I ordered the ziti with meat sauce. I had to ask them to take the dish back. No flavor whatsoever. The sauce tasted as if it came from a can and the meat had no flavor. Not worth $20+ on its best day. My minestrone soup was cold when it was brought to the table. I had to ask the manager to remove my $12 cover charge for the soup that I had and a taste of the wine. The service was awful and the food not worth a second try.
