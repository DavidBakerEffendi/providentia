First trip to Cleveland - and decided to come to a historic Cleveland establishment for lunch on our first day.  Ooooops - big mistake to choose this one.

It may be a fine venue for events but run do not walk from the lunch buffet.  It looks fine on their website but all selections were very dry, tasteless, not even lukewarm (and we got there 45 minutes after they opened).  How do you ruin potatoes?  it seemed as if they prepared everything on Monday and let it sit under heat lamps or in warmers until we arrived on Thursday.  Horrible.  The photos on their website of the buffet when you click on 'lunch' are very very deceiving.    

Too bad there aren't negative stars.  But actually they do deserve one for the iced tea (which was very fresh and flavorful and refilled often), the mini-desserts brought to the table (flavorful and chilled) but just two bites (very small) and the service. 

The building is cool and the atmosphere had hotel style tables with sheets tied around the standard hotel chairs (think wedding) with large centerpieces of flowers.  It was like being at an event before the rest of the people arrived.  

There was a sign at the bar that bottles of wine were $3 - so if you wanted to come and share a bottle of wine and maybe have dessert only (which I don't know if they offer) - that would be at least interesting.
