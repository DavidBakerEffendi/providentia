What a waste of time money and calories. $45.00 for an Asian sampler,lobster bisque and a salad. The food was under mediocre, price was kinda high ( the sampler had 6 items on it for over $14.00).  Now I know why we haven't been there in a long time. We wont return to much competition out there to  just be mediocre.
