The only thing at TI worth seeing is the Sirens show out front. This buffet was boring, lacked variety, and the food was of questionable freshness. I know it is a Vegas buffet and not to expect much but I thought it would be better for the price. Now I know why they do not let you see the buffet until you pay. If I had the chance we would have gone elsewhere. The pork ribs were way undercooked, I addressed it and got a guy in a cheap sportcoat to tell me that is how they cook it. They cleared out table twice while we were getting something else. The desserts were offered a bit of redemption, but by the end of the meal , we were just ready to go. For a Strip Casino, this was a poor example.
