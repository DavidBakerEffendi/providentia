I have purchased so many things from baker wee over the years. They used to be my go to for all major events. I got my wedding cake, baby shower cake, birthday cakes, cupcakes etc from them. 
Recently, I ordered a dozen cupcakes for my friends baby shower. I went to pick up the cupcakes and grabbed a few additional pastry's. I SPECIFICALLY asked the woman at the front if the chocolate chip cookies had any peanut products in them or if they had any cross contamination. She told me no and then reassured me by having the owner come over and tell me the same thing. I gave the cookie to my daughter and an hour later we were in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. She is extremely allergic to peanuts and has serious allergic reactions to them. I called them back after to find out what was in the cookies and the girl I spoke with said "the cookies had nothing other than normal ingredients you would find in a cookie, however, there is cross contamination and they sit on the same pan as the peanut butter cookies". My head almost exploded, SHAME ON YOU BAKER WEE. I asked them before I bought the cookie and asked for reassurance over and over and was told by no means was there a chance of peanuts or peanut products in or on the cookie. We will never ever come here again and I will share my story with everyone I know. They put my daughter at risk and didn't even apologize when I called back. This place is a joke.
