We came here on a Friday night after a Target run in the same shopping center. Should have left immediately after entering the restaurant and seeing only 1 table of customers, buy we were hungry and decided to give it a try. Ordered the Pad Thai which had undercooked noodles and was way too sour. The red curry was sweet, and the yellow curry was bland. The "angel wings" (stuffed, fried chicken wings) were the only enjoyable part of the meal. Will avoid this place from now on.
