Even though this place is cheap, you still don't get what you pay for. What a terrible location for this franchise. 

Seafood Soon Tofu- the only seafood in my bowl was an oyster the size of a nickel, a shrimp (with a very dark grey head) that was smaller than the spoon, and a small mussel. All of the seafood tasted unfresh or freezer burned- I didn't eat any of it. The rest of this bowl was just tofu and soup.  

We also ordered the Dumpling Soon Tofu, which came with dumplings and also meat in the bowl- it was just okay. The kimchi here tastes too sour because it's been kept for too long. Yes, kimchi is fermented but the kimchi here is way past it's best before- it tasted spoiled to me. The other two banchan were not very memorable and we did not want refills. 

I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone, very disappointing- I will not be coming back.
