Thai food is definitely one of my favorite foods.  The Pad Thai, Thai Iced Tea, Lemon Grass Chicken... mmm.  When walking in to this place, it's very small and quaint.  I didn't eat inside but I ordered over the phone and took it back to the office.  Looking at the plastic bag full of food, I was super excited like a little girl during Christmas day eyeing on the gifts.  

After tearing the plastic bag open, flipped open the container filled with Pad Thai, spring rolls, fried rice and just dug right in to it.  Needless to say, I was so disappointed.  The Pad Thai had a funny after taste and while eating it made me want to gag.  The fried rice had no flavor to it, and I couldn't even finish it all.  I just picked at it and tried to eat as much as I could but my stomach and nostrils just had enough.  Oh, I forgot, it smelled very bad.  The only thing good about the whole dish was the spring roll and fortune cookie I ate in the end.  

I should've just had Panda Express.  Atleast that tastes so much better.
