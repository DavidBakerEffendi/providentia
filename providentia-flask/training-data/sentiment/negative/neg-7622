The bouncers are the rudest people i have ever met! And honestly completely racist. The bouncer wanted extra money to let us a crowd of brown people in! I left last night so upset because they wouldn't let us back in after a smoke break. Made St. Patty a sour memory. Should have stuck to fionn maccools!
