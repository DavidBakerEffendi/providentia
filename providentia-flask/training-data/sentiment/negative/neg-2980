Very disappointing for several reasons:
1. As soon as I entered the restaurant, a bad odor greeted me. I can't imagine enjoying dinner with that smell.
2. I ordered my food Togo and was shocked by how bad the food was. Their tofu beef soup tasted powdery and it had chewy cubes of beef in it. Their bibimap barely had any meat in it and was nothing special. I could have done a better job.
3. It was expensive for such a poor meal. 

Will not be returning. Save your time and your money and go to Takamatsu instead.
