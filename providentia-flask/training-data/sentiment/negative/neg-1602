There is bad service and then there is no service.
Today on such a nice sunny day I went down to National on 17th the patio was very busy but there was not one person inside.  I decided to sit at a bench in side and 15 mins past almost 20 mins and no one person came over to see was I having any drinks or Lunch. After leaving the place I called to let them know how crap it feels that as a customer you no longer matter.  I spoke to TJ an owner / manager he seemed very nice and assured me in 5 years this has never happened.  Now in the past I have been a big fan of National and have been there many times but now there is so many places to choose from.
