Very disappointed. I saw the prices for the breakfasts and thought they must be really good to charge that much. $10 for eat n park smiley breakfast equivalent w/ sausage gravy on the side. The bacon was old and tough, the  home fries frozen potatoes and the eggs were ok. The sausage gravy was dark brown and not that good. Would not recommend bob Evans. Over priced and poor quality.
