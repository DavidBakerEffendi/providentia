Just plain bad. We went on "opening day," so I could excuse the slow service, but the food was just awful. Chili on the chili burger tasted more like marinara with hints of Hormel. Burger both overcooked and cold at the same time. Husband's breakfast sausage and gravy came out tepid. How do you screw up breakfast? 

Was given no choice of inside or outside seating. Sat outside, no wind break, so everything was flying everywhere. No manager came by to check on us, and saw the server four times: once with drinks, once with a refill 30 minutes after that, once with food, once with a check. 

Strip prices for dorm room quality food. Skip skip skip and go ANYWHERE else in Town Square. Yardhouse, fantastic. Claim Jumper, very good. Brio happy hour, excellent. This place? Crap. Avoid.
