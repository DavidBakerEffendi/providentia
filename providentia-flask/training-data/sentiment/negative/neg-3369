Horrible experience here. I called several times leading up to out get together and I was told there was no way to make a reservation - I had 14 people in my party. This was suppose to be a SURPRISE get together for my boyfriends 35th birthday. He LOVES topgolf- one of the friends in the party agreed to get there at 345 to put our name in. She had never been to topgolf before and no one explained to her the process. She put our name down and requested two bays around 345 and she was quoted 30 minutes. This was perfect because every one was arriving around 4. We waited until 455 to be sat. UNREAL. We went up to the counter several times to check on the status of our group and the girl kept telling us ten more minutes. Absolutely unacceptable - just be honest and quote and hour and 15. We had dinner reservations at 730 25 minutes away and didn't start golfing until 500. When we were sat, we were told to quickly start so that we could receive the $35 an hour rate instead of the $45. Super unpleasant experience. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP. It was a nightmare.
