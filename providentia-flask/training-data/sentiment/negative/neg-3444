This is the worst experience I have for Korean food. I'm from the Bay Area, CA and they do not take over an hour to prep all our food. 

I went there to have lunch. The restaurant was empty and there werent many people (only about two people in each three tables). We ordered Seafood Pancake, Tofu Soup, and Seafood fried rice. We ordered the pancake for appetizers first and that took a good 30 mins. Seafood pancake shouldn't take that long especially when there weren't that much in the large cake like pancake. Then we waited another 30 mins or more for our other food. While we wait, new customers come in and got their food before us. Either they have their food for lunch prepped or they don't prepare at all, it was not fair to us. The food took so long that we asked for it to go since it passed the 40 mins. Overall it took about an hour and a half wait...

The waittress was sweet but she has some issues with serving and looked nervous. There wasn't a lot of staff and it was very disorganized. 

Overall, I don't understand the organization of the service and why it takes so long. The food is decent but service makes up this restaurant not good. I'm not coming back unless their reviews gotten better.
