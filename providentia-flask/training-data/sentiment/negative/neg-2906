Nice hotel, horrible buffet!! Barely gets a star! All the food was cold and not fresh. The only decent tasting things were the pasta bar (lobster ravoli), some of the sushi rolls, the orange chicken and the shrimp noodle soup. Everything else was very ehhh - pho soup tasted like disinfectant, the "mexican food" was not tasty, the salads were old and the desserts were bland.  You would think in a nice hotel the buffet would be good but apparently not. I actually think that Hometown buffet or Sizzler is better!  Even with a two for one, I don't think this place is worth it.
