I ate lunch here today and was completely disappointed.  I ordered Renee's lunch special.  It included soup, sandwich, and salad.  The soup was tortilla.   It was like some kind of much.  It was barely warm. The taste was awful.  The chicken salad  sandwich had almonds and way too much mayonnaise.    Besides that buttered bread was on the sandwich.  Nothing in the description said the toast would be buttered.  The salad was saturated with the dressing.  Even the unsweetened tea tasted old. My waiter was Mr. positive but didn't wait on me or ask me if everything  was OK.  He was concerned that my tooth picks that held the sandwich together was taken apart.  I told him that I didn't like butter all over my bread.  He said, "OK, just wanted to be sure that they didn't leave it that way."   I would expect that he should have asked me if I wanted bread without the butter but he didn't and got away so fast that I couldn't ask him.  He never came back to ask me if I needed tea or anything. The soup was so bad I didn't eat it at all.  I ate the salad or there would be no lunch. When he picked  up my plate, he said, I guess this means that you have no room for cheesecake.  I guess he said that because most of the food was still on my plate. Once again he sped off not given me a chance to tell him that the soup was awful.  Very disappointing.
