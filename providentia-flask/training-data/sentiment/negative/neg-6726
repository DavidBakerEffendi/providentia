From a Top Chef Master, I expect much more.  This was a horrible experience as we came here for Restaurant Week.

We got off to a dreaded start where it took almost half an hour to get our wine out.   The only good thing RM did well was ship out some of the best Mattaki (BC), Potters Moon (RI), and Blupoint (NY) oysters.   This would have been perfect if you brought the wine before we could enjoy these oysters.  We continued to sit for a good 15 minutes before they could locate the bottle of Bordeaux.

The clam chowder was pretty flat.  I honestly enjoyed the clam chowder from the M Resort buffet.  You'd expect much more from a world class Top Chef master, right?

Next, we had the diver scallops with black bean sauce.  The scallops were nothing special and lacked seasoning.  All of the food came out rushed since they did not time the delivery with the delayed wine.  

Last, our waiter even knew he did a shitty job.  He comp'ed us 2 coffees and 2 additional glasses of wine, but honestly they could have done more since everything they did was wrong.  

If you're going to experience fine dining on the strip, do not go here.  I take some responsibility for bypassing the 3-3.5 star rating I saw.  I was just hoping these Yelp reviewers were harsh but they were overly generous with their ratings.  

Do not come here.   I wasted my money and could have had my last Restaurant Week experience anywhere else.
