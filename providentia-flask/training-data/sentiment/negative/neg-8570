I LOVE Jimmy and Joe's pizza, and we order almost every week... This time was a HUGE FAIL. The pizza was way undercooked, half toppings we're on about 2/3 of the pizza. It doesn't even taste very good... Not sure what happened, but I'm severely disappointed and will be sticking to the other location indefinitely. :(
