Enjoyed the food but definitely needs some management upgrades. First thing, I eat alfresco often and am aware of the nature that may want what you have.

Sat outside next to the busing tray. The birds knew just what to wait for. My husband asked if they could clear it away since the birds were buzzing his head to get to the leftover food, he was told sure. After another 10 minutes and watching the birds fly over and land on fresh water and the pitcher to refill glasses with so called fresh water I got up and went inside and spoke to the hostess. She said she would find someone (heard that before) and pointed me in the direction of the manager....which happened to be the person my husband spoke to. The manager covered up the food with napkins and more food proceeded to be put on top. FINALLY someone removed it and the whole dance started again. Wynn is suppose to be first class, not this restaurant, reminds me of seagulls attacking you at McDonalds on the boardwalk for fries. Someone needs to put a covered busing holder out there or get the staff to bus to the inside. I'm sure they can design a bird proof dirty dish cart or closet but looks like Wynn doesn't care. I've even been to outdoor dives that have better trash cans that deter birds. For a $100 breakfast for 3 I think they should be able to do better. 

If you choose this place and sit outdoors stay away from the back by the busing table.
