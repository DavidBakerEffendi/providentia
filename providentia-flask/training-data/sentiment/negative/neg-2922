Sunday of Memorial Day wkd, 730pm. Plan B after Bacchanal at Caesar's gave us a 2-hr wait.

The Buffet at Bellagio has soooo fallen off it's allure and pedestal of being one of the top, high-end buffets in Vegas of years ago. The first sign was that we (party of 2) only had to wait 15 minutes.

Their carving station meats were not plentiful and selective. Meats did not taste all that good. Ribs were dry. Steaks were dry. Turkey tasted like cardboard.

Turkey gravy was super salty. 

One of the carvers took his sweet @ss time slicing every single piece of prime rib and turkey. Makes for an even longer wait! arghhh!

The layout is horrible. 

Not much main dish selection. 

Food was very tasteless.

Everything seemed so "bulk cafeteria" made.

They close at 1030, but at 9pm, the dessert station was "all out of chocolate covered strawberries". So lame.

Desserts did not taste good. The cheesecake was so bad. Didn't even have any chocolate cake selections!

A sign of a buffet that is not high-end? When the ice cream station is NOT manned by a human being. More of a sign that a buffet is actually low-end? When the ice cream station is a crappy soft-serve, manual, help-yourself dispenser! This is a severe contrast to the manned, well-decorated, well-presented gelato stations at the Rio Carnival, the Aria Buffet, the Bacchanal, etc.

To top things off, it was a "holiday weekend", so they charged "holiday prices". $47.99+tax pp. Yet, the selection, the quality, and the experience was barely better than that of cross of Hometown Buffet and Souplantation!

Sorry Bellagio Buffet. Never again until you renovate, reinvent, and rejuvenate!
