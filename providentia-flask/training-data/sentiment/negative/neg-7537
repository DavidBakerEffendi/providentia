My girlfriend and I were in Cleveland from West Virginia for the Browns game a few weekends ago and I was very excited to check this spot out. I had done my research and clearly this was the place to eat. I cant say that it lived up to my expectations. First off, we were charged a cover to come in and eat, $5 for each of us. I understand that a band was going to be playing later, but I explained that we were eating and leaving. They still charged us. Fact is that I do not know my way around the city and was starving after having not eaten in hours. So, we dealt with this ridiculous BS and ate there anyways. Our table and seat were filthy. Fine Ill deal with that as well as long as the food is as great as they say. That didnt even happen. The dogs themselves were fine, but the toppings on mine were not fresh and really just underwhelmed. Maybe it was just an off night, but when coupled with the door charge and dirty seats ad long wait, this was a complete bus. A damn shame as excited as I was and for my first time in Cleveland as an adult.
