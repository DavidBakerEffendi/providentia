Not worth it even if it's cheap.

1. First impression - Walked in at noon for lunch and first thing our group noticed was the weird smell that the restaurant had.. it smelled like we entered a public washroom...
2. Food - Ramen was too soft, soup was tasteless and very watery, shrimp was tasteless, egg was pretty much hard boiled. Basically the food was far from a decent ramen. 
3. Service - I ordered the shrimp Wonton ramen but i got the shrimp ramen instead. I never bothered to ask for the fix because we waited for a good 20 min for 3 ramen and there were only 2 tables including us at that moment. I didn't feel like it was worth the wait.
                  - We tried to get the waitress attention by waving our arms for a good 5 minutes. We thought the waitress was busy as she was staring at the counter top but she slowly lifted her arm and her cell phone was in her hand. She ignored us cause she was busy on her phone when there was only 2 tables in the restaurant.
                  - We asked for separate bills but that took another 2 min for her to ask another staff at the back to let it us know its not doable. She's not well trained at all and she doesn't know the first thing about being a waitress... attentiveness.
                 - She gave us change and when she did, she slipped the change out of the change plate and it almost fell over the counter top toward my friend and I. 

Overall, food was terrible, atmosphere was terrible and service was HORRIFIC.

You would only go here if you desperately want something to stuff your stomach as they compensate their lack of flavour and taste in their food by increasing the portion of their ramen.
