They recently re-opened after remodeling and it is not the same. I ordered the same thing that I have ordered numerous times, general tsao chicken. It used to be large, juicy, breaded chicken breast. Now it is small pieces of chicken with no breading and fried until it is hard and dry. 
Their fried rice used to be to die for. Fluffy rice that was full of vegetables and large hunks of pork. Now it is dry and flavorless. 
My soup and egg roll were both cold. 
I asked for ice tea and was told they didn't have any, but then served me hot tea. So I made my own. I guess making ice tea is too complicated for this new service team. 
I tried to provide direct feedback but they did not want to hear about it. 
Save yourself time and money and do not go there.
