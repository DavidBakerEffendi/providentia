I rarely leave reviews, but when I'm treated as poorly as I was tonight, I feel my experience should be shared. 

My family came in tonight and asked for a table for 8. We were led to a table made for 6 and watched as an employee moved two chairs to the end of the table (the other end of the table was against the sushi conveyer belt). These two chairs were literally touching the chairs at the end of the long sides of the table, leaving absolutely no place to put your legs. 

So I said to the employee, "Um, if you set up the chairs like this, where should we put our legs?  Is there a better solution for a table of 8?"  He asked me to hold on and went to speak to someone else. 

Moments later, an older woman came over to us with a very aggressive attitude and said, "Ma'am, if you don't like our service, you don't have to eat here,".  I was completely taken aback by her approach and tried to explain that I was only asking if there was a better set-up for our party. She continued to berate me, making fun of my facial expression and telling me that this set-up was the only way to seat 8.  I told her I didn't have any issue with the set-up if it was the best they could do...I was honestly just asking. She walked away and we sat down.  Then the woman approached our table *again* and told us that we didn't need to stay if we didn't like their service. 

A restaurant telling me twice that they don't need my patronage is enough for them to lose my business forever, so we left. I will never - EVER - set foot in that restaurant again.
