I think the other reviewers were eating at another restaurant of the same name. This place is awful. I wanted a salad and iced tea for lunch. The tea that came was passion fruit not black tea and the waiter did not inform me of that. The salad was OK but the dressing was very spicy. Again no info on menu or from waiter. The noise level even at lunch was deafening. Recorded music like Coldplay very loud. I asked to be moved away from 
speakers or to turn it down. No response. The wait staff was inattentive. Save your money. The arrogant butcher deserves it's unfortunate choice of names.
