If I could give them negative stars I would. I've been a supervisor for customer care at a retail establishment for 10 years and have never been treated so badly. I was called names, never asked if I wanted anything, talked obscenities about at the bar to the point that I couldn't hear!!!! Went up and requested service, told me to get a bartender that I never saw. DO NOT GO here
