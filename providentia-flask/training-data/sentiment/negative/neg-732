First time customer.  Ordered a cheesesteak sandwich.  Sitting next door at the Sleepy Dog Brewery while I'm eagerly digging into this sammich and three bites in im greeted with a  L O N G black hair intertwined in the beef.  I'm in disbelief thinking it's just a fiberous gristle from the beef as I pull it out I realize it's not cow.  I went back & demanded a full refund.  Sorry, forgot to take a pic.
