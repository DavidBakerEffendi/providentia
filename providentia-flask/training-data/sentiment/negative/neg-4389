I've been wanting to go eat at this place for a long time, so I was ecstatic when my sister took me to brunch one morning. After waiting 20 minutes to get our order taken we finally went ahead and got the steak, seemed fitting. 

There were many things wrong with our plate, the steak looked burned but they tasted fine so we didn't send it back. After finishing our meals we headed out and we ended up getting food poisoning!!! It was horrendous. The place let me down. Even after I was told not to go I gave it a chance but was disappointed. I will never go back.
