COCKROACHES!!!!  Ick Ick ick!!!

Do not know why I liked this place so much before. Check out the health ratings on this place. They have this complete cycle of bad reviews over and over and over. Won't ever go back!!!

BLD...well

It is best for breakfast!!!! Lunch is ok. I'd skip the dinner. 

Fresh squeezed juice takes so long it is like they picked the oranges right from the trees. Should I still eat here?

Mmmm dogs, dog pee and flies...that sums up the patio. Wonder if they ever hose the place down. Oh the flies. But should I still eat here?

Eating inside...well all those flies come in too. But should I still eat here. 

Food is very over priced....but it is so delicious. Should I still eat here?

Did I mention the cockroaches and the state health ratings? ICK, ICK, ICK!!!
