First time eating here, and I will not go back. The wait wasn't long, I'll give them that. But the food was yuck, I had pieces of chicken that wasn't done. My fries were limp. When they called my name I went to get my food, and they had to bag it because it was to go and some how they missed that. Went to bag my fries, and they were bagged with out putting them in a  take out container. I told them that was gross to have fries in a bag like that in the open. I was told that was company policy, still gross. So the manager again explained it was policy, I said ok. But she did put them in a carry out box. The best part of my meal was the ranch dressing that came with the chicken, and I had to pay almost a dollar for an extra one. Needless to say, but I will not be going back for half fried chicken and limp fries. Yuck and gross.
