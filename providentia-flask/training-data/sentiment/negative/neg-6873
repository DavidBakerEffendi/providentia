Went for lunch with co-workers. I had the Chicago dog and onion rings with a drink. Dog was excellent, rings not so much. Incredibly greasy - even too much for rings. Unfortunately my co-worker had a disasterous Retro Burger. There was a 9" or so brown, curly hair found in the MIDDLE of her burger. 

We observed a female employee with shoulder-length, brown, curly hair; not tied back or in a hair net, cooking the food. This is gross, unsanitary, and bad restaurant management.

According to www.fda.gov - retail food protection - Chapter 2-402.11: " (A) Food employees shall wear hair restraints such as hats, hair coverings or nets, beard restraints, and clothing that covers body hair, that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed FOOD; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles. 

It was asked that the burger be re-made, and yet again, the same female employee was cooking as before. The practice of employee hygiene is a basic essential of running a restaurant. Shame on the owner for not being aware of day-to-day operations with his/her employee(s). 

I will not be going back, nor recommending this establishment.
