I would give zero stars if possible... 100% due to the terrible customer service. When I asked to speak to the manager, I was informed that the rude person I was speaking to was the manager. My guess is that this location is not a top performer. There are many great burger options in North Scottsdale. Don't go to this one unless you want to be treated poorly.
