-1 for the handful of gnats hovering above our table 
-1 for the dingy smell inside the restaurant
-1 for the dirty cloth napkins
-2 for the awful tasting tacos ("lobster" and chorizo con pappas)* 
-1 for the practically virgin banana colada

* lobster is in quotes because i highly doubt it was real lobster. it tasted more like what imitation krab is to real crab. oddly crunchy, chewy and trasparent. 

i would've left if i were on my own, but i was with two friends that wanted to try it out and we had a groupon. personally, i never plan on setting foot in this place again. i want to gag just thinking about it!
