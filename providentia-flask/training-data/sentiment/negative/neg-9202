Tried to place an order over the phone. Guy on the other side was saying stuff I didn't understand. After a good thirty seconds of being unable to communicate, he asks, "Do you speak Arabic?" I said, "no." He hangs up. 

I go into the restaurant. Everyone there was speaking Arabic. No one helped me. It's a shame. Places like these are usually very friendly to all customers. I'll simply go to those places next time.
