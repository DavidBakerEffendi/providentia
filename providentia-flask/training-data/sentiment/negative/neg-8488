I cannot believe this place... I stayed here with some friends this past Memorial Day Weekend. I was super excited when I booked a Bella Suite a couple months back for the trip but let me just say on the drive back to San Diego I wish I had never done so... regretted it beyond belief!

Check-in was a breeze after staff directed me upstairs to a less busy lobby. They gave me some coupons but the only one I used was the "Admit 4" to LAVO @ The Palazzo. 

The room was beautiful. We actually fit 19 people in that suite... pretty amazing but you can bet it was uncomfortable. This wasn't the source of my distress, however. 

On my way back to San Diego I checked my bank statement only to realize they had charged me $250 EXTRA. Why??? Did they tell me why?  I had to stay on hold with customer service for more than an hour. They made up some report about how the room was so damaged that they had to hire special cleaners that had to work for hours. They said that they couldn't give the room to customers and that they were fully booked that weekend. STOP YOUR NONSENSE VENETIAN!

Don't try to play me and my wallet. I am not amused! You were not worth the inconvenience. Of the the four different employees I spoke to at Customer Service only one was accommodating, the others were outright rude and accusatory.
