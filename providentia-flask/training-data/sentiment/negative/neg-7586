I wish I could give a negative star review! It's my husbands birthday and he didn't want to go in and sit inside the so we ordered the curb side to-go. Ordered two meals totaling $37 and some change...cool. We get home 20 min away to find out his food is wrong. He tried to be a good sport about it. He ordered the Louisiana steak medium rare.. after taking a bite of the Mac and cheese and finding it unsatisfactory me moved on to the WRONG steak. Even tho it was the wrong steak he was going to eat it anyways until he cut it and it was well done. So I had to drive 20 min back to the restaurant for them to replace his steak, I asked for the Mac and cheese to be replaced by the grilled asparagus. (I even brought the old food back) I was told it was $1.40 up-charge to change the side on a meal that was incorrect that I had to drive back and get! A manager who was already clocked out and getting ready to leave happened to stop to talk to me... I said they could easily comp $1.40 since I wasn't asking for both meals free or even his wrong one... so by the time I go home to eat with him my food would now be cold! All I got was a "oh I'm sorry don't worry about the $1.40 they didn't know they had messed the food up." My point is I drove 20 min back for them to fix my husbands birthday dinner, eat my food cold... what a great birthday dinner experience! We will never return to this location EVER again! I have been a General Manager at a restaurant before and that's not how you handle situations... I'm glad at least one of us gets a hot meal.. even if I spent 20 min each way driving... TWICE for to be compensated for our food, time, or gas   I tip my hat to you o Charlie's on giving out the worst experience I have had at a restaurant.
