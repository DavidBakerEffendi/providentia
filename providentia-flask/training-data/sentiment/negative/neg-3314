The young man who working the drive-thru right NOW SUCKS!!!! His attitude is horrible. Didn't get my order correctly. I was missing 2 tacos.  I checked my bag and I asked him did he put extra Hot sauce in the bag and he looked me in my face, lied and said YES. Not one sauce in the bag before then So I said "there's not one Hot sauce in this bag dude". Oh then he gives me 4. I asked for 4 more......You know one for each taco????? and he acted as if he didn't hear me. Plus all of my cinnamon twist were scattered at the bottom of my bag. NOT HAPPY!!!!!!
