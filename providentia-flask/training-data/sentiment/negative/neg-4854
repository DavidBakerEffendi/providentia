This is the worst place I've ever been to whether for breakfast ore brunch, and they have alot of nerve accepting money from anyone. I have been reading various reviews on this dump and I can't believe anyone could give it more than one star and that being that you have to give one star to post a review.maybe they're drinks are good but the food is disgusting. To pay close to $9 for an over cooked waffle that comes with a blob of melted margarine, yuck, not even real butter or even a choice of which one you want. The waffle pizza is soggy, things are quickly heated so they're cold and cheese doesn't appear to new real cheese, the eggs like rubber, the bacon was paper thin and precooked then reheated, so disgusting, then they serve all that disgust on the cheapest paper plates, not even matching our of good quality, everything soaks right through and years before you cam finish the junk they serve you, and to pay top dollar to get your own food, please. The tables were dirty  and sticky, we had empty cans of soda at the end of our table that was there when we sat down and still there when we left though we asked them to clean the table. The place smelled horrible, no ventilation and looked dirty. The Styrofoam cups was a nice touch for water. OMG, HORRIBLE, horrendous service and food, but they were nice, lol, that's a joke.
