Christy, the front of the house manager at 7pm on Wednesday has horrible decision making skills and whomever hired her needs to recheck their hiring procedures. 

I had a pickup for a flat iron steak and a large chopped chicken salad. The order came up and was ready to be bagged. Another customer appeared and ordered a chopped chicken salad. Christy came over and spilt up my order and gave my salad to the guy that just came in. What kind of stupid idea is that?. Not only does that screw up the workflow of the cook who now has to double time to get a chopped chicken salad out but the other half of my order, a flat iron steak, had to sit and get cold while the salad is being rushed which also puts a strain on the quality of the salad from forcing it out. 

No apologies. I even pointed that out and she just shrugged me off. 

If I was the manager and saw that, she would be fired on the spot. It was a blatant disregard for me, the guest and the productivity of the employees. And to knowingly do it in plain sight. Horrible. 

She has a really bad attitude and clearly can't cope with the business and should step down.
