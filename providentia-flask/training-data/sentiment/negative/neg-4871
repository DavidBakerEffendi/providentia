Very unpleasant staff. When I questioned why price was 17.99 yesterday and now 30 today, cashier rolled her eyes and in an exasperated tone informed me that weekend brunch was more. Ok. Try posting prices and we won't have to ask!  Then trying to get seated with dozens of empty tables took 15 min of waiting for 5 staff members ambling around like mindless zombies to finally decide to seat people. Then getting served cold "hot" tea by a clearly confused waiter/waitress (? - still not really sure what they were and I'm a physician). I think next time I need to just grab a croissant elsewhere
