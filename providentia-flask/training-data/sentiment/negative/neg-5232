My husband and I were excited to try Ryu but were sadly disappointed. We opted for sushi (not teppanyaki) based on the reviews. It was still happy hour so we got four different rolls - NONE of which were special. 

The sushi was subpar at best.

1 star was also for the TERRIBLE service. The restaurant was pretty empty and the server was completely inattentive. It was almost a joke.
