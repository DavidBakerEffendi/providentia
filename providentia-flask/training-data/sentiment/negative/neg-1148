Food is disgusting!!! I ordered a BLT and it took 30 mins to recieve it when it did come it came with rotten tomatoes on it!! Tomatoes that smell of urine and have white mold on them.  Very disgusting restraunt, I do not forsee this place staying in buisness very long just like the last three food places that tried to establish here.
