BOY COTT.

I hope the douche bag owner goes to hell.

The food isn't amazing. it's alright. I've been there so many times and the owner has always been rude to me ( i think now it might be a racist thing) despite the fact that i tend to order more than normal (i like take away for lunch the next day) and tip high. 

One day, i placed an order for pick up that was meant for 10 ppl. I spent some good coin. When i went thereto pick up i asked him for hot sauce. He gave me two measly packets. I asked for more given the number of ppl. He gave me shit for asking for more going into his costs. I'm sorry but i don't see how two packets is enough for an order for 10 ppl, and then he tried to charge me 25cents a packet. I was not being unreasonable in any way. I just hate cheap people and i'm done with this place. It's an analogy and tells you how he must manage his kitchen. 

Based on this experience, i don't trust his food. He'll do anything to save a buck or two. 

Oh and on a few occasions, i've seen him yell at his staff pretty bad.

Now that you've read this story, keep an eye out for yourself and let me know what you experience.
