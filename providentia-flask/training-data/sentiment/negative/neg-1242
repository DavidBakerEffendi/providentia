I stopped in for a take out order for a group of friends. I decided to stop by this location as it was convenient for my drive. From my experiences with Ten Rens, this location definitely felt subpar to other locations. The take out menu definitely lacked the options and variety from the menu of other locations. I come to Ten Rens because I've known then to have a decent bold flavours for their drinks despite a premium pricing model. What I found was that there was hardly any grass jelly in my milk tea that came with it. It almost felt like it was scrapped from the bottom of the barrel. Not only that, I noticed that the drinks were not even topped up, some only about 75% full, and the rest was empty foam. Mind you, they are located a high school, so perhaps the quality toppled to the floor from stress dealing with students, but I came on a quiet weekend night. For the price I paid, plus the 10-15 minute I waited for my order, I would definitely opt for other nearby locations unless I truly have no other options.
