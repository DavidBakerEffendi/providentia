First of all, the woman who answered the phone on 9/1/16 at around noon was extremely rude and had not an ounce of customer service in her voice for the price you pay for this expensive pizza. She told me to hold, she didn't ask, that's very annoying. And then after I ordered she told me they don't deliver until after 5pm? 

I've ordered this expensive pizza from here several times before and they delivered. And I'm positive it wasn't after 5pm. If that's the case now, they should also put it on their menu. Their menu clearly says "Delivery."

Just another inconvenience from a family owned business, which I try to give business to, who also loves price gouging. I think I'll stick to chains from now on.

Oh and on a previous delivery order they didn't bring me my Eegee - so the delivery driver said he would credit me some points on some rewards program they have. I'll pass on that, I'll take my money back because I won't be back here.
