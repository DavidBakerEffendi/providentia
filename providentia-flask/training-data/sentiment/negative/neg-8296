Service was absolutely horrible.  

We came for lunch. Made an order using their iPad.

At first we received items that we hadn't ordered like soup or such. And we told the waiter and he simply said " just eat it"

We just ignored that and told him we won't eat it and don't want to be charged for leaving it.

Then as we waited a whole bunch of rolls came in but none of which we ordered!!!

They just threw random food on our table and thought we'd eat just about anything they gave us.
