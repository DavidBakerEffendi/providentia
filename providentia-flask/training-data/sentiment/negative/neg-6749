Worst place to go if you really want to eat and enjoy......bad food complimented with worst service possible in this world. Ambiance is ok ok kinds......only good thing is it is not one of those restaurants which looks like rat holes. Staff is not at all courteous.......and it looks like they don't know how to smile to your customers....looks like they are only paid to serve...not to treat their customers well.      
We orders some dishes and 4 gobi paranthas.....they came back after 10 mins informing us that they are out of flour and so can serve only 3....we said okay.......but were shocked to hear such an excuse!! Anyhow...that was not the end....when they actually brought food, they told us that they don't even have a single so they chose for us to bring plain naan (not even asking us or apologizing)!!  Wait....that was not the end too!! When they brought the check...it was having an extra beer which we never ordered...and when I pointed this out to the owner...he behaved as if I had done a crime pointing this out....he said how can you blame us like this....we put only those things that we ordered...and refused pointblank to accept the mistake.
Overall...a strict no no for this place.....
