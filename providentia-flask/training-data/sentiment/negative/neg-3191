Although the interior design is appointed in multiple natural stones, and the facility is very impressive - the food - and the prices are not. 

My party of five adults and three children visited this place for the first time on Sunday April 26th, 2015. 

READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY - THREE OUT OF THE FIVE ADULTS (myself included) GOT SICK FROM EATING THE SEA FOOD !!!!! 

At close to $20 dollars a head for Sunday lunch - This added to the negative marks. 

Then - to add insult to injury - we were asked by our server if we would like to have some "complimentary lobster" - which turned out to be inedible cuttings from crab in some "kind of red sauce" - no claws or tails as I had been anticipating..... 

BUT wait - there's more: 

We were told (by our hostess when we first arrived) that they had lamb, but sadly, all that was on the serving line where the "lamb" was supposed to be - was beef (labeled "lamb").....  this got this entire disaster to a new height of "adding insult to injury" 

So much for looking forward to having "Lobster" and "Lamb"  

I do sincerely wish that I had had a better first time at Jogoya - as their entire staff DID try to make our dining experience a very pleasant one (aside from the Lamb and Lobster debacle).  

Sorry guys -after our party dropped over $130 bucks on lunch - I'd at least like to NOT have gotten SICK from eating there...... Won't be back :-(
