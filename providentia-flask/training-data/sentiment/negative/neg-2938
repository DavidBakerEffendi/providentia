The Venetian used to be my favorite hotel up until today. I just found previous stuff from the last guest guest that stayed in our room. I'm not racist in any way but I can guarantee you there are Chinese 100 There was not enough amenities for the price of the room. I highly recommend other hotels on the strip for the same price. I came here for my 29th birthday and I was very disappointed. I just wish they would go through the room a little bit more thoroughly before letting other guests stay in the room and finding their stuff.
