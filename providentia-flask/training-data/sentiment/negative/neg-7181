Despite reading all the "positive" reviews of this restaurant,  decided to try it out.   A couple of good things - the reader's reviews are highly accurate and reliable, except for the ones that rated this restaurant with four or five stars.   And it seems that after being in business for more time and overcoming opening issues, they have managed to be very consistent as to food (not in a good way)....

Facilities are interesting and creative; service was for the most part, bordering on the overly attentive, as two waitresses are assigned to the table.  They were friendly and generally informative (in that sort of I don't go out to places like this much, but Beso seems like a cool restaurant........).

Food was mediocre at best - guacamole must have been made days before and lacked any freshness; paella tasted like paste, chicken was dry, and lobster was mushy; ceviche was tasted fishy.   All of this culminated in massive worries about waking up with food poisoning the next day which fortunately, didn't occur.  That said, the food wasn't worth the price or our effort to go there, and there are many better places in Las Vegas to try.

And btw - if you like martinis with blue cheese olives, they list a very tasty one on the menu - but beware if you order three or more olives for this $15 martini - they will charge you $3 per each additional olive over 2.......   And what's with pushing the wine - three times asked if we wanted wine.   Given the cuisine here, seems like selling sake in a taco restaurant.

Not recommended, and definitely not returning.   Even if Eva shows up....
