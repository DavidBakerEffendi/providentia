Well, I found a "love letter" from the Silverton casino security saying that 'RVs are not allowed to camp over night in the parking lot.' Of course I have a pic of the "love letter".  We were planning on leaving that night ANYWAY.  My goodness, no love for RVers.  I mean I WAS in the casino spending money (which of course they love).  I did some minor gambling AND went to the buffet. I have my receipts to prove it!!! :/  I guess they want people to reserve a room in order to stay in the parking lot overnight...  I was only here for a few hours SPENDING MONEY why would I book a room just so I can have my RV in the lot for a few hours.  I will definitely let my fellow RVers know to steer clear of the Silverton casino.  And that really sucks because Bass Pro is right there... You guys suck Silverton casino, but thanks anyway.
