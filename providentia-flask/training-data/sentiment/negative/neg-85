I stopped to get lunch.  I saw the more healthy menu and elected to try 2 of the healthy enchiladas.  One was spinach and one was chicken.  I had a difficult time finding the spinach. The sauce was incredibly awful. The waitress was terrific. She checked on me to ask how I liked the entree. I told I really didn't like it at all. She looked at the spinach enchilada and said,"That is terrible."  She insisted on getting me something different. There was literally one tiny bite of spinach and the rest was just corn tortilla.  She ended up bringing me a taco salad.  It was OK.  What is interesting is I believe it was a manager that brought me my food and I asked him, what is this that I ordered? I opened up the enchilada and he had to see that my enchilada was just a corn tortilla.  He just kept on walking.  I won't stop in here again.  Again the waitress was terrific.
