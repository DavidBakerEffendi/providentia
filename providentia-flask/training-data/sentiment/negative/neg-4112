Definitely was a childhood favorite! Haven't been in years! My experience here was horrible! I went in a Monday witch I guess kids get to eat for 99 cents. Girl at the cashier completely over charged me then did a return not handing me my whole  entire amount of money needed to be returned back...  was confused but  I work in retail so was understanding her. She should of handed me my return money then re rang my kids 99 cent meals! She had a horrible attitude which I get end of night everyone has their days! Went to take my kids to the restroom..... ummm can we just say when was the last time you dusted your vents??????? Fucking disgusting!!!!! This is a restaurant! It should be smelling like sanitizer and bleach in your f****** bathroom! Obviously they clearly do not clean up and maintenance the restaurant very well! I do not think I will ever come again thanks for ruining my childhood favorite! :(
