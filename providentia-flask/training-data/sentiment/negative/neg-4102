A simple meal ruined. I just ordered a bacon egg and cheese. I wasn't given an option on to what bread is like. Walked to the register and was told $8.64!!  A $9 BEC!!! Now the kicker, inedible, the bacon was rubber they thought they were doing a favor by piling it on. At a normal place where the bacon is good, fine otherwise gross. WASTE OF MONEY.
