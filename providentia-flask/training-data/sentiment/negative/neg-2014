The food is okay, but omgosh the service...... went here twice and will never be back. 

The first time I went, it took 20 minutes from the time I was seated until someone came to take my order. I didn't time it, but the rest of the service was excruciatingly slow as well. 

Today's visit? The same horrible server (female with a ton of makeup, not the Asian girl) screwed up my check. She WAY over charged me for my lunch. When I asked for a new check because the amount was wrong, she argued back that it was correct. So I did the math for her, rounding up: 
$9 (Panang curry chicken lunch) + $8 (chicken satay) + $3 (Thai tea) = $20 plus tax, but she charged me $38.75. I was dining alone, did she really think that was correct?!? So she fixed the check, but then I tried to pay and they didn't have any change. I should have just walked, but I turned my purse inside out to get the payment, informed her I won't be back, and left. 

The food is not the issue here. Please hire competent employees.
