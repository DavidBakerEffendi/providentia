Absolutely the worst service we have had in a long time.  The lady that was taking care of us completely ignored us and it took forever.  She was with a booth across from ours who must of been family or friends and proceeded to sit down with them and speak non stop to Spanish with them for over an hour.  When I tried to get her attention for another round of drinks I was given a dirty look and she went right back to talking to them.  We love the food here but she even got that wrong.  I have a food allergy and she did not let the kitchen know.  I went without eating because of her ignorance.  WE WILL NOT BE BACK!!!
