We ordered 1 pizza and bread... Placed the order at 6:28 pm.. I am writing this review at 8:15 pm and our pizza is still NOT here... I called at 8:00pm and asked about our food...the girl who answered the phone could care less..she was rude, and when I told her that 2 hours for 1 pizza was ridiculous, she agreed and then stated it isn't their fault...she offered a 10% discount next time..

At 8 :15, as I'm typing this, I called to cancel the order...I was immediately placed on hold...

8:20pm (still on hold) the pizza has finally arrived and sadly, it is cold and soggy...bread is cold and hard.... 

We will never order delivery here again..
