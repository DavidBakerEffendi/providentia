I usually get bad service here but today was the worst. I decided I wanted some Asian food so I went by the drive thru because I didn't felt like getting out, when I ordered they told me that the teriyaki chicken was going to take 6 minutes so I told them that was fine. After paying they asked me if I could go wait to the front because they had a line and I said that they did the same thing to me last time and that I never got my food I had to go in and get it. They assured me that it would not happen again, so I said fine I'll go to the front. I waited for 15 minutes and I never got my food when I went inside to see what was going on they told me they gave the last of the chicken to someone on the drive thru and I had to wait again. At this point I was upset and I complained and asked for a refund but the manager did not cared or apologized. This is the worst I been to.
