This place gives me super powers - invisibility! Where else can you sit for 15 minutes, not be acknowledged, have two servers and one manager walk within 15 feet, and never  acknowledge that you exist or might thirsty.

The best part? I gain this super power on nearly every visit.

I really can't understand how this place stays in business. I really try to patronize it here, but they certainly don't respect their customers.
