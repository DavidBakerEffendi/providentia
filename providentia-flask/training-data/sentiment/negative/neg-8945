I noticed when this place opened because I love great BBQ and the fixins. I was REALLY disappointed. for  $14 and some change I tried the Brisket sandwich with Cole slaw, cornbread and a drink. 2.25 for a med sided drink is high-even with free refills. the sweet and mild BBQ sauce was tasty but the sandwich was short on meat, the cornbread was no different than I make at home, room temp and served with a cold butter pat.  The cole slaw left a lot to be desired. It lacked luster, flavor and actually seemed dry. I exchanged it for potato salad that tasted slightly better than the stuff sold at grocery. The last gets the star..tasty. If you know good BBQ you will be disappointed. Staff was friendly and helpful.
