I would love to rave out this place. I have been waiting to try since it started to build over a yr ago. 

When i approached the restaurant
I noticed all the staff outside smoking. Once inside i was alerted that they were the ones also handling the food. Everyone reeked of cigg smoke. 

I order kung pow chicken and wasn't pleased. It wasn't kung pow chicken. The sauce was not correct nor were the ingredients. 

Everyone working there seemed confused and lost.
