Utterly horrific experience with this establishment. We ordered online. Waited an hour and a half. Heard nothing from them. Called them. They denied having the order.... told us to call "Slice" (their payment processor). Slice called them and they had conveniently lost the order. They did not apologize and did NOTHING to fix it. I now have a hungry house with a bunch of pissed off people. Terrible business
