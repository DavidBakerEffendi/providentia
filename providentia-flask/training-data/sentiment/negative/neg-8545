My first time here and it was horrible. This is not a true seafood restaurant. It has 2 to 3 fish selections. That is it. I asked for halibut. No. Sea bass no. Snapper no. Tuna. No. Swordfish forgettaboutit. They had whole sea bream. I asked nicely if it could be filleted. No.  
So. Needless to say I asked why.  Reply. Chef can't filet it. Well if he can't how can I?

How about a nice bottle of wine waiter asked.  There is no wine under $70 and the markup is 300%   Really?  No thanks. 

I ordered salad. It had the most bitter dressing. Horrible 

My pasta and clams was tasty but way too salty. My friends ordered clam chowder was said it was bland and unappealing 

Price for my pasta clams and salad and cocktail was $70. I was unimpressed. For this price I would eat somewhere else. 

I give this place 6 months to go out of business.  It was empty on a Saturday night. Now we know why.
