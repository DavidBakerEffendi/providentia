Nanashake at the Veg Festival. 
With three staff members available we were ignored  at the front of the line while one of them was serving promoting half price product to the clients besides us. When we were acknowledged the staff member was rude and refused to sell any products because it was one minute after closing. If they would had said that earlier we wouldn't stayed around standing like idiots. 
Poor customer service
