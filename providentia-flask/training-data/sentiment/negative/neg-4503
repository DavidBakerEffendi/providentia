A friend and I recently went, since we had a buy one get one coupon. Thank goodness for the coupon as I would never pay $25 for four tacos and a couple drinks. The tacos were just so so, nothing special. The queso for the chips was nacho cheese. If you are thinking of going here Id highly consider salsaritas heck even Taco Bell over this place. If I had to name a positive I guess Id say the soda was good and cold? What a failure this place is.
