Excellent food very flavorful.  Fahim Sahab (owner) is down to earth and a great conversationalist.  Felt like being back home.  Definitely will return! (March 2017)

Went back on March 2018 based on prior visit exactly a year ago.  Ordered Beef Seekh Kabob and regret it.  Tasted horribly bad, almost like the beef had been boiled in water!  No spices, no charbroiled flavor and absolutely inedible.  I left it on my plate.  The waiter came by and asked me how it was and I expressed my disappointment.  He didn't care and just walked away.  Based on this visit, I would NOT return!  Typical inconsistency that we seem to see so much in desi-run businesses.
