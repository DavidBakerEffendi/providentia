Awful. Every single part of this is awful. We ordered drinks to start. Waited 20 minutes for them and they were flavorless and watered down. And no, it wasn't because they were busy. Everyone around us got their drinks. The food was not hot when it came to us and had zero flavor. Pretty hard to mess up cheeseburger and fries. The waitress was non existent.  I would rather but from the kiosks than ever come here again. I swear... don't go. You will be thankful.
