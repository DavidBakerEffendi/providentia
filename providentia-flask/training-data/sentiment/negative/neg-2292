Living in Ayrsley we were excited this spot opened. We have been here on multiple occasions and each time has been worse than the time before. We just walked in on Friday night they are not busy. We sat at the inside bar and multiple members of the staff walked by us and it took ten minutes for somebody to stop and give us a menu. Then, we sat for another ten minutes again, staff walking around and nobody stopped again to take our order. We got up and left. As we walked to our car all members of the bar staff were outside talking to each other. Other people left as well complaining of poor service.
