Good food but horrible delivery.  This is the fourth time my order was wrong.  They usually forget something.  This time we waited 40 min to get the wrong wings.  When we called we were told don't eat those we'll get you the right wings but it will be another 40 minutes.  Or we can get a credit for next time but they still need to pick up the wrong wings.  
Then we were told the driver mixed up and was on his way back with our order and would pick-up the food we got in a few minutes.  Considering we opened the bag and boxes I hope he's not going to deliver them to someone else.  In addition we need to call back later to talk to a manager and it's been another 30 minutes and we don't have our food yet.
