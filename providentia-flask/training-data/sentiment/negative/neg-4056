We just moved into the neighborhood and were curious... Sadly, we'll never go back. The chicken fried steak tasted like mystery meat, everything was doused in extra salt, and the vegetables tasted like they'd been in a freezer for years and then poorly reconstituted. Our meals were a disaster.

The only two saving graces: A surprisingly decent salad bar (with a lot of fresh fruit and fresh spinach and other fresh, healthy things) and a relatively chipper waitstaff.
