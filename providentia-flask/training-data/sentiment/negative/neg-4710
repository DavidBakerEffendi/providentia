To expensive to be dissatisfied. 

I ordered the lamb dumpling,  the shrimp and mixed mushrooms. 

I had to cook the dumplings because they where raw. 

The mixed mushrooms was 95% snow peas 5% mushrooms. 

The shrimp was 80% batter. 

I had two more dishes and everything came to $60.

Very disappointed and we are not picky eaters.
