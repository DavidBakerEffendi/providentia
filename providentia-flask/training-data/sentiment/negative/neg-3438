First time ordering, customer service is very good but the rice not so much. I ordered fried rice which I paid extra for but got steamed rice that was lightly browned. When I called to place my order I specifically asked for dark fried rice. Not overall satisfied with the food. No other city compares to Chinese food in St. Louis, the capital of Chinese food where real fried rice is made!
