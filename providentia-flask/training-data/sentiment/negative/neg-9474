Blah! This Panda Express has a gross restroom (or disgusting customers who urinate all around the toilet in the ladies restroom and don't bother to flush either}. Either way, you can judge a restaurant's cleanliness by their restroom too.

I also observed the employee using the same cleaning towel to wipe the chairs to wipe down the table with. Double gross!

I am feeling nauseous from eating there. I went to check their rating inspection on Maricopa(dot)gov site, they usually get A's and B's. I still wouldn't eat at this location again.
