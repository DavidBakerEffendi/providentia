There is nothing worse than a going to a place that is pricey and disorganized.   You go in and have to stand in a line to order your food.  Not a biggie but come on, it shouldn't take you 20 minutes to place a simple food order.   The entire order taking process was awful!   You would think that they would have opened up more than one register but it becomes apparent why they didn't.

The kitchen was well disorganized cluster.   Watching them trying to push out what appears to be simple food was well amusing.   Then there was the management staff / expeditors that really couldn't get anything right.   It was so bad that I could have sworn that this was an episode of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares or Resturant Impossible.   

So after then standing around 30 minutes for the order to come out they finally have the order ready or so we thought.   Go up to the counter and we are told that they are out of Ribs.   Out of ribs?  The first thing that goes through my mind is okay, so how long ago did you know that there were no ribs.   Then next thing the asst manager says is to ask didn't the order taker tell you when you ordered there were no more ribs left?   WTH ... so they knew over 30 minutes ago that there were no ribs and are just telling us now.   Definite lack of communication between the kitchen, management, and the counter.

Now at this point they want to know if there is something else we would like as a substitute.  Course the answer is no as wanted ribs so asked them to cancel the rest of the order.   Other than the salad which we already consumed while waiting.   They seemed put out that we didn't want to continue with the order.   I was shocked that they didn't even try to offer something on the house as compensation.

Needless to say this is not a place that I plan on going back to.
