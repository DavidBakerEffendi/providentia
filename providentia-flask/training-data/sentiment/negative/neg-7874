First time to this Jersey Mike not impressed the floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned or mop the bathroom men's bathroom is trashed the windows aren't even clean they don't even have the open sign on and then has three TVs only one TV on playing baseball that's it so the employees don't care about cleanliness the food is okay but definitely some improvements need to be made to the cleanliness of the establishment
