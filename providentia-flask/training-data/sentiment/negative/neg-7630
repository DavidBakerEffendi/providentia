Ordered a chicken pita through door dash, was the worst pita I've ever had. Chicken was dry and cold, whatever sauce was put on it was smeared along the pita only rather than given to me in a side container so I can add it ONTOP of the gyro. The chicken ratio compared to anything else in my pita was a bit much, yes I ordered chicken but this thing was overflowing with barely any additional toppings. Just lettuce falling out of it. This will be the last time I order anything from Pita Jungle, if you can't get a chicken pita right, then there is no point in trying the rest of your menu.
