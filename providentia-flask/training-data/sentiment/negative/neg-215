Not worth it! Went for Monday $10 crab legs special the catch is each person has to purchase a drink or appetizer. Ok fine still gonna go for the crab. Thank goodness we got the appetizers! The crab legs were more like shredded crab. They were over cooked so u couldn't get any chunks of meat! They were cold and it was an overall waste of $40 will not return! Could've done a better job and had more had I made them myself!
