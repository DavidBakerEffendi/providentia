I used to order here often but i moved away from the area. I came back to visit family this week and ordered takeout. My total came to $25 which isn't bad as i remembered their portions being pretty decent. I OPENED MY ORDER AND MY LAMB SKEWER PEICES WERE SMALLER THAN HALF MY THUMB. And i only got 5 pieces which is ridiculous. When i called to ask whether this was normal they were extremely rude. 

By the way i live only 5 mins away (2 intersections) and delivery minimum is $45 (more when its busy $50+).

This was one of my favourite restaurants in richmond hill... Not anymore though.
