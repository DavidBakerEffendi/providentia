I came here a long time ago when they first opened and got a veggie burger. I asked them to cook it very well, almost overcooking it. But when I got it home to eat, it was an undercooked mush burger on a bun. It was absolutely terrible and got thrown away.  Thus, I got turned off from the whole place.

However, yesterday I met a friend for salads. My first thoughts were that it's ridiculously loud inside and the line for ordering gets really long, requiring anyone who wants to use the restroom to battle through those trying to order.  It seems like a poor set-up to me.

That said, I thoroughly enjoyed my salad. There are endless options and the salads are huge, making them very well worth their cost. In fact, I came again this afternoon for another salad. While there seems to be a little inconsistency with chop size and topping amounts, this can all be dealt with individually.

I will definitely be back for salads in the future, but would pass on the other items.

4/21 Update:  I've bumped my review down. I went today for my salad, which I haven't had in about a month. I immediately noticed the bowls were a good bit smaller than previously, but the price was every bit the same.  They pack the bowls so high with lettuce that any toppings I requested were falling off.  Last, they no longer allow me to get my cheese after the chopping. I like my cheese in larger chunk form so I can taste it, not obliterated in the small chop.  I don't really have a reason to go back.
