Mediocre at best. There are far better sushi restaurants in Phoenix/Glendale than this place.

My husband and I are sushi lovers and are always trying new sushi restaurants. We traveled 40 minutes from Surprise to try this out. We were disappointed.

The rice they use is black/purple and DOES NOT taste like sushi rice. It doesn't taste right and it makes the rolls taste abnormal. At every sushi restaurant, we always make sure we get the rainbow roll to gauge the quality of their raw fish.Their raw fish is okay.. definitely not great quality, but not the worst either.

If you love rolls with lots of sauce, then this place is for you. I, personally, don't like TOO MUCH sauce on my specialty rolls... just a little is enough for me. But they DRENCH those suckers so much that all you taste is sauce with weird black/purple rice. 

There DINNER MENU is very small... and does NOT include bento boxes. All they have are rolls, sashimi, ramen, and the typical appetizers. Their LUNCH menu, on the other hand, have bento boxes.

Last but not least, the PRICE is a little more than what I'm used to for the same quality. The "SPECIAL" we were offered for uni/sea urchin was $5 per ONE piece. That's a little expensive. I can get good uni/sea urchin at "Sushi Catcher" for $8 per TWO large pieces. 

FYI, be prepared to pay for parking since it is located downtown-ish. It costs $1.50 per hour for meter parking.

We won't be going back.
