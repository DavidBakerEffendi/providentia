If you like RUDE service and leftover food. You are welcome!

Seems like I owed the server million dollar when she was serving me. 

A lot of dishes not available but still show in the menu. 

The food quality is bad. The roasted duck I ordered seems like left over from yesterday. (I am a roast duck lover and been eating roasted duck over the years in different countries and cities like Hong Kong, Beijing, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and so on). I can tell what is fresh and what is good on roasted duck.
