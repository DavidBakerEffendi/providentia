I just don't like it. I've tried most every sandwich they have, and while the bread is soft, there is WAY too much of it in relation to the amount of meat you receive, and so little flavor on the sandwiches--even when you think there should be. Coleslaw and dressing should have flavor. Thanksgiving should have flavor. Even their chips are generic. This location seemed very run down, the radio station was blaring so loudly the cashier couldn't hear me, and the strip mall it is in was cruddy. I'll pass.
