Terrible. Used to be the diamond in the rough every year up until this yearly trip. 

They reduced the cost of dinner to 28 dollars but the food selection is now half of what it used to be

Also, at the start of dinner at around 530pm one would expect fresh food, but most of it had the 4 hour under a dry heat lamp look to it.

Asked our server why the food looked stale and he said it shouldn't.. Ill pass it along to the manager *rollseyes*

Lastly food quality dramatically dropped. Save your money and goto McDonald's instead for better food quality
