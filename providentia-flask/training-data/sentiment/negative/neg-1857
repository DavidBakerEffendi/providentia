On May 19 at 10:00 am I placed an order with Pizza Hut at 2835 N 16 st to deliver $180.00 order to AZ State Veterans home for our assistant directors last day going away party. I spent Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday getting money and card signing done .She had to leave 12:15 that day At 11:20am called Pizza Hut at 2835 N 16 st and ask when is the  pizza and pasta going to arrive a young woman at Pizza Hut said at 10:00 AM they had 100 pizzas ordered by a school nearby they had to take care of their order first. When I asked when our order would be delivered she said our order was being prepared don't expect it before 11:30 called again at 11:45 was told the order would not be there until 12:00 called again at 12 o'clock girl said order was being packed in to the truck for delivery and order would be at Az State Vets home  at 1 PM. We canceled the order and was hung up on. I was so embarrassed when I had to find all the people that gave me money and give them their money back. I was in tears because I knew everyone was very hungry. Our assistant administrator and her 9 year old daughter gave me a hug and said don't worry about it's pizza huts fault.

         THANK. YOU. PIZZA HUT!!!
