Made a reservation and still has to wait over 15 minutes when the restaurant was not even half full. Our son sat down in the floor and the host told him to get up. Finally got a table then waited another 20 minutes before we could get water. Then another 10 before anyone took our order. Not sure about the food yet because we may never get it.
