Disgusting rancid fish. I'm not even exaggerating that the tuna was smelly, slimy, and warm. The owners who are also the chefs didn't even apologize for the quality. I've been here a few times before and it was okay- certainly not the freshest but passable. This time is was bad and I was further disappointed the staff didn't offer an explanation or apology. I will not ever return and hope I don't get sick from the bite I had!
