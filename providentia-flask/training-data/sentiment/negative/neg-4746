I am a Absolutely disgusted in the service and food. I ordered soup (17.00) and a stir fry with jasmine rice. The total was 48.98 as you will are from my photos the soup was only half portion. Yup 17.00 for that .. the stir fry was as you can see from the photos was a minimal portion size. I called the restaurant and he says too bad (owner) there is a no money back policy.
