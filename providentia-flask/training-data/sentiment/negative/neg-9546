First of all you have to walk all over to get to your room and take at least 2 elevators to get there, second we got to our room and found a small spot of blood on the comforter and thought ok gross will just move the comforter down but we didn't think to remove it all the way and went to bed because it was late, so i got up the next morning and found that there was more blood spots on the sheets by our legs and started to inspect everything and there was more dried blood spots on on of the pillows, i contacted house keeping and they said that was unacceptable and would change everything, no apology at all.After getting home i got an email of the bill and found i was charged and extra $70 in fees for drinks and snacks they said i had used from the room, i called and spoke to them to have the charges removed which they did. I guess this is a standard procedure with them they said this happens all the time and the will take it off if the customer calls and i also made the comment about the housekeeping to them and was told i should of complained when i was there, they had no record of this complaint
