What in the bloody hell?! I have been here many times and the bartenders are typically not very good. Fortunately, the food is pretty good and they have a good beer selection,  so I deal with it. This last time however, and I do mean it is the last time, the service was atrocious. It was a normal day, not too busy even when you consider the patio patrons. My boyfriend was without a beer for 20 minutes and I made it 15 before deciding not to order another. Maybe when the staff is having a lover's quarrel, they should save it for home instead of walking by empty glasses a dozen times without acknowledging their customers. Eventually, one of the bar tenders finally did look at my empty glass and my boyfriend finally decided to politely hold his up to show how empty his glass is, and was still ignored. The best part is, 10 seconds after I set my card in the rocks glass to pay, they saw it immediately and scooped it up. So, either they hate us for being regular yet, quiet patrons, or they are just not very good. Either way, we won't be back.
