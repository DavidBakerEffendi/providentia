I can relate to the comment above about the owner (see below).  

3) the owner. he's a terrifying rageaholic, and it doesn't matter who is on the receiving end -- employees, customers, vendors, i've seen him go off on all of them. it is a mystery to me how he stays in business when he treats everyone so badly. 


I am from out of town and wanted to have some sandwiches delivered to a wake on short notice.  I was simply calling to see who might be able to accommodate my request for a deli tray.  The owner went on and on about how it was the worst day of the week for him and that there is no way he could help me.  This man deserves to go under.
