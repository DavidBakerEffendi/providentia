Yuck.

This is the new Fuji Yama location.  I was really excited because I heard that I really good chef was going to work there.  However, when my friends and I arrived, he wasn't there.

The atmosphere was really bright and cozy.  The guy waiter that we had must have been really new.  He seemed really nervous, but he was really nice and he took care of his customers really well.  However, when my friend went recently, he had another waiter and he forgot to enter the WHOLE SUSHI LIST, he found out after 1 hour into the dinner.  But anyway, the waiter we had was great.

The sushi was similar to the quality from AYCE.  The rice was way too wet that it made the seaweed super soggy and chewy (we ate it right after it was served at our table).  The quality of the salmon in our salmon roll was disgusting.  It felt like plastic and looked like it was rubber!  

We ordered a roll with mango in it.  At least the mango in the roll is fresh mango.  You can tell because it has started to change colour.  However, you cannot taste the mango in the roll.  

Long story short, the place was horrible.  The quality it similar to any AYCE place in Calgary.
