Sadly, I'm not going to review on the sushi..... My wife and I were craving sushi and decided to try The Sushi. As we walked in, there were customers at the sushi bar and a few at tables. Not extremely busy. We waited what seemed liked forever to be seated. We weren't asked about drinks and no water was ever brought to us. We literally sat there 10 minutes wondering if we would get some service. A few minutes later we decided to go elsewhere because we felt completely ignored. Had hi hopes for a non AYCE sushi house.
