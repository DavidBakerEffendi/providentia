I'm not a huge fan of using Yelp for negative reviews, people take it too liberally and air their grievances when they should just probably seek therapy or get a hobby...

BUT this was a terrible experience. 

Details aren't exactly necessary. Just get it together. Be polite. Acknowledge people when they've been waiting an excessive amount of time. Get orders right after clarification several times. And maybe try and make the situation better when none of the above happens.
