Horrible customer service. The girl who was at the end to start the order was sitting with her back to me playing with her smart phone... Then looked at me as if I was rude for interrupting her.

I got the big boss burger which was cold presumably because they pre-make so many and let them sit there.

I really like the concept, but every time I've come in there (3x now) the service has not been good.
