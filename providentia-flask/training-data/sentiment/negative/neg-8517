My husband and I had dinner tonight.  We purchased a groupon deal for dinner.  We were greeted by the owner asking us if we had a reservation, there were only 3 other couples in the establishment.  We had the Bruchetta for an appetizer and although the bread was excellent, the brochette did not see fresh. I had the Leg of Lamb, which came with 2 sides; I had the Green potatoes and the Greek salad.  My leg of lamb was two pieces of shaved lamb, which was so overcooked it was difficult to eat.  My Greek salad was not good but the potatoes were fairly good.  My husband had the Bolognese meatloaf, which was OK, but the other sides were not very good.  We had Gelato for dessert, which they bring in from a vendor, which was the best part of the meal.  I'm pretty sure this place will be out of business within 3 months.  I would not go back.
