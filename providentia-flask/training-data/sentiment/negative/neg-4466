Gave one star, last time there, very limited menu. Almost tasted pre-made and reheated. They said it was due to the kitchen being remodeled. Could not actually show us a menu. Couple weeks later, closed with a public notice posted from the city. Looks like they may have lost their license. Too bad, when they first opened the doors was great.
