I have enough experience with this place to write a fair review. When I moved to Toronto I lived on the east end so I would go here approx. once per month (when I did my banking) because I liked getting work done over their WiFi while eating at a nice pace at a reasonable price. Today I returned after about a full year since I moved to the west end and will definitely be my last time. Here's how they've gone majorly down hill: 

-First of all, the place was empty... Nothing to complain about but their service should have been fine and the fact that it's empty now (appose to a year ago), says it all. 
-So they removed some items from the lunch menu, fair enough, they need to make money. 
-On top of that, as I was ordering she mentioned 'last call for lunch' it was only half past 2pm -- so I had to order everything at once, which was a reasonable few rolls, soul, etc.  
-When I asked for their WiFi password they said their WiFi was down-- then after I looked visably annoyed that I sat down and ordered just to not get any work done she gave me the password -- so, she just lied to me. 
-They gave off a vibe that they just didn't want to be there. Fair enough, I've worked some shitty service jobs but it shows that they aren't paid well at all.
-The real kicker was when not all of my food showed up and I asked about it, she said I didn't order it etc. 
I didn't make a huge deal about it, but it was before 3PM and she said I couldn't order again. So I ended up paying 20$ (I did give a few $ tip regardless) and I had 2 small roles.

I guess that's average price for sushi, but they definitely shouldn't advertise all you can eat. It's the fact that I was lied to multiple times I did feel 'cheated' and left feeling over all that the place must be struggling. Good luck giving it a try, they really need to do something about their customer service and they can get back to where they once were. Cheers.
