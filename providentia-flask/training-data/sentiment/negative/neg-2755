The service is absolutely terrible at this establishment. You can tell that they don't train their waiters, at all, and they can't even say what is included in each dish. The restaurant wasn't that packed during the lunch hour and yet they were acting as if it was a full house. They were rude when our table asked for a condiment and at one point was talked down to. The managers and owners should be embarrassed about their quality of service. I have never been so repulsed by a dining experience.
