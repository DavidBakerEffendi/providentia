Ughhhh I usually love einsteins but this one is so horrible!!!!  I got an everything bagel toasted with regular creme cheese and an ice tea my usual. The ice tea was soooo bad I literally thought I was drinking urine. It tasted like it was sitting there for days and I swear I saw mold stuff in it. My bagel was so cold, dry and chewy but in a bad way.  Seriously so nasty. The service was horrible,  took them so long to make the order way longer than the normal expected time. I will not be back here or any Einstein because of this.  How hard is it to make a bagel!  Oh and it barley had any creme cheese on it just chewy cold bread
