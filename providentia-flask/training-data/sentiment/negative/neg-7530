I just came to this location today with my son and my chicken was raw in the inside. The cashier asked me did I want the cook to make me a new order and I said no I just want my money back. I am glad I looked at my food before giving it to my son. The manager didn't do anything and her apology was not sincere. I will never return the disorganization should have been a red flag and the fact they didn't have donuts because they ran out. Well if you make donuts fresh then remake some.
