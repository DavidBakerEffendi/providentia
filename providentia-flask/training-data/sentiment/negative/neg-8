Had food delivered. Tender meal, 2 piece dark meal, Mac and cheese, corn, hush puppies. The tenders have an undercooked texture and the seasoning was soggy. The fries that came with are soggy. The Mac and cheese is gritty. The hush puppies too salty. Only good thing is the bacon corn but even the bacon appears undercooked. Will not be eating from this business again.
