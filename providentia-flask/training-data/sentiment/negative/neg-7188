While the staff is very friendly and made the order correctly. The value is just not there. Paid $18 for 2 very below average meals. 
The setting: don't dine in (or eat here at all), because every table and seat is dirty, making it a comfortable setting for bugs to dine in there as well (see photos). This place is in dire need of a remodel.
