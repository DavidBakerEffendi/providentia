I would have given this location two stars, except for the terrible customer service I received. 

Had a takeout order that they completely messed up. Got the meat wrong, didn't put in the tomato or onion and put a veritable mountain of sauce even though it was requested as lightly sauced. That, was problematic in and of itself. But, given it wasn't the absolute worst burrito I've had, I could have forgiven it.

However, I sent an email to the company to let them know how disappointed I was in my order and my experience. They forwarded my email to the manager of the queen street east location who replied that the mistake was my fault. Not the fault of her "experienced" staff member who had to have one of the other staff members help her figure out the order because she couldn't follow what was being asked of her. 

That, right there, is reason enough not to go back. In a world where customer service is a priority, the folks at Burrito Bandidos have proven that it is not their priority. 

In a nutshell: mediocre AT BEST food combined with atrocious customer service. Avoid this place.
