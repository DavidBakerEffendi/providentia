Dominos had a deal for $6 medium pizza, which I thought was a good deal and you get two toppings. Went to pick it up and they should have just said $6 small pizza, the box was a small. It serve probably 3 people if they all had 3 pizza each. When I went to pick it up the guy was on his cellphone, but don't worry he was nice enough to put his phone down when I came in. Not worth the savings.
