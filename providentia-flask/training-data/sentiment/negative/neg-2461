There is a girl that works the front (brown girl with light eyes) that just has a terrible attitude.  

You could be very respectful but for some reason this girl just has issues.  She is condescending, the way she speaks is disrespectful, and she screams at customers.  It is strange and awkward

I just want to eat some fried chicken without any drama....ill come back to this location when they change up this issue.
