Wow, it took 30 min for 2 bubble teas on Monday night!!! 

We asked the cashier after 25 min of waiting, and it looked as they totally forgot our order.  People came after us got theirs way before ours.  

The cashier didn't even say sorry for the slow service. We saw few other people walked away also.  

Will NEVER go back there again, this location is horrible.
