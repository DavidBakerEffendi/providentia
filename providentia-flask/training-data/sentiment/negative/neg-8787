This was the worst visit ever! I ordered the avocado crossiant and it was put together poorly! It was piled high with lettuce, 2 small slices of avocado and 1 slice of tomato... the cucumbers, banana peppers and olives were on the plate instead of the sandwich! I cut and attempt to each and it falls apart!  There was no aoili or spread... just dry! Disappointed! It was served with a small garden salad that came to the table after I sent the sandwich back. Needless to say, the salad was the only thing I ate. When we askedfor more bread, the waiter brought it over on paper in his hand! WTHAY! SMH! 

As for the little people, they enjoy their meal... one had pancakes and the other had 1/2 turkey club and a cup of corn chowder.

I paid the bill and left a minimal tip! I won't be back!

SN - I could see the kitchen and the staff was playing a bit too much to be cautious of the poor service!
