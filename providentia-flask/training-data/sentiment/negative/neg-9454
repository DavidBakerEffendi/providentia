I feel bad for giving just 1 star but for the price, this place should've had more of a variety. I went for lunch and I sadly have to say, the best thing I ate was the Mac and Cheese. There was an extremely small selection to choose from and I honestly didn't want to eat anything :/ I felt bad because I went with my family and for the price, I tried to eat as much as possible. I would prefer going to hometown buffet (do they still exists?!) because from my memory, they have wayyy more of a variety. Nothing special about this place, I say, spend your $ at a better buffet.
