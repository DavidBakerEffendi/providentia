Hands down the worst meal I've had in over a year. Horrible frozen food re-heated and passed off as dinner. We ordered the spaghetti dinner special which included an appetizer, salad, spaghetti and meatballs, pop, bread, and 2 dessert orders. We had breaded mushrooms as an appetizer, these were about the same quality as something that you would buy and heat yourself in your microwave. The salad was just basic bag lettuce mix but tasted fine. The bread, oh the bread. This was when I started laughing out loud in my kitchen. The bread was a hot dog bun soaked in a garlic butter sludge and then put back together and heated. When I say hot dog bun I mean the kind you get at the store for like 50 cents a package. The spaghetti order was generous at probably a full pound of noodles. How ever they had been badly overcooked and then allowed to dry back out in parts. This was complimented by maybe a 1/4 cup of "sauce" which was just enough to color the noodles an odd orange color. The sauce tasted like ketchup that had a few tablespoons of dried oregono tossed into it. In fact that was the only real detectable flavor in the whole dish. 2 meatballs, total, accompanied our dinner. They were obviously frozen and both slightly smaller then a ping pong ball. Looked and tasted exactly like stouffers. We ordered zeppoli and a cannoli for dessert. The zeppoli consisted of maybe 20-25 globs of cold rock hard dough ranging in size from pea, to meatball sized. All were too hard to bite into and tasted like old oil. The cannoli was also cold and filled with what I believe was cream cheese icing from a can, mixed with some mini chicolate chips. I've never had a cannoli lose it's filling when turned sideways before. The 2-Liter of Coke we had was by far the best thing about this meal. I won't be back for any reason, complete waste of time and money.
