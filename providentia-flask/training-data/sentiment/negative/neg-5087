I never really leave bad reviews but this is not ok. 

My food was 30 minutes late, order missing items  and no apologizes for not bring out my curbside meals after I called twice. Its called curbside but tonight it was pick-up for me. 

Neverless, when I walk in two hostess a young man and a young woman are just standing there with my order sitting on the counter. 

No apologizes at all. The restaurants wasnt busy so there is really no excuse. I got my order because we have had a long day and didnt want to wait any longer.

This is one of the reasons chain restaurants are failing, lack of decent customer service.
