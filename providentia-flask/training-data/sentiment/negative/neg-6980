Have been here over 50 times since opening a couple years ago. Spent a lot of money on VIP passes to jump the line and even more on food and drinks. The past three times I have been there I noticed many changes for the worse. First, even though I have been there 50+ times they act like it is my first and make me wait for somebody to show me how the bay works.  Annoying as heck.  Had to wait, even though I paid $50 for a VIP pass, an extra 20 mins for somebody to show me to the bay. Second, the service is horrible. They need to train the staff.  Rude, no empathy, no please and thank you, no nothing.  Third, the bartenders are the worst.  They have no idea how to make a great drink except pouring a beer. Do not have a margarita, they are horrible.  Fourth, the bay we were in you cannot change the channel on TV because it was broken.  They are not keeping up on maintenance.  Fifth, the balls kept getting stuck and not coming out.  Had to have them reset it 5 times in 2 hours.

My opinion is they have leadership and management issues. Focused on profit now and not long term.  They could care less about a long term loyal customer and think they can keep attracting first time visitors. They will not make it 5 years from now if they do not change the service
