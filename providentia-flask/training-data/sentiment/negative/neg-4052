The games are okay and the atmosphere isn't bad but I did not have a good experience here. First, the wait time was brutally long.  So long that we put our phone number down and went to tim hortons to wait. After more than an hour passed we got a call and walked over. Since we had been there for so long we had already purchased drinks. 

Normally I wouldn't bring a drink into another establishment but they said there was no food left and hot beverages were on last call. Also the staff did not seem to have a problem with it. We sat down and had the $5 minimum rule explained to us and proceeded to play games. We had a little more than an hour before 2am at this point, so we thought we'd get a couple games in and call it a night. 

Then, the drinks we brought in and tried to keep out of the way disappeared. While we were playing, staff came around and threw out our unfinished drinks without saying anything. They did not tell us to get rid of them when we entered because they were closing up, but they had no problem throwing our drinks out without asking us. THEN they had the gall to automatically charge us tip on the $5 for the absolutely no service we received. They did not even once come around and ask us what we wanted. 

I've been here before and it wasn't bad but the treatment we got this time was horrible.
