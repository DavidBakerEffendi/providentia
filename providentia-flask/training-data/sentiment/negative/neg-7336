We went in to place a take out-order, a Frisco melt and a chili supreme.  20 minutes later we still don't have our food.  The lady seems irritated when I ask about our order.  They scroll back through the few orders they had to find ours  It's still another 10 minutes before we get our order. We get home to find the sandwich under the chili, smashed and missing the extra sauce we paid for.   I'd also like to mention that two people that came in after us, one got his order before us and the other never got his sandwich, gave up and left!  So, order placed at 10:09 pm (not busy) and we left at 10:38.  Never again!
I wanted to add that the sandwich did not have extra sauce and the chili mac didn't have extra sauce and meat all of which we paid for.
