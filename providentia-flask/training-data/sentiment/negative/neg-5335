the first clue was that we were the only ones in there for lunch. for 13.50 (thank god we had a groupon) the enchildas suizas was probably worth about 4.00. and on top of that, they left off the onions and cilantro that was on the menu to make it sound yummy. 13.50 and still hungry. maybe this place is jumping at night. the pieces of steak in the salad was very good though....oh, by the way that was 10.50, for 4.00 worth of meat...
