How disappointing!!
The restaurant was not busy but took 20 minutes to get acknowledged at the table. We sat outside and inside was empty. Our server said it's so busy as everyone came at once. She said 'hey I'm doing good though'. 
They were out of three cocktails on the list. When we found one they had it was warm. 
The manager never came outside. He was leaning on the bar drinking diet Red Bull's. The bartender was yawning and watching tv. 
Spare Rib came out ice cold. Table next to us got their entrees before their salads and were told they could keep them warm if they liked. 
The English style chicken curry was good and Philippine busses was excellent. 
Wine list was dull and red wine was warm. 
We were very disappointed. This place is very poorly managed when one server is outside alone with seven tables and no management present to help her
