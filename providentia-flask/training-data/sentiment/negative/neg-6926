Ok....it's Dennys. My expectations aren't that high. That said, I couldn't believe what they tried to serve this morning. Called in for pick up and after having confirmed my order at least 3 times over the phone, I found that not only had they left 3 things off my order, but also that the pancake puppies were burnt beyond recognition to the point that they even burned through the styrofoam container they were put in. When I called in, I was put on hold for 10 minutes before the manager came on the line, made me re-explain the situation and then told me to come in and get another one or get my money back. No apologies or even a surprised tone...just matter of factly. When I asked if the replacement pancake puppies would be on her (the principle... not that the 1.99 was going to break me) she said she reluctantly agreed to give a coupon for next time. Mmmm... that's ok. Don't think there will be a next time. Up your standards to edible, please, Dennys.
