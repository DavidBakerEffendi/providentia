Usually I would have written a review of flying colours for Gals considering it is a favourite for me and my girlfriend, but tonight We went out for a late night bite and got a couple roles. From when we had sat down to the end our server was never close by to take drink orders or to check on the meal. After we were done we waited about 25 minuets before she even brought us the bill, by the time she had brought the card reader, I was not to impressed with the service so I decided not to tip. When she had printed the receipt,she stopped us on our way out and told us "the original cost did not include a tip; how will you pay cash or charge.?" After  those very rude words I just just put down about 2 dollars of pocket change and left.
This was my absolute favourite Sushi restaurant but now.. I think it's safe to say we'll be taking take out.
