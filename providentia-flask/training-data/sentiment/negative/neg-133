I tried this place along time ago, way before Yelp. It doesn't look like customer service wise anything is changed. 

When you come out of the arena there's a bunch of girls rolling around with a bucket giving away free bull ride passes to sucker you in. We walked in and the place was about 50/50 empty/full. So of course we tried to sit where the bull was because we were dumb enough to pick up 2 bull riding "free" tickets. Guess what, you can't sit there because those spots are reserved even though nobody has it reserved for the night. Ok, well let's just grab a normal table then. Nope, we have to put our name on the list and wait for one of the empty tables to come up. We sit down and wait for about 15 minutes looking at empty tables and we come to the realization that this place sucks so we get up and we walk out. Guess what, we never got buzzed for a seat. We did get informed that we are on the waiting list but that's it. Way to go restaurant! Guess I should've read all the poor reviews before I bothered wasting my time.
