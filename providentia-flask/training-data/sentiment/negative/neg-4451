WORST chinese dessert place in town.  Very DISAPPOINTING. 

Came here and ordered take out on a Saturday.  We ordered two items, the Glutinous rice balls with walnut paste($6.99) and Coconut and Grass Jelly ($5.99).  

Glutinous rice balls with walnust paste - the walnust paste tasted so bland, tasted nothing like walnut.  It had very similar flavour as the ones from the instant walnut powder.  The paste was not smooth at all, it had weird residue(not walnut texture-like) in it which was not pleasant at all. The rice balls has sesame paste inside, nothing too spectacular.  

Coconut and Grass Jelly - its basically grass jelly and young coconut meat in coconut milk.  The grass jelly were alright.  But the coconut meat were still frozen ! Some of them were hard as rocks and there were ice chucks in the coconut milk.  Its pretty obvious that they did not have enough time to defrost the coconut meat before serving them to the customers.  Every bite was crunchy from the ice chunks...

Also, the portions were so small considering the price we paid ! 

Definitely would not come back!
