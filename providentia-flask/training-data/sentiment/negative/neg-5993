Unimpressed. Did drive-thru, ordered a Mighty Angus combo, 2 cheeseburgers, drink and mcnuggete. Am told 'have a good night' and drive home -  get home to find they neglected the cheeseburgers. Not worth the hassle of driving 20 minutes. Simply won't be going there again and will suggest friends do not buy from this location.
