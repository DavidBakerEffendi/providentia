Let me preface my review by saying I love (or used to love) Einstein bagels.  I've been to this location three times and it's just getting worse, to the point where I don't think I'll return.

Today, I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and a bfast sandwich, along with a fountain drink.  I waited about 15 minutes for my food.  Staff was mysteriously missing from the front and everyone appeared to be wearing baggy, dirty clothes.  At the register, things were dusty, there were gift cards with snowmen on them, spilled coffee, just a mess.  No better at the drink bar where I wondered if/when anyone had cleaned the soda machine, as it was filthy and the coke tasted weird.  Spilled milk everywhere.  Just disgusting.  I think as a result of the experience, the food, when I left, just did not taste good either.  I doubt I'll be headed back to this particular location.  Ever.
