More like "Gimme some better customer service." I feel partially to blame for referring my friend to this bakery for her baby shower cake.

Gimme Some Sugar has catered several events that I attended, and I was always impressed with their creations. My friend had numerous issues with customer service, which is attributed to the bakery shutting down completely for Life is Beautiful. Despite red flags (ex: not returning e-mails promptly), the bakery promised and confirmed to have my friend's baby shower cake completed by the coming Sunday at 1:00 p.m.

We drove 25 minutes to Henderson to pick up the cake. Once we arrived, we noticed the parking lot was desolate. The bakery was closed. We rang the doorbell multiple times and knocked on the doors, and even looked through the windows. No one was there. My friend and I both called, texted and e-mailed the bakery. No response. 

We left the shop but ended up making a u-turn to give it one last shot. When we returned, an SUV was parked in front of the bakery. We rang the doorbell and one of the owners answered. My friend told her we arrived on time but no one responded. The owner said their shop's door was open and that there was someone onsite. Total BS.

The cake, which cost about 100 bucks, looked like it came from a UPS facility. Not much thought and care was put into the packaging. It was placed in a brown, unsealed cardboard box as opposed to a regular cake box. Overall, its appearance and flavor were disappointing. Oh and supposedly, from what we were told, it could feed 20 people, IF it was cut into small pieces. WTF?

I would never again recommend to anyone to have their cake made here for their special occasion.
