Can't get anybody on the phone without a 10 minute automated Question and Answer service, then you'll wait until their darn good and ready to answer the phone on their end.  After 20 minutes of wasted time, they just lost my daughters birthday reservation for 35 kids.  Don't know how much that would have been but they lost it.

Why I didn't get the free 20 tokens by booking online?  They told me 4 times that I could get 20 free tokens by booking online at ChuckECheese.com, after each and every selection I had to grueling go through...but hey, you can get the free 20 tokens by booking online.  

I didn't book online because I had human questions that deserves a human answer.  And I won't be baited because I can get the free 20 tokens by booking online.  

Now you've read that you can get 20 free tokens by booking online, as many annoying times as I had to hear it. 

If you like high prices and low customer service, which I abhor, then this place is for you, if you've consigned yourself to a poor customer service modern mindset that you apathetically won't find better anywhere else, then this is the place for you.  

Oh, and if you care so little for your money, then send me your money for reading this review.  I'm always willing to take your money for offering very little.
