This place is probably the worst place in charlotte for pizza.  If you are trying to go here for the pizza, don't!!  Feul is probably an establishment for late night pizza and wings but you should partake in neither. If you want anything spicer than mild, don't even partake - the wings are useless and have zero sauce.  Pizza is okay and staff can be friendly if you get them on the right night.  But mostly you should know they will charge you for extra sauce - including if you just want hot wings with hot sauce which would seem like a given. Only redeeming fact about this place is that they serve craft beer in cans.  Otherwise don't order the wings unless you like dry, sauce less wings.
