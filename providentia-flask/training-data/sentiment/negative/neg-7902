Its lunchtime, I walk in with two other people and seated right away by the very gracious hostess.  We then to proceed to sit there for 15 minutes with no water, no drinks, no waitress.  I watched two of them stand by the booth they congregate at, then two waitresses walk by to other tables and take orders one of those being a couple who arrived after we did.  I am always more patient at lunch because I understand its busy but it was not busy at all.  We finally got up and walked out, went next door to PF Changs and had a really nice lunch.  Pathetic!
