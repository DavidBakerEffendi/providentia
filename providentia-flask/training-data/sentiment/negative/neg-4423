Be weary of the servers at Top Golf. Especially ones named Hannah M. She altered my receipt and gave herself a 110% tip. When my credit card company called to dispute the charge, the manager called me back the next day and tried to refund only the altered tip. I didn't even get an apology for the altered receipt, overcharging my card, or spending a Saturday on the phone trying to get the charges reversed. You suck top golf.
