Formerly Stars Comedy Club, Bentley's Bar & Grill is not to be confused with Bentley's on 27 in downtown Charlotte.

Bentley's Bar & Grill is a sports bar in downtown Belmont NC with a flair for running out of burgers or just about anything else at 9pm on Saturdays.  Yes the manager comp'ed our meal.  But our waitress was completely indifferent and service overall was terrible.  It still took half an hour to get a few beers and cokes to our table.  She refilled water once every two hours and everyone in our group was eating dinner.  

But I don't blame our waitress.  All of the problems that night were indicative of the management's inability to pay attention to the basic details of running a restaurant.  Don't make me beg for food and drink.  You're the ones that put the sign on the door that says "Open for business".
