Ok so let me just start here I have had issues with Papa John's before I have not ordered pizza from them in 2 years but tonight I was watching a commercial and I thought that pizza sure does look good so I'll give them another try. SORRY DOMINOS I should have been faithful. I placed my order and received my confirmation email your pizza will be there in 40-50 minutes. I waited an hour and 15 minutes and thought I'll call and check on it. The first guy I talked to put me on hold for 5 minutes and 43 seconds before the manager got on the phone and said to me the driver rang your doorbell and no one answered so he left. No sir there are 3 people here 2 of us are in the living room 10 feet from the door and windows wide open he didn't come here. Oh yes ma'am he did he's been a driver with us for over 20 years he wouldn't lie. Um NO he wasn't here. Then the manager continued to yell at me and when I got mad back he accused me of being rude. THEN he says oh wait never mind that wasn't you your order was placed online and YOU picked for the order to be picked up. Wait you just accused me for 10 minutes of not answering my door when the guy delivered my pizza then you all of a sudden decide to change to I ordered it wrong?? Â He did send out my order for free my pizza is really under cooked when picked up it falls apart. Yeah I will not make this mistake again until you get 7032 Brighton Park Drive, Mint Hill, NC 28227 store in order I won't be back. And if you need more proof yelp all 1 star complaints and google as well.
