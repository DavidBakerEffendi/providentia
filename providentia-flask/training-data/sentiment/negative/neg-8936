Why is it that when you place an order you suddenly become victim to
 the lame, inept, useless employees behind the counter. The cook was on the phone, with the manager mentioning that  the next cook is going to be late because his car got stolen. She was pissed off that she might have to work till 5:00pm tonight. All this in ear shot and view of the 3 customers that are waiting for food.

What really makes this bad is the food sucked! Chicken fingers, unfries and water
