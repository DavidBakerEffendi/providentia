Service: 3% F AWFUL AWFUL service! The first thing out of the lady's mouth was "how do you want to pay" (Nearly walked out right then and there, and I should have.) Every employee was playing around on their phones,  and it took like 10 minutes for them to even acknowledge that I was there.  (There where only 5 or 6 other costumers who where already eating.) A couple of guys even looked over at me, and just continued playing in their phones. If I where manager, I wouldve fired everyone.

Cleanliness: 33% F This place needs to be SHUT DOWN. Dust, grease,  and yes even dead bugs where on some of the tables! I didnt even dare go into a bathroom either.

Food: 11% Not fresh, flavorless, and gross. Gave me one heck of a stomach ache afterwards. 

I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.
