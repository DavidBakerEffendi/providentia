Last night a group of friends and I decided to go to Denny's and ended up at this location. I have to say the experience was horrible!!! There was only one server, the manager and two guys in the kitchen. We got out order all messed up, the waitress said the grill person was new and we didn't mind at all, we understood and said it was fine. Food was neither good or bad, very average. The problem was the waitress' attitude towards her coworkers, she started yelling at them saying that the order was all messed up and blah blah blah, then she started yelling to the manager that she needed help and that she was about to leave; it was so uncomfortable to be there, the manager went to our table to ask what else we were missing and I could see that she was about to cry. The waitress wasn't rude at us but it was really awful to see the way she acted in front of the customers. Two or more people actually left the place before even ordering. I'm not trying to be mean, but this place really needs to improve in too many ways.
