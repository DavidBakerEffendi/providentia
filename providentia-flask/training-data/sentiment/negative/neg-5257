It's not the fact that you are terribly understaffed every time I come in, or that the food is salty as heck. It's not the fact that I sat there on August 9th, 2015 at 7:15pm for 15 minutes, 10 of those without a menu, (still ok. You were busy) but that you took the order of a couple that was there for 5 minutes BEFORE you took mine. THAT'S why I left pissed off and out of my mind with anger. I wish you guys could get it together there. I feel bad for the servers because either a) you are perpetually understaffed or b) it's your first gig and are just inefficient. Either way, something needs to be done.
