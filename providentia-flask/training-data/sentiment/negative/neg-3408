salty, greasy pizza with clueless staff. This desi lady told my friend the price of small pizza so he decided to order. While they were preparing, the lady kept looking at us the weird way. When my friend went to the counter to pay for it, he looked confused. We realized she misinformed him about the price. He told me if I wanted to share and I said "Heck no" because I could literally see the pizza sliding left and right inside the box because the bottom was drenched with oil. I told him the pizza looked trash and he said it's also too salty but my poor buddy had no choice but to put it in his mouth because he was starving. rip
