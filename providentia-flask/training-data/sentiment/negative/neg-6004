If there was a zero star I would have clicked that...
Soggy Food, Bland Alfredo that tastes like ... Well... Nothing..... there was actually no flavour.

And to top it all off!!! 

A BIG LONG GREASY HAIR BAKED INTO MY CHICKEN WINGS!!! 

Before you order food from here... Dig deep into your wallet, take out whatever cash you would have spent on your meal. Scrunch it up into a tiny ball and enjoy the taste of ink and plastic on your tongue because I guarantee it will taste better than the excuse of a meal the call Fettucini Alfredo and it will probably cost you less!

What a joke...
