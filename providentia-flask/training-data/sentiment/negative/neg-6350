I'm seriously so mad...Pizza Hut was literally my first job so I know how this works. Whoever stretched this pizza tonight 9/16, should be ashamed of themselves. You don't need that much dough to cover the cheese-sticks bro!! ‚Äç...ugh. This is so irritating especially when this isn't my normal Pizza Hut and actually drove. I truly have no idea what you would call this. Smh.
