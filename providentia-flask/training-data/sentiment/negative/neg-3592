Ron's Pizza Palace is cheap. If the only requirement for your meal is that it costs less than $10, Ron's still wouldn't be your best option.

Today I ordered an "antipasta" (sic) salad that came with wilted lettuce, thinly sliced, low quality deli meat, rotting carrots, and an overabundance of some shredded white cheese. The entire combination filled slightly more than one quarter of the styrofoam container it came in.

On multiple occasions in the past, I have ordered hoagies from Ron's. While I have had enjoyable hoagies from Ron's, that is not the standard experience. The hoagies are very inconsistent in terms of quality, occasionally good, frequently bad. If you get a hoagie, I don't recommend one with produce on it. The produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads.

I won't be ordering from Ron's again, despite the inexpensive menu. I'm all for a cheap meal, but only if a certain standard of quality is met. With Ron's, you are better off considering fast food.
