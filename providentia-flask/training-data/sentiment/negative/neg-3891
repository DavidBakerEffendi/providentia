What is the point of being in business if you do not remain open during posted business hours? My wife and I drove here and arrived at 1115pm last night but it was closed. Both the website and front door say open until 1200, midnight. This is unacceptable. 

The restaurant itself has really good sandwich and pizza options with a great selection of beer. Had they been open the review based on the food and drink would have most likely been 4 or 5 stars. I'm curious to know why they were closed, as I assume they are still in business. Might go back, especially if I know why (want to make sure they still open when I want to go next), and would consider rewriting the review.
