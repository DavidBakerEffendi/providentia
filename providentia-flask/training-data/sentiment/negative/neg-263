Really disappointing experience at this restaurant. I visited recently with a group of my girlfriends for brunch, and we were a large group of 20 girls. As soon as I walked into the restaurant I was super excited, the ambiance was fantastic and the menu looked amazing. However I was quickly disappointed by the service and the lack of cleanliness of the bathrooms. 

We started our really good and quickly got water, but I soon found myself out of water and stealing other waters from empty seats. I went through three water glasses and not once did anyone refill or even offer to refer my glass. We had pitchers on our tables but they quickly ran out of water too. 

On top of that, it took them an hour to get my food either because the waitress forgot to put in the order or the chef forgot to make it, I'm not sure which one it was. I ordered chicken and waffles and a pineapple juice as soon as I sat down, and with the rest of the group as they ordered, and it wasn't until the rest of my group had had their food and basically finished it that the waitress asked me what I ordered. I never got my pineapple juice but I did get my chicken and waffles. I had to get it to go because I was on a time crunch, and the waitress was nice enough to comp it, but it really didn't make up for it. 

On top of that the bathrooms were disgusting. Water and liquids everywhere, soggy paper towels on the ground and rags sitting around in the stalls and on the sink. I started gagging as soon as I walked in and I held my breath the entire time I was in there. I honestly could not believe how horrible it was, especially for a restaurant that is more upscale than most. 

Overall it was a horrible experience. I will not be back and I will not recommend this spot for any future brunches going forward. Avoid at all costs!
