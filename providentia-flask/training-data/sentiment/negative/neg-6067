Food - ok.  Overpriced.

Service/Professionalism - ridiculously awful, and I mean awful.  It's an absolute joke.  I have never been treated so rudely in a restaurant ever.  To make it worse, the woman providing service is the manager of the place.  I am shocked that the Fuego group would allow her to be in charge of a restaurant.  During her nasty rant at me, she complained that her restaurant doesn't have enough business.

Looking around, there were almost no customers.  Anyone who used to frequent this same location when it was "Chuy's" knows it was busy almost all of the time.

All of the workers, including the manager, looked unprofessional and behaved unprofessionally.  They were dressed in jeans and t-shirts.  They were eating burgers from Sonic at the bar, and going in and out of the kitchen area while eating.  One of the staff had a milkshake from Sonic and while goofing around dumped it all over the floor.  She tried to clean it up with a dustpan.  The pan was dripping milkshake, tracking the milkshake further throughout the restaurant.

With overpriced food, treating your customers badly, and behaving thoroughly unprofessionally (and I don't mean relaxed, I mean straight up bad), it's no wonder no one comes this place.  I doubt it's even up to code.

I can't wait until it is out of business and someone opens up a better restaurant.
