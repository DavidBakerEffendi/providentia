I never thought that I would do a one star review. Sadly this place didn't deserve more. I was in tonight for my cousin's wedding rehearsal dinner. It took 45 minutes JUST to get BREAD on the table.  Our salads were sitting, IN VIEW, and uncovered, that whole time - gross.  It took another 30 min for the rest of the foods to arrive, luke warm, and during that time not a single waiter/tress came back to refill water. My BROTHER finally took it upon himself to pour water for 30 people.  When he went to complain to the manager he was treated very rudely. Finally, after the meager dessert plates were put out the manager came in to give coffee to three out of the four tables. The fourth table NEVER got coffee.

Friends, I don't know how this place is still in business. Don't waste your time, money, and taste buds on this place.
