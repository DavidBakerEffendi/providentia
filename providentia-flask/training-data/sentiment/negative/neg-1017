This place is not vegan! I know the name says 'vegetarian' - however, most 'vegetarian' restaurants are in fact vegan. I use to dine here quit often, and have asked the server many times, if their food contains dairy, and they said no. Fast forward to a couple of hours earlier, when I was dining at their restaurant, I see cheese and mayo in their dishes! WTF?! I confronted the server about it, and she said some of their dishes does in fact contain dairy, and she looked at me like 'is there a problem?'. I'm never coming here again.
