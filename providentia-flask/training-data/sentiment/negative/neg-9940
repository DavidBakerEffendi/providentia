Avoid this place!!! I should have known not to come back after they forgot a whole pound of wings when we ordered take out and charged us for it. Went out with a group of 7 on Friday evening and our waitress was never to be found even though that place was dead. At one point we saw her sitting at a table with a bunch of guys clearly flirting. I get you need to work guests for tips but at the very least make sure your other tables are getting served. We had to flag down another server to ask for drinks and get better service. The food was subpar and my beer was flat. I didn't bother asking for another since it took so long to receive the first one! At the end we split the bills and didn't realize she already added gratuity to the bill, even though we were only 7 in our group(??) She ended up getting $70 tip on oue $145 bill. Extremely frustrating. We are definitely never coming back to this place. There are a ton of better eats in Richmond Hill!
