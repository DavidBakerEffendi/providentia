Met up with some friends. We've been going to coaches for over a year now and we Love the salads. But this visit was not so good. The salads for example,  chix Ceasar, gyro, salmon ( $10-$15) or specialty salads no longer come with romaine lettuce or mixed greens. Waitress told us from now on it's all "ice berg" for all the salads!  It's sad that the quality has gone and the portions have also, (didn't think we noticed coaches) down but hey the prices are the same. We won't be going back as we can get iceberg salads anywhere. Felt bad for waitress she was annoyed too.
