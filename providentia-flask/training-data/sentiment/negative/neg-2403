I came here the other day to have a bite to eat for lunch. When I got there the place seemed decent. After ordering my food I grabbed a seat at a very uncomfortable booth. What I ordered was A carne asada burrito that came with some tortilla chips. Once I was a few bites in I realized the burrito tasted horrible. I continued to eat it because well I payed for it! I got just over half way threw and had to throw it away because I couldn't hack it anymore. 

I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.
