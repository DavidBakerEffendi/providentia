Our visit was in a word, sad.  And I REALLY hate having to say that. Me and my S.O. were looking forward to trying this place, with him being from New York we are always on the lookout for a good bagel. 

We were seated promptly, so no problems there. The waiter came and offered to bring coffee or water as we were perusing the menu - still good. The problems came when we ordered. I ordered a nova lox sand which and I had the Yelp offer for the mimosa for 1 cent. So I tried to order it and the waiter cut me off and said he'd do that at the  end, not realizing I was trying to order the mimosa and not just trying to cash in on a separate Yelp deal. But. Whatever. S.O. Ordered the morning pile up. We got our food moderately fast and one fill up on our coffee. I still wanted a mimosa and I was going to order a black and white Cookie and a raspberry rugalah. But when our waiter returned he never asked if we wanted anything else-he simply dropped off the bill without saying a word. 
He never even asked if the food was good or if we needed a water, nothing. He offered the table next to us to pack up their coffee to go and I would've liked the same but he never asked. I will say that I know the waiter may have been having a rough day, but still. A little common kindness goes a really long way. I was hoping for a great experience and a new breakfast spot, and I ended up with neither. 

In summary - Coffee was just ok. Food was ok. (The morning pile up was a mess and tasted bland. My nova lox bagel was actually pretty good) Service was less than I hoped for and I strongly doubt that we will ever return.
