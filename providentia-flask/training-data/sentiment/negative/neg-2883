Not an especially attractive crowd.  I was with a big group and we entertained ourselves for hours.  
Bartenders were good. 
I stepped outside for a moment to say goodbye to my friends and they wanted me to go wait to get back in, and then pay,  just to close out my tab. 
The outside staff,  or maybe it was their instructions,  didn't sit well with me at all. The door girl especially was insulting.  I won't go back.  Too many better places in the area.
