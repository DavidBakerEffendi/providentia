Absolutely horribly disgusting place to eat. I hit one star on accident and don't know how to delete it. There are not enough words in the English dictionary to describe how bad this place is. The best part about this place is I didn't get sick. Stay away. You're better off eating out of the dumpster behind Taco Bell. And healthier for it.
