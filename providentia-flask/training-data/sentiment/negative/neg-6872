THE WORST HOTEL AND COSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! 
I don't normally write reviews but this place by far has been the worst hotel I have ever stayed out. 
The hotel was so old and dirty - it's different from the pictures on website. The staff was extremely rude and unprofessional - Specially Jill(picture attached) at front counter and the manger. Accusing me something I didn't do for to get my deposit. I finally left Hotel but they didn't give me fullly refund. They still wants to charge extra days that I wasn't staying and treat horribly because I was leaving the hotel. Ridiculous!!!
