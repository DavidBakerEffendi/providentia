Tried their signature chicken wings; not only was it more expensive than the other local wings places, I was genuinely surprised by the bad quality, considering that wings was supposed to be their specialty. The wings here are literally fried chicken carcasses, imagine KFC chicken but with all the chicken meat shaved off before deep frying - there is barely any meat, only bones! Also, the wings was not served with fries or anything filling but instead replaced by small portions of diced radish and coleslaw. Needless to say, if you are looking for a wings night, avoid this place at all cost.
