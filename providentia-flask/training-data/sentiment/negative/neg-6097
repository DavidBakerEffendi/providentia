Since I live two blocks away, and this is considered a historic restaurant in Old Town, I decided to take my boyfriend out for a night of mexican food and drinks without having to worry about driving home. He got the steak and shrimp fajitas and a corona. I got the fajita taco salad and a margarita. My margarita was watered down beyond belief and my bf's beer was nearly warm by the time we got it. The atmosphere is unique and reminds me of old mexico city, but with that comes dirty floors, flies, and gnats. Although the presentation of our food was beautiful, the quality of the food itself was a bit sketchy. The shrimp in the fajitas were over cooked and rubbery. The steak was also way over cooked and tough, and my chicken was very dry which is surprising since it was fajitas. Nonetheless, we endured our drinks through slow service and mediocre food just to later get sick that night and the following day. Which resulted in a ER visit and a day of lost work. Lets just say I will never return. And there are more authentic mexican places in the valley that wont get you sick. No wonder this place is running groupons ALL the time.
