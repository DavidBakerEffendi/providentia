I should give it NO STARS, but it won't let me.  The three girls working there were screaming at each other in Spanish, the man ahead of me had been waiting a long time, the guy 2 ahead of me got charged wrong and the lady was arguing with him (he had a coupon), the lady making my sandwich lost her knife and found it on the counter in a dirty place between the oven and another machine, I asked for her to use another one and she looked at me like I was crazy.  Reluctantly she went in the back to get another one while rolling her eyes.  I stayed to dine there so I could experience more, and EVERY ORDER was screwed up, they were rude to everyone.  And the keyboard to the register was covered in plastic wrap and completely disgusting.
