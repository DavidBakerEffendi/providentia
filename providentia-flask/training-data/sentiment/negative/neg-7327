Let's get the straight first, I love Jimmy John's. The one in Scottsdale is amazing and my go to for lunch. But this location by my house is complete garbage.

This place is unreal and ran by incompetent employees. 

I ordered delivery today and the order was taken as normal. It takes the driver over an hour to get my order to my house which is just 1.4 miles away. She got lost repeatedly and called me three times asking for directions. When she got here I still had to pay the bill. 

Sandwiches were great. But we didn't order enough. 

I called back and asked to get the same order again, and this dude tells me that I'm out of their delivery area.... what in the actual f&*k are you talking about? How? Your lost driver was just at my house. This is the third time I've had a delivery to my house and now they can't delivery after they completely wrecked my last order. 

I don't own a business, but I can tell you this is downright asinine, and if I did I, would train my employees to know right from wrong and what makes sense. 

So dumb. Just really really dumb.
