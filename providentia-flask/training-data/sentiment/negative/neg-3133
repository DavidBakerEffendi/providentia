Been here many times for breakfast when it was Three Sisters. It's a greasy spoon, neighborhood joint that makes a competent pancake along with some egg dishes. 

Now under new name but believe same owners - we return on a Sunday morning.  Menu had changed from our last visit.  Waitress comes over and asks if we're ready.  I pose a simple, polite question:  Are the sandwiches and salads (the whole right side of the menu) also available?  I had a vague recollection when it was Three Sisters that these were NOT available on the weekends.  Her response was loud, rude and inappropriate.  No! she yelled.  Salads and sandwiches are NOT available on the weekends!  She said this so loudly and with so much irritation in her intentionally robotic voice it was absurd.  Others in the room just sat staring.  It was so egregious I felt the need to say on an equal decibel level "Ok, ok, I get it!  You have been asked this before and it annoys you.  You're coming through really loud and clear! Enough."  A simple sticker on your 1974 menu with six words would correct what appears to be a serious hot button issue for you:  "This page not available on weekends."

Who goes out to breakfast on a Sunday morning to be spoken to like that?  Worse yet, one of the "sisters" was sitting at a table across from us with a friend.  The friend was enjoying a sandwich.  Really???? Where the hell is Larry David when you need him?  

Name should be My Rude Sisters Kitchens. And btw - why do your omelets have that strange sheen on them?  Oh right, its all that grotesque, unnecessary oil.  We won't be back, rude little sisters.
