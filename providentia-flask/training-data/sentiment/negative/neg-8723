I initially gave this place a 3-star rating, which is NOT bad.  According to Yelp, it's "A-OK".  I'm amending my review to 1 star because I'm entitled to my opinion and don't appreciate getting insulting, nasty e-mail from the proprietor because she doesn't like what I have to say.  Seriously, how unprofessional is that?!  It wasn't hard to figure out who it was.

Allow me to share the gist of this exchange: Out of the blue - like 2 years after I ate there, I get a message  telling me to stop reviewing [read censorship], saying that I have no idea what I'm talking about, that my "whole life" [yes, she said this] revolves around complaining about an industry she says I don't understand, and that I was pathetic.  [Uh, seriously?!  Yeah, total low-blow personal attack.]  I responded that she has no idea of my pedigree or what I know and scoffed at the notion that she could judge my "whole life" based on Yelp reviews.  [She's sending me nasty e-mail because she can't handle my personal opinion of a subjective experience 2 years earlier, and she calls ME pathetic?!  Yeah, that's obviously PSYCHO.]  I suggested that instead of spewing her negative energy and vitriol, she could use the energy to improve her business so people can't complain.

I mean, there's obviously a problem with not being able to take criticism constructively, which seems like an issue in an industry where you're trying to please people.  It's not personal lady - get a grip.  Is she running a business? If so, you would think she would want to improve it to entice and keep customers, not insult them.  But, according to her, what do I know?

Her actions and comments are beyond rude, ill-mannered, stupid, and unprofessional.  I certainly won't be back and won't be recommending this place to any of my numerous friends and colleagues, who trust my opinion and seek out my recommendations in the industry I supposedly know nothing about (if she only knew - I want to brag so badly - ha ha).  Her loss.
