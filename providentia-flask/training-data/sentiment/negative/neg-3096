My love for this place had a full 180 degree turn.

One Monday afternoon, my boyfriend was craving some cheap breakie food so we wanted to come back from the amazing experience we had last. The menu Is extensive and they had a huge variety from sandwiches, soup, breakfast , pasta...

At least that's what I thought...

Me:"may I please have an order of the fish and chips"
Lady :"ok...no problem"... She then walks into the kitchen and came back out.. "Sorry. No fish and chips today.. Only Friday and Sundays."
Me:" ok.. Then can I please get a burger.. Make my fries a poutine please !"
Lady:" we don't have cheese curds"
Me :" I'm fine with marble cheese"
Lady:"we don't carry that either. Just cheddar cheese. "
Me :" ok that's fine"
Lady : comes back in a few minutes "sorry we don't have burgers today."
Me:... "So.. What do you have?"
Lady : "just wraps , sandwiches , and breakfast "
Me: " ok... I'll have the steak sandwich done rare please... With a ceasar salad.
Lady :"no ceasar salad"
Me :"ok then. Just boring plain fries."

After 20 minutes do patiently waiting, my food finally came out. Steak cold. But at least my fries were warm... But we I indulge in my cold steak. Found a little hairy surprise. 

I am utterly disgusted and irritated . I don't even need to rant here, you guys get the picture
