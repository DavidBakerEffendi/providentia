// The Bad //
- Hostess invaded my personal space by grabbing a very personal pendant I wear without asking permission and was way too close in general.
- The food took a long time to reach us. 15 minutes for two burgers and fries.
- When the food arrived, half of my friend's 1 lb. burger was completely raw, mine 1/3 lb. burger was only slightly undercooked.
- The waitstaff was inefficient. During the first five or so minutes of our meal, we had three servers visit us a total of six times. During the last five minutes of our meal, no one came by.

// The Good //
+ My shake was delicious. Great consistency and flavor for something super customizable (you can choose from like 30 different flavors).
+ My burger was tasty.
+ The pricing is reasonable.

Summary:
Go to pickup a shake, but stay away from the hostess and keep a good grip on your valuables and things you don't want.
