This place used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. What the hell happened? I told myself that I wouldn't mind paying a 15 dollar cab ride(one way) to Chinatown to eat here but it was terrible this time. The won tons here used to be great. The roasted duck was awesome. It's just not the same anymore. I hate to say this but I think MGM's Grand Wok is a lot better than this place. Not only that...........the prices are comparable to casino restaurants. After the cab fare...........Sam Woo is probably more expensive. 

A real disappointment.

For a real decent Chinese restaurant off the strip................try Joyful House.  They have the best soy sauce supreme shrimps.  It's more of a dinner place but I love their food.
