First, let me share that I've spent close to 200 nights in Las Vegas, mostly in hotels ranging from cheap to very pricey (depending largely on who was paying-- me or my company!) so i speak from a lot of firsthand experience.

To cut to the chase: 

LIKED:
1. off the strip
2. next to Bass Pro Shop
3. rustic environment (except for the very plain and unmemorable room)
4. easy parking
5. relatively inexpensive

DISLIKED:
1. The room's air conditioner/heater sounded like a jet engine (and management didn't care) so you HAD to wear ear plugs to sleep
2. Small refrigerator had been removed from its ugly, scratched furniture leaving a big hole.
3. We were told that "NO" hotels in Las Vegas had refrigerators or microwaves in them (I know this to be wildly inaccurate), but if we wanted a refrigerator it would cost $15 a day! (I can buy one for $100)
3. Bathtub/shower wall had small chunks taken out of it
3. No exhaust fan in the bathroom
4. Ancient, small tube (CRT) TV in room. Very 1980's. Or even 1970's.
5. Walls were VERY thin-- you can easily hear the content of your neighbor's conversations
6. Awful smoke from lobby made it all the way into our room on the 4th floor at night, so the room STANK while you were trying to sleep
7. Ridiculous daily $4.99 "resort fee" for stuff we did not need (airport shuttle), which actually was closer to $6 after taxes.
8. $11 daily fee for internet!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? CHARGING $11 FOR WiFI IN 2014? 
(Or you can sit in the horribly smoke-filled lobby and use it for free while getting lung cancer. You decide.)
9. So after the fees, your $59/night room is now closer to $80-- and there are nicer places in L.V. for that which also get you free breakfast and free WiFi.

Some nice staff (Teddy, for example), some that were mostly unfriendly. 
They nickel and dime you for things that should be included.
Will not be back.
I do not recommend The Silverton.
