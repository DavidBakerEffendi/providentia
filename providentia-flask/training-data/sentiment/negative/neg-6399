Frustrating wait with table assignment system. Needed to make a loud scene to get a table.

I took my family of 4 to this restaurant on Mother's Day, just before noon. The line up outside was not long. The receptionist told my wife that it would be a 10-15 minute wait. We were assigned a number 102 when they were serving numbers in the 80's.  We thought that was a reasonable wait. After 20 minutes they were calling numbers past ours. When we inquired, the receptionist said these were for large tables. There were still 3 others before us waiting for table of 4 or less. We inquired several times after that and was given the same answer.

After 1 hour, they were calling numbers in the 140's. There were still 3 others for table of 4 ahead of us. One customer after us for table of 4 started to complain about the long wait and they were given a big table as long as they were willing to share the table. They did not land up sharing. After 1 hour and 20 minutes, they were calling numbers in the 150's. I started to complain to the receptionist and she just ignored me. Another customer waiting started to complain loudly in Mandarin until management came to investigate. When I joined in the complaint, it got pretty loud. To keep us quiet, they gave us a table which was set up for 6.  I am sure that if we did not complain, we would not have got a table until past 2:00 PM. 

The restaurant was set up for sitting larger group for Mother's Day. Tables normally for 4 were squeezed in for 6. Therefore there were very few tables for 4 or less. That was just greedy.
Looks like at this restaurant, you have to complain loudly just to get fairly treated. I would not recommend a family of 4 to go to this restaurant. They are just not interested in your business.
