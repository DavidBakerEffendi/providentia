Literally one of the worst Cheesecake experiences I have ever had in America or abroad. You expect consistency and at least passable quality when going to a chain establishment, but not the case here at this location. Wednesday night last week stopped in for a late dinner (9PM) after a long day. The server was great very attentive, but unfortunately the same couldn't be said about the kitchen. Ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps  and my friend ordered a burger - one hour in an empty restaurant to grill some chicken - and plate it with lettuce. Kind of crazy, no apology from the waiter on the wait. 

Food finally came out - there were three chicken pieces on the plate - 3 about the size of two of my fingers side by side. - $14 for that? Sauce was missing from the plate and the lettuce was rotting. I wish I would have stopped to talk to a manager, but after a long day all I wanted was to eat and go home especially after an hour wait in a basically empty restaurant. 

I really hope this location gets it together, because this experience has a previously loyal customer questioning future visits.
