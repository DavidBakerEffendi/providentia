Never got a chance to eat here. Waited to be seated and no one ever came out. We came around 11:10. The sign in front says to wait to be seated. We waited for a few minutes and realized there was a bell. We rang the bell and no one came out. We can hear people in the back, so we waited and then a few mins later, we rang the bell again. My bf even yelled out, hello?? And still no one. After 10 min. We saw a guy at the open service window and my bf said excuse me. He looked at him, ignored him and walked away. At that point, we left because they obviously didn't want to serve anyone. Horrible. Never tried their food, but I will never come back to an establishment that doesn't care about their customers to even say hi.
