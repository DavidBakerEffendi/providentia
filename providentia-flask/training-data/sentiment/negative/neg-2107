I really want to like Panera Bread because I like the idea of it! It's convenient and they have healthier options. But everything I have tried tastes like a frozen microwaveable sandwich. Today I tried the Spinach Avocado Breakfast sandwich and it was extremely disappointing.  The bread was so soggy it was inedible. They didn't even bother to slice the avocado. It still had the hollow from the pit. And the black stem was still attached. Yuck!
