Okay this is serious! I don't ever give bad reviews but feel that I've had enough of this narcissistic pizza eatery. So let's talk food yes the pizza is good no doubt! Wood fired pizza is amazing but it's just that anywhere, but that's all it is.  Now they don't take reservations and your entire party needs to be present if you want your table. Yesterday I was told it was only half your party and that they were "reserving spots" at the bar. So they change their rules when they see fit, which is their right but it's my right not to eat there. They are unapologetic and slightly rude like a hot cheerleader who gets hit on constantly. Here is the kicker!! They told us to give them our cell phone number and go to another restaurant as we weren't allowed to wait in the their lobby. I started to laugh and told them if I go to another restaurant I am eating there with all due respect. The manager than came to speak with us and even though there were people behind us waiting we were told to wait next door. In the end I may just invest a few thousand dollars and help the business next door install a pizza oven so they can than welcome guests properly. Yes this place is popular but their prices are ridiculous when u really see what you get for the amount of food you receive the value just isn't there. I think it's time this place realized that customers are what's important. Ask not what your customer can do for you rather ask what you can do for your customer. Please join me in selecting another newer and friendlier place to eat next time you head out to spend your hard earned money. Thanks for reading!
