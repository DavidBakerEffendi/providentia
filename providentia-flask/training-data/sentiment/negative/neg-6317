Left after receiving our drinks. Went in with my son, a few people in the place. The host was not a host at all. I had to speak to him or he would of probably let us stand waiting on a table. An open booth was available but for some reason he wanted to clean a dirty table off for us. We got seated and one waitress took our order for our drinks. Another waitress brought us our drinks and said another waitress would come take our order. We waited on her but no one ever came. A group of 8 came in and there order was taken before our waitress came. We walked out. When we left, the host was playing on his phone and never said a word to us when we left. Never try it again.
