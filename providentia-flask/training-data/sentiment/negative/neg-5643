I don't leave a lot of bad review but when a place has to be horrible 2 out of 2 times then it's time for a bad review.  I came here once about a year ago and the food was ok and the service was horrible.  

Today I come and I try the drive thru.  They ya e a double drive thru.  One had a vehicle and the person was placing a order I went to the open spot.  I sat there easily 5 minutes and then I backed up and tried again. I finally decided to go to the other spot and I then sat there for another couple minutes.  Finally a guy comes and I can't here him and he can't here me so I finally just backed up and left.  

I guess these service issues explain why this location had no customer except the 1 ahead of me (who some how got service). 


NEVER AGAIN
