Wish I had read the reviews before going there this evening.  Food was blah.... Mexican my ass. I had fish tacos, I've had better at most fast food joint. My friend had taquitoes " not sure I spelled that right" I think they bought them at Costco.  She didn't even eat them. On to the margaritas..... what can I say all juice. I didn't taste tequila at all. I know you can argue a good drink doesn't taste like alcohol.  You're right, but tequila has a distinct taste....you know it's there, well it wasn't.  Dummy us we even order the big one. Lesson learned....read the damn reviews,  that's what they are there for!
