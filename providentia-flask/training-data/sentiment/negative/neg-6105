I have been dying to try this place out, but sadly I didn't...and probably never will. Reason being, sorry ass customer service!! I won't stop there though, so let me elaborate. We walked in and immediately made eye contact with the bartender, who said nothing. We continued to stand at the hostess counter for another 5 minutes, as we skimmed through a menu without any recognition whatsoever. All while 3 female servers moseyed about the empty restaurant; one refilling water on the sole occupied table, one clearing off dishes from a previously occupied table (that was empty when we arrived), and another walked up and down the hallway with her empty tray. Let's get back to the bartender though who continuously made eye contact with me...more than a handful of times, yet said nothing at all. Yeah you, guy with the tattoo on your neck...your customer service skills suck!!! Sadly the empty martini glasses you moved about from one side of the bar to another were clearly more important than attending to two very hungry customers that were anxious to give Lucky Foo's a shot!! Oh well, off to Tokyo Boys where customer service and food is always at it's finest!!
