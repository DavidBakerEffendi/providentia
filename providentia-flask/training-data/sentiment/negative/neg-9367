I must preface this with the fact that I eat at chipotle quite frequently. However, after today I don't think I will be eating there any time soon. I went on lunch break to get my husband and I a quick bite to eat. 

I ordered a burrito with chicken for my husband and a burrito bowl with chicken for myself. It was the lunch rush hour and the chicken was empty, so I agreed to wait a few min for some more to come out. I patiently waited about 3-5 min and finally the chicken came out they finished our meals with the toppings and I was out the door. At home I opened my bowl and much to my DISMAY the chicken was RAW in the middle like not just kind of pink, TOTALLY PINK. I ran to my husband to have him check his burrito before eating and it was also RAW. I couldn't believe it so I called the branch immediately and asked to speak to a manager. The girl on the phone informed me that due to the rush hour I couldn't speak to one. I explained to her that my food had raw chicken in it and she offered for us to come back for a free replacement. 

I quickly said absolutely NOT! I watched them throw the chicken from the grill onto a used cutting board with a used knife that cuts all the cooked chicken, they MUST know that if there was just ONE breast of raw chicken that was cut with those instruments, that means that the whole process and kitchen area has been contaminated. 

In conclusion I will NOT be returning to that Chipotle.
