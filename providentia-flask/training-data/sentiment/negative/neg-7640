This by far is some of the worst food I have ever had in my 40 years on earth. I would rather have a cold can of spam. How does this happen at one of the United States busiest airports. Wow. 

The cook was using dirty pans used on previous orders. I saw him cook shrimp for a burrito and then use it to cook chicken for someone. Wtf!!!!

All bad!!!
