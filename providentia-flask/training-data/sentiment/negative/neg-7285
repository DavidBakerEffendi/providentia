After writing an amazing review last time we used the catering again.  Boy that was a mistake.  Second time was so so disappointing. Brisket  was so bland and fatty.  The beans came out of a can. The potato salad was obviously old no one even ate it.  Here I had bragged to my guests how good it was. Major  major poor quality. The ribs were cold and meatless.  Not going to have this again.
