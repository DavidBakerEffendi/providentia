I will start by saying that one of the great things about the original Klondike, was the value. For $1.99 you could get a great cheeseburger, made of freshly ground beef, on a toasted bun, with steak fries. The taste was fantastic. So I eagerly awaited the re-opening of this place, hoping that once again I would have a place to get a great old school cheese burger. Today I tried the new Klondike, yes the price of the burger increased 500%, I expected that, things have gone up in the last 15 years. However I did not expect the burger I got. It was a 1/2 pound frozen patty on a type of bun that was called a name I could not pronounce. The burger was totally tasteless, it had all the flavor of a piece of cardboard. The fries were nothing special. And when I asked the waitress to please leave the pickle off the plate, because I don't like the taste of pickles, it comes with one anyway so my crappy bun is soaking up the pickle juice. I could not even finish this terrible meal. All this at 500% more. I won't be back. It a shame that the current generation running these places has zero concept of the value this town was built on. I guess old Vegas truly is gone for good.
