I was a little hesitant writing a review seeing as we never even got the pizza but I figure the world should know our story. I'm staying at a resort off the strip and had a flyer of theirs in my room so I thought I'd give them a chance. I placed an order at 10pm on a Sunday and was quoted a 45 minute delivery time. By about 11 I decided to call and check on how things were going and was told the delivery driver was parking and on our way up to the room and verified the room number with me. 45 MORE minutes later and still no pizza!!! This time when I called I was told I never answered the door (which had mysteriously changed numbers apparently) and it's MY FAULT they 'wasted their time driving 13 miles away to our resort'. 

So here's a bit of advice: don't waste your time with this shitty place!!!
