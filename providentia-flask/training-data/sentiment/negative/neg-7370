I never write reviews but thanks to Original Joe's I have created a Yelp account. 

My experience at Original Joes was awful. I was with a group of friends celebrating a birthday and we decided to go to Original Joe's. When we went inside we weren't greeted, so we decided to find a seat our selves at the very back because it was crowded in the front. Once we seated our selves it took 10 minutes for a server to come. Nichole is her name, she's very rude and unprofessional. My friends and I decided to order drinks, I ordered a shot, and when I got my shot I noticed about 8-10 little bugs in it. I told my server Nichole and she said "it happens"..what do you mean it happens?! 

By the end of the night, I had to pay for my nasty shot. The manager didn't even come to see if everything was okay. I was going to order food there but since I got a bug shot I felt the kitchen was probably not up to standard. 

The following day I phone the manager and explained what happened. He didn't care one bit, he said covered my shot (which they did not) and was being very rude on the phone. I explained to him that I'm a Chef and that you should have standards and if you don't that get out of the industry. 

What happened to me was because of laziness. The bartenders probably don't cover their liquor bottles at the end of the night which results in bug shots. 

If you want to see the picture I have posted it. So people eating/drinking at Original Joe's be aware.
