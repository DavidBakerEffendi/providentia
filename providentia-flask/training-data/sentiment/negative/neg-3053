At today's Madison Bash 2017, I waited for about 1 hour for my three orders (2x Outlaws & 1x Chicken bang bang). The wait was so long that people left to order food at the other vendors, ate, and came back to wait in the Electric Sliders line. Two customers ahead of me demanded their money back and left (one of them a mother who missed her child's performance). One of Madison's employees stopped by to ask the order taker if she was doing well. The order taker said she needed change. Big mistake on the owner's/operator's part; you should ALWAYS have at least $300 worth of small bills for change. During my time at the truck, the Madison employee hadn't come back.

I finally get my food! I bite down into my Outlaw slider and noticed my beef wasn't fully cooked! Only one of the three sliders was fully cooked. By this time, I'm overheated from standing in the sun, really hungry, and irritated. I went back to the food truck and asked for my money back. I've never had an experience like this, nor have I had to ask for my money back. By this time, the other food truck lines were long. I couldn't bear having to wait longer for food. I was so hungry that we decided to leave the Bash early without getting to see the rest of the event. Very disappointed.
