Sorry yummy yummy, I'm hoping what I ate stays in my tummy.  We had food delivered (which was free of charge--nice!) and it arrived close to when promised.  It was almost cold, which seemed a little odd for a quick delivery from 3 miles away.

Other than being cold the food looked really good, but the Little Lady immediately noticed the cashews she had paid an extra $2 for were not included in her meal.  Boo.  Then I had my first bite of General Tso's chicken...and it tasted like battered packing peanuts!  Holy great wall it was bad, worst Generals chicken I ever had.  No flavor whatsoever.

I was starving so I doused it in hot sauce and soy sauce (don't even try the duck sauce--not sure of it's composition but not good) and scarfed some down and tossed the rest.  And now I sit here waiting, wishing, and hoping my iron stomach comes through and I avoid any double dragon action over the next 12 hours.  Wish me luck.
