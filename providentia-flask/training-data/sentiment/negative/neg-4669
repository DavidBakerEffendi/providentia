Wish I could rate a zero! Horrible customer service!! The lady who took my order was wrong and she would not own up to it, I asked her to change it and she yelled that she did not misunderstand me that it's my fault, never has anyone been so rude in the customer service, never going to order from here again, and I suggest you don't either!
