This place is awful!! I ordered on Yelp's Eat24 app at 8:42 pm. The estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes. My food didn't arrive until 10:40 - almost two hours later. The delivery driver didn't speak English, his phone died, and the manager said she couldn't help him with directions because she was at home. It was a mess and completely ruined my Friday night plans - as I was on the phone on and off for over 35 minutes! Once the sushi finally came, I was even more disappointed. The sushi was soggy and tasted old, like it had been sitting out for days. This is truly a disappointment! Never again!!
