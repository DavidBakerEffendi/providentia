I just ate here today. Food was great until the owner came and offered to clear the table. We said yes as we thought it was a sign for us to leave. The owner than said next time you come you should finish this (2/3 eaten fried rice). I was not happy about the service as it felt rushed and inconsiderate. There will be no next time!
