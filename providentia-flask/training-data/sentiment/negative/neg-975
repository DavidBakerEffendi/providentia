As a Korean who grew up eating at this place when I was a teenager, I came back to try it again. The place has completely become a place for for NON-Koreans, as a matter of fact on a weekend lunch I didn't see one other table of Koreans. 

The side dishes which come out first are complete disasters - they look Korean but they are not korean, the end. The kimchi is extremely sweet (red in color but so salty and sweet) and the radish is also drenched in sugar you could feel the sugar grains. If the owner and the workers don't eat their own food for lunch what does that say about this place? 

I'm quite sad to know that there are a lot of Torontonians who believe that this is what Korean tastes like.
