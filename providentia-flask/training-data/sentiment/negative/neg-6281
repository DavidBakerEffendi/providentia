I had a bad experience at this restaurant, the manager Jeff Evans contacted me and assured me that he would make it right by crediting me for the burnt steak and salty sauces. I had offered to pay for the rest of the meal. It has now been 18 days of excuses and then ignoring my emails asking when the credit will be issued on my credit card. I am so disappointed, I tried to contact the manager of the Palms. Hopefully he will read this.
