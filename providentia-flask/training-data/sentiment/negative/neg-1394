Apparently I'm a glutton for punishment. All your obvious problems aside you do have the best bagels in Vegas. Of course that is only true if you get the bagels you ordered. 
Stopped in for a dozen after lunch. Yes I understand it's Sunday but coming from NY I still can't believe that if a place runs out of certain flavors they don't make more. Surprisingly you had pumpernickel. Too bad you gave me a shortchanged dozen everything bagels (I ordered 2). Not surprised. I should know by now that the guys behind the counter can't count. Even if you tell them how many of each bagel. Always short 1 or 3. 
So now I really & truly am done with you. No more messed up orders. No more low quality food. No more e-coli from your undercooked frozen burger patties. No more crappy service. No more surly attitudes from counter guys. No more pathetic excuses for a manager. 
I guess I'll have bagels & pastrami again next visit to NY.
