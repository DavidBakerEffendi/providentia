Horrible service. They weren't even busy, only myself and 2 other people there. The girl helping me was literally dumping food into my bowl like it was such an inconvenience; reminded me a the lunch lady who hates her job. I asked her for an extra side of medium salsa and she gave me a drop! Everything was disgusting. Sorry. The chips were so stale and so, SO salty. The salsa was watered down. Waste of a $10, since majority of it was thrown away. The worst location I have been to. Chipotle corporate should mystery shop this location and actually train their employees.
