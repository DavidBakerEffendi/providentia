Horrible place to get lit.... They feel as if they are an actual nightclub in one of the prestigious Las Vegas resorts.... In reality, you're a bar in downtown Las Vegas.... In the muck.... I never feel safe there and security is an absolute joke. It reminds me of Paul Blart security enforcement at this mid-grade, at best, establishment. I'm not even this disappointed when I go to PT's Pub.....
