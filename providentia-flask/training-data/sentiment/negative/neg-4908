If only I could give no stars at all.

I frequent the Eggsmart at Woodbine and John, so when I go to an Eggsmart, I don't expect fancy food like Smash or Inspire. 

The food at this Eggsmart was terrible. 

I ordered a classic breakfast, that included 3 poached eggs, 4 strips of bacon, 4 slices of toast, a slice of orange and a slice of papaya. As the server came with the food, I could see from the bottom of the plate that 2 of the toasts were burnt, to the degree that it was completely black. When the server put the plate in front of me, everything looked fine, so I assumed she didn't know about the burnt toasts and I flipped the burnt ones for her to see. Even showing her the burnt toasts didn't elicit any reaction. She dropped 2 pouches of jam and asked if there's anything else I need, then she left. Aside from this, the fruit slices were paper thin, much smaller than the ones served at any other Eggsmart locations I have visited. 

I have never left an Eggsmart without a fully satisfied tummy until this. I am definitely not returning.
