They started out not so bad when they opened. We assumed they would eventually take cards instead of only cash, but after all this time they STILL only take cash! You can't eat inside because they have no air conditioning and we used to get take out quite often from them, but then stopped because every single time the whole order would be very wrong. The food is way too over priced for my order to be completely wrong every single time. After many many times of this we just couldn't take it any more and stopped ordering. Their food is good when it is correct, but the whole execution of the business is done poorly.
