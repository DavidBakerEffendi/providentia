My boyfriend and I have been doing more take out recently and with our latest sushi craving, we ended up ordering from Ume Fashion Sushi. Looking at the Yelp reviews, we figured it would be a decent place to get food from as the ratings were fairly high. However we were wrong.

Upon scanning the menu, it seemed decent. Prices were a bit high but we figured it would still be cheaper than dining-out. We made a $50 purchase which included 5 rolls and a beef teriyaki bento box.

The beef teriyaki bento box was $16.95 so we figured there would be quite a bit of food. However, we got about 7 small strips of beef drenched in sauce. The beef was chewy and difficult to eat. The amount of rice was unimpressive and the miso soup was grainy and unpleasing. The bento included 5 pieces of sushi (3 salmon and 2 shrimp) and a 4-piece California roll. The sushi was quite small and the salmon was cut really thin. It was nothing special. I don't like California rolls as I'm a fan of raw fish so I don't want to give a bias review on the Cali rolls. Overall, it was a pathetic amount of food that didn't even taste that good.
We struggled to finish the food, not because there was too much but because we found it difficult to get down. The spicy salmon rolls we ordered didn't taste very fresh and we felt sick after eating the meal. 

We easily spend $50 when we dine out for sushi but the quality we get is so much better. I think I'd prefer just going out to sushi places I trust rather than ordering delivery from a place called Ume Fashion Sushi.
