WORST dining experience I can remember in years.

Food was okay, service was slow.  You could tell the wait staff was embarrassed.  They apologized, offered  free drinks, yet were so slow, never delivered on the promise.  We did the tasting menu, and I did not like one dish, took one bite and pushed away (Pork Belly, I am usually a fan).  Wait staff was so behind, my full plate was not even questioned. 

I would have understood a bad night, but the fact that Rick Moonens was in the dining room enjoying drinks with friends while his staff struggled really left a 'bad taste in my mouth.'  Poor showing.
