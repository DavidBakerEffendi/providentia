First time eating here because was working in the area and was craving Chinese food. Typical Chinese restaurant which is fine with me. Love them, always check them out. 

Food was what you expected. Tasted great, great service. So why the 1 star? 

This is the first time I've ever found a bug in my food. Not just a small ant or fly, a two inch long grub nestled right at the bottom of my plate of course after I ate everything. 

So while I know mistakes happen and things can happen out of your control, I feel as this might be a case of generic Chinese restaurant syndrome. 

Positive side, atleast I liked my good while I ate it.
