This review is for the service and overall experience. This review is NOT for the food. We wanted to goto Shake Shack which is next to Toms Urban in NYNY. Well Shake Shack was packed so Toms Urban it was. When we walked up to the host, she wasnt very friendly and didnt greet us. To me first impressions by the host is a big deal and sets the tone. We shouldve just left  but decided to stay. I ordered an All American burger and few other stuff. When i saw someone carrying out a tray of food around the restaurant looking for the right table to drop off the food i knew it was our food. The guy carrying the tray gives up and takes the food back to the kitchen. A few mins later he finally finds us and drops the food off. When i got my burger all i got was pickles ketchup and mustard. To me when i read ALL AMERICAN burger i think of a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. Well the ALL AMERICAN burger only came with pickles and kethcup and mustard. McDonalds cheeseburger has more toppings than that which comes with onions. So i asked them about the burger and they tell me it only comes with only pickles, ketchiup and mustard. So he asks me if i want lettuce, onions and tomatoes. I tell him yes.. He then disappears and  never brings me my lettuce, tomatoes and onions. By this time my burger is cold and our waiter comes by and i tell her the problem and advise her i do not want my cold burger. She then asks me if i want a refill on my club soda i tell her yes..She forgets my club soda andi remind her and she brings me a to go cup. WTF!! i was livid so i advise the manager of my experience and he advises me there is no excuse and comps my whole check which was not what i was looking for..I just wanted good service!! the other food we got was actually goood so im sure the burger wouldve been good with my lettuce , tomatoes and onions. This place put a bad taste in my mouth with the service..i would not go back ever again.
