Easily one of the worst restaurants , experience, and concept i have ever been to. I was shopping with a friend in the mall about two weeks ago. We were walking back and forth and debating if we should give this one a try and then unfortunately we did. We went downstairs and there was 3 hostesses. They took our name down and asked us to wait for 10-15 mins for a table of TWO. Funny thing is that i was walking around and out of like the 200 seats they had or even way more there was only around 20-25 people. I didnt get why we had tl wait this long. Anyway finally we sat down and ordered our server was professional and nice so far. Food is really average and i would even say slightly under average. Now the worst part when i wanted to pay our server was no where to be found. 5 minutes after i realize that our server and 3 more server are standing and playing with their phones in the small drink station that they have. I literally stood up, waved, whistled , tried to grab their attention in anyway but they were too busy laughing and showing each other videos. I had to wait 17 minutes for me to order my bill and 10 more minutes for him to bring it back so i can take some of the change back as our bill was 60 and i left a 100. So basically my experience at that location was 15 mins wait to get seated, 30 minutes ordered/ate, and 27 minutes to pay. Will not be back.
