Terrible service - left to wait for a long time in drive thru with no greeting. Later told no orders were being taken due to computers. It's a dual drive - I can hear you takings orders in the other speaker. When finally spoken to and denied service I advised them to tell me this earlier and he stated he was talking to other ppl. Yes, I can hear them. Apologize to me, offer a credit or even just let me know in a timely manner. Don't argue!
