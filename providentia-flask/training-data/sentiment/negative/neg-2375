Sadly, this weekly favorite recently changed hands and the quality of the food declined. First to go were the delicious eggplant sandwiches. Tried the new veggie sandwich which sadly only contained only potatoes. Then the quality of the remaining ingredients began to decline (tabouleh with vinegar?). The result, I have been searching for another place to satisfy the hunger for a decent falafel or eggplant sandwich.
