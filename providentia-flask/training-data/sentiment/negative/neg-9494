We made a reservation for a 7pm Teppanyaki seating and arrived (on time) to find out it was overbooked. The host asked us to wait 10 minutes while he cleared a space for us and promised to "take care of us."  After waiting outside for 20 minutes we went inside to remind him that we were still waiting. A space was cleared for us about 5 minutes later and we were seated by someone else. No one came to greet us or take a drink order after several more minutes. We got up and left without a word for another restaurant. Will not return.
