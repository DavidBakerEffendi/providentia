This location is not up to the standards of the others in the city. We've been here twice, and that's enough. One thing I will never understand is a server who forgets about a table who has no beer. Beer is a great way to drive revenue at your pub, hence most servers come by before you're even done. This one forgot about us for lengths at a time, on a day where it was very quiet in the restaurant. 

We had a few friends who ordered food. Two were forgotten, one got the wrong order, and the other was charged for something complete different than what they received. One of the two that never got their food (1 hour wait) just cancelled, the other said she'd still take it but just bring it to go as we wanted to just leave. Of course, it was not brought to-go. At this point the situation was just funny. More of a cringey nightmare than anything.

In summary: Forgot orders, brought the wrong orders, ignored requests, overcharged, forgot about the table, and then still wanted to point out to us that "that doesn't cover the tip". Right. Not going back here. Extremely poor management. 

We should all demand more out of our pubs!
