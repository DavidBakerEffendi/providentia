Good thing we were starving otherwise we would have left. The food was very bland. No seasoning whatsoever. They must give you large portions to make up for the blah food. There were no other tables in the restaurant and the service was still mediocre. All the people working were shoving their faces with food in plain sight. Not very appetizing. Won't be returning to Dominic Santos' ever.
