I love wit, mean, & below the belt jokes but this place has none! My experience with Dicks has been Long & Lengthy so I can honestly tell you, that you will be disappointed by the lack of Dick's here.
The staff is very polite, but thats not why I came! The jokes are non-existent and they resorted to racial comments while I was here. calling my girlfriend the "N" word and thinking its funny is not ok. I think That's when  the bartender realized he crossed the line. In this political climate you should lay off the race jokes, since you are still in hospitality. Management if you would like details on the employee please message me.  I dont want to put this bartender on blast in a public forum since you allow them to joke like this at work.
