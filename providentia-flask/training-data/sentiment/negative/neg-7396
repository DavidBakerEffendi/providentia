Used to go here quite a bit during week and on the weekends.  The last couple of times it seems that the quality has gone down.  The cauliflower tacos were my fav at one time but now have continuously been served a bit greasy.  We went 2 days ago in the evening and I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  The biscuits were extremely hard.  We also ordered the rosemary cookies and they were truly hard and when we went to exchange for something else, they said it would cost us more lol - when we told them about the cookies as well as demonstrated how hard they were the staff said they had changed the recipe.  I used to love this place but definitely off of my list to never return.  Too bad - good news is New American Green is across the street and always consistent with quality and tasty vegan food.
