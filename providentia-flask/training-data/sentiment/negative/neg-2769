Pretentious. Superficial. Rude. Ignorant. Arrogant. And Careless.

Only a few of the words to explain my recent experience at this Earls.

I truly was expecting better from this Stephen Avenue hot spot, but I can guarantee that I will never step foot in here again.

The servers were rude, the staff lead was extremely snobby, and after having left several messages for the restaurant manager and him not calling me back, I have nothing but disgust for this restaurant.

No redeeming qualities about it and the fact that the people in charge treated me with such disrespect and did not even have the COURTESY to return my messages speaks for itself.

I wouldn't suggest you make this place a part of your evening out. You are bound to be disappointed.
