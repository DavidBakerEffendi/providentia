Here for a convention...went to taxi stand for convention center side and lots of folks  (including me) waiting for taxis that never came.  A security guard stated that when the light for that stand us lit that they are supposed to come  he called and radioed and still no luck. Everyone gave up and either called uber or walked back to the main lobby. I went to the taxi stand and there were maybe 50 cabs waiting there. I asked the attendant and he said...yeah I know and there is nothing I can do. And that none of the taxis want to go to that side. I said well at least take down the signs at least so people don't walk all the way over there and wait and then have to walk all the way back. Spoke to the vendor for the conference as well since they ALSO had their own signs pointing to the taxi stand. No luck there either...I said again at least take the signs down
