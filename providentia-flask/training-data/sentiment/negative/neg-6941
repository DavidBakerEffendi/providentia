Heard this place was terrible from a family friend & wish I would've taken his opinion to heart. My fiance & I were scouting Retro Dog out for possibly having their food truck for our wedding reception but they instantly failed. 

I am a french fries queen! I can tell you who has the best fresh cut, frozen, sweet potato, etc fries around and Retro Dog is not one of them. They claim to be fresh cut but they tasted a little frozen. My fries were not raw but were definitely not cooked long enough (no crisp, just limp d*ck). Sadly, bathing them in a small cup of salt & malt vinegar didn't save the day. 

Then my fiance ordered their Chicago & White dog but said they weren't very good & he could've made better at home. He also ordered their tempura onion rings- F**king disgusting!!!! The onions inside were cut way too thick & therefore weren't cooked all the way.  The batter tasted like idk what- a really bad knock off of Arby's curly fries &, again, was undercooked & greasy. Even if I had just gotten off of a crappy 12 hour shift at work with no break and an hour long drive home I wouldn't eat their food. Less than 15 minutes later I got heart burn so...


As for their service- not bad, but their Root beer float was the only good thing that I had. But i must admit, I love the concept & the decor- just not the food!
