Well from 5 to 1 star!  Walked in, not busy at all.  I prefer having a small table rather than a high stool.  They told me "sit there."  I asked for the location I wanted to sit at and I was told "no".  Keep in mind, the entire place was open and only needed to have a 30-45 minute lunch.  Was a fan and regular, but I told them not to worry about it I would go next door and eat and they watched me leave.  This place makes you quickly eat and move on.  Not good for a sushi place.  It's already hard to get to, parking is bad and the walk downtown isn't necessary easy.  Thai Basil was amazing, accomodating, and great food, actually better quality than Harumi.
