Went there w/a coupon card I received in the mail FROM THEM.  It said come in for a FREE CHEESEBURGER & BRING A FRIEND.  The two of us went & my friend was gonna buy a burger.  Showed the card & lady at counter said, "Wait, I have to get my manager".  She was back at the counter in 15 sec. & said, "My manager said card expired"!  There was NO EXPIRATION DATE on the card!  We walked out & will NEVER go back!
