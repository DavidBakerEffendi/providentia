This place is a rip off. $27.95 for per "large" pizza. Their large is only 12". Their customer service is pathetic. I just moved into the area and ordered pizza from here for all of my movers. 3 large pizzas should have been more than sufficient however this place has a different understanding of large vs the entire rest of the world. They neglected to quote their price on the phone, obviously because they want to hide it. Had I not been busy moving things into my new home I never would have accepted the order. Unfortunately my fianc√© did. I live 500 meters from this establishment and was looking forward to making it my new neighbourhood hang out with my friends and soccer team. I will now walk further for better prices and service.
