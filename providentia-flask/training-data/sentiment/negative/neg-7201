Everything started great. As soon as bartender realized I was routing for opposing team I got cut off. Absolutely insane. The black dude was the bartender. Which was a dick from the moment I walked in. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know. If you want a good environment to watch a game there are plenty of other places to go around the area. Would never recommend phillys to anyone
