Sometimes we have off days and sometimes maybe it's not your jam.

Needless to say, I'm always open to try new places regardless of the Yelp reviews.  JK Sushi seemed like it was on the fences when checked the reviews, but I went for it anyways.  

I brought my two friends along for the ride.  The pace is small and dink and we were the only guest during lunch hour on a Friday; it was quiet....too quiet.  We started off with some rolls, the Hana, Dragon, and Las Vegas.  My take was it was overly doused with sweet brown sauce and literally I didn't need to dip my rolls in soy sauce because of it.  The Vegas was probably the best of the 3 with a crunch to it from be fried. 

Moreover, we also ordered the Japchae, Bulgogi, and the spicy pork Bulgogi.  Japchae had a slight hint of Sesame Oil which I rather have more then less of, but good on the texture with the boy choy.  The Bulgogi unfortunately smelled like it was old and sitting in the freezer for some times.  As for the spicy pork; my friend said he couldn't taste anything except spice and boy was he sweating.  

In the end, I think I'll pass on this place, but what really made me pass is both my friends didn't feel too well after their visit.  Service was good overall, but we were the only guest.  Again, was it an off day or was it business as usual?  I don't know but I generally hate giving 1 stars to a place that tries, however I have to be honest for my readers. - Enjoy!
