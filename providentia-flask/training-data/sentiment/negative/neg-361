We went on a Sunday around 11am we got seated right away.  The menu is trying to be like a new-american style type of menu.  I ordered chicken and waffles and the Bo ordered a breakfast burrito.  Our meals took around 25 minutes to come out and my boyfriend even commented saying how all the people sitting next to us NO ONE had a plate in front of them.  Sunday must have been a new employee training day because there was so many kids wandering around and around the restaurant with no real task at hand.  The coffee.... the coffee was good.  Then, FINALLY our food came out.  My chicken was good and it was a baked chicken breast breaded.  My waffle was HALF a waffle.  Two pieces came out and they were toasted cajun style (like a brick) i think they were seasoned with a pepper or something too?  My scrambled eggs came out already mixed with syrup.  Boy's burrito came out on a green pita wrap tortilla and carne mixed with eggs and some avocado on the side.  The "carne" or meat had a lot of fat on it.  Breakfast was $30.  I wont be back.
