Mine and my sister and brother in law experience of metro pizza was opposite of the the experience I had with my best friend. First me and my best friend came in first and ate around 7pm we had a calzone and garlic knots and wine service and food great. My sister and brother in law had not eat dinner yet and I told them how good the food was so they asked me to join the so we all came at 915pm ready to eat more good food, the service was good and great food again but this time when we go up to leave several male employees in the bar area where fat shaming us by barking and mooing at us we looked at each other is disbelief and when we looked back they where pointing at us. Bottom line this is disrespectful and we will not be back and I have enjoyed metro pizza for over 30 plus years!
