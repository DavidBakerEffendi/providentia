This place is the best that I've found in AZ and I'm trying to be nice. I obviously miss Cali Mexican food. they killed it for me when I ordered a chicken burrito with beans and I got a bean burrito with a little chicken. No reason to be greedy on food that a customer is paying for. My burrito was not even a burrito, it was a ball of ehh I couldn't even grab it.
