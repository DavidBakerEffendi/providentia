Oaky had dinner here the other night and was really looking forward to it and it was HORRIBLE !! Yea wine and beer were included and bottomless because the wine was likely made yesterday out of some synthetic package - terrible. 

The stations themselves were mediocre at best; ITALIAN looked the best but didn't try any as it was all carbs and way to heaven to eat and the LATIN station was ok with chips/salsa and guacamole, bad canned beans, orange dye color rice, the CARVING station roast beef I have to say was very good, but the frozen crab legs and warm shrimp at the FISHMONGER looked terrible, American was empty when I went to it other than some corn bread muffins and the DESSERTS as wonderful as they looked I saw allot of them in tables with one or two small bites and the rest left. In fact most staff clearing tables were clearing plates still full of food 

I guess maybe two years ago the Christmas brunch was far better that the regular buffet.  

Shame - will not be recommending or returning here.
