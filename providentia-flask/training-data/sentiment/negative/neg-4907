Worst Einstein bagel location. Place is filthy, poor customer service. Our bagel took more than 10 minutes and it was only a simple toasted raisin bagel. After waiting and they finally called my name, I go to my car and it's the wrong order. I go back in and let them know. The shift leader tells me " well you took the wrong order, why would you take it " apparently it's my fault. I asked to speak with a manager which took another 10 minutes of waiting. There was no apology or any acknowledgement of any type that they did wrong. Employees are rude and have no clue what good customer service is.
