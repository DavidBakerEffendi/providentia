This buffet is garbage. Easily the worse buffet I have ever eaten at. Very small selection but it didn't really matter as everything there was terrible. We got there at 1pm, they close at 2 and the only thing I can imagine is that they decide to not put fresh food out after 1. Everything was bad, even the salad bar with its like 5 choices of things. the ranch dressing was the horrible watery stuff you see at denny's. The layout is even terrible. the place was a mess, the food trays were a mess. jeez what a disaster. feel bad for my server he seemed like a nice guy and was on top of keeping our table clean (pretty easy no second trip for food it was all so bad) and our glasses full. 

I know not every hotel values their buffets as much as the next but this should be embarrassing to the management at Westgate. It is right next to "the largest sportsbook in the world" and you can tell that the fast food joints around it are better.
