I would give this place zero stars if I could. The service was terrible for a football Sunday when there really wasn't that many people there. Just another overpriced bar in old town with nothing special to offer. They also overcharged for my food but we didn't feel like waiting around for it to be changed on the bill. Back to my dive bar!!
