Battista's. Hot dang, the food was gross. Terribly, terribly gross. My manicoti was just a solid block of bad cheese with pergo-like sauce on it. But then it was paired with something (spinach) that was inedible. Seriously, I don't know how one makes spinach taste like that, my only guess would be artificial flavoring. Yes, it's that type of place. Then cap it off with cheap wine that'll give you a killer headache and some sweet hot chocolate standing in for coffee. Blech.
