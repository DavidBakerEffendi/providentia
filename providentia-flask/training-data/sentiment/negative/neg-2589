Unfortunately I wanted to love this place but did not have a first good visit. I ordered a salad that came in two containers, it was pretty much half a bag of spinach with a light sprinkle of strawberries and a little bacon, a couple of sliced mushrooms all swimming in boring spinach. The dressing tasted store bought, nothing special. They forgot my chicken so I called to have it removed from bill and they wanted me to drive back 20 min to get it refunded on card. I didn't have time so I paid for a chicken salad but never got any chicken nor a refund. They offered me to go back for another salad but I'm not close by so it's not conviniente for me.

I ordered 3 pastries and they were all like what you get at Costco, nothing special. I also ordered a French Onion soup, it tasted like dirty water. :( The cheese on the salad was meant for the soup but it was so little that I put on the salad for added taste. 

Just drive a couple more minutes and go to Cheesecake or Wildflower for a real meal. 

I don't like leaving bad reviews but I really didn't enjoy anything that I purchased and just felt like my $24 bill was just a waste.
