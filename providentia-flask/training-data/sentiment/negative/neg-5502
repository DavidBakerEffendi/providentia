Being a native of Chicago, I was excited when I found out they were opening a Panera right down the street from my apartment. This Panera was awful though! 

I went to order my usual, pick 2 of the Asiago Turkey sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup. I was told when ordering that they were out of the usual baguette they typically serve with the soup. Instead, they gave me a really hard roll. Strike one. 

The food arrives at the table and my girlfriend and I start chowing down. I go to take a bite of my soup and immediately feel something hard and sharp in my mouth. There was a large piece of glass from another soup bowl inside my broccoli cheddar soup! Strike two. 

We went up to the counter to alert them of the matter. We spoke with the manager and he was apologetic, but said there wasn't much he could do other than offer me another soup. No thanks. We return to our table to find it empty! Yep, an employee cleared our table and our food and drinks were gone. Strike three.

I won't be returning anytime soon.
