While the place itself looks cool, the food was low quality, tasteless, and just can't understand how this passes as good Mexican food.

The ambiance/decor is pretty cool, and definitely a large space to have big groups or a private party.  As with other Yelpers, service here seems to be a pretty big issue.  While we were a relatively large group (8), it was pretty late for a Sunday brunch and there weren't many people in the restaurant, and we had to ask multiple times to just some of the simplest items.

Chips and salsa at the beginning is nice - most Mexican restaurants do it, but not all, so definitely am appreciative when they have that.  The green cilantro-based salsa was pretty good.

The veggie burrito was terrible.  The tortilla tasted weird, the veggies weren't fresh, the entire burrito tasted bland, and I feel like I could've whipped this up in my kitchen and it would've been a million times better than what was served to me.  The overall quality of the food was pretty resounding.  Overall, not a place I'd ever come back to the next time I'm in Charlotte.
