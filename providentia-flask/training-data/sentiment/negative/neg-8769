Just got home and wanted to write this review while I was still in shock. My husband said do you want to go to IN -N -OUT? I said let's try somewhere new. I told him about this place I saw called Farmer Boys.  Walk in no one there, which should have given us a clue. My husband ordered the California BLT which might have been great for someone who likes their bacon raw. I ordered a cheeseburger and asked if I could get it with no cheese. Well I got a burger on a doughy un-toasted bun and that was all. NO ketchup, mustard , onions, or any kind of sauce. Nothing but a plain hamburger on a way to soft bun that tasted like dough.
uhg !!! I asked the girl if I could get some onions, she said "sure, I will bring them to you". She never did , and we tipped her $2 when she brought our food. It was just awful food.I swear my husband had one bite of his sandwich and I had one bite of my hamburger, we ate the fries took our sodas and left the food on the table because it just wasn't edible. Ended up at IN- N -OUT. $18 wasted at Farmer Boys.  People stick with what you know. What a huge disappointment.
