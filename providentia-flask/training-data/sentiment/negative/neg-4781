I'm gonna have to agree with Queenie on this one, bleah!!!!

Subs were just ok, and the bread was stale for me too.  

Shrimp Salad rolls didn't have enough shrimp, I really HATE it when the shrimp is sliced in half on the vertical to trick the patron to believe they are actually getting 3 whole shrimp, but no, I got screwed and got a measly 1.5 shrimp per roll.  This really bothers me considering how much the ingredients cost.

Didn't bother with the pho, because pho to go is not the same so I ordered a grilled lemon grass chicken dish with the typical rice, veg and sauce and found it uninspired.

The place seems more like a to go place, so I wouldn't eat in with my family.

Also noticed a bunch of kids in the back, don't know if they work there or are family members but that turned me off.  One little girl checked me out and took payment, hmmm.

Won't be back with the vast amounts of Vietnamese places in the NW, this one doesn't make the cut for me even though the lady who took my order was super nice.
