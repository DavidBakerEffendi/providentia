I was very unimpressed with my experience at The Living Room in Chandler tonight. The food was alright and the service was extremely poor. There were multiple waiters and waitresses that would come by but took 10-15 minutes to just order drinks and another 15 minutes before they took our food order. There was no silverware on the table and once we received our food we had to ask for napkins and silverware. There were 5 of us and only gave us 2 sets! So we asked again and no one ever came back. Finally, once we were done eating another waitress came by to ask how things were, still with no silverware and no refills on drinks. She came back with the little cocktail napkins you use for your drinks. Anything you asked for wouldn't get done or was messed up because there was no one waiter/waitress per table and no communication. I will not be back and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
