Garbage. Went there with my mom. She had the shrimp and avocado salad, after which she had digestive symptoms the following day. I had the burger, which seemed to be prepared well, but was doused in ketchup and mustard. If this is the only way these people know how to season a burger, they need to get out of the restaurant business.
