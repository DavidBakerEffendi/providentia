Worst service in the world. Ordered one bubble tea to go, waited 1 hour. The place is packed on a Thursday. There's one person working inside. She was swamped and looked confused ! 

Every customer was waiting for min 45 minutes and people were angry and she did nothing but run around like a headless chicken. 

I recommend you going to a different location!! Don't waste one hour for a bubble tea and crappy service.
