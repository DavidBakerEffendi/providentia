It's been almost 2 years since our last visit here, see my last review of Jack's.  It seems that nothing has changed much since then. It was 1/2 priced wine night so we thought we'd give the place another go round and order a bottle of wine to go with the Lasagna special. My wife and I came with some neighbors this time in the hope that maybe things had gotten better. Our hopes were dashed. I didn't mention our last trip here to our friends so I wouldn't taint any perceptions. Jack's wait staff is still very nice but the same problem arose with their glasses again.  They were kind of busy and service was a bit slow. When the wine did arrive the waitress poured a sample to taste. Of course after the first visit I checked my glass. This time not only was there orange pulp, but lipstick! I brought this to her attention. She apologized profusely and brought us new glasses and more wine. NOPE, more pulp and more lipstick. I called the manager to the table and shows him. He had a hard time finding us 4 glasses that were clean enough to use.  Long night, this is for sure the last visit to Jack's. Oh, by the way, the Lasagna was adequate at best.
