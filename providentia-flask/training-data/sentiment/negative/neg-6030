Three of us made reservations to dine here at 8:00 one night. We arrived a few minutes early, but weren't seated til 8:45. Usually I don't really care about this--restaurants get busy, people stay longer than expected, etc. But when your bill for three ends up being well over $375, I expect some one to at least explain why were waiting and when we how much longer to be seated. But, we got nothing, not even a passing apology by the hosts.

By the time we got our food it was 9:30 and we were all starving. Out of all our dishes I thought the only one worth ordering was the Ciopinno. 

I went back a second time for a late lunch, and again was seriously disappointed by both food and service. They really have a knack at hiring unfriendly hostess!

The food = ehhh. 
The service = no. 
The price = very high. 
Will I ever go back = nope.

Passing thought: My friend told me she's tempted to create a Yelp account just so she can write a bad review.
