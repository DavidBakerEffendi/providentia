This was disappointing! We started out strong with a wonderful host staff that greeted and seated us, however from there things went down hill. For a Friday morning the restaurant is slow so we expected quick service, we didn't get it, as a result our food came out slow and cold. The breakfast burrito was bland, the breakfast nachos so cold when they arrive the cheese had congealed. The one bright spot was the breakfast platter, which would have been fantastic except the toast was cold. Great atmosphere, nice people, poor service, cold food.
