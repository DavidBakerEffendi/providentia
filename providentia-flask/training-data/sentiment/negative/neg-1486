This place used to be my late night go to years ago and was actually really good. 
That's not the case anymore. Not only does the service still suck, well it got worse, but their food is disgusting! And forget about complaining about anything, they bring your bill anyway even after they see you didn't even eat their food! Do not waste your time or money in this dirty, disgusting place! There's so many other wonderful options out here.
