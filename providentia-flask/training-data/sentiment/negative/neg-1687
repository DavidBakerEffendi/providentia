Inconsistent everything. This location gives the original owners a horrible name. The pitas are cold and hard, the service is the worst I've experienced and the floors and flatware are dirty. Totally overwhelmed by the number of staff who stand at the counter when you walk in. Of the 5+ times we've been in here, they've never greeted us. The whole place has a bad vibe. I hate to write a review like this, but we gave this location several opportunities. If they at least changed the way the front is set up to be more welcome and inviting it would certainly help. Majority of staff has little personality. Chandler & Scottsdale locations have not lost the greatness that so many long time lovers of "the pita jungle" have come to love....
