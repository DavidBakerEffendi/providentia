Ordered the blueberry bagel with blueberry cream cheese 3 separate times, lightly toasted. Each time the bagel was sooo burnt. Twice they gave regular cream cheese with my order(requested blueberry). When I pointed out my issue, I was questioned if I had ordered right. Even though receipt showed my correct order. This place is so, so. Just make sure you repeat your order at least three times! Also request a light toasting for your bagel.
