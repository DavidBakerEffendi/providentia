Went to IHOP with the family for a late night dessert. When we got there, the waiter went to seat us but the table he was seating us at had a sleeping kid on the seat. He had to seat is in a location that was towards the back that was empty. We were given menus but the waiter didn't come back to take our order for at least 15 minutes. We thought he forgot about us. So I stood up so he could see me when he passed by. When we ordered, we asked for a sundae and we were informed that there was no ice cream. So we ordered something else from the menu. I felt something crawling by my foot. Looked down and there was a HUGE cockroach. My son squashed it with a napkin (see picture). The food came out within a reasonable amount of time but the waiter didn't come back to check on us. After we ate, we waited 20 minutes but he never came by so we went up to the front to see if we could get his attention and pay. There was a group of 6 people there waiting to be seated. They had been there 10 minutes and hadn't been seated. When the waiter finally came out, he asked how everything was. We told him about the cockroach and he said "I'll tell my manager". Definitely not the response I expected. This was a horrible experience all around. I wouldn't recommend this place. They don't seem to care about customer service at all.
