Really didn't have good service when me and my friend went to try it since it was near our area. The waitress took our orders, but never delivered one of the dishes we asked for. After when we got the check we were charged for it, so told them it was never delivered so they took it off. Overall the food was mediocre. Don't think I'd ever return here.
