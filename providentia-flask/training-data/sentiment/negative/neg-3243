Horrible experience here! Came for a Sunday brunch with the hubby, we had so many choices on where to go but chose here. Big mistake! We got seated and waited like 15 minutes and never got waited on, moved to bar and service was awful there too! Ordered the chicken cilantro omelet and it was horrible! The chicken literally tasted like rotisserie chicken u would buy at Walmart. No flavoring at all just cut up and disgusting. Too many mushrooms too. The hubby ordered chicken biscuits and it was so dry! It took us forever to get our bill too and we were just so ready to leave! Never will go back again that's for sure.
