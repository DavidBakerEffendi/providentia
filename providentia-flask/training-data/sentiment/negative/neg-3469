I went at 230 on a Monday. It was dimsum 

I hated every second I was there, the carts were going around but the ladies kept ignoring us and I don't understand why. 

we got gar how & a spinach dumpling. 

After that not a single cart were go by and we sat for so long till I finally I gave up 

we went to pay and it was 14$ which is soooo high for what we got ...... 

I'll never ever go back ..

.. food was good though
