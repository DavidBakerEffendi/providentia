My opinion of this establishment is seriously tainted by the two and a half hours I had to wait to receive my food. Once my food arrived it was lukewarm at best, leading me to believe it spent quite some time sitting somewhere. The hot and sour soup once heated was good, the Pad Thai was not; very slimy. My boyfriend ordered general tsos chicken, which was good and good portion. All in all, I'll go somewhere else for Chinese food.
