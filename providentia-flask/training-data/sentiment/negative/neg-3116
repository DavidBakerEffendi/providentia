What a sad place with the worst "management". Called in to reserve a spot on the patio for my birthday and was told that no reservations necessary since they will have plenty of space once I arrive for 8:30pm. However, upon my arrival the bartender said - "it is really dead today so we decided to shut down the patio". I was very confused at that moment and she advised me to come back to speak to the manager. When I asked to speak to him/her now she made a call, laughed on the phone and 5 min later "manager" showed up. First of all, not sure why I had to come back but more importantly, without introduction he nodded his head and said "Hey". Made up a lie that someone was sick and didn't want to open the upstairs not realizing that the bartender already spilled the beans....HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND NEVER AGAIN
