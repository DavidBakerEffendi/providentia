Just like most I seen the awesome pics online when deciding to book this for our vacation. Got to the place and as I pulled up I was like ok for sure looks a little beat on the outside but all will be ok. Front desk was nothing special and the room is filthy. Most items in the room do not even work. One of the 2 mini splits for air work in the room. The room has no attention to detail and is dirty. Bathroom had tp on the floor and hair. If it wasn't new year eve I would leave but I can't find anything else
