Well let me tell you about this place. My family gathered here tonight for my aunts birthday. 16 of us total, probably closed to a grand in total purchases. Two waitresses were rude to us all because we had the nerve to ask for a couple tables to be put together. Then, another waitress walked by and rolled her eyes because she had to walk around my Grandmother who was holding her great grandson. None of these ridiculous situations were worse than when the OWNER of the business came by and gave my 90 year old grandmother a completely unnecessary and impolite attitude. No man should speak to a woman the way this man spoke to my grandmother. We were told "you've been here two hours, I have tables to turn, and you're holding people up..we had just finished dinner. Literally just finished. The owner is rude and so is his staff. I've worked in customer service for many years and I can tell you that no service person should ever treat anyone the way these people treated us. I, and my family, will NEVER return to this establishment.
