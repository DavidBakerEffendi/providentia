We have been here twice now and neither were very good or worth the wait.  We've been her for dinner and now brunch, and let's just say, gross I've had better at hometown buffet.  The brunch had few selections and what was there was horrible and not fresh.  Will not come back to this buffet ever, much better buffets for same price or cheaper on the strip.
