Was headed for Hiro Sushi but it was closed.  Thought I'd give this place a try.  Ordered the mixed Tempura.  Very disappointed.  Shrimp mushy, like it was old, in the freezer too long.  Breading was closer to KFC than tempura, not light, airy, explosive.  When I walked in at happy hour and nobody was there I should have turned around.  To their credit the miso was good, and hot.  Won't be going back.
