This place deserves a rating as low as  president #45 and that is looooooow. I'm an independent delivery driver that came here to pick up an order for a customer. As soon as I walked in a person told me in a rude manner to "come here." I looked puzzled and said come here and she said yes come here as if she was talking to a child. I was highly bothered by this and had to fight my natural instinct to "let her have it." Instead I kept my cool and just imagined telling her off. She was very rude and unprofessional throughout the entire interaction. I guess I shouldn't be surprised based on some of the reviews about the poor service other people have received. I wouldn't trust eating here based on the service I received. She needs an attitude adjustment and to be fired and never be in a position where she has to deal with the public. In case the manager or owner wants to know (I doubt it), this happened on 10/23/17 in the early evening.
