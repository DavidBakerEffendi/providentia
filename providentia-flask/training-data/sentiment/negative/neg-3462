Greetings Management team,
 
I decided to have a Birthday Brunch at your beautiful restaurant Bottiglia inside Green Valley Ranch this past Sunday, September 23rd at 11am. Our server was phenomenal (I wish I would have taken his name). The food was great and I loved the environment however I did leave your restaurant with a bad perception of your hostess.
 
As I was celebrating my birthday, my guests took a couple of gifts. I forgot my gift inside your restaurants and return to retrieve them 10 minutes after my departure.
 
When I returned to ask for my gift your two hostess (dark and blond hair) stated there were no gifts, please check your cameras on the right side of our table by the entrance. I asked them one more time to please check with the server, the busser was walking by the table and the hosted asked for the gift in which the busser stated "I gave them to you". The dark hair hosted then went to the back (I assume the kitchen area) and brought my two gift bags and stated this is what they found but nothing was inside (that is unbelievable!). The dark hair host then pulled my three gift cards from the hostess stand drawer and said "oh are these yours?" two gift cards where from Sephora and one from TJ Maxx with  a value of $150.
 
I am very disappointed with the way your hostess tried to deny the fact I left my gift on accident and the way they acted seemed as they were STEALING my gifts! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. There was a camera next to our table which I am sure you can check footage on the occurrence mentioned above.
