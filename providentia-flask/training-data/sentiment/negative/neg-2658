So horrible!! First we get there and there is no hostess for about 5 minutes.. so we peak around the corner and some women (whom I'm assuming is the owner) says she will be with us in a bit.. so we wait about 5 more minutes and let her know we have a groupon for 4.. keep in mind that it's me my husband and my 5 year old daughter.. the groupon says enjoy 7 meats of this restaurant blah blah blah so we're like okay cool.. so we see the server (whom I'm assuming is also the other owner) going table to table and then skips us my husband asks what's going on and the server chick is like oh he will be right out.. server comes and says I see you got the groupon deal (very loud I might add) and says for ten dollars more we can get more meat choice.. I figured since I got the Groupon I thought we already had that but I guess whatever we were like no that's fine.. so he has the little meats and tri tip and he says we can only choose the little ones and we're like okay but let me say most of the meats are super rare like a bloody massacre and the ones that aren't are burnt like they were little devils.. but we deal.. so we go to the salad bar and tell me why the macaroni salad and mashed potatoes taste just like the one from Albertsons.. then we realized it's only them two working!! Like seriously it's only them two so I guess that's why everything seemed just messy.. the suggested tip was 15 bucks for three of us and I would've but it was just so messy since we got there.. like no lady I know you both are trying to make a living but I feel like I've got hustled.. and there was a moment my husband seen shrimp and eyed the server and the server stuck his face up and just walked away like I told you to pay the extra ten.. I felt so horrible I should have just taken him to the one in town square.. I feel so bad because it was my husbands birthday dinner ugh never again!!
