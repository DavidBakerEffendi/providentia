So I ordered from here once and it sucked. I called and the lady said if I could be on hold and I said ok. 10 mins went by so I hung up and called back and she asks me to hold again. I said hell no I was on hold with you guys the past 10 mins. She was being a super bitch when she reluctantly started letting me order and after not a good bye see you soon. She hung up. Definitely a people person lol.
