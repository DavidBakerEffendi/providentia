Service was good. Food came out timely and tasted okay. My issues are w/ the portion size I received from the tacos. They were awful. My fish tacos had a pinky sized amount of fish. This is no exaggeration. The rest was filled w/ filler cabbage. I couldn't believe a $14 meal would be so chintzy. The beer wasn't cold enough either. I will never go back to this place until the meals are properly made w/ reasonable portions. How can one justify going to LP for $14 fish tacos when Rubio's offers a much better and bigger portion for $8? It's insane, please fix this immediately!
