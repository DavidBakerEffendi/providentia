One word, "Ghettoness."  Seriously, eating here made me feel like dining out in some rural, totally undeveloped area in mainland China!  No decors, horrible service, foods not tasty at all (not even close to A-OK!)  GRRRRRRRRRR I regretted that I had eaten at such an awful place while i was in the Fabulous Las Vegas!!!  Never ever I would go back.
