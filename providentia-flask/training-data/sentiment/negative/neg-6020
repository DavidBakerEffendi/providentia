This place is a complete disaster. 

We stood in various lines for an hour in the cold (32F/ 0C) at 11p through midnight  because they couldn't properly communicate with their patrons on which line was which. 
This happened to a few groups of people, not just us. 

Then the bouncer, who really seemed like he wanted to show off his 'power' (the only place he has power?) started screaming at people to pay attention when he talked (that was the 1st time we heard him communicating with anyone)- irony: he didn't really say anything except to tell people to pay attention when he barked out orders. What a DB.

Then, they proceeded to let in a bunch of sleazy, gross, DB looking patrons which was pretty much the last straw for us and the group in front of us AND the group behind us. They pretty much lost about 20 people in the span of :30 when we left and went to Wood, Globe and Crescent street (Newtown).

The line we were standing in barely moved- and it was 11p.
What idiot club makes ppl stand in line when they first open?
People who had been in the club came out to let us know it was pretty much empty in there except for ppl who were there for dinner and were rolling out. 
Which is really stupid and ridiculous to make ppl stand in line in freezing temp when we could have been inside spending money on tons of alcohol. 

Typical stupid, disorganized, wannabe club. 
If it wasn't for my friends who were visiting from SF, i'd not have waited at all. 
Waiting in line for an hour at a club...is completely passe and 1999-ish, no?

Like i said...complete disaster. Don't bother. there're Plenty of other places to check out
