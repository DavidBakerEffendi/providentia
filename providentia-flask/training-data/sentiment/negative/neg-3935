Love the food. Hate the service. Had a party of 5. Was told they won't put tables together. Was given this option (and I'm quoting): "our picnic tables technically seat 6 but we know they really don't. You can seat 5 uncomfortably if you want to."  With her face she said that. I said - I'll take a table at Bar Louie 10 feet away.
