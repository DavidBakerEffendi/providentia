I ordered three tacos and all 3 were downright lousy.  Can't remember the last time I had food this bad.  The shrimp taco was overbreaded and in a sickly sweet sauce, the shredded beef taco was very tiny and thankfully, I can't remember what the third taco tasted like.

To the reviewer who posted that these tacos are top notch.... what are you smoking?

I waited forever to get my food and saw numerous other people who came in after me get their food.  Waiter was MIA. Not coming back....ever.
