Stopped in on a weekday to get eggs benedict.  I had the corn beef hash version and my wife had the traditional.  At 10.95 a plate, you expect something pretty good.  These were not.  Just bland.  The side of potatoes were even worse.  Fried potato nuggets, no seasoning, no onions, no peppers, just potatoes...plain.
