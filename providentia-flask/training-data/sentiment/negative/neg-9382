More like Le Plop! Second time was NOT a charm. Thought I'd go back and give it another try after a mediocre breakfast the first time. I tried the "18 Wheeler". It comes with eggs, bacon or sausage, "peasant" potatoes and french toast. The meal was just bland, I've had a better breakfast at a T/A truck stop on Route 80. Eggs are eggs, link sausage was barely cooked, "peasant" potatoes were just that, poor! They lacked taste and texture. The french toast was two large pieces of bread, over dipped in a plain, tasteless batter. Using sliced sandwich bread for french toast was sub par for a restaurant with a name like Le Peep. 

The service was fine, the waitress can't help the lack of ability in the kitchen. It has gotten dirtier from my last visit over 18 months ago. The carpet was dirty and the walls were banged up. 

Le Plop needs a face lift. In agreeing with the other yelpers, the decor is lacking. There weren't many patrons dining during my visit and it was extremely loud. 

Good Luck! It seems their weekend faithfuls keep them afloat! Does the South lack taste buds and palates?
