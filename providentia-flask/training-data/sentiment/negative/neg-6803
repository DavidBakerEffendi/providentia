Don't even bother. Idk how this place gets 4 stars but I was VERY disappointed. I was so excited to try this Buffett because of the good reviews but it was extremely disappointing. The people behind the counter were rude. There was a very limited selection, and I was honestly concerned about food poisoning. It was just tired old, blah food. And the bathroom was disgusting. Never again!!!! Go to Caesars palace Buffett instead!!!
