This place is a joke once you get past the nostalgia of the kids playing on replica fields of famous stadiums. Can't bring food or drinks in so they can sell you over price food and drinks. The service in the snack bar is a joke. I order food, when ready, maybe you can give it me without me having to wait 5 minutes while it gets cold and than when you ask for it, they get pissed. The dining area is dirty as all can be, only because they are giving free icees to 5 year olds to clean it up for them. The only reason I will come back is to watch my son play ball. Maybe one day they'll figure how to run this place....but I doubt it
