By far the worst service we've had in a while. Our service had zero priorities, zero multitask skills, and lacked organization. 

We ordered something fast and easy ..simple soup and salad unlimited. We kept having to ask him for refills on soda, bread,salad,soup...and it would take him 3visits to get it for us. 

We are so u happy with the service, this one visit ruined it for us. 

He tried to joke with us a couple times,but I'm sorry your personality can only go so far...hard work and great service is what gets you tips. Stop half a$%ing your job.
