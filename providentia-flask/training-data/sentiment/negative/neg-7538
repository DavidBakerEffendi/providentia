Took a friend from out of town there hoping for a good lunch but my friend had the worst turkey sandwich ever, bread was so dry he almost choked on it. The turkey dry and tasteless. Guy at counter was rude when asked for a fork. To make matters worse the sandwich was $12. I was embarrassed that my friend had that experience. Also for being an organic restaurant, they did not offer stevia as a sweeter. 
Also it's dangerous to cross the street (32nd) to park. We would have rather eaten at the Corner Bakery.
