My buddy Mike and I went here the night before Thanksgiving.  We had some last minute food shopping to do, then pick his girlfriend up at the airport.
I have eaten at the Red Devil on McDowell...while it doesn't WOW me, it has always been decent food at decent prices in large quantity - so I was willing to hit up this location.
Ahhh...the smell of cleaning fluids.  Sure, it's nice to know they keep the place clean - but when I walk into a restaurant, I want to smell FOOD, not anti bacterial disinfectant!
I had the chicken marsala, Mike ordered the chicken lasagne.  The salads were predictable iceberg, two slices red onion, 2 canned black olives.  Nothing wrong with them...just lackluster and boring.  Same with the bread.  Sure, it was fresh and warm.  But lackluster and without remarkable flavor or texture.
My chicken had been tenderized beyond identification.  (Think the inside of a McDonalds chicken nugget.)  The marsala sauce was bland as could be and the mushrooms were straight out of a can.  I was quite hungry, and made it about halfway through before the lack of decent flavor told me to stop.  The side of pasta with red sauce was fine.  If I ever have to go back, maybe I'll just stick with that.
Mike said his chicken lasagne was OK...but within a half hour of leaving the restaurant, he recinded that.
When we spoke Thanksgiving morning, he sounded to be in bad shape.  I figured it was because we picked up his girlfriend at the aiport at about 10, so he was up all night "reacquainting" with her.  I was half right.  He WAS up all night...but it was doubled over in pain in the restroom.
So - I am the lucky one here.  Completely disappointed in my meal - but I didn't get physically ill.  
If that's the best thing I can come up with to say about the place - well, you know I won't be back!
