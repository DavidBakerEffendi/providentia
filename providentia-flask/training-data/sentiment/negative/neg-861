the following description is of my experience at the restaurant getting the service of the restaurant: 

ordered blackend steak strips.  Steak came raw on the inside and black outside.  I think it was frozen and cooked from frozen at very high heat.  We couldn't eat it and spit back raw pieces of meat.  What came back was pieces of meat all stuck together, pounded out and then stuck together back again, including chewed up pieces.  Someone never told these people to make a new entree once they screw up, not to try to serve dogfood to customers.  Needless to say I wouldn't pay for it and we left shortly afterwards to give our business to another place.
