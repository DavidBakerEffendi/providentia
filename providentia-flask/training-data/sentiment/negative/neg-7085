This was our first and only visit to this restaurant.  From the get go the cashier was not very friendly.  Although as you enter the restaurant appears modern, once we got to the dining room it was observed to be dirty. There was trash on the floor and leftover food on the tables. It appears that turnaround is a little slow. It took over 20 minutes to get our food. I ordered the camperitos, which is nuggets. The chicken nuggets were so over cooked that they were rubbery and not very flavorful. I ordered the combo with French fries and even those were overcooked. My husband ordered a 4 piece and his meal looked better. We also tried the empanadas and again they did not have any flavor.  Needless to say, I DO NOT recommend this chicken place. Much better options in town.
