I sat at the bar, had two glasses of wine and ordered the filet mignon. While the food and drinks were mediocre, the service was extremely slow. I left content until I checked my credit card a few days later. I left a $13 tip on a $75 bill. I had written evidence of this on my receipt. But I was charged an extra $2 on my credit card. I have decided not to call the restaurant to deal with this because I expect this happens often enough. Instead, I would like to warn others to check your credit card statements if you decide to eat here. Or, avoid this place altogether, especially if you are attending a conference in the area. There person who served me was a young woman who worked behind the bar. I hope someone does something about this.
