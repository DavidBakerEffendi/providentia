I love this golf course, but had an awful experience with customer service during my last visit. I dropped my clubs off early for a tee time and they thought that my clubs were a rental set (full titleist AP2 set - 913 woods and a scotty cameron putter). 

They gave my clubs to some random person who took my clubs to the range. After they brought them back, I noticed a skymark on my driver and multiple clubs had been hit. The person also went through my bag and took a full box of Pro V1s out.

When I went to the manager in the pro shop all he did was offer me free drinks. I expect much more out of a premier club in Scottsdale. I won't be coming back any time soon.
