As a vegan, I have very few choices when it comes to fast and easy food. This location is on my way home after the gym - so brown steamed rice and steamed veggies is a go-to for me. These people cannot get this order right and I have recently given them 3 final tries. I complained when I got fried rice (with egg), the manager made it right with a free follow up (which was correct) but the last two times I end up with fried rice (with egg) even after being asked steamed or fried and stating IM A VEGAN....and my fortune cookies were all busted up this last time. Im too tired to even call the manager again. I have decided to write here and warn others - these folks are unmistakably morons. Go down the street to Pei Wei (Sunset and Stephanie)-  You're Welcome!
