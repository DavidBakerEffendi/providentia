i have been trapped in this mcnightmare so long that i actually had time to call the restaurant 7 times, call the 800 number n explain that my social security number was about to expire while waitn in line at their drive thru...i cannot believe i've been taken hostage in the east side mcdonald's drive thru! there are now 6 cars behind me, and they're all also trapped in the drive thru...now had i had to go to work, i would hav a very big problem right now. oh my god! the guy in front of me fell asleep! that's how long we hav been waitn in this drive thru! i cannot believe this is really happening to me right now! all i am ordering now is the store id #, and the manager's name, because this is ridiculous...by the time i get out of this drive thru, it will be time for lunch!! I hav worked McDonald's a total of 13 yrs, i think I kno a little bit about how it is supposed to operate, n holdn yer customers prisoner in the drive thru is NOT part of the plan...i drove thru 2 times, not once honey, so blaming the poor guy who fell asleep while waitn for eons n eons in yer drive thru is an outlandish way to shift the blame instead of takn responsibility for the actions, or rather inactions, of yerself n yer crew. Smh in disgust...
