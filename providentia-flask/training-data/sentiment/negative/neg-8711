If this is how churrascaria is done in Las Vegas, it's a shame!  My family and I went here for lunch.  We were the only ones in the restaurant and we couldn't locate any of the employees.  Not one sound came from the kitchen, which I found to be odd.  I was begging to leave because the emptiness and silence of the restaurant suggested that this place was going to suck....and man, was I right!!  There was only one server handling the small selection of meats.  The meat was DISGUSTING.  I could not finish what was on my plate because it was just horrible.  All the meats were dry and some tasted old.  I think that they just warmed up the meats leftover from the day/s before and served it because we did not wait long at all.  I learned what real churrascaria was supposed to taste like when I tried it in Chicago.  If you're looking to eat at a Brazilian steak house in Las Vegas, I'm warning you, do not go here!!!
