This is my only 1 star rating since using Yelp. We waited 20 mins to be seated that was no big deal. After we were seated we noticed that 3 families that came in after us were seated and had drinks and chips at their tables We had not even been greeted. Waitresses avoided our table handed out checks refilled glasses to other customers. I have never felt so disrespected.
