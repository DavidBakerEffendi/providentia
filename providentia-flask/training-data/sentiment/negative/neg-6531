if i can give this zero star i would, that's how bad the place is. food is ok but small ass portions and not affordable for the quality you're getting. servers here looks so unhappy w/ their lives that it shows...they weren't friendly at all. and the tackiest thing about it is that they add 15% tip on ur bill NO MATTER what the of people are in your party. one waiter had the fckn nerver to snatched the tip right out of my hand before i can even leave it down on the table!!! WTF?! assholes!
