I came here on a couple of occasions: (1) Ordered an Arizona burrito to-go. It came out to be almost $9 with the additional sour cream and credit card fees-way too expensive. The burrito was just alright. It wasn't anything to write home about. (2) Got Carne Asada fries with a tortilla, which came out to be over $11. Again, way too expensive. The fries were stale, the steak was old and tasteless, and the guacamole was flavorless. Shame, I live right down the street because I don't think I'll be coming here again. 

Be prepared to pay an additional $0.50 if you're paying with credit card.
