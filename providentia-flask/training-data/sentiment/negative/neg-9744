This time around I got to try the pasta bar because this place was so dead, no lines anywhere I went.  The pasta was not good.  The chicken in it tasted like it was pre-made, then frozen, then thawed out again. Turkey was still pink.  However they do have a new coffee station and it's up and running.  Getting seated they write down how many people are in your party.  Even though the ticket said six the gal tried to sit us at a four person table.  They could remove a few tables so people could actually walk around in here.  Tiny plates and immobility are not two things a buffet needs.  Food is just not worth the 22 bucks.  Skip this place.
