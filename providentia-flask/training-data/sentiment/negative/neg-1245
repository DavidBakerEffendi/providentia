Came here the day after a typical crazy night out in Vegas. My go to soup to settle my stomach is galbi tang(short rib soup). Came here based on YELP reviews. The interior looks a fast food establishment which serves Korean food. Anyways, ordered the Kalbi tang. It came out in a large bowl. Problem #1: The soup was bland! I've never eaten bland Kalbi tang at a restaurant before. I added salt and then more and more. I think they plain forgot to add salt. Yuck! Problem #2: The short rib bones and meat must come out a midget cow because they were the smallest rib bones I've ever seen and the meat pieces were a joke. Regret eating here. My wife ordered their Kimchee fried rice but it was bland as well. The side dishes were meh.  Sorry but can't recommend this place for decent Korean food.
