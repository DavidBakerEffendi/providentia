I could not be more turned off from this place nor have I ever been treated so rudely. 
1. This place needs to have online reservations. I called several times and no one answered then when I  finally got through they said we could come in with no reservation. No problem. 
2. We arrived early just in case and were turned away because we weren't "regulars and there is a priority for people not like you". How disgusting. Get over yourselves.
