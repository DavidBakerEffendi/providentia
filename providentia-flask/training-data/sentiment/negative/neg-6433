Typical steakhouse menu and dark atmosphere. Desire was great, but that was all.  Chicken cordon bleu w twice baked, and 8 oz filet w ranch potatoes: everything was very salty, too much, didn't eat more than a couple bites of anything.  I was looking forward to the garlic bread but it was just plain white bread toasted w garlic.  Dinner for 2 for $100 and I didn't eat anything, awesome!
