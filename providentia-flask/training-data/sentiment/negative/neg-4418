This restaurant was horrible! I went there a few weeks ago with my husband and his parents for my husband's birthday. All of the seafood we had was overcooked: lobster, stuffed shrimp and grouper. I highly doubt that they fly their lobsters in from Maine daily. The vegetables were not fresh or seasonal and the baked potato had no substance. How do you screw up a baked potato??! I think the lighting is so dim because they do not want you to actually see the food on your plate. The dessert, chocolate lava cake, wasn't even good. I grew up on the east coast and love old fashioned seafood restaurants; however, there is no comparison. I couldn't even dent the food on my plate because the thought of eating it made me feel sick. There are too many amazing restaurants in Scottsdale to come here and pay for overpriced, not fresh seafood.
