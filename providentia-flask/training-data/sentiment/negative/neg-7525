Extremely disappointed.. the service sucked!! The food was HORRIBLE. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.... my son had the pizza which was soggy. My oldest son had the chicken tenders and waffels and all he ate were the waffles.  I had the lamb that taste so bland. My husband liked the spicy jambalaya.. overall it sucked. For $200.00 we could've had a decent meal elsewhere.
