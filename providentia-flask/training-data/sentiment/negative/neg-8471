I think we are have given our local coffee house it's last shot.  Let me start with the breakfast sandwich that has the worst scrambled egg concoction on it its impossible to eat. That was the first visit. Coffee was nothing to write home about either. Went another time and got an overpriced pizza that looked great when it was coming to the table but after careful inspection it was the greasiest thing I had ever seen and too greasy to even pick up!! I wrote this review last year when they had the hot dog cart but apparently i didn't hit the post button. Still haven't been back.
  We said we would never repeat but got hooked in again by noticing a hot dog cart out front. Don't eat them often so it is a rare but treasured treat. Went inside and ordered the foot long 1/2 lb hot dog and a bratworst plus two iced teas. Came to over 17 dollars and they handed us two  buns in baskets and told us to take them outside to the grill. I asked if they had a bigger bun and they looked at me like I was stupid! huh? A 6 inch regular bun? Can you not afford foot long buns for your foot long hot dogs? I should have asked for a refund  but my guy said he wouldnt eat his if I told them I didn't want it. Instead I asked for a box and boxed the hot dog and threw the stale bun away. These people know nothing about food. We will never return because there are many better and friendlier places to enjoy without being raped  of your hard earned money for bad food!
P.S. you cannot get a refill for an iced tea if you have not ordered food along with it.
