Bleh...the girl cooking the crepes was not good. Like other reviews the strawberry crepe came out doughy and raw tasting. No crispness at all. I ordered a banana nutella, wasn't even warm. Banana was cold and no "melty" nutella. This place will go down vv the tubes auper quick. They need a true crepe chef or else. Not good
