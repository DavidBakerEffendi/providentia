Where do I start? This review in no way is a reflection on our server Darrell. Beers on tap here are pretty nonexistent, our apps came 5 minutes before our entrees. These seem petty and they are, but are not the true problems with this restaurant. Chicken pasta arrives cold, my wife's had a hair in it that another waitress tried to say was hers when it was clearly embedded in the pasta. Darrell got it taken off the bill and we had requested to speak with the manager who managed to look at our table several times but never had the wherewithal to make it over to us. Poor management skills must be a given here. I suggest any other restaurant in town over this place.
