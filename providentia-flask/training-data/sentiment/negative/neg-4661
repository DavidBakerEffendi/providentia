Horrible food and service.  I got a couple of cold sandwiches and onion rings.  It took over an hour.  The chicken salad was room temp by the time I got it and the lettuce wilted.  I am not going to eat it in fear of food poisoning.  I won't be getting food from here ever again. I tried calling to let them known what happened and the guy on the phone arrgued with me about when I placed my order.  I did it online through the yelp app so I have confirmation.  If you want good service there are tons of restaurants around Chandler. Got to any one of them but here.
