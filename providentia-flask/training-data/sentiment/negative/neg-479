Just stopped in for "Express Lunch"...never again.  From the hostess to the bartender to the waitresses, no one seemed to know what was going on in this place.  Food delivered to the wrong tables, incorrect pricing charged for lunch, and the wait for the "Express Lunch" to go was over 30 minutes.  

My coworker & I both got the Greek salad with lamb.  This was the only item that supposedly didn't include a side - even though the menu says the lunches all include one.  It was a scant handful of romaine, half a can of beets, maybe 2 Tbsp of lamb, and sweet, thick dressing.  This was at best a side salad (with a half can of beets poured on top) for $10.  A waste of time and money.  Just gross.

My coworker called to complain and was offered "more lettuce" or a free container of soup.  They threw in a free dessert as well - which would have been nice if she was actually able to eat sweets.  I didn't bother calling because I don't want anything they have to offer.
