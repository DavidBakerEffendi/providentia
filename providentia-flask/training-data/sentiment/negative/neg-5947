Super disappointing experience. Dinner last night, six of us 5:45PM, reserved a patio table (never realizing the neglect we'd receive from sitting the furthest from the kitchen!!) Our waiter was polite but extremely SLOW & very inattentive...Muscles & cauliflower appetizer 2 start our dining experience took 35min to deliver, & rather than explaining that he perhaps forgot to submit the order, he merely said "the kitchen is so busy, sorry for the delay"  A swordfish dish ordered was terribly overcooked & the ribs delivered were ICE COLD... (These guests are extremely low maintenance I might add) & in brief mention to our waiter, he elected to "re-order" the ribs in hopes they were warmer, & left the swordfish to be literally untouched. The ribs arrived  when everyone else had completed their meal, only to be placed in a to-go box!!! A glass of pricey champagne was served in a wine glass, (the flute glass serves a purpose in retaining the bubbles) We were told the bartender was young & felt like all champagne was Proseco (lame explanation) The server realized our disappointment & offered to comp desert!!! Considering our bill was over $700. (Lots of great wine consumed) it would seem complimentary desert was the least one could do to salvage a bad experience.... Luckily, it was several close friends enjoying each-others company but sadly, not the restaruant. Unfortunate because the ambiance & location is terrific, we won't be returning... I wish now I had paid closer attention to a review I had read in Trends magazine that was not positive.
