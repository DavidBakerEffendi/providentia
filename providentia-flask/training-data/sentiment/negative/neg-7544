WORST EXPERIENCE WITH A MANAGER/OWNER OF A RESTAURANT AND WORST PIZZA IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!! I ordered a pizza from Grazie for pick up since its not far from where I live,and wanted to try something new. To my disappointment the pizza I ordered came out incorrect, folded over, and DRY AS A BOARD WHEN I ORDERED EXTRA SAUCE. So, I called the manager to let them know about the order, but was totally thrown off, as he had A COMPLETELY RUDE ATTITUDE, was highly combative, did NOT make any attempt to make it right and in fact said to me that if I were to go to the restaurant to show him the pizza that he would kick me out and call the police on me - and of course then hung up the phone on me. I've eaten out to eat for almost every meal since I was young, and I have NEVER been treated so poorly and for sure never threatened by a manager/owner (who was a male btw..) I don't like being negative, but what happened tonight was NOT OK.. I do NOT recommend this place to anyone. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, POOR MANAGEMENT, HORRIBLE PIZZA!!! Save your money and do yourself a favor by NEVER EAT AT GRAZIE!!!
