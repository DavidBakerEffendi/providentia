Incredible! After a long wait at the drive thru we get home and we got the order of 2 cars behind us! Then when brought to management's attention they could care less and never once apologized for THEIR mistake. Will never return. Cannot recommend farmer boys to anyone.

UPDATE! See below! Copy and paste corporate message. Doesn't even come close to the reason the one star review was given. Sad and embarrassing. Reflects how they see the customer. SAD!
