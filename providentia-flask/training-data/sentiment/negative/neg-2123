If you want bad chinese food and bad customer service, this would be the place. I've been here a couple times just because I wanted to make sure that they didn't just have a bad day, but I was wrong. I've never back since and will never plan to go there. 
Let start my review of their BBQ side of the restaurant. I used to go here to buy BBQ duck or roast pork because they were the only one selling it. Their BBQ duck wasn't that good, but either that or driving to CA to get some. When you're threre, they treated you like #$%@ b/c it was crowded they didn't need you. Anyway, when King BBQ opened up a few block down the road, I didn't need SWBBQ either. KBBQ has much better roast duck and pork, definitely recommend it there. Now there are other places starting selling BBQ duck too, example would be the 168 market.
Now let look at their restaurant side. We ordered a varieties of items on different trips there and all of them ranged from eehhh to mediocre. Most of the food were too oily.The floor and tables were dirty and the service was kinda suck.
Summary, if you want Chinese BBQ, go to King BBQ down the road on Spring Mountain (and Lindell???)
