It's unfortunate that I have to give TR such a low score. We waited 45 minutes to get seated. In the mean time there was a huge half dead cockroach crawling around the bathroom. By the time we were finally seated all they had was well done prime rib. Waste of my time.  Had to ask for rolls several times because they didn't have any.  Texas roadhouse, if you can't have medium rare prime rib at 7:30 on a Wednesday night then your really missing the mark.   I was part of a production team that did a meeting for you In San Francisco. The service I experienced tonight is far from the culture you preached at your employee meetings.  I was a huge proponent for you before but after this, not so much.
