i tried this place to eat breakfast with my wife and 2 kids. and we will not go back there again. simply because its over price. they have this so called "belgian waffle" price $5.75 just a simple waffle that anybody can do it . and i waited 45 minutes just for that. and everything there is just over price. i would not recommend this place.
