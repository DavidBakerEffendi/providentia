I'll start with customer service! - Really bad - I had food twice here. The next day, the food tasted stale and also was spicy. The owner clearly denied that it was stale, and the spice was mild! I mean is the customer stupid to say such things. Nonetheless, it wasn't great food either. Just edible enough.

Second, they charge (whatsoever the low charge is), for some extra sauces (coconut chatni). Its like i get charged for asking for ketchup with my burgers and sandwiches!
