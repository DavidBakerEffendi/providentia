WAY TO BOMB METRO PIZZA! EVERYONE I know for a FACT who lives in Centennial was waiting...and waiting...and waiting for this place to open because after all the other locations are AMAZING! But WHAT THE HOLY HELL happened with this one?? WORST salad ever and my treasured garlic knots tasted literally like sweat..yes SWEAT! SO disappointed in this location. I bet people who like this place have not tried the other locations. They should, then they would see that this location SUCKS!! Guess I will continue driving all the way to Tropicana!
