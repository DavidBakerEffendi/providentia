I won't come here for the food again. The service is good and the minced pork rice is good. The beef tataki "highly recommended!!!" Was a super thick cut, over seared and bland. The nice part was you can get water yourself at the condiment bar. Nothing too special with the soups and half the items on the menu were crossed out
