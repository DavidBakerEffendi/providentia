Never been to an O Charley's in my life and never will after going here today. Rolls were good and that's the best I can say about this place. Everything came out BURNT. The chicken pot pie I ordered was burned and so was my girlfriends Tuscan chicken. Atmosphere was lame and so were the servers. Plain Jane central. This restaurant seemed to be on the outs based on what I saw. Don't go here. There are so many similar restaurants in the area that do such a better job.
