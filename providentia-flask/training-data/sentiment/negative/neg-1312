What a let down. I have heard about this place for years so I finally had the time to try it out and in simple words, everything was a disappointment. Nothing was fresh, the crab legs were dry/aged/rubbery. The service was good, and I don't want to discredit their work and service but the food was garbage. Now I am full, but still feeling hungry because none of my taste buds were satisfied.
