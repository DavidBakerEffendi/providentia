I've heard so many people say that this place is a must go for Arizona! 
When I was at another restaurant the guy said that there's people who fly out here just to eat. 

I'm a big fan of New York Style pizza and I was hoping for something like that. 

The ambiance was nice vintage like, very cute setting. When I got the menu there's definitely more drinks on it than food. I felt like the Pizza place should of been called Wine and Bite. For someone like me who enjoys trying new food. It's false adverstiment Pizzeria Bianco... geez
