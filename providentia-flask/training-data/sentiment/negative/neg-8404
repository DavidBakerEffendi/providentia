Hit or miss with this place. Please keep in mind we have been here before and we've had decent service. Don't expect much from them though. Especially the service, it's been the same for years and they all need a class or two. Today was a huge miss. Sat on the far left side at around 3pm. My family of 4 sat here for 25 minutes and none of the sushi on the left side had been replenished in that time. There are two belts. We ordered our own rolls to come out and that took 20 minutes until someone had finally asked if we were doing okay. We were fed up and just had them cancel our orders. Another couple next to us had ordered the same amount at the same time as us and there's had already came out. You get what you pay for, even then it's still not worth it including tip. We left hungry. Come here with caution.
