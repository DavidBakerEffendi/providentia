Booo field kitchen. You suck in so many ways. You think you are so damn fancy. The upcharge for crappy salad and limited selection of soups was not warranted. I DO NOT need somebody to toss my salad or pour my dressing for me, thanks. I also think that your drinks and additional items are a huuuuge rip off. You are ostracizing your original customer base by enforcing a one time through trip to the salad/soup bar. Do you really think that the customers that frequented your establishment are going to think that the decrease in value is worth it now because you put some fresh rosemary in a tiny vase at each table and planted some lettuce out front? I got news for you field kitchen...you are digging yourself in deep this time. Oh and the tip you slipped in to everybody's check? Classy touch.
