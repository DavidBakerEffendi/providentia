I thought this would be a friendly place to eat, and I was very disappointed.  The waitress was so rude. We waited ten minutes for a table that was sitting empty the whole time we were waiting. Then when we finally got to sit down and order it took a good 45 minutes for our food to come out, and the waitress didn't check on us once that whole time. Not to refill our drinks or anything. It was loud, uncomfortable, and the service was awful. The food was good, it was just hard to enjoy it after such a long frustrating wait. I love the idea of checking out little hometown spots, but this is the type of place that makes you scared to try someplace new.
