Came here for dinner this evening at about 7pm. It was not very busy and they kept running out of food. Eventually the line became very backed up. After we paid for our 4 combo plates we were told that we would have to wait for our pot stickers and beef.  Paid and sat down. 15 minutes went by and our food was not ready yet (waiting on broccoli beef and pot stickers). We eventually got our food and began eating (without our broccoli beef and pot stickers). We were almost done and our food still did not arrive. So I went to the front of the line and got my order of broccoli beef, the cashier told me to have a seat and that she would bring me our pot stickers. Another 10 minutes pass and have
They finally arrived. They were moist, soggy, and looked very under cooked.
