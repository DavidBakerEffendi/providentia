I had the misfortune of coming here for brunch. Maybe they are still working out the kinks, who knows. But for the over-inflated price of $17.99 I would expect better. The fruit selection is fresh, I'll give it that - but rather lacklustre. The brunch has the ubiquitous bacon, omelette station, scrambled eggs, sausages and pastries.

I am lactose-intolerant. Surprisingly many people are lactose intolerant. The omelette station uses eggs from a carton and surprise surprise it's eggs with milk. Since lactose-intolerance is fairly prevalent it would stand to reason that the restaurant make the effort to use carton-eggs which are milk free. 

I had asked for a la carte menu - dismissive response was "oh sorry, not available". How the f*ck can you cater to dietary needs if there is no one to do it? I mean, how difficult is it to not add milk to scrambled eggs?

Mind you, for $17.99 I expect them to use fresh real eggs. 

I had two pieces of toast, two watermelon slices & 6 slices of bacon - obviously I got my money's worth. Not.

If you value your tastebuds, enjoy the concept of good customer service, and not have your concerns dismissed out of hand then do not go to this shambles of a restaurant.

If you enjoy being treated in a shabby manner please feel free to patronise this restaurant. This person, on the other hand, values her wallet and her spare time.
