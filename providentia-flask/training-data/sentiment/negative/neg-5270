I was eager to try this place since all the reviews are really good. I arrived at the same time as a party of 8 did. The server got drinks and then shuttled food orders one by one to the POS computer. The server acknowledged me once but after 15 minutes of sitting at the sushi bar and never even getting a menu to look at it... while two sushi chefs and a man (I assume is the manager or owner since he had a fast food cup in his hand as he sat at the bar) ignored me... I left and will not return.
