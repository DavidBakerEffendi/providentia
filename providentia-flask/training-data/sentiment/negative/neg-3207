Horrible customer service. We waited over an hour when we were told 45 minutes and as I'm writing this, still waiting. The hostess "assumed" We wouldn't want to sit at the bar. Everyone else walked in and got a table within half an hour if not less.  The hostesses disregard of saying "sorry" is not excusable. When I come to Charlotte I always looked forward to coming here. Never again.
