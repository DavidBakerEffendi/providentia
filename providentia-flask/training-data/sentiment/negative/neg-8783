Horrible customer service.  My husband placed a to-go order and I went to pick it up.  Paid, left a 3.00 tip on a 12.92 order, ordered pad thai.  Got all the way home and my husband was calling me telling me they sent me home with the WRONG order and I needed to go back.  I went back and asked how I was going to be compensated.  She either had no idea what I was asking or was playing dumb.  She offered me a tea "to make me happy."  I went 20 minutes out of my way, gave a $3.00 tip on a to-go order and SHE screwed up and offers up a tea.  Our business will be taken else where.
