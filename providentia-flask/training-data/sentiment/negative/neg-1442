Very disappointed the whole family watching TV so I told my kids to buy dozen of taco for snack when I open it wow taco don't look like taco look like quesadilla like nothing inside I remember one time when I'm driving back from LA I stop by lenwood California and the only open is DELTACO I order 3 taco but when I open it lots of cheese and lettuce not like this Taco Bell not even half of this definitely this is my last taco bell
