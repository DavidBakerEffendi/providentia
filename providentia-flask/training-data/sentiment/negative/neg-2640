Let me start off by saying I had a good first experience here. The owner was really nice, helpful and informative about the restaurant. However this follow up experience was absolutely horrendous. We walk in around 9PM and are barley greeted by a group of 16 year old employees. One employee even yells "fuck" at the top of her lungs for no reason. Fast forward to when I'm eating, said employee starts blaring music so loud it made it hard to sit and enjoy my food. All 3 employees then sit down with a friend who comes by to hangout. All not doing their job and yelling and screaming. That same employee then shouts over at us and says "do you hate my music" and starts laughing. I hope the owners of this place read this as I will never return to this restaurant. And as an employee in customer service for over 5 years, I was absolutely disgusted with how these employees conducted themselves.
