In the Dark but Seeing Red.

The concept was novel for about 15 minutes.  The food was like soggy cardboard and could only have come from the freezer (Michelina was comparatively high-end!).  And then they had the gall to charge chef's rates.  In summary, the food was terrible, the experience was mediocre, and the prices were criminal.  That said, I appreciate the fact that they hire blind service staff who obviously face greater employment obstacles than others.  But this place is NOT built for repeat customers - O. Noir is a gimmick which I expect will burn out as soon as enough people have been to spread the word.
