My friends and I went there after everything was closing in Downtown. Though the service was okay, the food came out horrible. Worst of all, I ordered an Irish Coffee. They charged me $4.50 for the Irish Coffee and then $5.00 for Baileys.  A $9.00 Irish Coffee. When I complained , the manager said I had to call the General Manager and the District Manager to get any recourse. Never going there again. I absolutely do NOT recommend it.
