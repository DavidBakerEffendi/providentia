The only reason this restaurant even gets one star is the waiter.  He was so nice but the food was horrendous.   I ordered the "new" baked ziti, and it literally had a half of a cup of oil in the pan. I couldn't even eat it.   I took one bite, then looked at the pan and the grease was oozing out of it everywhere.  It was so gross and made me immediately nauseous.  We called our waiter over and he took it away and took it off our bill.  We left before my husband even finished so I think the whole meal should have been comped.  Needless to say, we won't be going back.
