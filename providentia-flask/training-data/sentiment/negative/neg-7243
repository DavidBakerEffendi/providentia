The only good thing about this Eat n Park is that there is now a Denny's around the corner. 

Surly waitresses who won't  bring refills or check on you during the meal (especially if you get the breakfast buffet--which is the only way to get your food in a timely manner). 

I wasn't expecting perfection, but if I wanted to do all the work, I would have stayed home.
