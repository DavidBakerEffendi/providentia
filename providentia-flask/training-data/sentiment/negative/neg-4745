I have been here twice and I just can't recommend it.  The first time was so-so.  I ordered a pizza off the pre-set menu and then still had to answer yes/no to most of the ingredients despite asking for it to be made as described.  The second time I did the same thing but this time they did at least attempt to build the pizza from the menu.  They were doing great until at the last step when they forgot one thing.  So, when they asked if that was all I offered the missing ingredient: Fennel Seeds.  Aaaaandd, the employee grabbed a handful of capers and covered the pizza with them. These things happen and so I was apologetic about my request to remake it.  I really hate capers.  I paid and sat down assuming they would get it right on the second go at it.  Lets just say that was clearly expecting too much.
