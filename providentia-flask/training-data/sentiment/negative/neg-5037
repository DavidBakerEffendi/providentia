I love the Wynn. It's my go to place, and I have enjoyed eating at the Terrace Point Cafe on several occasions. My last visit, however, was absolutely terrible.  After waiting 30 minutes in line, I was told that my cover-up for my swimsuit was not suitable for sitting indoors. I was told that sitting outside would be an additional 20 minutes on top of the thirty that I had already waited.  I was at the bar.  At the bar I was allowed to order drinks but when I asked if I could order food from the bar I was told that I could not because I was not dressed appropriately and could only eat outside. Being told that you can sit in a bar order and pay for drinks but are not allowed to order food is absolutely ridiculous and it honestly made me feel like I was a dog that had to eat outside. We ordered bottom of this mimosas at the bar and then finally about 30 minutes later were brought to our table outside. After ordering her food are bottomless Mimosas were now empty and sat that way for another 20 minutes making the whole point of bottomless mimosas pointless. When we explained our issue to the server when he finally came back with our food he was very apologetic and did his best to try and rectify the situation. At that point after dealing with the rude hostess as well as the bartender there wasn't much I could be fixed at that point.  I'll be the last time I return to the terrace point.
