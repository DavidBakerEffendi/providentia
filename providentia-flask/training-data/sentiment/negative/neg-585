We used our BOGO breakfast buffet coupon from MyVegas game on Facebook.
$20 and change for the two of us.

While this seems to be a very large buffet, it was lacking in selection.  
There is an omelet station, and my omelet  was delicious.  That's where it ended.
There were hash browns (shaved and barely browned) and no other style of potatoes.  Actually, very little food selections and you get your own drinks.  I think there are servers, but they don't serve you anything.  While I did see workers on the floor, they were not perky or happy.  Occasionally, I did see them clearing a table.  But there were many tables just waiting to be cleared--just full of dishes.  I wouldn't go back to have breakfast here again.  I'm glad we didn't pay full price, because it wouldn't have been worth it.  I wouldn't recommend this buffet to anyone.

But here is a perk--with that price, you get beer and wine --you have to go get it, but it is part of the price.  We didn't have beer or wine in mind with breakfast, but some people may like that :)
