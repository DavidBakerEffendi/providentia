Wet, soggy, and messy burgers.  I went with my coworkers today for lunch.  We each ordered a variation of their burgers. Mine was not cooked through and was very messy. One friends burgery actually fell apart on the ground. The fries were pretty greasy. Not worth the price we paid. I don't see what the fuss is all about as these are just average street food burgers, nothing really special.
