Fibbers... Get your act together. This is the 3rd time I've had to deal with incredibly rude wait staff, are you trying to scare off customers or something? I shouldn't be repeatedly made to feel like simply sitting down and ordering food or drinks is a massive inconvenience to your employees. You were a mediocre pub at best to begin with, but now you aren't even at the bottom of my list, you aren't even worth considering.
