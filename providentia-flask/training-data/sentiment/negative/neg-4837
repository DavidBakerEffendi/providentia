Not sure when they started charging the FULL amount of stay as soon as you book and implemented this policy:

Reservations must be cancelled 151 days prior to arrival in order to receive a full refund. Cancellations received within 151 days will result in 100.00% forfeiture of your deposit.

But any casino/hotel that does this will get a 1 star from me.
