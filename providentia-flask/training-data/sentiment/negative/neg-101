They did not honor the veterans day special.  The "manager" did not receive and email.  I told her it was on the web site. She did not look.  DO NOT GO HERE.  CORPORATE: Get a new staff and train them.  I will not be going back. Went 3 times and every time there is an issue.  They don't have a clue about filling orders and have horrible customer service.
