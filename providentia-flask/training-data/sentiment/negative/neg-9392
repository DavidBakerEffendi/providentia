I was very excited finally i found real mexican food because I tried the tacos from the food truck in the cabbadge town fest and they were super good.
Today I came to the restaurant with my friends, we got enchiladas, beef torta and huarache.
So disapointing, the huarache was build with two tortillas, what is that? They supposed to make it fresh with masa. Why would you serve tacos?
Enchiladas were served with rice and beans, you could tell the beans were right out from the can, no flavor whatsoever, the rice was like days old and not flavorfull. Enchiladas made with bottle sauce, I could just have made all this at home.
The torta was so plain, even my friend that eats plain food complaint that it was expensive for what he got.
Not coming back for sure.
