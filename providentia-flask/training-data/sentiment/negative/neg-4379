You know,  the food is pretty good. The wait staff, however, is horrible. I would give you our waitresses name from the last time but she did not give it. She is thin, shorter dark brown hair, average height and a nose piercing. 
She has a hard time hiding the fact that she either hates her life, her job or both. 

The lady that was with us asked for a manager and she sent over another waitress who then went and told her. We know this because she came back over and told us that we were wrong, she had not been rude. The whole thing was very awkward. They comped our breakfast for what it's worth. 

Again,  the food was good but that girl was nuts. 

We live in lake Wylie and will both never go back there and tell everyone about what happened to us on October 13 th. 2013 at around 9 or 10 am.
