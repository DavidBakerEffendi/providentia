I have to write this review. I am/was regular at SnS in Brunswick, but something happened recently with the staff that has caused me to write this review. They are unkempt, rude, ignorant to the menu and quite frankly act like a bunch of school girls in the hall. 

I love the garlic double burger there but without the garlic spread. So in other words a burger with the garlic salt on top of the bun. 

So that's what I ordered. My girlfriend ordered a Frisco and it was fairly slow that evening. Our waitress took the order and came back with the food some few minutes later and that's when I realized that it had the garlic sauce on it. I asked her about it and she became flustered. I was not rude, just asked her what it was as I normally get it the way I described above. She then, without saying another word took my plate and went in the back. She came back 2 minutes later with a bun and two plain patties. I started to ask her a question about it, but then just asked her for a slice of cheese and the manager. 

She went over to the grill person where everyone gathered to hear her speak. Then watched as the manager who was a part of the group, a person I'd never seen before, came over and told us that she, the waitress, was new and didn't understand the menu.  The manager, who was pregnant, told us that she doesn't really care for the meat quality anyway and won't eat there. Maybe she said that, because we didn't ask anything close to anything like that, because she was pregnant and I've heard of people saying certain foods can be off putting when pregnant, but the whole experience was surreal!

We were both baffled and now clearly frustrated. We ate the fries and left. Waste of $$ and time. Steak and Shake has lost our business. When and if they ever decide to hire people that actually read there own menu or eat there own food then we may consider going back. Until then, I'll go elsewhere to spend my hard earned money!
