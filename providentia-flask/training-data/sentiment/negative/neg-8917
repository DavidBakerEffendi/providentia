Well I'll start with I ordered my food at 8 an he told me 50 minutes an it's now 9:35 an it jus got here! (Cold) The man was mean on the phone I should've knew then not to order! Anyway on top of that he didn't listen to me an forgot a meal!! An now they r closed so upset with everything! Oh an I called to see if my food was coming an he said all my drivers r out! No sorry we got really busy or anything! I will never go back! An I work in food severs! I also never do this cuz I feel so bad but jus want to give people a heads up!
