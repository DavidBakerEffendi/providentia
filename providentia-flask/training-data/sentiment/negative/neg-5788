Disappointed. Was quoted an hour wait for our party of two with no reservation only to watch an incomplete party of three be seated immediately when they walked in 10 minutes later (also with no reservation) at one of two open four-tops. Upon further investigation, apparently it is their policy that parties of two may not sit at a table for four. Hmm. Kind of just looked they were friends with the server.
