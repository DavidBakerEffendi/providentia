I love the food at Wahoos and appreciate that they have a wide variety of options including Paleo, vegan, gluten free, etc. However - this location SUCKS. I came in for a takeout order and literally sat there waiting for over 30 minutes. Then I just got home and my order was wrong and they forgot the chips and guacamole I spent extra money on. What a huge disappointment especially after waiting so long for the food. You guys need to pull it together. This is totally unacceptable.
