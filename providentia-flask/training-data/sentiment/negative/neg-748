Buffet seems as though they keep getting worse!!! It is already at a size disadvantage but i was here a week ago & Service was horrible couldn't even refill my Pepsi for lunch great you can cook me a burger because not much else offered standard tacos, pot stickers., pizza, fries they hace mashed potatoes but no stuffing they had meatballs with stale noodles hard & nasty No orange chicken... Dinner probably sucks too... I guess palace is only good for breakfast service still sucks but atleast breakfast is good
