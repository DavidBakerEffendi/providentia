They always screw up my order. I go here for convenience but man do I always regret it. Simple task (no salt on fries) a separate fry spatula should be used because salt from the spatula still gets on the fries. They are slow with orders and not sure why because I only got there for a happy meal or 10 piece nuggets for my brother..
