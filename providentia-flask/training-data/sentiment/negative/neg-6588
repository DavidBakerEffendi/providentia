Why 1 star? Because of some of the most rude customer service I've ever received.

  ---   ---   ---

I did not plan on writing this review today, but after some of the most egregious customer service I've ever received, I could not resist. For those who regularly see my reviews, you'll notice two common comments:

1) I try not to kill a business with a review due to one part-time employee having a bad day.

2) I've written nearly 1,100 reviews, and only 9 are 1-star, at the time of this visit. I try to be positive, even when a place doesn't offer a ton of positivity. 

With that being said, let me paint the scene:

-My flight from Tampa-Charlotte was delayed, so I had to sprint from Terminal E - Terminal B while wearing Tom's and carrying 2 bags.

-I arrived at my gate, feeling like I just ran a marathon, only to learn that I missed the opportunity to board by 2 minutes. Awesome.

-I made arrangements to board the next flight and felt the need to find a good beer.

-How convenient? Right next to my gate was a restaurant/bar, called Whiskey River! 

-I take two steps in to said establishment, look for the beer taps at the bar, and realize that there aren't any within sight. 

-I turn around and ask the one of hostesses if she has a beer list I can see. She hands me a menu.

***THE FUN PART***

-The other hostess (named Kaylan) then addresses the other hostess and loudly asks, "Hey _____, can you tell me what the sign right outside the restaurant says?"

Other hostess: "See hostess to be seated."

Kaylan: "Ohhhh that's what I thought! And can you tell me what the sign back there, just beyond that sign says?"

Other hostess: "See hostess to be seated."

Kaylan: "Yes, that's what I thought too!"

I drop menu back on hostess stand, and walk away.

Apparently Kaylan found it wildly inappropriate that I took two steps inside the threshold of the business to look at the taps, without addressing her first. She then dealt with the situation in the most rude way possible. I can't recall dealing with someone that rude at a restaurant in all of the time I've been writing Yelp reviews. If I were the owner, there is a zero percent chance that she would be employed another day.

I have never written a review of a business without actually purchasing something, and I have never written a review within 30 minutes of an experiencing a place. This situation was so outrageous that I felt like I had no choice.
