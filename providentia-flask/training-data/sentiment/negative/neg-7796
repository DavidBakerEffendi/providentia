Please do yourself a huge favor and go somewhere else. I had the most unpleasant dining experience at this place. I understand that generally sushi ayce places have below par customer service but this place is by far the worst I've experienced. Our waiter kept dropping by and asking us if we were done (not in a polite way) even though we had only been seated for less than 45 minutes. In the end we got so annoyed we just left without having any deserts. Not to mention that the food was not good either. For the money we spent we could've had much better sushi.
