Had a reservation for 9:30pm and at 9:45pm we're told that there were 4 tables eating desert and as soon as one was finished they would clean it for us.
Not my idea of planning for customer satisfaction for a restaurant that will seat you only with a reservation. Were seated at 10:00pm.
The manager did give us complementary appetizers to be fair.
We were a party of 6.
2 ordered the prime rib - concensus=OK (not great)
4 ordered the fillet mignon - concensus = everyone agrees their steak was "tough".  No one received it to its correct ordered term.
Wine list is overpriced and in summary this restaurant is not worth the price of its meal selections when compared to the quality of the food it is delivering.

Would not go back.
