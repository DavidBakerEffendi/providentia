We are here right now and will never be back. We always come here and usually enjoy everything but not tonight. The bartender would not serve my moms friend who is 30 because she thinks he is messed up. He is actually really shy and always talks different. Before we came here he had one margarita at Azteca across the street. This was really  prejudice because he is not drunk and I ordered a drink and wasn't even ID'ed and I'm only 21. We will never be coming here again. The bartender is rude and there is a reason this place has shitty reviews.
