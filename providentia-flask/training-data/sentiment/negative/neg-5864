My wife & I are big fan of both Boiling Crab & Hot n Juicy.  Last night, after 10 pm, Hot n Juicy was closed & we accidentally found this place called Urban Crawfish. Never been here before. It was around 10:25 pm and only one table was occupied. Late hours and it was understandable. Bit sketical but we decided to give it a try and ordered carry out. 1 lb Crawfish in spicy, 1 lb shrimp medium spicy & 1 lb shrimp extra mild sauce. What kind of sauces they were are not important in this review because everyone has different taste. Just because I didn't like their sauce doesn't mean it is a bad restaurant.  Different restaurant...different recipe..simple. 
   We got home & finally get settled to enjoy our late dinner on our day off. Well, very disappointing taste of sauce, but like I said, it's only personal preference.  I'm sure there are lot of people who love this recipe.  But Crawfish not being fresh? That's a totally different issue.
   If you are Crawfish lover, like I am, you understand the joy of sucking the brain juice out of Crawfish. To me .... that's the best part. But at the same time It's also one of the nastiest tasting thing if it is not fresh. I tried 6 crawfish and ended up throwing them away. Just terrible. I've never been a review writer on Yelp. But paying $ & tasting  not fresh shelfish? Its just very difficult to tolerate.  Expecially when I'm a chef myself.
   As I write this review with bad taste in my mouth, my wife is making a sanswich. I'll let you take a guess why.
