Although I personally did not eat while here at this restaurant I experienced one of the worst customer service experiences in my LIFE! If it was possible to give negative starts I would. 

  The manager was the worst I have ever seen! Our friends found hair in their food and were told that, this sort of thing happens often, as if it was no big deal! Then she proceeded to yell at me because I wasn't present when the hair appeared and was discussed. I was merely trying to ask if they would be charged for the item as my friends were unsure how to ask tactfully. 

  Although the owner tried to resolve the issue. The issue of customer service and rude yelling could not be addressed, unless they were to hire new manager, who is capable of communicating with people properly. 

  If you want quality and RESPECTFUL service. Go else wear . I was told by my friends who attempted to eat here that the food was unimpressive. Hopefully this restaurant will learn a stern lesson, to treat their customers with respect, if they agree with them or not. Customer Relations 101. You are welcome for the free advice!
