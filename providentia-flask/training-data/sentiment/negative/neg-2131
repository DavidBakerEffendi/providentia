Purchased a groupon for four people, but the manager told us we cannot use it for three people. They told me that I can only use half of the value if we had three people. What they are trying to do is pretty obvious: the food of the groupon is not enough for four people, so customers need to order more when they arrive the restaurant. And customers will be charged for desserts fee for each person (like others mentioned). 
The groupon is not available for a few selected dates on groupon, but it cannot be used on any holidays actually.
