You realize that the whole staff of the this place does nothing but sell and smoke weed in the back near the dumpsters, and they have friends in cars sitting out front it's like a social drug network there the moment they it dies down from the late night bar staff.  Food is still good just takes forever to get anything and THEY NEVER HAVE SUPPLIES OR ANSWER PHONE. Constantly out of cups and carry out containers.
