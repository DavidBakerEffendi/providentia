We had a 20 minute wait which we didn't mind . We were taken to the very back of this restaurant right by the back doors. Table was not even set up for diners. There were open booths and tables all through the restaurant. We clearly were not the target demographic that this restaurant caters to. I'm ashamed of this type of behavior and will never patronize this restaurant as long as I live.
