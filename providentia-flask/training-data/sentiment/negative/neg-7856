I am not a fan of chain types of "Irish" themed pubs (it's hard to tell this is one until you walk in). Nor am I a fan of bars that attracts clientele like a) clubland douchebags, b) loud obnoxious sports fans, c) alcohol-fuelled college kids/frat boys, d) any combination of the three. Its downtown location means you can expect such a crowd to a mediocre grimy pub like Grace.

Likewise, its beer menu is disappointingly dismal, small and completely leaning towards a world tour of familiar big brand names at premium prices. You might as well drink out of a toilet. Then again, it's a corporate chain pub, what should I expect?. Any bar in Toronto that does not at least have Steam Whistle or Mill St. does not deserve to be a bar anywhere in Toronto.

The food.... let's just say I'd rather go to a supermarket and buy some Pinty's Pub&Grill frozen meals. Hey, Pinty's products are endorsed by the Homan curling rink... I can't go wrong with that!

And the service can be slow to nonexistent. It wasn't even that busy a weekend night and there was hardly anyone keeping check at our section. And if I have to work my butt off to get the bill, via heading to the bar and then getting shuffled by headless staff over which server to talk to, and then waiting another 15 minutes waiting for it to be produced, meanwhile in the drunken frustration contemplating pulling off a dine-and-dash while watching the Penguins get their ass kicked on their dinky TVs, well... congratulations. You have failed as a restaurant. Let me know when you make an appearance on that obnoxiously exaggerated TV show Bar Rescue.

I shouldn't have to undergo an expedition to resolve a tab or get more drinks. What, y'all don't want to be paid? Hey, that would be swell by me, as I sure won't be back here even this is the last remaining bar in downtown.
