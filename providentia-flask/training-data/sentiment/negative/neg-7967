Just no!! My fiance' and I popped in here without doing any research. I just knew that I wanted a crabcake and we were staying at the Luxor so it was close (situated just outside of Mandalay Bay).

We went mid day through the week and the place was completely empty. I ordered a crabcake, and it was the worst crabcake I have ever eaten (my grocer's are so much better). At $25 I was served one very underpleasing crabcake. Not only was it tiny, but I couldn't see/taste hardly any crab, AND it had shell bits in it. I wouldn't have paid $5 for it if I had the choice.

My fiance' ordered a fish sandwich (also about $25 for a sandwich) which he said tasted terrible. He said it was less flavorful than McDonald's...what does that tell you?

Moreover, the servers were at the bar practicing making drinks and paid very little attention to us, which was awful considering we were literally the only patrons.

I visit Vegas pretty frequently at twice a year and I will never, ever go back to this restaurant. Trust the reviews here... 

In addition to the terrible food, the employee's are awful to deal with. You couldn't pay me to go back.
