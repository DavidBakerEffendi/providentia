This place is absolutely terrible. Some of the staff there is okay. Food Is mediocre, place is poorly kept up, and their A/C never seems to be working. The manager, Kathy, is absolutely 100% unprofessional, she yells and cusses at her staff in front of the customers, talks down to everyone. Some of my regular servers express how mean and unprofessional she is. Surprised she has kept the staff she has for as long as she has considering the abuse they endure each and everyday. I enjoy Tuesday dollar pizza a beer night. The bar tender is great, but the manager really makes me rethink visiting there everytime I go. I myself have been a manager in the restaurant business and I do not approve of her managing technique and skills, or lack there of really. In my opinion this place would do triple the business of they found a better person to manage this place. My visits will continue to decline until someone with a brain fires this incompetent woman. Until then, find another place for pizza and beer like empire if you want to avoid drama and constant yelling from her big mouth.
