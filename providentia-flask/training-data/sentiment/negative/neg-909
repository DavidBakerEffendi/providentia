Here is a lesson on how to achieve 1 star on yelp:

1. Party of 16... come by every 45 minutes
2. Take 30 minutes to fill 2 drink orders
3. Stare at the table from across the room, notice everyone staring back at you. Don't come back to the table for another 20 minutes
4. Charge 18% gratuity automatically based on party size. Most restaurants have stopped doing this, take notes.

It is obvious our server didn't give a fuck about his job. The manager (or some dude that looked like a manager telling people what to do) was there that night and he didn't notice even when we complained as he walked by.

I hope you close down and something much, much, much better comes. Like McDonalds. Even McDonalds is better than you. Think about that.

p.s. Your free cotton candy is the worst cotton candy I have ever tasted. You should be paying me to eat it.
