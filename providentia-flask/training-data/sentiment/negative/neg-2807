How hard is it to screw up not once but twice
We ordered a deep dish with Italian sausage and Canadian bacon deep dish
we knew it would take time [its 820 pm]  at 915 the waitress brings a complimentary appetizer saying it will be here soon [that was nice]
then the pizza arrives  green peppers, where did the meat go?
She confirmed that she put in the ticket for  Italian sausage and Canadian bacon 
She apologized saying she will rush it, confirmed again our order
shows up 25 minutes later [10 pm] only Canadian bacon.
How do you screw it up twice.  Asked for the manager and said that is it we are leaving.  He "agreed" to remove the pizza charge but still charged us $12 for 2 beers, Thank you!
great experience!!!!!!!!!!
