Joined the husbands for a happy hour after golf and the drinks were horrendous! I ordered the French 75 which came out totally flat. I kindly asked the waiter if they could open a new bottle of bubbly and she said yes of course. The new drink came back and the only difference is that they added Sprite. It was actually kind of insulting. I finally asked for a wine which I'm willing to bet my bottom dollar that it totally came from a box. The food was gross and over fried. Long story short, if you're not 85 years old and only looking for a cheap beer and shotty service, don't waste your time.
