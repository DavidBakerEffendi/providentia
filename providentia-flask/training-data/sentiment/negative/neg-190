This place is not even that good the food doesnt have good taste and i even told the guy that if it wasnt good i was gonna complain about it, we got home and opened the chicken katsu and it was soooo thin you could just see the crunchiness and not the meat at all, we also ordered some bbq beef and it was disgusting. I called back right away after i took a small bite on the food and i talked to the guy who took our order and nicely told him the food wasnt good and the chicken was so thin with no meat on it so i asked for my money back ( $19 for something that wasnt good i get paid that much at work but thats an hour of my ass working for throwing it away just like that ) and he told me : I TOLD YOU TO ORDER THE COMBO ONE AND YOU DIDNT LISTEN TO ME SO ITS YOUR FAULT NOT MINE & all i said is : im not gonna get something you want me to get so i got What I Always Get EVERYWHERE I Go To Eat This Type Of Food so let me talk to the manager please and he said I am the manager actually i am the owner actually and its your fault not ours so at the end he just said to bring the food back which i did and when i walked in a lady was next to him and he said : She's actually the boss and i was like wtf? Thats not what you told me over the phone liar so the lady looked at the food and gave me my money back. Bad experience ever. And i even told him over the phone , i rather get my money back and give you back the food than just making a bad review on internet , i wasnt gonna do the review but i am because he was rude and a liar.
