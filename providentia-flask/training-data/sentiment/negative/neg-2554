First of all I been a loyal Cora customer,  I been coming to them almost every other Sunday with my family 

Went here last Sunday. 

The service overall was pretty bad.   Waitress was super rude and was rushing us to order.  Even though restaurant was not busy as I normally have seen them.   She had one other table beside ours.   We were so upset that we ask her not to serve us.  Completely ruin our time there. 

We had ordered 3 dishes...  My dad's was the last to get his and there was a 10 minute time difference from the time I got mine and him getting his. The portions have shrunk,  barely got any home fries. 

We won't be returning to this Coras again. And I will forward this to their head office.   They need to train their staff and do some quality control...  I hope this review turns off people from going here.
