Utterly disappointed.

That's how we felt after we cruised into the SAME restaurant and one of our servers from our visit  in May told us there was NO tasting menu anymore.  

WHAT!?!?  DJT had the SECOND best tasting menu in Vegas.  

Sadness. 

Trump cut half of the staff at the restaurant because the demand for a finer dining establishment wasn't there.  

All the staff that remain, are jumping ship fairly soon.  

Ugh.  Now I'm really never coming back to Trump LV.
