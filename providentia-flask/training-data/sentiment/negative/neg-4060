Not worth the price.  Peel and eat shrimp, snow crab legs that you have to crack yourself.  No King Crab, no Lobster.  I don't know why people think this is a good deal for what they charge.  For the record I wouldn't eat here again if it was half the price.  You can go to a much better buffet in town for the same money and get a lot more food and much better quality.
