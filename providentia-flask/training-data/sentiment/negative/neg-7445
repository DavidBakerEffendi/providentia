Please stop employing trashy, lazy employees that show they do not want to be working. Had a awful experience with the night shift workers. Employees tried making customers uncomfortable by blasting vulgar music "8/26/16 roughly around 9:50pm." so we would leave. They should try working at McDonald's next time. Way to ruin a great burger spot in Summerlin. Will be also contacting corporate ASAP.
