Bro. This might be the nastiest place I've ever eaten at. The salsa comes steaming hot for some reason. Beans were dryer than the Nevada desert itself. I just wanted a chicken chimichanga. Chicken was unseasoned, bland and chopped unlovingly and shoved into a cold and soggy tortilla. They use that warm stadium-grade nacho cheese that tastes like Kraft singles. The most comparable thing I can think of to compare my meal at this IMPOSTER MEXICAN FOOD is microwaved taco bell. LOS BASURA!!
