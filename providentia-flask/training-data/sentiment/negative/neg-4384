Good if you're a fan of precooked food or egg McMuffin's. I ordered their egg sandwich on a brioche bun. Hard egg and even stiffer bun. I had planned on eating the cheeseburger until I saw a pile of pre-cooked burgers stacked high in the back of the grill. Nothing special here, I'd go somewhere else.
