We had high hopes for our meal, reviews were good, restaurant was full. The person who took out order was irritated to start, not sure why... I guess because they were busy. Then we waited for 45 minutes for our food. I asked a couple of times and was told they were slammed. The guy's next to us got their food in 15 minutes. When ours finally came (2 fried eggs and potatoes) it had two long dark haired in it... Not either of our hair. Ugh...I was super hungry. 

I have it back and we asked for a refund. He did come over and refunded us both which was nice but never an acknowledgement of any poor service..Anything. sorry... Never again
