From the time we ordered to the time the food was placed at our table was 30 mins! Then when our food arrived it was cold! All 5 of us had cold food. It was terrible! You can tell the potatoes weren't even cooked long enough, they were soggy and cold. I've eaten here many times, this was the least busy and the worst experience! Maybe it's not busy because they are starting to make so many errors! I'd recommend a dozen other restaurants over here any day now!
