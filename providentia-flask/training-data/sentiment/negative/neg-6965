It's pretty rare that I post a Yelp review.  I should start doing it more, but for now a place needs to really stand out and this one does for it's absolutely terrible service.  The food was good but it is very overpriced, not unusual for a strip restaurant though so we expected that.  Service was very slow.  Our waitress was nice and she could definitely tell that we were getting irritated.  At the end of our meal they left us sitting with empty plates and water glasses for a good 15-20 minutes before clearing the table and offering dessert - which we were in the mood for but after waiting so long   we just wanted to get out of there.  I will never try this place again.  It's good for spending a bunch of money to get in a bad mood when it's all done.
