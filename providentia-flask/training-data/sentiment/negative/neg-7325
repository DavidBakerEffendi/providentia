This was probably the worst Chinese food I've ever forced down.  The server brought out the fried rice first and my first thought was, "Wow, they used a lot of pepper." Well, it wasn't pepper.  It was burnt.  My guess is that they burned something in the wok before they cooked ours and didn't clean it out.  The lo mein was the same way and my wife couldn't eat it.  We had to send it back.  Later that night my wife was in pain from the food.  The price was reasonable for good food but this was anything but.  If I could give less than one star I would.
