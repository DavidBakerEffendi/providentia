This is by far in the way the worst barbecue in Scottsdale, asked for a wet piece of brisket sandwich and got nothing at all but fat unfortunately it was grotesquely undercut which made it chewy and no flavor. I am from Texas and I know barbecue and this is the worst. Do yourself a favor and drive up the streets of Scottsdale to Bryan's. The sad fact is I have had good barbecue here unfortunately inconsistency is the deathknell of most barbecue places. Fortunately for them there is very little competition that is not 20 minutes away.
