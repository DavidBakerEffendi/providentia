This restaurant was suggested by friends  (from Detroit!). The drinks and service were good but the food was very disappointing. The chips were commercial, the "crispy" taco shell was grainy like it was from the local grocery store and the fillings were copious but bland. Additionally, the refried beans were pasty Rosarita's out of a can! Arghh! The enchilada used a double tortilla which made it quite doughy and the menu was limited and we couldn't substitute anything so we ended up ordering two dishes and splitting. All in all, if you're looking for western style or Tex-Mex, I think you'll be disappointed.
