Service is good, food not to much
Fajitas are tasteless, carne asada has no taste no salt or pepper the flour tortillas were hard as a rock so we ordered corn tortillas and they were even worst and my kid ordered chicken fingers with fries and the fries look at least a day old and tasted like burnt old oil, will definitely never come back here
