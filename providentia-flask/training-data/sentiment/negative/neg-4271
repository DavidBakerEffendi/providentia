First impression was great. Loved the peanuts at the door and on the table.  Hot rolls as soon as we sat down, great.

Now the not so great.  Waited too long for water on a hot as heck day. Blooming onion burnt. Steak tasted like someone dumped a bucket of salt on it and it was over cooked.  Green beans mushy, watery and lacked flavor, even from the hard bits of what looked like bacon.  Ribs were only so-so.  Waitress forgot to being ketchup for my dad's fries.  Salads were just ok.  

Based on this experience I won't be back again.
