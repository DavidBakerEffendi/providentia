First time to Bar Kada, can't say I will be back any time soon.  First impression is that the decorations are very cheesy and out dated.   I like the large wood tables branches, seems like it would be cool to come as a big group.  The over all first impression is not greatest, old/out dated and look used or dirty.  The fish tank is the  cleanest item in the place!   The regular dinner music is really loud you have to shout to the person sitting right next too, it's really stupid!

So we came here for the "Star Quest" Contest and we paid for the $25.00 Buffet and without a doubt the worst buffet in the history of all the buffets in the world of all time.  The beef had really good flavor, but was chewy, I almost lost my back teeth chewing it!  They had a chicken & Veggies with quail eggs and the ran through the pan and forgot to stop, there no meet, a sad dish food!  The Pork pan had the most flavor, it had chunks of potatoes and carrots and was good, to bad after ten people it was all gone!  The chicken screw was made of chicken thighs and the meat was not trimmed of the fat.  The pork belly was way over cook and had  no flavor.  Five items and the food was gone in seven to ten minutes. Over all dinning experience "don't eat the food!"

The staff didn't check on us for drinks or any thing.  Lousy experience, way too many options in Las Vegas to waste time at a place that is out dated, that has poor food and really creepy service!  Las Vegas has over 4000 places to get a dinner and a cocktail, I would try them all out before I retuned to bar Kada!
