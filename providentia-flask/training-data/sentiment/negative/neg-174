What the heck?! I had my friend order my chipotle I ordered the chicken salad I wanted my salad in the bowl and I also ordered guacamole on it. I get my bowl and my lettuce is in a small cup on the side??? And first THERES NOT ENOUGH LETTUCE. And second the guacamole is freaking brown CLEARLY I know the avocado is bad and they gave me bad guacamole. Not only that but the lettuce looks like it's 2 days old!!! at this point I'm freaking pissed so I threw the whole bowl away. What a freaking waste I'm so upset I'm never coming back to this chipotle ever again like what the hell man their food is NOT always fresh. Oh and they never gave me dressing when I ordered a chicken salad either.
