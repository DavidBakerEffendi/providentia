I've never had high hopes for Sonic, but I thought perhaps they would have improved over the years. All I learned today is that ordering a meal with onion rings at Sonic will yield you precisely one onion ring, and it will disappoint you. I am now also privy to the fact that if you upgrade your drink as part of a meal combo, it will not be a dollar or two up-charge. It will be the full price of the item, minus a four cent credit. Tater tots were stale, chicken fingers were microscopic, and my hopes are genuinely dashed. I know it's Sonic, but c'mon. There are faster food options out there that I would gladly vouch for. Unfortunately, this restaurant (term used very loosely) is not one of them, and will do nothing but disappoint.
