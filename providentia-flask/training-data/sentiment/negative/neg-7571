I was told it would be 15-30 minutes 

I'm just getting a spot an hour and 20 minutes later

Set proper expectation I was told I could start on the first floor immediately I choose to take the 2nd floor because it was a small wait well if I didn't get bamboozled I would have just gone downstairs immediately 

Thanks for ruining my evening
