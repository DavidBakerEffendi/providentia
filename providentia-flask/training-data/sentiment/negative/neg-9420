Decided to do an early Valentines dinner with my wife to avoid the crowd. We pass Landry almost every day for the last 10 years we've lived here in Vegas so decided to give it a try. Between breakfast and dinner we eat out at least 5 times a week.
What a TOTAL disappointing adventure.
We started with happy hour drinks which were ok but then it jus went downhill quickly.
We ordered two appetizers, zucchini and calamari.
Zucchini was ok but calamari sucked and this was a seafood restaurant!!
Next we shared a seafood platter which came with a so so bread and so so salad.
On the platter was a seafood stuffed crab shell which was almost all breading, shrimp in a bad sauce, some kind of fish on the bottom of the plate and a portion of VERY bland white rice. 
My drink was never refilled and waitress sort of disappeared.
Manager came by to ask how everything was and we told her as she could see by leftover food on our plates.
She did take six dollars off of a $49 bill.
After watching the success of Tillman Fertittas
Show, billionaire buyer, we were very unhappy and will not be going back which is a shame because we like to support local businesses.
When we got home I saw I had left my wallet at restaurant. Busboy found it and gave it to manager who said it was in safe waiting for me to pick it up. Must say when I got back to restaurant all seemed to be in order. I of coursed asked for person who turned it in and tipped him. I applaud their honesty
