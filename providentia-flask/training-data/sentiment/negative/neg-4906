4-15-18 11pm went to this Taco Bell after a long ass day at work.  This Taco Bell is down the street from the house, so we go here ALL THE TIME. well I guess the guys working tonight really just don't care. Ordered my food and ordered and payed for double meat. Well I get home and my food doesn't even have regular meat. I take my food back up there and the MANAGER RYAN, was extremely rude and unprofessional. It was only after waiting for 15mins, I get my refund and he decided he wanted to apologize.
