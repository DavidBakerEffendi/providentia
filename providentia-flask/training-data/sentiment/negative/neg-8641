The bartenders at Wahoos are awesome. However the management stinks. They have gone through several managers and have made a lot of changes. They took out golden tee and added slot machines. They said they want the bar to be more gaming so basically screw the locals who drink a shit load and just want a place to hang out. They are also taking out the caseda seating on the patio. I guess it's time to go to another bar. Too bad because this was a great local place to unwind and enjoy some nice company.
