I live in Southern Highlands and I love taco bell but lately I have been getting food that is cold. I always go through the drive thru and a couple weeks ago I ordered a taco salad with ice all on the bottom I took it back and they did give me a new one but yesterday I ordered the big box and the tacos were Cold I called no answer couldn't drive back I had to go to work, so I drove back today told the manager and all she said was thank u for telling me and gave me a 99 cent free taco coupon. Never even replaced it I'm getting sick of the cold food and not replacing it so I'm not going to go as much any more because the service is terrible. They don't care because they have already got there money. Bad service at this TACO BELL
