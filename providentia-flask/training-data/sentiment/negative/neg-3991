Unfortunately, my experience with this restaurant was very disappointing.  I'm sure their food is tasty but my party and I never even had the opportunity to try it.  I had booked an evening reservation for a group of nine and after arriving (on time and all together) we were escorted to a back table.  Then, a minute later we were asked to wait outside as that table was actually reserved for a larger party who was running behind.  Although a little confused, we all obliged and waited outside of the restaurant.  30 minutes later, still no table.  The staff weren't exceptionally helpful and after asking to speak with the manager (who didn't seem to care much about the situation) we decided to leave.  It was a shame because we were really looking forward to dining there.  I understand that restaurants are often extremely busy for the dinner rush but if you're already overbooked, don't agree to take on another group reservation.  I imagine the service is better during off-peak hours but after our experience, I won't be going back to try it out.
