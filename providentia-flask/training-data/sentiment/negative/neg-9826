I was very excited it try this burger joint and was very disappointed. I ordered a hamburger and they made a cheeseburger. I sent it back and told the guy i didnt want cheese. So he made it again and guess what, it had cheese AGAIN! By the time I actually got my burger without cheese, I was full from eating fries and my husband's burger was cold because he was waiting for me. They didn't even offer to comp us for  anything.  I also thought it was dirty. The floors needed to be sweeped and the trash needed to be emptied. With so many other choices out there, I won't go back.
