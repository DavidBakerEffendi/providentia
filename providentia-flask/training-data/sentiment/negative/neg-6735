Fraudulent. Yup, there's no other way to say it. Waiter: "Can I have that topped with bearnaise sauce for you." Us: "Sure." The bill: "Additional $15+ tax". Waiter: "The special today is a bison steak". Me: "Rare please." The bill "$68+ tax". (Ended up being more expensive than ANYTHING else on the menu!).
Sorry guys but if you're to do the used car salesman bait and switch, then have the common decency to mention the upcharge. Disgusting behaviour. Lost a customer for life.
