Wow. What a disappointment. Sat at the roof part of the restaurant and was not pleased with anything other than the breeze and the view. We ordered a beer and a cocktail with a waitress that did not crack a smile ONCE! We ordered guacamole and chips, maybe the worst ever. The guacamole tasted like it was out of a jar from the supermarket. Could they not have made guacamole out of real avocados? Based on the app, we decided there were better places to go. Sorry Gaspar, no go.
