This place is under new owners so it is not the same restaurant everyone has been praising in previous posts. The restaurant is actually called New Old village bistro because it has new owners now.

The food is mediocre at best. My omelette was pretty tasteless and the fries were super greasy and way over salted. The prices have also gone up because the website for this place is actually the old restaurant's webpage with their old prices from before which seemed like a much better deal. Also the online ordering doesn't work even though it says your order was placed online. The new owners didn't even have a clue there was an online ordering system. 

The service was also super slow. Took 30 minutes for my takeout order which is ridiculous for an omelette.

Overall I would suggest going elsewhere for your breakfast fare or stick to cora's which is much nicer, healthier and has AC.
