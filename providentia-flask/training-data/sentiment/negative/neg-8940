Never placing an order to go or eating at this location again.  Ordered a $20ish salad to go with avocado that was subpar on presentation.  The avocado was not fresh and had a black slimy substance all over it.  When I called back about the order and mentioned the lack of quality, Erika said that they have several people check for quality before sending out.  Erika didn't ask how they could make it right, but instead defended the lack of quality in the food and presentation.  Very disappointed with this salad.   Sincerely, Sad Salad Girl
