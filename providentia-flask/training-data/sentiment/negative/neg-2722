Went to Aladdins on a Sunday night with the wife for dinner and we're were one of the two tables their. We waited 25 minutes for our food all the while not having silverware and a gnat floating in my tea. My finally got her food with burnt chicken and complained to see if she could get a new one or it to be corrected.  They did NOTHING and still had the nerve to bill us. The manager did not once say anything to us other than snicker behind the counter after I refused to pay for her burnt food that was not eaten.  We will never be coming to this Aladdins in Fairlawn again!!
