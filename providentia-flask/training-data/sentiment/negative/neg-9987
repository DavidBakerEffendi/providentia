So I'm a bit of a foodie and I have what could be called an extreme sweet tooth. I especially have a propensity for anything with frosting or that's fresh baked goods. I had heard that Carl's Cakes were fantastic with people getting them for their wedding and other family events so when I saw one at the local grocery store called grasshopper torte, I splurged and bought it.
   The description on the cake says "chocolate cake filled with chocolate and mint buttercream, iced in mint buttercream". You see, I have a real weak spot for buttercream, real buttercream.
   After dinner the family is pretty excited because we have cake for dessert so I took the lid off, sliced it and took my first bite. It was totally disgusting. At this point, I peeled back the store label to reveal the ingredients.
   The ingredients read as follows: flour, sugar, eggs, milk, margarine, shortening partially hydrogenated soybean oil, partially hydrogenated palm oil with mono and diglycerides added baking powder, baking soda, cornstarch, salt, cocoa. The mint filling contains: alcohol, water and oil peppermint. Fudge filling contains liquid sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, corn syrup, cocoa, water.
   This ingredient label should just read crap, crap, and more crap with a side of hydrogenated crap and filled with trans fatty crap. This so-called super duper cake has no butter cream has no butter and barely has anything that's natural whatsoever. 
   So Carl, just a word of advice. My dead grandmother could make a cake better than this one that didn't send me to a cardiologist and actually tasted like something other than plastic.
