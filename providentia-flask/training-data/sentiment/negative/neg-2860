At the table and I haven't even left yet. I've been coming here for years and decided to take a new friend to my favorite spot. She ordered the Manicotti and had one bite and didn't like it. We asked the waitress if we could trade it out for something else. The gentleman who I guess is a manager here said he "can't replace the food simply because you don't like it, cause other customers like it so there is nothing I can do if you dont" I always come here, the staff is wonderful and I never have any problems. And whenever we didn't like something they always replaced it. No problem, excellent service. I am so embarrassed that I talked her into going here tonight and will not be taking anymore friends here in the future.
