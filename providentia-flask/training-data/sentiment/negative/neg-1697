Mediterranean like food is served here.

My big problem with the place was the big creepy (hat, tats, t shirt) guy standing by the bar staring across the restaurant through our whole meal.

As it turned out the creeper happened to be the owner.  Dialing down the creeper factor when you're at work (even if you own the place) is probably a good idea.
