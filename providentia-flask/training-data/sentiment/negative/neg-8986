So I guess they removed my last review.  Not sure why.  In my last review, I stated that we arrived just after 2:20 on a Sunday afternoon.  The front desk girl told us they were not seating any body else because they close at 2:30.  If you're going post everywhere your open until 2:30 then continue to seat people until 2:30.  My impression is that they lack service.  We went to another place nearby just north of there that remained open until 3.  Unlike US Egg, they were very nice and seemed happy when we walked through the door.

If you're going to not seat people until 2:30, then you should post it on your website.  Hopefully this doesn't get taken down as well.

I felt strongly enough about this that I took the time to write a second review.  Much better options around the area.
