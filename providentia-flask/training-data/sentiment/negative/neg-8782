Do not be tricked by the traditional interior and decorations and waitresses in yukatas. 

The food was NOT even authentic Japanese cuisine.
Overpriced. The only good value was the appetizers but only because the quantity over quality scale. My boyfriend even mentioned that the sake tasted funny. 

I was totally upset on how poor the garnishing was too for every dish. 

The only thing I was impressed with was the hot towel that they provide for you in the beginning for you to wash your hands with. 

There are better quality Japanese cuisine that's cheaper and has more value. 

Very disappointed and won't recommend this to anyone.
