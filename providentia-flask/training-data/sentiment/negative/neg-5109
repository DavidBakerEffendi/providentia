Came here for the first time today.  Don't know what sets them apart.  I placed an order to go, food came out in just a couple of minutes, drove home only to find that it was the wrong order.  Came back to get the right order.  They had my bag sitting at the counter for me.  I asked if they still wanted the bag I took home back, they said that they would break it down and use it.   (I hope someone behind the counter thought better of this). Got my bag back home, order was still wrong, missing half the sides.  Wasn't going to go back again for them. 
At this point, food wasn't hot anymore.  Family was hungry.   Food was over cooked,  very salty.  Over priced for what you get.
Too bad, I was really expecting this place the be great.
