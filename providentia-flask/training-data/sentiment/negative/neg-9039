1/31/2010 my family and I visited Beso hoping for great dinner experience. The place was loud we could not hear each other speak the tables were crowded the waiters kept bumping into our chair though out the dinner.  We started off with the Guacamole appetizer  let me tell you this was disgusting there was a hair in my Guac I told the manager and he didn't charge me for it, how generous of him. I had the Paella, the mini lobster tail that was in the Paella was tough the Spanish sausage was hard was not impressed for the price. Overall I was disappointed with this restaurant definitely do not recommend. Oh the service was good the waiters are attentive so nothing negative to say about the service but the food was not worth the price.
