One weekend, my husband and I decided to visit our family in Vegas. Our family wanted to get together to have a great memorable breakfast and my sister in law picked this place. This place had a great reputation with my father in law, so we decided to give it a shot. When we came here for family breakfast, the experience was less than satisfying and an epic fail ! 

First, the server dropped a steak knife on my husband then she dropped toast on him.  This woman did not even say sorry for her actions. The bottom line here is she could have badly injured my husband with dropping the steak knife tip down. I feel that the waitresses here crumble under pressure ! They are in a hurry and don't take there time serving. What kind of a server doesn't know if the steak is well done or rare?! The wait staff exercised poor skills in serving and customer service. It is apparent that management has neglected to training there employees.

 Second, it is unacceptable to make someone wait 25 minutes for a meal without checking on it.  Everyone was half way into there meals and I hadn't even gotten my food at all! The waitress that took my order didn't even relay my meal to the kitchen and that's why i waited to the longest for my food. She didn't realize it until after the manager went to the kitchen to check on my order. 

Lastly, when my sister in law spoke to the manager on duty about why the service was below par and why I had not gotten my food yet.  His answers were less than acceptable. He had the nerve to say there's a lot of orders and so much pressure on the staff. What kind of lame excuse is that? Too many orders is not an excuse to not serve customers in timely manner and with quality service! If you cant take the heat get out of the restaurant business! 

Dont ever go to this place if you want a good quality meal with your family, especially if you have a big family!
