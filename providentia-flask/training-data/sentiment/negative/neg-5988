Big piece of plastic bag in the food? What is wrong with vegetarian/vegan places in Phoenix? I really start to think anything marked vegan here will get high ratings just because they look trendy/fancy. This place has super slow service. Waited 10 minutes for the two staff try to open a wine for a customer, just so to make an order. Jackfruit was obvious leftovers. The staff tried to reheat from whatever left and sitting in a pan for who knows how long, and they were still cold when I got them. Dried bread and tiny little fillings. And I found a big piece of plastic bag in the sandwich!!!! See the pictures. And it's $10!!! Disgusting place! Only second time here and I swear I will never ever return to this place again. I really lose my trust in vegetarian/vegan place in Phoenix. Like this place, so overrated and they are just not even decent. Please be warned.
