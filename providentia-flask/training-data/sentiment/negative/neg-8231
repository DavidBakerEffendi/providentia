I wanted a dessert on the go and something really cold to drink so I ordered the Caramel Espresso. What I got was an Iced Cafe Latte and it took forever to make it... as he took three other orders and had conversations with three other employee during this whole process. What I got was a cup of iced milk. There is nothing Coffee or Espresso about this drink and clearly the person that took my order had no desire to make what I actually ordered. My friend ordered the Iced Cafe Latte... and also got a cold glass of milk on ice. Thanks for making my lunch and shopping experience at the Biltmore Blah! Word of advice for your employees: customer service is what brings business back in even if it's just a cold beverage on a hot day!
