The worst food ever!!! White or brown rice? Are you kidding me? Has anyone ever had real Mexican food? Walk into don tortaco and ask for white rice and they will say.. Estas loca? A freakin joke. Worst food selection. The brown bag my food came in tastes better than my chicken taco. Seriously chipotle is a joke. If you want to eat healthy, don't eat out or go to whole foods.
