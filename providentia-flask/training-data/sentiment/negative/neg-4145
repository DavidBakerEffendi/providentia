Sat in the store 1/17 5:50am for 20m while the lady who was the hostess and server for the morning shift. All the lady did was chit chat the whole time and didn't bother to serve anyone, she didn't even serve drinks or even take my order. I'm sorry but it's super unprofessional. Never in my life I've had to wait that long to be served at a dennys that had little or minimal customers...
