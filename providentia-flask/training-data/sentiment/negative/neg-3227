Terrible service.  Employees should be helping each other instead of hanging out outside.  They didn't have a full stock of toppings or bread let alone any soups why be open 24hrs. If your not prepared to deliver.  They should hire people who actually care about their job what ever it may be. Definitely not satisfied or coming back.
