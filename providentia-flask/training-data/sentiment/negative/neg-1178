Terrible. It's my youngest sons birthday and all he asked for for dinner was sushi. AYCE sushi. I searched Yelp and saw Teharu. 10 minutes away? Sweet! After a 45 minute wait (not too bad for a Friday night), we were seated in the far back corner by the bar to accommodate my daughters wheelchair. Cool. Then the fun started.

There was food all over my seat, and the floor- omg. Rolls, napkins, rice, edamame, and something sticky that refused to come off the bottom off my shoe. I pointed it all out to the waitress and she shrugged. Okay, alright, ya'll are busy, I'll deal. I should have left. I grab some edamame for the youngest, and we order drinks. My oldest grabs two plates and I grab one. I take a bite...YUCK. Stale rice, warm crab salad and not fresh. I get the jalepeno poppers- tasty. Okay yay. I snag another roll, getting into the "flow". A Las Vegas roll. Deep fried roll. Hot and crunchy, yeah? Nope. It's cold. Cold and soggy, and the avocado is BLACK. Not brown, but black. 

I look over at my oldest and realize he's had 3 plates. My garbage disposal looks at me and says, "Mom, I tried because I didn't want to waste our money not eating, but if I take one more bite I'm gonna throw up." Poor kid didn't realize you don't pay a flat AYCE fee, but by the plate. I flagged the waitress down. After I showed her the black avocado on the cold deep fried roll, she removed it from the bill. I paid the $25 for 8 barely touched plates and got the hell out of there. We're all still hungry at this point and decided to head to our go- to dinner spot for birthdays- The Cheesecake Factory- where we were served by friendly servers and my boy got his Happy Birthday song. We will not be back.
