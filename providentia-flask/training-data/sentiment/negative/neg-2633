Worse establishment ever. Place went to shit. Cover charges is more than any of the clubs in Vegas. The security are pricks. They lost my ID and didn't take accountability for it. The bartenders take forever to get to you so good luck getting a drink. Honestly I will never go back to this place. Sad seeing a place you went to a lot during you early 20s go so far down hill.
