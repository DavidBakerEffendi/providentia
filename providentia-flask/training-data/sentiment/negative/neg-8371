What an absolute joke this restaurant was. I understand that tapas are supposed to be the equivalent of a small appetizer, but to get literally 2 or 3 bites of food in each plate made the group feel awkward as we're not used to seeing food delivered with such a feel of poverty. I would imagine that if Canada was ever stricken with war or famine or some sort of severe economic inflation, we would have to pay $15-30 for each 3 bites of food like we did at Toro Toro. 

Now on to the food itself: they take pieces of McCain potatoes, broil in the oven, cover them with a creamy garlic sauce, and give it a fancy Spanish name - if that impresses you, great...I wasn't so impressed. 

The octopus plate was ok, but there was barely enough in the plate to actually enjoy it - more of a teaser. 

By far, the biggest disappointment was the paella. The rice was doughy and clumpy, and each plate of "seafood paella" comes with 2 small pieces of shrimp. Again, it had the feel of cheapness and poverty. 

3 of the tapas in their menu were not even available - but in retrospect, that was probably a good thing as it avoided what I'm sure would have been 3 more disappointments. 

Even their bread is served in tiny, heartbreaking portions. They only had 2 choices of desert. Any place that doesn't several churros shouldn't be allowed to call itself a Spanish tapas restaurant!!

We ended up tripling our original order of tapas and still all left hungry. 

Aside from that, the music was annoyingly loud and their table layout was unpleasant - they use picnic style tables meant for 8 or 10 people each, so you might get seated elbow-to-elbow with strangers. 

Needless to say, our whole group unanimously agreed that this was a terrible experience, and we won't be going back.
