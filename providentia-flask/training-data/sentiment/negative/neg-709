Never in my life have I experienced what I did tonight. Our family had a bad night and dinner was ruined. So we decided to load up the car and go to Denny's. We arrived to an empty restaurant and was greeted by one of the worst human beings ever. I won't even call her a waitress because she was far from that. She refused to serve my family because there was 11 of us. It's 9:30-10:00pm your restaurant advertises be "open all night" but you can't seat us? She goes on to tell us how she can't open up the back area/room for us because there is only one server. I stood there wondering if I was dreaming. She actually turned down tip, and revenue for your company because she didn't want to move some tables around to accommodate us..thus the reason why the place was empty. She has probably turned away so many people they quit coming in. She was rude, had no teeth, and no customer service skills. The whole experience left a nasty taste in my mouth. You should definitely put some more thought into who you hire because this woman is doing your company no justice. I'm almost certain her name was "Joy". It's sad that I have personally witnessed Denny's catering wild teens and drunks when the bars close on Friday's and Saturday's but turned down a mother, her 4 kids and grand baby, along with my sister and her three kids. I ended up spending $60.00 at Steak N Shake for my group and left $15.00 tip. You can thank your non-customer service oriented waitress for missing out tonight. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief!
