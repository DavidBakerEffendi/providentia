I love Chinese food. My go to meal is Beef with Broccoli. I ordered this for pickup recently and it was hands down the WORST I have ever had. The meat was chewy. The broccoli looked horrible! There was so much sauce that it was like a soup! Also, the sauce tasted like a bad watered down gravy and not like anything that I have ever had before. This restaurant is close to my home, so my experience with my meal and having to leave this review is unfortunate. I will not eat there again!
