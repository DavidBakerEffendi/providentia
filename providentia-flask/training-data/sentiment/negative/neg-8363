Horrible. I ordered the nachos to go and sat at the bar to wait. I threw a $20 in the video blackjack machine to waste a little time. I ordered a lemonade for while I waited. The lemonade was really weird. It was mixed with like soda water or something,l... It was oddly carbonated and tasted bad. I took like 3 sips and meh. When I got my food, they not only charged me for the lemonade... Odd enough for someone playing the video machine, but they also charged some bullshit to go fee as well. So I spent like $8 on 3 sips of lemonade and a to go fee. I could see if I was ordering some dine in only special or something of that nature, but I was just getting standard nachos and felt like watching TV and eating in my room. To top things off the nachos weren't even all that good. Avoid this place like the plague
