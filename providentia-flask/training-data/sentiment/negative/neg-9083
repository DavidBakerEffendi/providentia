UGH! I usually enjoy Panda love the honey shrimp.  Usually I'm good because that item is cooked fresh UNTIL....

When I got to my hotel room the shrimp was okay but I ordered steamed rice. And the rice were actually hard stale rice balls. So I end up not eating any of it because if I thought one item was sitting then what does it says for everything else.

I was left out of food not to mention  expensive airport food.
