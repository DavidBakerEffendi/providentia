I feel sick. Waited 45 minutes for our food to come. I think the only reason we got it was because as the waitress walked by I said "I'm so hungry" than magically our food appeared. The food was cold... I order a veggie omelette with toast and hashbrowns. My girlfriend ordered the cornbread pancakes and chicken. 

I took a bite of my cold 45 minute cook time omelette  and there was goat cheese in it. I dispise goat cheese. I felt like I was going to throw up. On the menu it says the omelette comes with cheddar cheese not goat cheese. I informed my waitress and she magically brought  me another cold omelette and cold has browns in about 4 minutes.... 

So initially I waited 45 minutes now 4 for a replacement omlette. By now I lost my appetite, I feel gross. Don't go here.
