I bought lunch for my team mates and called for pick up order. They tell me 15 mins wait but ended more like a 40 min wait. As we sat down in the Conference room to eat one of the orders were missing bananas (banana cream pancake) I mean it is the main ingredient. So I called to inform them and they asked if I was returning back to pick up the bananas so then I asked if they were going to double it. The lady says she has to ask her Manager then I told her "ya you do that since I have to return for my bananas." They also forgot tartar sauce for fish fry, ranch, ketchup and utensils..wth? We were already hangry from the start and then we go through this hassle. Although the Manager did ask me if it was enough bananas when I came back for it.
