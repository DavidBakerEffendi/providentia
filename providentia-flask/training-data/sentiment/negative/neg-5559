Okay so This place sucks so bad!!! DO NOT EAT THE WINGS! I REPEAT DO NOT EAT THE WINGS!!! This place has not cleaned the oil in a very very long time. And you can taste it. My order took almost a full hour and I I've a mile while! I was not able to get my money back but I got store credit for a place I would never want to eat again. Overall fuck this place. Don't waste your time or your money on this place.
