I have been here many times and I have had two negative visits that will keep me from ever wanting to return. The first one happened to my friend; they took her license and made her pay for ANOTHER persons tab and refused to give her her license back until she paid for it. That should have been enough to keep me out of here but this was the real clincher. 

On a Monday night I went out with a few friends to celebrate graduation and to hang out. In order to enter the bar they took a photo of me and scanned my license. I then went to the bar and ordered a drink and handed the bartender my credit card and told him to keep my tab open. At the end of the night I approached the bar to close out my tab and the bartender told me that he has given my card to Someone else and that he was sorry and I should just call and cancel my card. He also covered my tab but I don't feel that this fully makes up for what happened. This person he gave my card to then went and made purchases using my card causing me further headache. Normally I would agree that the bartender made a mistake. However, the fact that I had to have my photo taken when I had my ID Checked to enter the bar upsets me since the bartenders did not make any effort to make sure that the credit cards they were returning to people actually belonged to that person. They have such a focus on security for their front door but take minimal precautions to make sure that the correct person is signing for their credit card. 

If this happened to me on a Monday night then I wonder what may have happened on a busy Saturday when at least a hundred tabs are open at once.
