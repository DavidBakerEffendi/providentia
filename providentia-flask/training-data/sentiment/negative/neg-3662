This was my fist and last time going. What was wrong with this place.... way too much! First of all its $11.00 for 6 rolled tacos. You can get 5 for $5.00 at so many other better places and this didnt even include cheese. Thats an extra 1.50. So it $12.50 for 6 rolled tacos. When i talked to the manager about it, everyone spoke Spanish in front of me to delegate the situation. Granted I know Spanish and am Latina myself, this is America! Speak English!!!! Not only is this rude to customers who cant speak spanish but its horrible business practices. After refusing me a refund even though no one told me the stupid rolled tacos didnt come with cheese (who does that! Rolled tacos always come with cheese and guac!) she asked the cheese to be put on the tacos and walked away. Other things wrong with my service:

 - Tacos were overpriced. $2.50 for a mini taco. You pay that price for a full sized taco at other locations
- Cheese quesadilla overpriced. $4.50 for a plain quesadilla that can buy you a beefed up quesadilla elsewhere. 
- There was half of a broken toothpick in my rolled tacos.
- The meat in the rolled tacos was fried to exessively making the it hard and jerky like. 

 I did go into this place expecting something great considering it seems so popular but im not wasting another penny on this dump and neither should you. There are way better mexican restaurants that offer better service and better tasting food at a lower cost.
