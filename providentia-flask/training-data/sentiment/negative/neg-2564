We stayed there this weekend and upgraded to a suite that costed over $2000.00 for the stay. There were bugs in the room, it took 3 calls for in room dining to clean up. We had an issue with management Shari and Manuel the front desk managers. Very RUDE!! We will never stay there again. By far the Bellagio and Caesars are 100% better than this Venetian.
