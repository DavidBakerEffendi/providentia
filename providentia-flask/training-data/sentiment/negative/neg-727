super upset. walked in and the food preparer greeted me and then turned around to continue to make a joke with her coworker while I was standing right in front of her. I'm all for having fun at work but customer service should come first with any business. I ordered a steak bowl and it was just cold and sad, like the food was just sitting out all day. the cashier was nice so kudos to her. where is the management for this location, you've got some serious work to do!
