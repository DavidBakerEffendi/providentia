I've yet to encounter worse service in one of Calgary's fine dining establishments.  Teatro runs a close second, but The Rush?  Truly terrible.  Nice looking young lady, but rude, inefficient and seemingly without a clue that she didn't know her job.  Being cute just isn't enough, in my opinion.  

The menu?  Good gawd.  You'd think in a city where healthy individuals abound, this high end restaurant (as most others in town do) would offer healthier options.  Everything on the menu was horrendously high in fat with nary a vegetable to be found; a definitie sign of a lazy chef.

The prices?  Horrendous.  The only reason  I could fathom?  The lovely decor.  

I won't be back and - as you see - am not the least bit shy about telling everyone.
