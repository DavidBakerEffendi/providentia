My bf and I came here last night for dinner. We decided to come here and after our experience, I wished we didn't! Our waitress was super nice and did a FANTASTIC job but we cannot say the same thing about the food. My bf ordered chicken & ribs--the chicken was NOT cooked through. How can a chef mess up cooking a chicken breast?? The center was so pink! Apparently it happened twice that day. They happily fixed it for us and apologized...but I was expecting more. The manager could have came out and explained why this happened (new chef possibly, etc), they could have taken something off of our bill, given us free dessert, given us an extra side ...something! This place was not worth the money we spent here! I am very disappointed. I have been to outback plenty of times but I will not be coming back anymore.
