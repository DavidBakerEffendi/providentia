Ok, first time I was here was for lunch. I had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers I had ever had. Noticed the pool, darts, pinball, golden tee, and ancient bowling game and thought I would take my friends back there and share this incredible place. 

two days later, for dinner and drinks, 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a Friday night. She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc. I'm pretty nieve, and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time. So there we have it, a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulations.

I'll be getting my hepititis c test next week. (joking.... kinda)
