I will never ever go back. The very worst service we've ever had in Phoenix. Beyond slow. Totally disorganized and ultimately owner fairly rude. Food was up and down. Hanger steak and fries good, chicken good ( both maybe 3 star) but beef bourguignon was way way over cooked. There is simply nothing to recommend this place.
