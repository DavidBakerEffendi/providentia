We came here because my grandma had a taste for lobster and all of the other restaurants in Cesar's had a wait and they had a sign right outside that said 1 lb Maine lobster for $48.  She had the 1 lb lobster and I had the 8 oz filet and lobster tail.  We also had a crab cake for appetizer.  The crab cake was pretty small for $16 and the meat was just ok - my grandma said it tasted like the one she gets from the pouch from the store.  We agreed the best part was the crust on the top.  Not worth $16.  The lobsters were all overcooked and I don't think they were 8 oz.  My filet was undercooked - it was more rare than medium rare and the flavor was just ok.  For $130 we got very mediocre food.  The service was good though and the staff was pretty friendly.  I forgot my purse here and went right back to get it like 5 minutes later but it was already in the back and it took them like 10 minutes to get it out - that was strange.

I would try this place for happy hour but never for anything else.
