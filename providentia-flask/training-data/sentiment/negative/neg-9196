Worst customer service ! Sign said that it s opened at 11am. There are customers waiting in front of restaurant at 10:55am ! I can see there are at least 3,4 workers inside walking around but none of them will open the door or acknowledge the customers ! At 11:02 am , they still don't open so we knocked on the door ! They just sit inside and give us sign saying they don't open till 12:00 pm ! It s ridiculous and rude !
