Visiting this new restaurant, it's 11:30. Ordering poki bowl with lettuce. Portions are very small, had to ask for extra everything, if you say extra cucumber slices you will literally get maybe extra two or three slices! Lettuce is not even close to fresh, it's rotting but it was still added to my bowl. Shocking!
I showed it to the staff and they didn't even offer to replace it with fresh lettuce. We will not return here.
