Awful.

Ordered a couple of basic burgers and fries to take home...got home and ended up throwing away half my burger and my boyfriend threw his away.

Watched the meat being cooked, they put a lid on top of the burger patties and basically steamed them. The meat was absolutely awful tasting. Flavorless and bland. The bun they used did not improve the bad taste of the meat either.  The fries were chopped and thrown directly into the fryer which resulted in soggy starchy fries. Could not even eat more than 3 fries they were soggy and oil-filled like noodles. Literally oily noodles.
 (Fries 101: the less moisture in the fries before you fry them, the more crispy they will become hence you need to soak them in cold water and pat them dry)

Everyone was in total chaos in the kitchen for customers to see...kinda embarrassing for them. The guy working the grill looked homeless. I just sat and stared at the mayhem while i waited for my order.

We paid nearly $40 for two burgers and one fries to share. We will never eat here again it was simply poorly done. Yuck.

By the way the "italian gelato waffle burger parlor" theme really sucked. No branding or identity here. Very confusing and chaotic. Hire a branding team and fix your food guys.
