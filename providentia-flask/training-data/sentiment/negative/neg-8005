The food is edible and the service is inconceivable. The running joke with my friends has always been that you need to call a half hour in advance to order breakfast before tee time. Today I decided to eat lunch at this place and it took one hour and twenty minutes from sitting down to finally getting our pizza. It's obvious that this place is ran by people who have never managed a restaurant before.
