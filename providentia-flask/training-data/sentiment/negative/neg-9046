A group of us ate here about 3/4 weeks ago and while I cannot fault the food, which was delicious, I would NEVER set foot in this restaurant again because of the sheer rudeness we experienced from one of the waiters. Normally I would complain but we were that shocked that we all left bewildered. I spoke with anither colleague a week later and he said he and his wife experienced the same behaviour. There is no way that the management can be unaware of who I am refering to as they stood out like a sore thumb behaviour wise as I found all the other staff extremely pleasant. Sort it out as there is no shortage of excellent Indian restaurants in the area.
