I haven't been to a Cocos in a few years, and I remember why now. 
I took my daughter there on a Saturday, mid morning. It wasn't very busy but there were tons of people in the waiting area. After 15 minutes of waiting for a hostess, I put my own name down on the wait sheet and took a seat. As more guests came in, still no hostess. It took 25 minutes for someone to acknowledge that there were people wanting to dine in their restaurant. After the hostess finally came up, she informed us that in addition to us already waiting 25 minutes, it would be an additional 10 minute wait. After being seated, the server was great, the food not so much. You could go to IHOP and get better food and faster service. Needless to say I won't be going there again.
