Whiskey Blow does not deserve a Star!!  

We sat in the bar for over 30 mins and had to literally  flag down this steroid junkie bartender.  he did took our drink orders but another 15 mins went by  nothing.  not sure if he forgot or he was too busy thinking about his next testosterone cycle.  the other bartenders just look right pass us like we did not exist. The place was not even crowded.  Total waste of time!!!
