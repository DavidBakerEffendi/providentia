Extremely disappointed. Stopped for an early lunch. 1st: Had trouble finding the place as it's not on the street; but off the golf course parking lot. 2nd: When we walked in, there was a gentleman seated at the counter and the cook was talking to someone else. We sat at a table for several minutes without recognition. We left and found another place nearby that wanted our business.
