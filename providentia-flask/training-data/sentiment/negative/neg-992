Dude seriously read the f#@$?!& reviews! I know i should have!
My meal was 39 minutes late. Totaling 1 hour and 46 minutes to arrive. Also my vegetables were hard and undercooked. When I called to complain about my food the lady that originally took my order over the phone (Vee the owner) told me that she also "cooked my food AND delivered it." Girrrl stop lying!  My delivery driver was Hispanic! Shake damn my head. Vee the owner  was extremely rude and blamed that on her lack of English Language skills. Ok fine, as a Hispanic minority I can except that. However, she then said they were too busy and that she could fix it the next time for me. I insisted that she either fix my food TONIGHT or she give me a full refund immediately. I told her that if they were too busy to just give me a refund and she said, "Oh no, lady you don't listen, you just think out your mind, I fix for you." Thinking out of my mind? Ummmmm, well yes, my mind is where I think from? WTF.  She then asked "did you eat it all?" Of course I didn't eat hard vegetables you fool! She said she would fix it within 25 minutes (IT TOOK 40) and that she wants her hard vegetables back. Which is fine by me because I do not eat half @$$ cooked vegetables. The delivery driver was argumentative and claimed that she didn't want to argue but "my food was just fine, because she'd order it plenty of times." It is safe to to say that I will never order from Papaya Thai again. Also the fact that the owner stressed the importance of  receiving said hard veggies back makes me wonder if they redistribute them to other customers. Unacceptable service and food. FAIL!!!!
