Disappointed in this place. Our group had a great sense of humor so we were really excited to go. The food was pretty good, but the waiter (o****) forgot the appetizer and waters. Then he barely checked in and we had to wait forever for other foods requests and the check. The rest of the tables looked like they were having a great time though. The waiter made some jokes about the girls flat chest (not original or with a funny twist even) and no one even got a insult hat. Very boring night, felt like I was watching the opening act on last comic standing.
