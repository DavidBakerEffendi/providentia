I have been to Fishbone many times in previous years. This year I notice they raised the price which I can understand.  We went there on a Sunday afternoon at 5PM. We were told wait time was about 25 minutes. I noticed there were plenty of empty tables on the deck, I suppose the wait should be very shot. 
After 30 minutes passed, we were told to wait another 10 minutes when plenty of tables were empty. After 40 minutes, we were told again to wait 10 more minutes because they need to set up a table. 
Finally after 52 minutes wait we got our table.  

Total unnecessary wait when tables were empty, waiters were available.
