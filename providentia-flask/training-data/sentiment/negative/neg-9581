Food is not that good and the customer service is horrible. Services are very poor and the staff is rude and unprofessional. I would not recommend, to many other good places around for them to treat customers the way they do. If I was the owner I would fire the staff including the daughter that claims to be the manager and start training a new staff, hopefully you would get better results
