The jerk staff always mess up the order, I asked for spicy chicken and they load it with sweet and sour sauce...I ask for large fries they give me small. Worst most dumbest ppl on earth live in this area....double check ur order...take a bite infront of them to make sure they don't mess with the proper ingrediance....to hell with this BK location I hope they hire less retarded staff who follow direction and don't mess with orders for the fun of it.
