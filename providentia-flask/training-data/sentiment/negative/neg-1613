My mother and I eat here all the time, usually it's great, great food and great service until today.. My mother and I walked in, there was only one person ahead of us so we waited, when it was our turn we went up and said hello to the cashier who was actually the shift manager by the name of "Rosie," she barely looked up to greet us back, so I begin ordering, and I'm vegetarian so I usually just get a sandwich and switch out the meat for cheese, been doing it since I started eating farmer boys and it's never been an issue, at this location or any other, well today it was, as soon as I asked to substitute the meat for cheese, she immediately looked up from her screen with an awful look on her face and told me she was going to have to charge me for that, I said okay no problem that's just weird because I've never been charged for it but okayy. She then started to say well who isn't charging you for it, I need their names so I can talk to my boss about that, I then informed her the store manager actually cashed me out last time, and she rolled her eyes and continued to try and argue with me about it, I said ma'am I just want my food, charge me if you need too. When she finally got done putting the order in, I realized she didn't give me both the drinks for our order, my mom then asked if she could have her drink, to which Rosie replied with an obvious very bad attitude "the breakfast doesn't come with a drink!" My mom then walked over to the menu and pointed out where it specifically said "comes with small fountain drink." She then slammed the cup down on the counter and said "fine, fine I will just give it to you." All I can say is I won't be back to this location, and Rosie the manager definitely needs training in customer service, she obviously had a very bad attitude with us from the beginning and was very argumentative even after I told her I was not going to argue with her I just want to order food.
