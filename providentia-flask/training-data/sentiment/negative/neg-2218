The last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.  

This time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:

Bean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99
Bottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19

Since I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier "I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?"  She said "No" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, "Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  

I didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.

That does it for me, I will never eat here again.
