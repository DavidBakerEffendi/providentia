I will never come to this place ever again. I'm pretty sad and disappointed about it, as this is a nostalgic place for me to go since I've been coming here when I was little. I ordered my usual, teriyaki chicken rice bowl, and after nearly finishing half of it I felt like I was chewing on a piece of hard flexible scrap. When I spit out whatever it was in my mouth I had realized that it was a dirty black piece of fingernail. At first I thought it was a piece of bone or cartilage from the chicken, but after examining closely I realized what I had just been chewing on and I nearly vomited and vowed to never go back. If I could, I would have given zero stars. However, I guess the one star is that they refunded my money back and apologized.
