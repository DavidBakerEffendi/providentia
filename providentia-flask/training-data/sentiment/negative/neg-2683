This is the SLOWEST BK I have EVER been to! I take my breaks there once in a while but the wait is sooo long I always have to eat on the run! I ordered the new "Turkey Burger" and it was HORRIBLE!! Both my boyfriend and myself ordered them and BOTH of us about got sick with the smell! After taking one discusting bite (to give it a chance) we immediately told the manager it was awful. He told us they had not tried it....but never offered to exchange it! We needed to eat so we each got a chicken sandwich but we had to PAY FOR IT! I believe it should have been offered to us atleast with a discount! (we paid 3.99 for each turkey burger!). We left the turkey burgers on the counter and they threw them out, but we left discusted. I took the survey offered and told of our experience. I also wrote customer relations of BK but didn't even get a response.  I will never go back to this BK and warn all of you .... there are plenty of other BK's around the area where I am SURE they would offer you a cheeseburger if your food was unedible!!! The staff and managers are who make the "chain stores" so I will now visit the Elliott and Kyrene or Ray and Dobson store where you are treated like the "Queen" to BK's "King"!!! LOL! :)
