Don't ever go to a place where you see peoples reviews are at such polar opposites.  THIS PLACE SUCKS SOOOOOO BAD.  All the people who have given this place anything above one star were either drunk, high, or just never ate at a good Brazilian Steakhouse.  Please, please, please do them a favor and don't eat there and let them just go out of business.  With all the great food options we have in Las Vegas area, go somewhere else.  You will regret it forever.  Unless you like paying for crap because it maybe cheap with a groupon, don't do it.  Do not say you were not warned by the real consumers that posted here.
