really not that great...when there are like 100 other restaurants to eat at within a 2 block radius.  Try somewhere else!!!

And I think it made me sick for 2 days...I have an iron stomach but a couple hours after I ate this I was nauseous and had to throw up a couple times. WTF!  I can't place this causal link for SURE...but I'm definitely suspicious.  I really don't think it was the boba I had after.
