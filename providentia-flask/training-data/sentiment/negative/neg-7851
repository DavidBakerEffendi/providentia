Bought a Groupon Now for a Wash. Haircut and Style for 25 bucks. When I got to the salon they complained I bought the Groupon BEFORE getting there since they would have honored the 50% off and made more money since after Groupons cut they don't get the whole 50%. The front desk lady complained about this fact to EVERYONE she talked to. I got no wash and for a style I got a simple blow dry and no products. I would have been better off going to Fantastic Sams for the same service and less price even with the Groupon.
