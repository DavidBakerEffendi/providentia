I came. Was told "I'll be there in a minute" three times by the bartender. Then someone (not the bartender) came and took my order...a pop tart and potstickers. There aren't very many people here. The bartender then came back and asked again what we ordered. The food took forever. For two basic things when not busy. Almost walked out.

If you want a refill on water, don't come here.
