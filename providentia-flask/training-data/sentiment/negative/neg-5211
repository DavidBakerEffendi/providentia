I decided to order the Crispy Chicken. It wasn't. Batter was soggy an no flavour. They said a hint of Swiss Chalet Sauce. Really?
How come when we order a 1/4 chicken, the chicken looks like a baby, but the Crispy Chicken pieces look like a full grown chicken? Much bigger pieces. 
Something is not quite right here. 
I ordered the 3 piece of 'mixed' and got a drum, thigh and a wing (that was cut really oddly)

Never again.
