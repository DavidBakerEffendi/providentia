Don't even bother. The food is nothing special, neither good nor bad (although their happy hour offerings are very bad, as if they are trying to discourage you from ever ordering them again). What really sets this place apart is the service - it's atrocious. The staff obviously does not want to be there and it's apparent as they stand there and gossip amongst themselves for minutes at a time, while the half-dozen or so customers sit there waiting for something. Save yourself the trip and go anywhere else.
