Yikes!  This place is like if an old creepy vaudevillian uncle invited you to his house for dinner. It was cluttered and not clean. Our table was wedged in the corner and a spooky, green faced witch was three inches from someone's right shoulder!  The cold bread took forever to get to the table, the food was ok, not spectacular. The clams were shriveled, cold, and stuck to the shell. I had to pry mine loose and reconstitute it with the sauce to salvage the meal. A 20% gratuity was automatically added on the bill. I hope the little boy scout filling the water glasses gets a cut.
