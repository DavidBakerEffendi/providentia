This place is really awful. It is a complete tourist trap which in my book is defined by crappy food and expensive prices...check and check.

Beer: here' s a tip - don't order beer from the tap. It comes with a "souvenir" plastic 'glass' and therefore costs $10 for cheap stuff like Coors Light and $12 for better beer. And that's for the small one. You can instead buy a 24 oz tall-boy in a can of Miller Lite for $5. Also look around for beer specials, we could have bought 2 pitchers of PBR and had a 3rd free. The bartenders don't willingly inform you that their beer's a rip off. 

Food: another tip - don't eat it. It's just awful. We were a big group so I saw what all came out. Completely mediocre bordering on sketch. I got some awful thing with rice, a hamburger patty, eggs on top with gravy. The hamburger party and the gravy were nasty. The patty clearly comes to them shaped and frozen and when sliced into it looks like the most pathetic and low quality beef ever. Blarf. I tried to look up what this creation was called so you can be sure to steer clear but their website is so awful I got fed up and quit. Gross. Good luck.
