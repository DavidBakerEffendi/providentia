Sop up some overcooked hamburger meat with white bread instead.  Seriously the only truly awful Ethiopian restaurant I have ever tried.  I love this cuisine and enjoy it in most major cities across this country and a few overseas, I didn't know bad Ethiopian restaurants existed until I came here.  The food was greasy, overcooked and flavorless - and the prices were three times what I ever paid before, anywhere!  I wish I could give negative stars. I'm not kidding, words can't adequately describe how revolting this experience was.

I chose to introduce my father to Ethiopian food here after years of extolling its virtues and was painfully embarrassed.  No wonder the restaurant was empty - apperantly this is the norm? 

I am baffled by the good reviews. The only people that could like this slop are people that are unfamiliar with food!
