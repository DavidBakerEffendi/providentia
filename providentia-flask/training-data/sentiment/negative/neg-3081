This was the worst meal I have had in a while.  We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer and it came in a giant martini glass.  The bread was soggy and the tomatoes tasted old.  I had the chicken quesadilla and it was very dry.  The salsa and guacamole were less than fresh.  It was inedible.  My husband had the boneless wings and there was so much sauce, it looked like soup on the plate.  This place was terrible.  I will never go back. Yuck!!
