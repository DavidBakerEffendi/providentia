Review is solely for the food. If you want a good brew, then this place is ok but def don't order the food. I ordered the pretzel bites with beer cheese and it was horrible. The pretzel was obviously warmed up in the microwave and tasted a week old. I will not be going back for any type of food. Wait staff so super awesome and friendly.

If you want a good pretzel and beer cheese, head to Old Mecklenburg  Brewery. None better!!!
