Don't believe pictures at all. Made one round and was disappointed. But since we made that one round the cashier refused a refund.  Asked for manager and when she finally came out she said it's been 30 min.  I informed her there food wasn't good and the pictures where not in her buffet she said well it's only $7.50. This is the first and last time at this business.  Yelp should really make people update there pictures every 3-6 month.
