I ordered a medium Pizzaz Pizza.  The service made me feel like a truly valuable customer.  The gentlemen working the evening I visited called me by name and when I left he said, "John, thanks for visiting."  I gave it two stars because the crust was chewy and bland.  The toppings on the pizza were bland as well.  Maybe I'll have better luck when I try a pizza with red sauce and different toppings.  From the looks of the pics posted on this site I expected a better tasting crust and was surprised that the crust was, well, bland.
