Never coming here again. I live on the block, 30 seconds away from Valentino's. So, of course, I had to try out the closest pizza joint near me. Since it's 2015, I like to order pizza online, and this one was for pick-up. The website could use a huge makeover with it's amateur-like interface. After figuring out how to make my order, I received an email notice saying my pizza will be ready in....wait for iiiiitt, 45 minutes. 45 minutes!!!! Okay, whatever, I figured if it takes them that long then it better be baked to perfection. I go to the shop 42 min later, pick up my pizza within 5 min, and go back home. I open the box, ready to be amazed by all the ravings I've heard from others including "authentic Italian pizza", "high quality", "amazing local pizzeria". Pshhhhhhtt, are you kidding me?!?! Were you guys born on another planet? This was perhaps the worst cheese pizza I've had in my lifetime. The pie barely had any cheese, it was horribly cut (I had to grab a knife to fully cut it), and the base of the pizza was ~cardboard dry/burny, with about a ~5mm thickness. Because I pride myself on being unbiased, I continued to eat the pizza, but mostly because I was starving. It tasted like I just bought pizza from a backroom pizzeria that sells dollar slices, except burnt. Waste of my time, and a bad way to end the day for my stomach. Have fun ordering, you guys!

P.S. I always like to give second chances, so maybe when I'm having a day where I feel super nice I'll stop by for a slice and update this review.
