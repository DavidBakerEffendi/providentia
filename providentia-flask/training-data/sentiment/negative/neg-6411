I usually like to leave a nice, thorough review of establishments I visit highlighting the pros and cons like I did with my previous review, but this place...There isn't a single compliment I can spare. 

There has been zero improvement since the last time I was here. The food is awful and the management is even worse. If you like your burger dripping in grease and tasting like it was marinating in a vat of salt before hitting the stovetop, this place is for you. Eating one half of a burger would give you hypertension. 

I know it's a newer establishment, but come on, management needs to learn how to treat its patrons better.  The managers need to take a lesson in kindness and hospitality. 

This place needs some help fast. Will be avoiding Mooyah like the plague.
