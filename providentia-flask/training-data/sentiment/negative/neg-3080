We came in response to a large advertisement for 1/2 price Senior Citizen entrees on Sundays from 5:00 - 7:00.  We planned our day around it and arrived right on time.  My husband asked for a table.  The two hostesses sneered at him and said we'd have to sit outside--in 110-degree heat!  We declined, of course, but we were both just aghast.  If they don't want senior citizens in there, they shouldn't buy advertising aimed at us.
