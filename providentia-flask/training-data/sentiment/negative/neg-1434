I've been to El Chorro several times for brunch and it has always been wonderful. Both food and service .Last Sunday's brunch with family from out of town was so disappointing. Our waiter was snarky to the point of being rude. My husband wanted jalapenos in this omelette and the waiter refused, stating they had jalapenos but not for that particular omelette. The server continued to be rude and snippy the entire meal. I had the beet salad, which I've had before but it's been changed. It was 4 beets on a plate with a bit of lettuce and goat cheese on top. Definitely not a salad. Mediocre food, indifferent service We won't be back.
