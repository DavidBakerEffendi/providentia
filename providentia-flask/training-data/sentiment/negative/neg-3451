So ill start off with the positive.  Our server was attentive and apologetic.   Ok now into everything else.   We waited about an hour maybe a little more for our appetizer. Which then came out cold.   Our waiter did the best to hold us over bringing us bread.   Which had been thawed out, and I know this because the middles were still cold.  We then waited about 30-40 more minutes for our meals.  The food was mediocre at best.   We ordered a flat bread, burgers, salad,  and some pasta.  All of it was ok.   Keep in mind they charge you a $2+ sharing fee?  Which I was told I'd charged because they give you more food.   Although I'm not sure how 3 sliders are considered more food when the description includes 3 sliders.   Anyway,  we won't be headed back there.  This place took over where saut√© was.   Some of the pit falls of that place were service, but at least the food was decent.
