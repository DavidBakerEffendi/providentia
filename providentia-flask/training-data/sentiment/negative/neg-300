I used to come here frequently with friends. I came here last night and the food was great! However the service was AWFUL! I don't know if I will be back here because of how horrid this service was. Water was refilled constantly but the waiter was so slow with everything. Slow with coming back to take my drink order. She was slow to come take an appetizer order. She was slow to put in entrees. She was slow for multiple things. It took her 45 min after dinner to bring our check. I'm disappointed because I have never experienced this at this restaurant before. The place wasn't even busy for the service to be this awful. I hope I can find a different location soon because I love the food but need better service.
