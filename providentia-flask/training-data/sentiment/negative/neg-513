Our first time here was last night to support our friends band. We sat at the bar and the service was absolutely horrible. Had to flag down the girls to serve us. Beer list isn't up to date - took my husband 3 times to get a beer they still had. We had one drink and left. There is a terrible smell inside the bar area. Bartenders were not friendly or helpful at all. The only redeeming quality of this bar is the beautiful patio with gas fire pits to sit around. 100% do not recommend this place!
