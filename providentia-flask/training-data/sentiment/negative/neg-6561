I come he quite a bit an the food is usually good but today was over the top POOR. What made me experience so bad was the cold ginger dish which I must have ordered twenty times before and always came out alright but to day not so much. It was RAW and I don't mean a little pink. The center still had a heart beat. I requested the dish to be taken back. When I received the new dish it was the same dish but with a few pieces taken out and slightly stirred around. Like it had been picked threw and just covered with a little more sauce. I was grossed out. I went to the bottom of the plate and STILL RAW.  Asked again for the dish to be taken back. This time when it came to us it was the same but the whole plate had been just thrown into the microwave. I did not touch it any more and I was still AWFUL plate of twice NUKED and sifted through chicken. DISGUSTING!!! It truly ruined my day. Then the check came and I was still expected to pay for the RAW TWICE NUKED GINGER CHICKEN. The waitress agreed it was really raw and explained that the chicken they used today was bigger. Ya so if you know that cook it longer DUH. I was so pissed I paid my bill and left. I was heart broken that a place I usually frequent had done me wrong. I feel sick to my stomach now and am really disappointed in you WO FAT. Minus Four STARS for serving RAW product and not having the decency to correct it.
