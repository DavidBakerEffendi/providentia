I wrote a review second day they were open complaining about their extremely high prices. I guess it was taken down. We'll see about this one. I don't know why corporate didn't adjust their prices when they saw the enormous  sales slump. Now they're in bankruptcy. Good for them. Feel sorry about the local staff. I still go to Henderson to do 95% of my shopping. Even Albertsons prices are above normal. Maybe they'll put a Smiths or trader Joe's in its place.
