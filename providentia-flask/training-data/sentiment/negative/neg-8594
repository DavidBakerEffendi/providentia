The Tuesday night prime rib buffet went from about $8.00 to about $12.50 which is not worth the price. The prime rib was good but everything else was terrible. I do not care for prime rib so I had spaghetti which was cold and the sauce was not tasty at all and the fried fish was hard and dry and the chicken was chicken. While I was eating a gentleman came to my table and asked how the meal was. I told him it was terrible and I would not be coming there again. He did not seem to care and he said he would tell the chief. I have to say I go there almost every Tuesday and Thursday and at $8.00 in the summer it is not a bad deal but at the new price I can go to any restaurant and have a good meal.
