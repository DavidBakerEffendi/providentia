Alright I am still so LIVID about this place that I am not even going to make this a very long review because its too painful but I will say AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS unless you're going there to dance and drink. The food was TERRIBLE. My friend got chicken strips that weren't even cookied and I got this buffalo chicken wrap that was not even edible. Which coming from me NEVER happens especially when I am paying $14 for the item but it literally tasted like Vinegar wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla. The hotsauce and the Guacamole and chicken was just non existent in the flavoring and I literally had to dip the darn thing in Queso just to be able to eat half of it . Which I only did because ...You guessed it.. the thing cost $14. We had initially been downtown and decided to check this place out because they had a veterans day special for a free burger which my boyfriend took advantage of and for being a free burger he was able to eat it but the fact of the matter is. Even Checkers does it better!  I really enjoy Toby Keith's music and I like the atmosphere with the pretty ladies in their backless chaps but we didn't even end up with a hot waitress and the music was so loud that was playing I couldn't even complain to our waitress if I wanted to but I just couldn't even stomach the energy after how bad everything was. I will hopefully be uploading some photos to cement the fact you shouldn't bother with this place but it's me and I am not always that good at attention to detail. This would have to be one of the first places I have not been able to finish my food though. I am the queen of eating pretty much anything but this place failed hardcore. The chips and Queso was definitely from a Can but that at least tasted good just wasn't worth the $... Definitely try somewhere else if you have the chance!
