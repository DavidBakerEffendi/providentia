Pros: Great location, fun games, good food. Cons: the staff are severally undertrained and inexperienced. Visited the Porch 5-6 times in the last 8 months and the results are always the same. Slow service, staff on their cell phones half the time, inexperienced bartenders, hostess who have no idea what their job is. At this point you have to blame the mangers and hiring staff for putting people in these positions. Either they're trying to save a buck or the don't have a clue. There no way they can't take note of the terrible service.
