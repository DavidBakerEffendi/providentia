All I can say is horrible  

I wouldn't waste my time on the food hereâ€¼ 

I ordered the chicken tikka masala was so watery there was no texture...... Barley any flavor and almost NO CHICKEN  

This is my favorite dish so I was soooo disappointed 

Second my garlic naan was EXTREMELY HARD a complete WASTE OF MONEY 

I could barely eat any of it.... I wouldn't even feed it to my dog 

DO NOT GO HERE there are soooo many better places
