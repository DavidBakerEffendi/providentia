Worst ihop ever they ruined 3 of 5 orders. Made my 7 month pregnant gf wait for 45 minutes to get food that was edible and then the manager Sara was to scared to come tell us we were only getting a 20 percent discount.  They then threatened to call the police on us when we refused to pay for the portion of the meal we werent happy with. We are now in the parking lot waiting for the police to arrive.  Food was sub par even when it was correct.
