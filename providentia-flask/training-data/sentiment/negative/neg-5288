Worst experience at any Mc Donald's here. My family & I hit the drive thru for breakfast sandwiches. It took over 20 MINS!!! They served me like warm coffee. Corporate is going to have to send someone down here because it's a @$&% show. Angry customers everywhere. All the people they had pulled over in the parking lot ended up inside and angrily demanding their food.
