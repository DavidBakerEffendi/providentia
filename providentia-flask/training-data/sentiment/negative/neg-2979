Two words: BAD VIBES! 

I'm beyond surprised and disappointed in my experience I received here at Nekter. Maybe I hyped it up too much with the anticipation of wanting to come try this place out for a while now. 

Anyway, my best friend and I were in the area doing some Christmas shopping so we decided to stop and get a drink. Upon entering, all eyes on me. And not in a good way. I didn't feel like a celebrity but more so like everyone was dogging me and looking me up and down. The people there were already giving the place a bad vibe. While we were looking at the menu for some time we just went and decided on a smoothie each. Being our first time, we didn't know what to get. As we paid and sat down at the table to wait for our drink we noticed the ladies that were in front of us sitting across the way staring. I didn't mind that and I continued to stare at my phone and wait for my drink. 

As my name was called, I went to pick up both my drink and my friends. I didn't know which was which so I had nicely asked the lady. She said it so fast I didn't even know which was which still. After she had rudely said in her fast voice and disturbing attitude she quickly turned away so I didn't even want to bother asking a second time. I left with our drinks and we figured it out ourselves. 
Such bad customer service. 

After we both had a sip of our drinks, we noticed the two ladies that were in front of us yet again stare at us because they hadn't received their drinks. So they went up and confronted the workers. The rude lady deserved the confrontation by the customer but all in all it was such drama and bad vibes all together!
