Today I was there at 7:30pm and my appetizer (Sawara shio-yaki, and an octopus dish) came at 8:30pm then my food (spicy salmon roll, chrishi don) finally arrived at 9pm.  The food was just right like any other Japanese restaurant.. Not surprising but don't get me wrong.. They taste good.  But I wouldn't recommend cuz it just took toooo long for the food and I was hangry.. That's hungry+angry.  The other table asked for the bill as soon as their food arrived... Everyone waited avg of 2hrs to get their order.
