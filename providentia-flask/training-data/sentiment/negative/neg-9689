Terrible service. Ordered my burger with no onion and no tomato. Goto our seat. My buddy gets his salad. My burger comes about 10 minutes later. He's already done. The burger comes with onion and tomato. I told the girl in the sea foam green shirt that I ordered it without those items.  She scowls at me and tells me to put it in her hand.  Then after she leaves I realize they didn't put cheese on my burger. I wave down another employee that my burger is missing cheese. I explain I have to go and my friend is already done with his meal. Can I just get a piece of cheese. Next the girl in the green shirt comes over agitated and says you wanted cheese. That's one of the ingredients on the menu. Yes I want cheese. She keeps offering to make my meal again. I once again tell her my friend is already done eating and I don't have time for another burger to be cooked. She asked if I wanted something else. I told her I just wanted the cheese. She kept asking so much my buddy interjected and said He just wants the cheese. End of story. Bad service. By the way the line was out the door practically with one register open. Seen two people walk out. Just some advice. If the salad is done first. Put it in the fridge until the hot meals are ready so everyone can eat together. Or make the salad after the hot meals are done since they are so easy to make. Watching my friend eat then me watching him is not my idea of having lunch with someone.
