--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! 

This is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. 

Management provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!
