I have been here quite a few times since they opened.  A couple of those times were corporate events (*****) and a couple were just regular visitation (***).  During the corporate events, everything was great but largely due to the budget of the hosting company.  On the other times the service has not been great in the outdoor bar area, but that is another review for another day (many people were billed twice near the outdoor bar and servers think Cabernet Sauvignon is a white wine).  

Do not book a "social event" and actually be a popular person or run into people you know at the venue.  Also, do not speak positively about this venue on social media while you are there as "social event" means "private event" to TopGolf and you will be charged for people who are near you, even if you do not know them all... The contracted amount of people are the maximum allowed near your unsecured area despite a fixed cost but increased revenue on the part of TopGolf (patrons will pay 18% gratuity for being near you).  Just have someone arrive early and reserve a couple of lanes and wait the 2 hours, $1,000 will go a lot further that way.

We moved everyone we knew to the bar area in lieu of breaking up the group but they chose to pack up our food an hour early without checking with me, regardless of the fact that we paid for a fixed amount of time.

I am certain this company is trying to alter the definition of customer service as they do not seem to understand it.  Constant defense of a poorly written "contract" and management continually blaming their employees for a flawed policy is not service.

Also, Joe B., do not respond to this post with some useless apology, you can feel free to contact me directly as the staff has my contact information.  If you do not plan to address this issue, spare us the commentary.
