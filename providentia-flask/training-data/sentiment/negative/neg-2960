Wow, what disappointment, dirty place with sticky floors and tables. Meat was so dry, had to use lots of sauce just to get down a couple of bites. I left the rest. Ordered the collard greens, nowhere was it stated that they were spicy--too hot for me to eat or even my husband who loves spicy food. The corn bread was under cooked too. Horrible experience, however, everyone seemed very nice.
