I was really hungry today and I decided to stop in cause I was craving some seafood.  For starters the place is not nice inside or out.  I almost considered just not going but since there was a good review I decided to stay.  

I ordered the crab and shrimp ceviche tostadas.  I was totally not impressed.  The crab had pieces of shell in it and the shrimp had no flavor.  The only good thing was the coke in a bottle but I can get that at the grocery store so unfortunately I was very disappointed.
