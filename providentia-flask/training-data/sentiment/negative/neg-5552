Lots to be desired!

I noticed this place as I was working on the road in this part of town yesterday.  I had a little time to kill and was craving some Tom Ka soup!

Right from the get-go it's hard to note much in the way of positives.  It was approx. 4pm, not a single customer in the dining room.  I walked in, and there was no hostess... (She was hiding behind her make-shift office in one of the dining booths).  I asked her if I could sit at the bar since I was dining alone, sadly there was only ONE available seat at the bar, the remaining seats were occupied with restaurant supplies.  

I ordered my Tom Ka and some Chicken Satay along with a glass of Iced Thai Tea.  While I waited for my food to arrive, I noticed them microwaving several meals, and they weren't even being discreet about it as the microwave was sitting behind the bar facing patrons.  The microwaved food was then packed into 'take out' bags.  

My food arrived and it was less than impressive.  The soup had chunks of tomato so large they had to be cut with a knife, I was offered a 'spicy' soup and it came out a weak 4 out of 10 on the Thai spicy scale.  The chicken Satay was decent, however I refused to try the dipping sauces since moments before serving I saw them take it out of the microwave!!!!

The three items totaled over $20 which seemed a bit steep for the quality.  The Thai food market in Las Vegas is strong, and  in order to compete, you've got to be good.... This place left a lot to be desired
