Came here for late night dessert and was surprised by their overpriced dessert and significantly small portion compare to other dessert places. I was actually a bit excited to see new Hong Kong style dessert place to open in Scarborough and didn't expect to have such disappointing experience.

Even though we have seen bad reviews at this place, we still decided to give it a shot and try out their dessert. However, the quality of their food is really below average nothing surprising at all. Not just their portion was super small comparing to the price, but also the overall quality wasn't good. At least not good enough for me to recommend people to try or going again myself.
