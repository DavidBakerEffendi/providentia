This is probably the worst part of my experience in Toronto! The food was cold, staff was unfriendly, food was tasteless and dirty. When we first arrived the table was cleared but the napkins on the table had spot of spattered food. Sure fine, i could ask for different napkin. We ordered food and it came out within 2 minutes! Okay it could be that fast sure. But it was COLD! It was already made food that just brought out to our table. We ordered noodle and we waited for a while. Then we asked the waiter and he said it was sold out!!!!! Okay VINCENT, you should tell us it was sold out BEFORE we order the food, not after we waited 30 minutes. Oh yeah by the way this place charge almost $20 for this shitty stuff!! Please do not make sure yourself of victim of this tasteless, dirty, and unfriendly place.
