Really bad. 1 star food at a 5 star price. Definitely avoid eating here. I had lobster and it was so overdone but yet it was priced as if it were fresh from the dock. Service was week. They had a huge group come in and it got so out of control. These girls acted as if they were in a pizza parlor, doing cheers and screaming and management never tried to step in. Bad food, bad service, bad ambiance. Just bad overall. At least I did not get food poison so that's a plus!
