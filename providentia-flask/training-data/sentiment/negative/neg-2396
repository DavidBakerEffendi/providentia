WORST SERVICE EVER . AVOID AVOID AVOID 

I came here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation for 10 .when we arrived we got two tables one got all you can eat and another got the woonam and couple choice. Each one you can choose 3 meats and get soy bean soup. So while we were ordering our meats ( that was available on both sections ) she was saying how we choose too much from one list , so we ordered 4 meats and two portions of two of them.

- we asked for water, received it after 20 minutes of asking and we never saw them again 
-asked for soybean paste never got it 

As we started getting full I noticed that we had only gotten one soy bean soup and nothing else, later when I had to go pay I asked about our soups and she said "oh, you didn't get it, I guess I left it at the wrong table " like wtf? not even an apologize.
After we received the check and people pulled out cards and cash she started to sigh and look annoyed so I just paid and left. It wasn't until after we paid and left we realized we never got one of the meats. 

This is out raging how horrible the service is , the food was good but it can't make up for how horrible the service was .
