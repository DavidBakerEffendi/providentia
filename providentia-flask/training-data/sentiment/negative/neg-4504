under new middle eastern management! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! No pork dogs at all! No Coney Island dogs! None! No bacon! it's turkey bacon...waste of time as well...it took me 43 minutes to get 4 hot dogs that tasted like grocery store hot dogs...and...Falafel is on its way! Yuck!
Do NOT go here. This place sucks...the waitresses whisper under their breath apologies...They will never make here. This is America. Deal with it and don't buy a Coney Hot Dog restaurant and then stop serving Coney Island dogs! Frauds!
