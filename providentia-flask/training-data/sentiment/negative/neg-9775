Currently sitting at Cafe Rio. This is the worst experience I have ever had here. It's 7:30 on a Saturday and they are out of pork, green sauce, scrambling to find chicken and no concern for the well being if their customers. Our food is cold. The Pico is brown. The women in front of me asked for green sauce and they looked around and just said nope we are out. Didn't offer to make more or give her other options. My boyfriends Steak was tough as if it had been sitting out for too long. I asked the employee to put cheese on my salad tortilla as that's how they have always come without asking and she made me feel inconvenienced. There are dirty plastic gloves on the floor and a worker has walked by several times without picking it up. There is clearly a lack of supervision.  If I were the GM, I would want to know. Terrible experience. I love Cafe Rio and it might be a long time before I come back. This place used to be so good.
