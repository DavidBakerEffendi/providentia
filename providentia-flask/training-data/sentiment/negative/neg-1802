Been here several times and its probably the biggest dive of any McDonalds Ive ever been. Ive been to McDonalds in 5 countries and dozens of states and none rate as low as this one. The food has been cold a few times, soggy fries, kids got 2 of the same toy even when we said 1 boy and 1 girl toy. The order has been messed up a few times. Inside its disgusting along with the restrooms. They couldn't understand perfect English in the drive thru. The late night menu is so small why bother stopping. I don't anymore like dozens of others we visit the one in the east side of Sun Prairie or the new one near Woodman's. I'll sun this store up....Terrible.
