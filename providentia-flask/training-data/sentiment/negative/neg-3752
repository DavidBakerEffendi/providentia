I wanted to share that after my posted review, the owner of JJ's ("Jonathan L") chose to send me an email filled with sarcasm, condescension, and ridicule.  That's fine.  That's his prerogative.  Now it's my prerogative to never visit JJ's again, not only for the items mentioned in my review, but for his unprofessionalism as a business owner.  

He feels that I should reward his workers going above and beyond their regular duty.  To me, that's just called doing a great job.  I, too, go -- and have gone -- above and beyond in all of my jobs -- retail, restaurants, offices.  It's who I am.  I don't expect a tip for treating someone extra special or making their day.  Just doing it is reward enough.  Plus, I'm already being paid to provide good service by my employer(s).  That's why I was hired.

Jonathan also wanted to "explain" to me the difference between "fast food" and "fast casual," since I apparently didn't get it.  Oh, I get it.  He suggests that they not only prepare my food and ring me up, they deliver it to my table.  Wow.  Well, that deserves an extra special bonus, right?  Meanwhile, I have to select the least dirtiest table in the dining room because nobody's out there cleaning them off.  Nobody checks up on me at my table afterwards.  Nobody refills my drink.  Nobody takes my trash away for me.  I left a 20% gratuity on the bill I signed at the register.  Where was the "exceptional service" and employees going "above and beyond" for that?  

So, no thanks, Jonathan.  I'm not going to pay extra so your employees can treat me like a customer.  Just visiting your establishment should grant me that.
