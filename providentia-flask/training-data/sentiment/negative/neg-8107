I placed an order for four people, who had special requests for their food items. Such as Cheeseburger plain, Cheeseburger no onions and a burger BBQ sauce only. The only thing they got correct was a strawberry shake. The person working the cash register had communication challenges that made it difficult to understand what he was saying and clearly he had challenges understanding what I was saying. I enjoy Farmer Boys and have always received quality service and food. I would highly recommend if someone is going to work the register they can clearly communicate with the customer to insure quality service. We did not want to wait for the order to be redone, we got a refund and ate somewhere else.
