The only good thing about this place is the AC. Small, dry, one note tacos. Horchata tastes like they added baby powder--come on, anything with added baby powder is rough. Cheesey joke, but something here should be cheesey if they can't get any flavor into the pastor. I just wanted delicious tacos! Why are these $2.50? Why was this Phoenix magazine's Readers Choice best tacos in 2016? Was there a change in ownership? I'm probably more annoyed than I should be... but it's because I threw the dried up, chopped up, unremarkable tacos I paid for away, and hanger is real y'all.
