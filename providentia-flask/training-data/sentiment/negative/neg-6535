My review is based on 6-8 visits. The service here is inconsistent but tends to be poor more often than good. Do not arrive when you are very hungry. Kitchen staff can be seen working on food prep when salads (food that doesn't need cooking) have yet to be served. Food tends to take a long time even when there are less than 3 tables in the place. My most recent experience was so bad I've decided to never return considering there are so many alternatives in toronto. My friend and I came here for dinner after work. Another couple was seated next to us. Their apps came before ours while we had arrived and ordered at least 15 minutes before them. The server tried to explain that this was because one of our apps takes a long time in the oven and she had ASSumed we wanted our apps to come out all at once. This didn't explain why their pizzas arrived 10 minutes+ before ours. I ordered a vegetarian lasagna (daily special) for take out. This was the worst issue of all. I asked if they had vegetarian lasagna because the menu showed beef lasagna. The server confirmed they do. My vegetarian daughter took a bite to find out that they gave us meat by mistake. Inexcusable mistake!!!
