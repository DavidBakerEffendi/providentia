Holy shit! Never have I been so pissed at a resteraunt. Service? Terrrrrrrible and non existent. Food? Is this the Oregon Trail set on meager? This place is the biggest ripoff since Milli Vanilli. You're forced into one check on a party over 5 people so they can screw you on their 18% gratituity... which they don't deserve because I mean... there is no service they should pay me money for being at this dump. Never have I been at a place so dead and still wait 25 minutes for a re fill and then get an attitude for having to go ask again for it. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this place like the plague. Also their Nachos? More like a side of chips with a pinch of cheese melted on them. Seriously you guys SUCK!
