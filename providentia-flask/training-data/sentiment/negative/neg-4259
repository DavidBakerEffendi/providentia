This place seemed like it would have some good bar fair considering there a midwestern themed bar. Couldn't be further from the truth. Food was frozen for probably months had that freezer burn taste to it very gross. The service is rude and could care less about your visit or what you think about the food. Left a 10% tip and I'm still pissed about that and wish I left a penny. Do yourself a favor and go to any other sports bar anywhere it will be a much better choice I promise you.
