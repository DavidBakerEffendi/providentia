I agree with the previous reviews and wish I listened.  We had a horrible experience tonight.  I was with my friend and her mom and the service was horrible.  Many mistakes made and the owner refused to take responsibility and make good.  Instead the manager or owner treated us horrible, raised his voice, and was beyond disrespectful.  Avoid at all costs....I mean...still in shock!
