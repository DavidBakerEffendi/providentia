I've been here several times for take out and dine in and have been satisified with their value and quality. This is my go to for platters.

Unfortunately I had chirachidon last night for dinner and got mild food poisoning. I had to play game of thrones all night. Didn't sleep.

I noticed while I was dining in that one of the chefs would go outside for a smoke and come back behind the counter without washing their hands and make sushi. I was wondering why their radish always smelt like weed.

From 5 stars to 1 stars. Ruined my night.

Good luck if you eat here.
