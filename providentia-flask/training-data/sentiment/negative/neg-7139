This location is in the Venetian food court on the 2nd level Canale Shoppes. The food here is far below the normal standard of PE. The first item I got (kung pao chicken) was an absolute salt bomb - burn your mouth levels! I couldn't eat it so I went back and told the cashier and she semi-reluctantly replaced it with another item. The broccoli beef I got next tasted fine but the broccoli must not have been cleaned well. I got crunchy bits in it from time to time, probably from dirt that was not washed off. Never going there again.
