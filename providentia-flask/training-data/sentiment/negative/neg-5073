The food here was rather disappointing. My friend and I shared the misto platter (assortment of cheeses and meats). It came with two types of cheese (one edible, one chalky and flavorless) and three types of meet (the salami was alright, the other two were not). Although the appetizer platter was generous (which is good because it cost $15) there wasn't much on it worth eating. The sandwich was alright, but the pizza was greasy and ungenerous (it seemed like it was pre-made, frozen, then cooked). The only upshot is the nice outdoor seating and great wine menu, with reasonably priced glasses. If I came back here again, which I doubt I will, I would just stick to the wine. Lastly, the waitress was nice and helpful, but she also complained to us about some of the other customers at the restaurant, which was quite awkward.
