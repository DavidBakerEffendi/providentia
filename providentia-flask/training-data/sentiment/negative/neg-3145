This place is the worst... Worst stomach ache ever after eating here.  Just came here for lunch and right after had a horrible stomach ache.. 

Would never come back to this place ever.. Sushi and Sashim is not even preserved properly. When I got my bento box the sashimi was warm... This place is atrocious.. Quality of the food is so bad. I just feel this place is so dirty. Would never recommend anyone to this horrible restaurant. 

Never going back to this place again..... This place is on par with Matsuda Don Mills. holy fu**... another place to burn.
