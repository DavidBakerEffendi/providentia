I hate giving 1 star reviews but I have to in the instance . There was no one in line at the drive thru and literally 3 people sitting down to eat.

5 people were  in line waiting with 1 girl at the register working. The woman in front of us actually left from having to wait so long. We had to wait 20 minutes . The girl at the register was waiting on a guy who didn't actually order food, I believe , he was a vendor. Someone else working could have helped in instead of having all of us wait. 

After we were waited on, I heard girls laughing in the back so it's not like there weren't people there who could help .

I will not be coming back.
