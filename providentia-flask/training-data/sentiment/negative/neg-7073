This buffet is priced pretty much the same as the rest of them, and includes unlimited wine and beer. We picked this buffet because we were staying at the The Mirage, and they also had a better quality beer included in the price. 
There were a lot of options for people without any dietary restrictions. Vegetarians watch out! I talked to the chef and he told me that even the dishes marked as vegetarian contain chicken powder!!! The CHEF told me this! He didn't seem to care at all that this of course makes any vegetarian items not safe for them to eat. I spent the whole night and next day sick from eating chicken, which I am allergic to. This practice of adding meat to items clearly marked as vegetarian is dangerous. Who knows what else is hiding in their food.
