We are staying at Bellagio for 5 nights and went to the buffet for dinner tonight. Now over the last 15 years we had dinner here at least 8 times and it was always great. Maybe the best in Vegas. But it has been 2 years since our last time and now our last time. This buffet has gone from the top in Vegas to average at best for the price. The selection and quality has gone down so bad that it is now one of worst of the big casinos on the strip. Sorry to say if I could give it less then 1 star I would. If you don.t trust me find out for yourself and throw away your money or go somewhere else where they still care about there customers.
