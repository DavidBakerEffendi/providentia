If you want stale and very dry hard rice you'd come to the right place! I was looking forward to trying something new since I usually go to Chipotle when I am craving Americanized Mexican food. I think I will be sticking to Chipotle for awhile.

The flour tortilla was really greasy, the guacamole was tasteless and expensive for 1 oz serving and was a shade of olive green, the rice was sooo hard like it wasn't cooked! Also, the black beans were overcooked and were clumpy and kinda dry. 

Overall I think their food just looks quiet unappetizing because the presentation along with what I tasted today were not good. Plus, the back of the house was kinda messy along with messy steam tables...if you have an open kitchen I'd recommend to keep it presentable.
