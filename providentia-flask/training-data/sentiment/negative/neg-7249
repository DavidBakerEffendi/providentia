We haven't been to John Cutters in about one year and it will be longer than that before we return. Three of us went there on Sunday the 18th for the steak special. We got there about 3:30 and it was about half full. The service was quick and friendly, but the food - Ug. All three of us ordered the bone in Rib Eye, done medium. I used to come here frequently and the steaks were always good. I don't know what grade meat they are buying but all three were full of sinew and gristle. Cutting them was a chore because they were so tough. All three steaks were done to a different level. One was medium, one was medium rare, and one was close to well done. All three of us left almost half of our steaks on the plate rather than fight with them. No comment from the server when picking up the plates. My wife concluded that they may buy a lower quality of meat for the Sunday half price special. $17.50 for a bone in Rib Eye steak is a good deal. But, if you can only eat half then it becomes the equivalent of $35, the normal price! I don't know if this was the new normal at John Cutters, but I'm not going back anytime soon to find out.
