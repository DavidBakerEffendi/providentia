Horrible service. I placed my order for 2 All-American Cheeseburgers ahead of the family of five who placed a large order. After a 10-12 minute wait, the family of five got their order first while I had to wait an additional 5 minutes.  The excuse given by the employee was they were busy and short-staffed!! I don't see how that makes a difference in whose order is prepared first. Will never return to this Rally's location...not even worth one Star.
