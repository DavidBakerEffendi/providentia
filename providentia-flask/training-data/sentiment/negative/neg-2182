It's unfortunate that this used to be my favourite shop to go to for a little taste of the old country. They have all sorts of Hungarian (and European) goodies and delicious prepared meals for you to take home.
My last trip to this store found me full of surprise when I saw the one type of coffee, which I love and have shipped from Europe, sitting on the display shelf behind the counter. It was a bag of Nescafe 3in1 Hungarian coffee (15-20 pouches I think). I asked how much the whole bag was not that I really cared since I was going to buy it at any cost but it was something like $8-$10. 
Almost ready to pay, the fat owner comes out from the back and sees the friendly girl who served my about to ring up this fantastic coffee (did I mention I love it?). He grabs the bag with his fat greasy fingers and says that the price is wrong, that's the old price. Then he proceeds to tack on an additional $6! WTF?! I was desperate since this coffee was only available in Europe and I used to drink it all the time. I reluctantly bought knowing that they had seen me for the last time. Typical Hungarian mentality. This was one of the reasons that Hungary completely lost most of it's tourism for decades. Screw the customer.
Well, my coffee is now readily available in almost every supermarket so greasy slim can change his prices all he wants!
