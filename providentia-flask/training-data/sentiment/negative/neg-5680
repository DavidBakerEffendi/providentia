Wow, it wasn't until I came here that I realized you can screw up Indian food so badly.  I really should have known better and read the reviews but I really had to grab something quick during my lunch hour as I wasted a good part of it at Dollarama in that same building, waiting the long line.  In any case, I had the "classic Indian bowl" and it was horrendous.  I ordered the paneer and I have never tasted such watery paneer in my life.  The cheese cubes were the size of my finger tips (I have small fingers) and I counted a total of 5 cheese cubes in that bowl of stuff.  The rest of my spinach mixture was watery, salty, and gross.  It was such an epic waste of calories.  Definitely go to Matagali's nearby instead
