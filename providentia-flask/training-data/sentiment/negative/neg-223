OMG! How I wanted to love this place. I had been meaning to eat here after reading the glowing article about their female chef in Charlotte Five a few months ago. I also saw the pics in yelp from that time frame that made the food look tantalizing. WRONG!! The good imaginative chef is no longer there. I went here today and got their most popular two meals: the chicken sandwich and the shrimp and grits. DISGUSTING! I should have known this wasn't going to end well when I arrived at 12:30 Saturday - the peak of lunchtime - and the place was COMPLETELY EMPTY!  But back to the food:  The chicken was way undercooked and had zero flavor. The shrimp and grits was also devoid of flavor and the grits were so under cooked they sort of crumbled in my mouth. To make it edible at home  I had to add my own andouille and creole salt. I also re-cooked it in my own oven. I repeat DISGUSTING!! I called back later to discuss my experience with a manager but none were there on a Saturday night and all I got was a confused girl who didn't know her own work title but was full of anger and attitude. WONT. FUCKING. BE. BACK!
