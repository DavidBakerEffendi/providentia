I wanted to try something different, so I stopped in here for lunch. I have to say I'm surprised at all of the five star ratings and talk of how good the service and food are. That was certainly not my experience. First of all the waiter never even cracked a smile, certainly wasn't friendly. After he put my food down he never returned to fill my water or perhaps ask why I wasn't eating the chicken. 

I ordered the Pollo A La Provonzol with a salad as the side. It came with bread and herbed oil for dipping. The bread and herbs were amazing, absolutely delicious. The salad was alright, nothing great. The chicken breast was huge and filled the plate. It had obviously been beaten to make it flatter. The chicken was extremely dry and tasted of fish. It had to have been cooked with fish or at least on the same grill where fish had been cooked. 

Ordinarily, I would have returned the chicken and had it prepared again, but by then I was slightly nauseated and no longer hungry. It's safe to say that I'll never eat there again.
