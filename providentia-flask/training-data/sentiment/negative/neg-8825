I came here with a friend for dinner.  The waitress seemed to be intoxicated and wasn't really paying attention.   We ordered drinks and that took about 30 minutes to get.  We asked for a menu when we first arrived and that didn't come out until about 45 minutes later.   She kept pushing the lasagna on us when we didn't want it.  I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  Not a good thing when there are other restaurants 2 steps away.
