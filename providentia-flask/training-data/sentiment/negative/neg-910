Ordered six sandwiches online. Went in the store exactly when I was supposed to pick up the sandwiches, and supposedly I'm supposed to be able to cut in line, but I waited because no one behind the counter acknowledge me. I waited about eight minutes before I finally said "excuse me, is my order ready?", showing my phone with the confirmation number. I had to point at the bag that was sitting behind the worker and said "I think that is my order". She handed it to me, but was missing 2 out of 6 sandwiches. Of course i asked for the rest of my order and the cashier who was visibly irritated asked which ones I was missing without even asking the workers if they had the other two sandwiches.  So i had to get all the sandwiches out of my bag, and read off the numbers from the wrapping.  Then they handed me the other two sandwiches with no bag whatsoever. No "thanks", no "sorry",  not even "have a nice day" - but instead a glare from the cashier like I wasn't welcome. Is it because he just couldn't handle the work - he was training someone new and that can be frustrating.....or does he not like asian customers like me - I wonder. It's not as if they had a ton of business.  They did have a couple of people in line.  I've been to other locations where they had a dozen people in line and still handled everyone's orders well and with great customer service.   I love good food. I hate their un-professionalism and bad-attitude!  I will go to another location from now on.
