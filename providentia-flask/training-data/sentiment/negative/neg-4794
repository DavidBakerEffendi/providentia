Horrible, horrible service.

Been here before, and the ice cream is OK, but not as good as Honey Hut and way overpriced.

Came in on a Sunday night tonight and went through the drive thru in search of a hot fudge sundae.  Asked for Ohio ice cream (aka Moosetracks), but was told they were out of it.  I was offered no alternatives, as I was obviously an impediment to the server doing nothing.

I looked closer at the menu to find an ice cream they had on hand.  Had to drive ahead to a small piece of paper that was taped to the beautiful digital menus which listed their ice creams they had in stock.  I find it ironic that the menu that doesn't change is on 50" TV displays, but the menu that does change is tucked away on a piece of paper that you have to drive up to, and then back up to the speaker to order.

Decided I would have a medium hot fudge sundae with chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, but before I could get to the word 'sundae' I was rudely told WE ONLY HAVE LARGE AND SMALL.  click.  

I'm done with this, and I told the stupid crack the same.  Again, she remained unphased, as now a hindrance in her otherwise quiet night had eradicated itself from the situation.  Ended up going to Regos and buying ice cream and making my own hot fudge sauce, which was better than this dump could have ever dished out.
