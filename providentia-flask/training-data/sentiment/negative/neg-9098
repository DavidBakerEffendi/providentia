I would love to speak about the food BUT today I cannot.  We were never served.  My group of five was told when we asked when putting in our name that the wait would be 20 min. We waited patiently for an extended period of time.  What made us wonder was when after 45 min someone came out to say the wait would be 20 min.  Seemed to be a pat response since the place had more people go in than leave.  A large group was seated before us.  We went to ask how much longer and the hostess only response was she couldn't say because she couldn't ask people to leave. I explained if they had been honest in the beginning that it would be 45 min wait we would have gone somewhere else.  The hostess AND the cashier both repeated themselves that it is only an estimate and they can't ask people to leave.  Since they could explain to me after 45 min wait that the reason we were a longer wait was because it was a party of 5 -- I tried to explain that would have been benefiical in using their skills to estimate in the beginning. NEVER DID THEY OR THE MANAGER WHO CAME UP AND LISTENED DURING THE SECOND TIME THROUGH EXPRESS ANY CONCERN WITH THE INVONVENIENCE. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST UNLESS YOU HAVE NO LIFE AND CAN WAIT ALL MORNING TO BE SEATED
