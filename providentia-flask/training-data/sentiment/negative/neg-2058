Sorry this place was not impressive.  I was starving and came in based on Yelp reviews. Order a few sandwiches and a few bagels.  

I waited forever for them to make the sandwiches (no one else in the joint).  I was super excited due to the length of time to prepare the sandwiches that that would be spectacular.

Wrong!! Drove home.  Pulled out the food. The bagels were fine.  My sandwich was a joke - I actually thought they were playing a joke with me (maybe they were??).  It was two pieces of bread with cream cheese on one side and a clump of meat in the middle.  The other sandwich was just meat and a slice of cheese with nothing on the bread. 

When I placed my ordered. I told the gal taking my order that it was my first time at the place and I wanted to be sure the sandwiches came with lettuce and tomatoes? I was told YES by the gal at the register.  

The prices were extremely high as well.
