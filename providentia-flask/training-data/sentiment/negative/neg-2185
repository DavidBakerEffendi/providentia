Chapala's is hands down the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.  I still remember their commercials from the 80s "Chapala's, my dear..Chapala's", yet I've never been. Now I have, and if I could unvisit, I would.

1. Service: Our waitress was surly, and downright rude.  She did, however, keep the only palatable thing filled...our drinks.
2. Chips and salsa: The one thing you continue munching no matter how full you are. This was definitely not the case. Chips were ok, but the salsa was so salty that it was completely inedible.
3. Entrees: My friend had the fish tacos and said they were ok.  I had an easy combo platter...cheese enchilada and chile relleno. The enchilada was over soaked with sauce which turned the tortilla to glue and the cheese was cold. The relleno had it's entire seed core still inside which was not cool to bite into. We informed our waitress who simply brought us the bill and made no offer to take my uneaten food off of it.
