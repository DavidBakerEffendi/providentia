I wish I could give this a 0. My boyfriend and I went here a few months back and it was the day they were having fried chicken. As a chicken lover I decided to order it. I was not only disappointed, but disgusted. I eat out a lot, so I know good chicken when I see it and this was not it. The batter on the chicken was still not cooked through and neither was the chicken. When we told the server they asked if we would like to have it remade and I said no. We ended up only paying for the meal my boyfriend got, but even he did not enjoy his steak. I would not be upset if that was all, this place ended up giving me food poisoning from the two small bites of chicken I had. Save your money and visit a REAL steak house like Mastro's city hall, Flemings, or Steak 44, AND WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY AWAY FROM THE CHICKEN!
