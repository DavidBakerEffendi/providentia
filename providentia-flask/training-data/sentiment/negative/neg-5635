Decided to order here because it's location is very close to the house and I didn't feel like cooking and when I tell u that was a bad choice to make. We ordered the fish and chips, shrimp dinner and side salad. The fries were so soggy, and the fish and shrimp were not cooked all the way. It was warm on the outside and cold on the inside. This was by far the worst fish I ever tasted and the batter was so mushy and disgusting we had to throw the food away so we wouldn't get sick. The only good part was the salad but they forgot our dressing and a fork.
