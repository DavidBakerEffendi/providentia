Walked in and did not stay.  Very marginal sanitation score and every seat had torn leather.  I kept looking for a booth that had seats that were decent and not torn. There were NONE.  This place was just too gross to stay. The exterior is run down. The interior is worse. Could have had good food, but based on the appearances of everything else, I was not about to take a chance.  This is all too bad because I know this restaurant has been a Charlotte staple for a lot of decades.  The simple reality is that if the owners want to keep it open, they need to invest some money in some updates. And they need to get their sanitation score better.  Two thumbs DOWN.   Yuck.
