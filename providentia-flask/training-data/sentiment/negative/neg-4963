Absolutely the worst service i have gotten the 
past year or maybe in my life.

Ordered a cold milk tea, didn't know it was more expensive than the hot one. i asked if i could switch it to a hot one,and she refused. I understand that it was my fault not looking at the menu properly,but she gave me attitude afterwards and didn't even say thank you after i paid. 

I returned to the booth to grab a pair of chop sticks because i had some food to eat. She gave me the dirtiest look ever,and even after i left she kept starring at me. 

Will never go back to this place and i don't care how the food or drink taste like, you don't serve people like that.
