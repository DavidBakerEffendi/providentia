So I have been going here for years. We have other sushi places closer to us but drive 20 minutes because normally this is our favorite. But over the last few visits things have been getting worse and worse. The food itself is still good, the problem is the staff. We walk in and there are 2 large groups ahead of us and 1 small group. We visibility see open spots at the bar but have to wait to be seated. I hear one of the big groups talking to one of the staff members who is telling them it is going to be nearly impossible to seat them because 6 six people is too many to sit at the bar. They point out to the staff member that there is a whole row of empty tables that will work. The staff member tells them that they can sit there but will have to walk to an from the bar to get food because the owner refuses to turn that side of the conveyor belt on. They reach an agreement and get seated. Meanwhile more chair are opening and we still can't go to them (a total of 20 minutes) because no one is bothering to clean them off or check the names in the list. When we finally get seated our waiter takes our drink order, puts it down, and proceeds to disappear for the rest of our visit. The staff mostly stands around or talks with each other and had no sense of urgency when it came to taking care of us. No one ever checked in and we had to wave someone else down to get our check. He had to count 3 different times the number of plates we had, and then got someone else to come over and check his counting. 
I am hoping that the owner sees this, I hope they take note and open up the second side again. I hope they hear the service their staff is giving.
