Have been coming here for years. Good sushi at an affordable price but expect horrible service. Called in for take out and a new girl forgot to turn in my food order. I arrived half an hour after my call even though she told me it would only take 20 minutes and they didn't even start on my food yet. The staff makes me question whether or not I will be back.
