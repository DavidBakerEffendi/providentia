I FOUND A COCKROACH AT THE SALSA BAR!!! Do not eat here. They acted like it was fairly common to see a cockroach in their establishment. I had to wait for my refund because it was on a card and no one even went to the bar to replace the salsa or even clean the bug.... 

I normally don't review chains like this but I had to let my fellow yelpers to avoid this dirty place!
