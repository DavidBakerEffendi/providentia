I have eaten mexican food my whole life. I grew up and lived in los angeles my whole life. And i have to tell you I have NEVER not eaten what i was served. I have always wondered what a dead mule's anus tasted like,well i found out after taking just ONE bite from my carne asada quesadilla. It tasted HORRIBLE! I mean really who eats this garbage? This is the poorest quality mexican food i have ever tasted..it took 30 minutes for me to get rid of that rancid taste in my mouth...that was a waste money and quite possibly a threat to my health. I will also say i noticed the carving station where they chop up the meat is not sanitary,they are constantly pulling out different meats and commingling the bacteria and juices from all,not to mention the flavors from meats i may not prefer the taste of,and using the same knife to cut it...this place should be inspected by the health department asap.
