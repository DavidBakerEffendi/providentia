The service was so poor that I never even made it to the point of tasting the food. I stood in line behind a man for 15 minutes while nobody helped him at the register. There were 3 women behind the counter and nobody bothered to help the customers at the register. I didn't stay longer than 15 minutes to find out why they were so incompetent. Really sad that the service was so poor because I had heard great things about the food.
