The only good thing right here is the taste of the food is good. That's it.

There are several bad things you need to pay attention to:

1. Be attention to your bill. They may charge your disinfectant smell ice water as a coke.

2. Be attention to whether they have served you all the food you ordered. For example, they didn't  serve me the soup in the combo until I asked a waiter to do it.

3. Be attention if you are a uncc student and you want to get a uncc discount. This place is the only one that asks all the guests to provide the uncc id to get a discount. So you should be attention that if you want to get the discount, remember to ask all your friends to bring the uncc id with them.

Overall, if you can't live without curry, you have to come here because they have the best curry in the area. However, if you can live without curry, my suggestion is to avoid this place.
