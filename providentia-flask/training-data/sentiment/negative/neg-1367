I came here yesterday for lunch with one of my gfs.
I was really excited to try out this new hot spot with awesome reviews.

I was really bummed out with lunch yesterday and will not be coming back.

We ordered pad thai with chicken and singapore noodles with chicken. Both dishes were horrible. I'm a huge pad thai noodle fan and was not impressed at all. Both were lunch specials ranging around $7. On the other hand, my gf thought it was good.

Parking and seating wasn't a problem.
Our server which could be the manager/owner was nice but then forced the issue of us coming back tomorrow... which I told him I live very far and he insisted I still come back. Ummm no thanks.

I wouldn't recommend coming here and I won't be back. Such a bummer, I was hoping to find a new lunch spot.

Sorry Pan Asian... Next!
