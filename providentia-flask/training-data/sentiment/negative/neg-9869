I was treated to this place back in July of 2016. They put some kind of cleaner in our drinks. I don't know how else to write this, but they put some kind of kitchen cleaner in our drinks. The waitress didn't believe us and just laughed it off. We had an 90 year old man with us and when he kept telling her that you can smell the cleaner in the drinks, she kept telling him to just drink them and that we were imagining it. 

I was sick for 3 days. Everyone else was sick for a couple days more. Those that had a suspicious drink became ill in just hours and stayed ill. 

Two of us called the restaurant and were told a manager would call us back, they didn't call back. I wrote their corporate office and never got a reply back. When I called they connected me to someone that didn't even speak English and they hung up on me and I could hear laughing in the background. 

Something very odd is going on at this place. They act very suspicious and when cornered in questioning they will become even stranger. Everyone in the party that wanted some answers from the Claim Jumper have come to the same conclusion. There is something odd going on inside this restaurant. 

I should have wrote a review on it back in July but I figured someone in our party was going to sue them so I held off. 

This place may kill someone, or maybe it already has. Enter at your own risk.
