I pick up food orders from here all the time, and every time I ask for something extra light ranch or salsa this place demands that they charge extra. Normally I am picking up 6 to 7 item orders. They clearly got their money on a large order but apparently the walls will fall down if they give away a ranch or salsa. Places like this are the worse
