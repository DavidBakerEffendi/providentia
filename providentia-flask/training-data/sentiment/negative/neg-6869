When I pulled into the drive thru the worker asked if I would please wait, after waiting for 10 minutes I said hello into the speaker and they asked me to wait again. After five more minutes they finally came on the speaker. I ordered and then pulled forward to the window, where I sat for another 15 minutes waiting for my food. The two male workers inside were messing around and could clearly be heard saying 'Fuck'. I paid for my food, and then a few moments later the second worker came to the window asking me to pay again. The other customer behind me ended up backing out of the drive thru because this all took so long. The overall experience was terrible. I will drive out of my way just to go to a different location.
