Alright.  Ready for my two cents?  My client told me about this place not to long ago.  She knows how I am about pizza ;)) well anyways.  I came across a Groupon for it. I was ecstatic!!!!!!!! 
My boyfriend and I went for date night. Right when we walked in, we got sat down right away. BUT 15 minutes later,  our waiter was no where to be found nor knew who was our waiter. I had to ask who our waiter was. One, she didn't speak English nor I can comprehend. Two, she kept smiling at me when I was talking to her,  she didn't listen to what I say.  honestly, whenever I had a question or command something,  I had to ask TWICE!!! Smh. 
These couple came in 30 minutes after us, THEY GOT THEIR FOOD BEFORE US. I confronted the manager, he did not care, he said don't worry.  It'll come out.. wtf are you serious?  


And, Whatttt? No hot sauce or ranch? Yeah. I was bummed out.

Overall. Horrible customer service. But I love my pizza .
