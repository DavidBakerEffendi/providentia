Worst place ever....waited 5 minutes to be asked how many will be in our party to be seated.   Not because they were busy, but  all the staff were more interseted in standing around talking.  Then had to wait another 15-20 minutes to be seated when there were only 8 customers total.  Once we finally got seated, the wait staff took about 20 minutes to get our drink order and bring them out to us.  We left 45 minutes after arriving because our food order still had not even been taken.  So many other restaurants to choose from in the area.  Don't bother with this place unless you don't care if you are there for HOURS and enjoy crappy service.  Then they made us pay for our drinks......never will come back again!!
