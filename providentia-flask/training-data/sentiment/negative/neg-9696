I can't even begin to tell you how overpriced the wine is here. Last night we had a bottle Chappellet wine with our meal at an upscale Scottsdale restaurant. We paid 65 for it. Tonight we ate in downtown Chandler and they wanted 130 for the same exact bottle. My husband and I have had many red wines while visiting places from Baltimore to California. Never have I seen a more overpriced bottle of wine. This place needs to get over itself! Where do you think you are New York?
