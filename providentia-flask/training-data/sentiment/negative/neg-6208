Ok, this place sucked. Order a long island ice tea and she sends it out with lemonade mix instead of sweet and sour. And wanted to charge 11 bucks for it. The manager didn t come over when told DID nothing. We left without eating. Then down the street at Hooters find out there closing down. I understand why. I wouldn't hire the manager or the bartender, they'll put you out of bussiness.
