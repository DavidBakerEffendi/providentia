We went to have dinner last night as a family. We were told the wait was 25 minutes. It turned to be 45 minutes. We were then seated at a table and upon being seated told that there was no silverware. Not sure how a restaurant runs out of silverware on a Saturday night. We were then brought our appetizer about 30 minutes later and weren't given any plates or napkins with that. My husband had to get up and go look for plates so that we could enjoy our chicken wings after being there an hour and 15 minutes. Meanwhile our waitress still hadn't taken our order. 2 hours later we were provided our dinner of of prime rib, filet, shrimp, & ribs. Never once was there an apology for the service or lack thereof. We requested our bill and our food upon delivery at our table. Needless to say, are $100 to go dinner was not what we look for when going out. When families go out there looking for service and an atmosphere to enjoy. We won't go back. Management needs to be changed.
