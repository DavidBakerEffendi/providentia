Not sure ramen should cost this much after adding toppings. Some toppings were a bit overpriced, such as garlic, nori, corn & spinach. Pretty much end up with a $15-$20 bowl if you want to get full. I guess if you eat to just get satisfied by taste they are not bad. When I got my bowl with all the added toppings it looked the same size, slightly more than one without. So I wasn't too happy. Given they were busy, don't skimp me plz. I first tried to go on the grand opening and the wait was an hour. I didn't like that we couldn't get a to go order, forcing people to wait an hour in the Vegas heat wave. No waters offered to the patient guests. Not a good look at all. You might be packed out the door, but u must treat your loyal customers properly. Also a lot of pre bussing could've been done instead of having 3 staff members at the front door having you sign in yourself. 3 people up front and your making the guest sign them selves in while table need to be turned. Come on now, common sense. Training should've been done prior to grand opening, who's the front of house manager? Tsk*tsk*!
   I've had some other noodle spots like oodle noodle where all/most ingredients are made fresh and imported. The cost there is about $11-$12 lunch special with a yuzu soda (3 course with drink). I understand the noodles are not the same type. But as far as flavor and price there are a few others that top this spot hands down. I might give it another try but $20 for ramen after a bad first experience. Hmm, I wonder. Coin toss I guess. Till then 1 star, sorry.
