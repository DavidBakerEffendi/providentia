Worst dining experience we have ever had in this area. The guac we ordered tasted like it was prepared days in advance and kept in the fridge. When I told the waitress she toolkit back and showed the manager and they were both questioning its lack of freshness. The main dishes we ordered were waaaay to spicy, and we love spice. We will never return to this establishment unfortunately.
