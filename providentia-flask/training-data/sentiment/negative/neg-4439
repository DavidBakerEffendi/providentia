The food here is simply disgusting, there is no other way to describe it. I ordered food from UberEATS, not only did they decide to ignore half of my order, but the food that came was so horrible that it wasn't even edible. Everything tasted spoiled and I ended up throwing everything out. For the price they charge, I thought at least the food quality would be there, and that couldn't be further from the truth. Avoid this horrible restaurant like the plague!
