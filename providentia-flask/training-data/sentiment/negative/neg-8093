I will not be visiting La Piccola again. I hate writing this review and I really felt like not writing one at all. I feel like I really need to let this business know where they are falling short. I do want to give a very positive review of our waitress. She was in training, but she was attentive and was our only enjoyment of the night. 

The two glaring problems with La Piccola:

The food: did not taste fresh at all. It was something we all picked up on. My cous cous was overcooked and very bland. My chicken was seasoned well, but not cooked all the way and my asparagus was damn near raw. Let's just say I didn't finish my meal. I am only going to review my meal, but the others in our party were all disappointed. 

The owner Andy: is definitely not a good front of house. He really should manage in the back. We were treated poorly by the owner, who has a rude and had an arrogant way about him. I didn't touch my cous cous and Andy thought it was because my palate wasn't sophisticated enough. He didn't even think that maybe there was something wrong with it. I think Andy believes his restaurant is earth shattering here in the valley, but in reality it is just another unmemorable place under the sun.
