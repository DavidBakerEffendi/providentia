Today, I can't give any stars. My wife, daughter, and myself enter around 4 for an early dinner. The wife orders a house stromboli,i order the ruben, and my daughter gets a couple slices of cheese pizza. In addition, the wife and I get salads.

I like my salad first, like most people. Well, it came out with the meal. Now, my food is going to get cold waiting on me to scarf down a salad. This was not an issue.

The wife's stromboli was sitting in a pool of grease. So much it was inedible. My daughter has to wipe the grease off her pizza. My ruben had no dressing. Everyone makes mistakes. I look for our waitress. She is nowhere to be found. Mind you, we are the only table in the restaurant. I decide to go to the counter and service myself. She ignores us. I have to make several more attempts to get assistance, and she continues to ignore us. In between, she fills the ice machine.

I head to the counter to get my check, speak with a manager, and post my bill. I want nothing free, I give feedback, positive and negative. We can't improve if we don't know.  No manager, just some guy helping out. Convenient. The hispanics in the kitchen are laughing, probably at my expense. All he says is sorry. I expected nothing less. Now we have to find the waitress to get my bill. She won't even give it to me. She hands it to the guy and spend off. Now he can't run the register. He goes to find someone else. After an additional 5 minute wait, I can pay and leave...never to return.

So I had to post one star, but it was not deserved or earned.
