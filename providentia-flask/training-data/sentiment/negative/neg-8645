This buffet is still the worst of all of the stations buffet even though they re did it.  I even didn't  like the ham. I never eat ham that was bloody and taste less. How do you screw up something that all you have to do is cook it. I had pot stickers that weren't  to bad but there wasn't any sauce  to put on them. Country fried corn was horrible. All in all the food was bland  and tasteless. Go to Texas station if you want to go to a buffet near palace it isn't that far away from palace
