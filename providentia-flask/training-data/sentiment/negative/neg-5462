We had reservations for noon for a large group of 13.  They were not ready table want set up.  Service was slow despite them not being that busy.   Our drinks sat empty. Our food didn't come out till after 1.  I got the grilled fish tacos and they were dry.  It was a lunch we needed to get back to work.  I would not go back.
