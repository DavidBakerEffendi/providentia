I don't even want to leave one star! Wow I haven't been here in probably 7 years or so a few friends wanted seafood and I remember it being amazing! Wow was I wrong!! This place was so run down I was embarrassed! Our guests didn't even eat their food but they hate to complain so didn't even say a thing but being a good waitress she should have noticed when only one bite was touched they weren't happy. Appetizers sucked and were dry. Waitress didn't know a thing about the menu and was all over the place when asking questions. Lobster was chewy, steak was tough. I just cannot believe how much this place changed! Stay away if
