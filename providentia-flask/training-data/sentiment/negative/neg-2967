We waited for over an hour from when we sat down to when the first plate of food was put on the table!  We had to ask three times for silverware.  It took them 20 minutes to bring me the check so we could leave!!  We approached the manager and told her about our discontent and asked her why this had happened.  She gave us excuse after excuse about what was not going right at the restaurant.  She never once asked how she could rectify our situation.  We told her we would not be back and she watched us walk out the door!
