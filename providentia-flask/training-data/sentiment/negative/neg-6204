Well I spent my evening throwing up after I had dinner here. I went to get groceries & decided  to try their food; BAD MISTAKE!! The staff is rude and very unwelcoming. I'm new to the phx area so I came here relying on the Yelp reviews. 

The food tasted OLD and definitely NOT FRESH; I'm Indian & I think I can tell the difference between fresh and old frozen left overs you warm up. The cashier has no sense of customer service, he was trying to do 3 things at once, total fail! I asked for a pound of sweets and he pours in syrup and charges me extra for the "extra weight" !! This place is cheap and has horrible employees working there!! If I could I would give this place ZERO stars!!
