Have no any idea why people like this place and why people say that food is goof there !!!
First of all - the place is dirty - spoon was dirty when they give it to me, toilet is ugly dirty!!!!! Table is dirty !!
Soup is so so taste - totally does not worth the name of the best soups in toronto. 
Sandwish i also did not like and also felt very bad that evening ( vommiting) , maybe because of their food,  am not sure but i think yes!!
So to tell you the truth i was disappointed in food in abundance and also worried cause looks like i poisoned there. 
 do not recommend
