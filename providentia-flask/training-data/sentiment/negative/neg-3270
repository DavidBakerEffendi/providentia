if I could give a negative star this restaurant would have negative 5 stars. I like IHOP I usually find the service good and the food comforting.  This restaurant was horrible!!!!!  we showed up at 9 o'clock tonight and ask for a table. We had to wait more than 20 minutes to finally get seated. Our name was on the list and we were  supposed  to be first to be seated, but another family walked in and the person who was up front was going to seat them first.  If I  didn't speak up they would have sat before we did. So we finally got seated and then had to sit  for over 20 minutes  to get water. After 20 minutes I was fed up and I walked to the manager and told him that we have nobody helping us.  he came and got our drinks. He  took our order, but our food never came. What really annoyed me was that there were other waiters working on the table next to ours and two tables away and a waitress one table away who completely ignored our table. 25 minutes later we still did not have our food and the people who came in after us were eating theirs. I still did not know who our waiter or waitress was. Nobody came in to identify themselves and greet us like they normally do at other IHOPs. finally after waiting over an hour and still not having our food I went to talk to the manager but he was doing the cash register and so we just left. I have never been treated so horribly by anybody this restaurant does not have their act together the manager was nice but he does not have a staff that is people oriented. Would I go back here? that's really funny not on your life. I do want to mention that the woman's room was disgusting it was dirty and smelly and the trash was overflowing onto the floor. The restaurant was the same way when we showed up. There were five or six tables that had not been clean with dirty dishes on them.
