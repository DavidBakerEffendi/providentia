I wanted a non-fondant cake for my sons birthday so I went to Baker Wee for the convenience of it. I have to say this cake was nothing better than Costco's and for double the price. The frosting was way too sweet and the raspberry filling was not impressive. Most likely will not be buying cakes from here again. Should have gone to Costco.
