Your damn cashier at Drive Thru sounds so damn ghetto! Can you please train your workers to be proper?! Plus she took forever to just say hello and ask me what I wanted to order! No kind of "I'll be with you in one moment". All I got 5 min later was "Haylloooow! What do you want to order?!" WTF?! Slowest service ever! I was ready to drive through trees just to get out of the line! HORRIBLE SERVICE
