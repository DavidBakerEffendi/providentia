I went to mc Donalds today for lunch today, April 19, 2016 and the food I received was horrible. I ordered the buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich, and the bun was burnt, the lettuce was wilted and brown. I was so disappointed with attitude the management had how they treated me. If possible  please don't use this location, unless you enjoy bad customer service, food that appears to be old and cold and extremely long lines in both the drive thru and the walk up counter.
