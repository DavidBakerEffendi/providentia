I placed an online order that was to be ready at 6:10 I arrived at 6:03pm and paid for my order. While waiting I placed another order for fried mushrooms. It is now 6:52 and I was presented with the mushrooms but not my original order!! The server finally retrieved my food and what do you know, it's been sitting and is now cold. I asked to speak to the manager and his response was "oh I bagged this a long time ago" there are TWO workers doing the takeout window.. and they are blaming each other for my order not being ready... the manager says "I wish they would do away with the online ordering because it's not accurate" it's 2018!!!! How is your online ordering not accurate??? Not to mention it was clearly ready and just never brought up front. Ridiculous and I will never order here again.. going on 7pm and I'm waiting on  a FRESH order. Not to mention I've watched 2 other people leave and come back with messed up orders.. it's chicken and fries people.. oh and while waiting I got to witness a lovely screaming match between two servers in the back.. real professional
