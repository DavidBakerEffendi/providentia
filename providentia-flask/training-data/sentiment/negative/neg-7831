This is the very first review I am writing and I am doing so from my car. I placed a take out order for two philly cheese fries with extra onion and mushroom. I picked up my order and drove off to the movies. I get there and open the container. The first one was fine, the second has basically no cheese, one little sliver of onion and one tiny piece of mushroom. I just paid $16.00 for fries!!! and this is what I get? I call and am told I can return it now and wait for a replacement or I can return it after my movie and they would replace it then. I explain this is my dinner and ask if I am supposed to wait 2 1/2 hours for that and the "manager" tells me "Well I can't bring it to you" I inform her I will not be dining there again and she says "okay great! Have a good night" Horrible experience.
