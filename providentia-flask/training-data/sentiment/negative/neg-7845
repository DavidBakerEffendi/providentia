On our way to Cave Creek, decided to stop here and for once try a new place for breakfast. 
When we walked in, there were a lot of young children in the restaurant, and it was very loud although not too crowded.  Dirty floor, tables hadn't been bussed, and what's up with all of the dresses and headbands up front?
We were seated quickly, and were advised that the waitress would be around in a few seconds. Seconds turned in to 15 minutes to put in our drink order.
We ordered the Chicago omelette and the Breakfast Changa. The omelette was over cooked and hard and the Changa was undercooked, and the bacon was almost uncooked. We never saw the waitress after she dropped off our plates, and had to ask 2 people and wait 15 minutes for our check. Fast forward to that same evening...my stomach is a mess. 
This place has great potential, but until it realizes that potential, I won't be back.
