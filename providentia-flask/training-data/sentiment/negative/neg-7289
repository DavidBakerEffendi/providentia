Total disappointment! We came in hoping for a great breakfast in Phoenix and got a total disaster. We ordered our breakfast took the number just to find out that nobody took the number in the kitchen, 15 min later we were asking about our order and nobody new about it!! We were asked to show our receipt!!! a few minutes later our order was found packed in boxes to go and the waiter was trying to convince us to eat our breakfast in boxes in the restaurant. 
It's my first negative review in Yelp but I guess this is a part of the reason the app exist.
Customer service should be first, unfortunately we did not get a good service. 
We hope ncounter improve in that aspect.
