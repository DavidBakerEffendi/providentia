Horrible experience with a employee named oscar,Me and my boyfriend go here in this location a lot,most of the time we eat inside but sometimes we do drive thru,I saw this particular employee counting change with his gloves and he never change his glove after counting the change while handling food..He was literally putting the fries in small little tray then press it with his dirty gloves,I'm so disgusted so I confronted him told him he is not gonna touch my food and he said he change his gloves all the time.But he just change his glove after I confronted him.i mapping that the manager will take action regarding this issue.we want our food to be clean.
