Worst customer service i have ever got. When we seated ourselves it took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table and another 10 minutes for someone to take our order and the people in front of us came 10 minutes later and someone was taking there order already. By the time they took our order the people in front of us already got there food. By the time our food came they made a mistake we ordered a kids meal and asked for a fruit cup they gave us fries we also ordered a triple meat sandwich did not look like it was triple meat with a cucumber salad they gave us coleslaw we had to tell the server.
They didn't give me any utensils for my meal i had to ask. They really need to work on their speed of service and quality of service
