Has declined over the years. My last 4 visits have been below par. Slow service with countless mistakes. Quality of food has gone down dramatically. Shocked at how poorly maintained and dirty everything is: dishes, windows, floors covered in grime and a layer of grease. Granite counters are broken and cracked. Far from a fine dining experience. Too bad it can not be the place it was when it opened.
