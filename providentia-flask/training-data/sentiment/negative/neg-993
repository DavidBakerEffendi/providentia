After 2nd experience, not worth it.  1st delivery very quik!  Instead of ranch, they gave me Italian & no peppercini's as requested.  Delivery guy said tip wasn't included, but online receipt says yes, tho I tipped more anyway because he didn't have the right change.  
2nd time, I placed my order @ 5:20p, eta 6:15-25p & they didn't show up until 7:15p!  By then the chicken fingers, fries & fried zucchini were soggy.  They are less than 2miles from me btw.
