Wow............. I cannot believe that people even consider this place to hold events.  I was here for a baby shower and there was a first communion celebration going on  in an adjoining room. We shared the same buffet line! Classy. 

The food was bland.  Desserts inedible. But the worst part of all is the cleanliness.  It was so dusty and dingy.  The floors need a good scrubbing and the carpets need cleaned. You have to go down a flight of stairs to the bathrooms. Halfway down the steps, I had to hold my nose from the mildew smell.  I've been in port-o-johns that smelled better.
