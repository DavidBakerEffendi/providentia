This is the slowest service I have ever experienced. The drive thru line is a half an hour long even though there's only six cars. The line at the window is even worse, you have to wait an hour. After waiting an hour for my food, it ended up being cold. A fry was still partly frozen. If you do decide to go here...REMEMBER CASH, they do not accept any cards.
