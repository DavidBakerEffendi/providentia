Having just moved from Austin not too long ago, I was very much missing out on decent Tex/Mex in Pittsburgh. Mad Mex is... well its good, but its not even in the same genre. Lets just say, Chipotle was a welcome site - and that's hardly Mexican, either.

I was very excited to have this place open up in my neighborhood. Until I tried it.

Lets start with the good:
* Decent salsa
* Good guacamole (a pleasant surprise)
* Warm tortilla chips
* A nice clean, mildly-tacky-but-appropriately-so atmosphere

Now, the rest:
* Margaritas were TERRIBLE. I'm sorry, you can't charge me $10 for a margarita and use a MIX in it! Are you kidding? Simple recipe: Tequila, fresh lime juice, cointreau or Patron Citronge or Gran Marnier or Paulas Texas Orange. This is not hard to do right.
* Crispy shells everywhere on the menu.
* No breakfast tacos offered
* Veggie options were strange. Broccoli? Cauliflower? WHAT? Why not calabacitas? Sweet potato, grilled corn, rajas, nopales, caramelized onion, Mushrooms... Huitlacoche? So many better options than a salad bar shoulder shrug.
* Limited salsas. No mole or tomatillo.

So, basically, this place has potential - but its going to take a complete menu/recipe/bar revamp before I'll consider returning.
