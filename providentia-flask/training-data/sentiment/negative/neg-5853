I have been to this location twice and walked out cause no one would help me. I waited for 10 minutes no one helped me or even asked. I was trying to buy 6 subs I guess they don't need my business. Very poor management at this location. The one on hell and Tatum and Arrowhead Mall they actually care about the customers and the service. I wouldn't be surprised if this location doesn't make it. It's a shame cause the image of the company is positive except this location.
