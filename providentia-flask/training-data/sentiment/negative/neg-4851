We came here with friends after dinner to enjoy some games and drinks. I like the atmosphere. Laid back and chill. They have huge bean bags and couches. I was excited because they have games for grown ups but everything was either taken or broken :(. The dart board had no darts the connect four doesn't lock on the bottom so the pieces fall out and the Operation board is missing all the body parts. I recommend to to you Gold Spike that you fix the games so people can enjoy themselves.
