"Italian Kitchen"..... Um not quite! There are so many real Italian restaurants in the area that blow OG away! Everything is so bland, over-salted, and well.... Just not good! Prices seem so high for the quality of food. I'm always stuck going here for birthday dinners and no one ever seems so impressed! The wedding soup should be ashamed of itself!!!! Servers are always nice, but there are other local/ independent places that actually serve Italian food!
