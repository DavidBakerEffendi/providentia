Good luck with this place! If your planning on winning that won't happen. And forget them giving you free play that's a rare occasion. You can't stretch your money here. It has been quiet and dead in there the last three times I've been there (I'm a Vegas local) 
As far as the food places in there they are going down hill. Twin creeks use to be amazing and now the food is absolutely terrible. The last two times eating there the steaks had to go back as well as the creamed corn. My advice would be to stick with the rock shrimp and salad. 
The diner is hit or miss-they either get your order correct and the food comes out fast or they have you waiting over an hour for food and when it comes it's incorrect. (And if you plan on ordering a turkey burger for some reason it takes them the longest to make that) 
The Chinese food has also gone down hill it's not as good as it use to me. It's been tasteless. 
They really need to get there act together in this place as soon as possible. They need to treat the locals better! I sure hope for some positive changes to happen. There has to be a better way of running that casino.
The only positive in that is the nice pit bosses and the dealers.
If I was you I'd take your money else where and stay at a place where you feel welcomed and appreciated for your business.
