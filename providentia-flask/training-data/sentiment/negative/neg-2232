Waste of time and money. After arriving in town to visit family we headed to "table" for dinner. I ordered a burger medium well with pepper jack cheese. It arrived well done without cheese.  We had other issues with the 2 of the 4 meals ordered. The waitress was not listening and failed to correctly order one of the fish entrees. 12 bucks for an over cooked burger with a burned slice of cheese was a bit much. Sadly we ended up ordering pizza once we got back to the hotel.  Pretentious, eclectic and disjointed menu coupled with an overpriced and underwhelming food and service.  Enter at your own risk.....
