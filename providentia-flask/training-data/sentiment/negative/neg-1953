Overrated, poor service, overpriced and a zoo atmosphere. That was our experience when we brought out of town friends to Sushisamba for a dinner for four. Food was very good as you'd expect, but the experience makes this place a "keep off" location. I took the waiter aside to plead with him as a local to treat my out of town guests with more care and attention - he didn't bring one of the four drinks we ordered, forgot 2 of the appetizers we ordered, and didn't bring the bottled water we ordered twice...high expectations quickly became a disappointing experience. Will never return to what is nothing more than a tourist trap...
