Salsa had no heat, not even the hot one.   food was flavorless and over cooked.   Service was horrendous.   Nothing to say good things about.   Vegetable fajita had no seasoning and tasted canned and greasy.   Fish fajitas also lacked seasoning and fish was cut into small pieces and treated as though thawed.   Guacamole tasted store bought.  Would not recommend
