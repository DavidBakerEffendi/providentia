Our order was said to be here at 8:40 and showed up around 9:10 so half an hour late and I asked if it was hot she said "warm, I think".  I knew then I should have said take it back, but I'm a nice guy.  So I brought the food in to give it a try.  The Mushrooms my girl said were decent 7/10 on the lukewarm side.  Her famous philly cheesesteak was not that good 3/10.  I had the loaded fries and I imagine they would have been great 9 or 10 out of 10, but they were lukewarm.  I had the chicken bacon ranch toasted sub which was decent.  I imagine it would have been great 9 or 10 out of 10 had it not been lukewarm.  I'm not in the business of imagining to eat good food, I WANT to eat good food and being lukewarm to cold doesn't cut it.  It's no wonder this restaurant has 1.5 stars overall.  Never again.  Zio's is by far better and they deliver on time and are further away.
