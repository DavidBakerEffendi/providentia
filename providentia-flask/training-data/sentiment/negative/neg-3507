It's so bad it's insulting. Worst location ever. 

The things that went wrong could have been avoided so easily. A few more years and they might not be around. People have standards.

I am not bougie and I have very low expectations at any wing bar. All I ask for is a drink, basket of wings, napkins and maybe a plate for my bones. That's it. 

I came here on Tues Feb 27 @ 730pm for a birthday. There were 12 of us. 
-drinks took way too long, they didnt have clamato so I got the berry smash - it didnt have any berries in it like the picture had advertised.

-we had simple orders, some people got 2lbs and 2 flavours but when it came out they were mixed up. For example: person A: 2lbs honey garlic and garlic parm. Person B: dry cajun and sweet asian. When it came out honeygarlic was with dry cajun and sweet asian was with garlic parmesan.
- It also took the servers awhile to figure out what is what. Constantly leaving baskets at the end of our table, running back to the kitchen confused. They would tell us "this is sweet asian" when it wasn't and 1 girl said she read the slip wrong and it actually is what we ordered. All of this made our wings cold. Extremely unenjoyable experience. 

-in the end we were missing 1lb of hot and honey for the birthday boy which the server did eventually get for us. And we had 2lbs of wing flavours we did not order . We didnt want to eat it -they were cold.

-worst part was when 1lb of Sriracha wings came out but the server said "hot & honey" so the person who ordered hot &honey started eating it. Another girl came by with "hot & honey" We all looked puzzled . Then the first girl came back and told us "oh the first basket wasnt hot &honey but actually sriracha". So they switched it and handed it to the right person BUT the person with the first basket is now missing 2 wings because the server told the other person it was theirs so they ate it. 

-the mistaken 2lbs were on our bill as well as the Caesar i had wanted previously.
- best part was when the server dropped off the plates she only gave us 8plates,8napkins,4 wetnaps and 1 fork for 12 people.

-when we would tell her about the wing mix up or ask her for our drinks again, or more napkins she happily got what we asked for. She also had a nonchalant attitude and it really seemed like it didnt phase her as if this always happens and shes so used to it. She was nice but being nice doesn't mean you gave good service.
-she was also bartending so maybe she was distracted.
-I truly believe that the downfall of that night was caused by the entire functionality of that restaurant and it is not solely anyone's fault.

These are simple things that shouldn't have gone wrong. It's so embarrassing for the st.louis brand.

I don't know if the mix up was because of the kitchen if the server punching in orders wrong. Either way we weren't too fussy but just left with a sour taste. My friends and I will never be back.
