Went for a friend's birthday. Bought a bottle, to stand in the middle of a crowded room. Ended with a bill that was way too expensive compare to what we took (already expensive)! Really rude doormen. A group of 6 that will a)never come back b) that will not provide any positive feedback to any of our friends.
