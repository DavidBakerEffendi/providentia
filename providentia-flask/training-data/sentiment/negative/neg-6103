We went today for lunch and discovered they recently (8/4/16) received a "B" grade after their health inspection which immediately makes me not want to eat there. After looking up their inspection to see what the violations were I find that a lot of them are repeat violations which means I will not be a repeat customer! Sorry Park 51 Cafe but you need to clean it up!
