Pizza Pan isn't good, they have a BOGO gimmick which draws people to them. So yes this place is great for portions but not so great for taste.

It's really below basic pizza that you could make yourself, you aren't getting anything special here. The reason I dislike it so much is I've had it so many times to tell you that it's just below average. They somehow by the grace of God landed a contract with the Cleveland Indians to serve their pizza, why I don't know? But so many places are better than this chain that you might as well cook your own pizza up and save a headache.

Ask yourself this, how bad does ones food have to be to offer free food since its opening and still have chains close down?
