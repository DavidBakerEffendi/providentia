For seafood there is a lot to be desired! This place is all about the ambiance only if you survive the walk down the 120 degree cedar staircase. 

First, if one calls for reservations and one specifies that they have more than one child in the group one would that the first thing out of the hostesses mouth would be a polite warning about the non-kid friendly atmosphere solely for the discretion of the reserver. But NNNOOOOOO way...this  greedy establishment wants any dollar they can get since the quality is not worthy. 

No high chairs, no kids cups, nothing in plastic, or paper to go bowls, no kids menus. NADA!

Then comes the seafood and steaks. Seafood was so bland it might have just crawled out of the ocean and plopped itself on the frying pan. Sad indeed for a seafood restaurant that should be better than the rest.  

The filet was ordered medium but cooked all the way through since the chef opted to butterfly it to save time in hopes of rushing to the next customer and the pressing it to the grill ensured that there was no juices remaining and the char from the grill was the only flavor disguised as steak rub. 

My recommendation...dead lobster for seafood and outback for steak and you would be a happier customer than of you dined at this anti-child establishment.
