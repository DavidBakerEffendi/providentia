The crab rangoon is the best I have had because I don't like onion and this one is without. I ordered online and an hour and a half later I called to check where the order was. A very nice lady told me that it had just went out for delivery and if I hadn't gotten it within 10 minutes to please call back. 30 minutes later... nothing. I called and a man tells me that hey never received my order but I was very close and they could have it to me in 10 minutes if I still wanted it. I'm not sure how he knew I was close because I hadn't told him my address, only my name to find the order (which they never got). It seems they had gotten the order and misplaced it, which is fine if they would have just admitted their mistake. He offered a free Thai iced tea for the trouble. I clarified my order twice with him to not have onions... it showed up with massive chunks of onion, over 2 1/2 hours late, and full price. I am incredibly disappointed & don't believe I will be dining here again.
