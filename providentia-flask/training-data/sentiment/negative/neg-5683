I used to enjoy coming to this location. I think they must have changed management. I only visit about once every 2-3 months for staff meeting food. The energy is low with the employees. The manager has an apparent  sour attitude. I seen her and another employee giving each other a look while serving a customer that may have been a little indecisive. It was very unprofessional. The other employee was not happy to be there herself. There is a few employees that are wonderful and they would be the only reason I would return.
