I used to order here all the time with my mom & sister & it was great. 2 years later not so much. I had a big order, my girlfriend & I were having a movie day, & they messed everything up. I called & the lady was rude as hell, told me my delivery time was 45 minutes. An hour and a half go by so I called back to ask where the food was & it didn't sound like she was paying attention. I told her my address & she said "ok" & after a few seconds of silence I said uhh yeah can you tell me where it is & she said "ok" after a few times repeating this conversation I started getting upset then she finally told me that it'd be 20 more minutes because they were "10 minutes behind" so the guy finally gets here after another 45 minutes & the fries were soggy, sandwich bread was burnt, soggy, & cold. Sandwich meat was full of fat so I couldn't even eat it. Mozzarella sticks were all fried & stuck together, & the garlic knots were dry & had a burnt taste to them. Last time I'm ordering from here.
