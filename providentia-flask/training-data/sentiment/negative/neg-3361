Arrived and sat at the bar, asked the bar tender who was more focused on the game than the service 3 times for water with lemon, finally with our appetizers we got water with no lemon. The appetizer wasn't right, the kitchen didn't have half the ingredients. They did give us the appetizers for free being that they are wrong. My girlfriend and I continued to ask for water refills, and not receiving them. We normally sit at the bar cause you receive better service but this was far from the case, after having to continuously ask for water refills my girlfriend was very upset, having worked in the industry for many years she knows this is rule one, so we left with no tip given and my girlfriend who had eaten there many times before, stating that she'll never return. I'm not returning due to the bad food and horrible service.
