I called for a reservation and the hostess said there were two tables open. I told her I would be there in 15 minutes but she would not reserve the table. When I arrived 5 tables were empty. I was then told it would be a 30 minutes wait. They then said they only take 15% reservations & 85% for walk ins. Although the food is great it's not great enough to deal with their arcane reservation/walk in policy.
