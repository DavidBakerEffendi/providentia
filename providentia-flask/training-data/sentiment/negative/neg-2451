What a waste of an evening. Good thing I ate at Postinos beforehand. Not that the food is any good at Dierks, actually probably just average bar food, but I have no idea as they stop serving food at 9pm on weekends. Wtf? All so they can take hooker looking waitresses around for 'bottle service'.
Now just that would have been more tolerable seeing as they do actually play country music, which some country bars do go away from later in the evening. But they took all the chairs and tables away so there is no where to sit unless you overpay for a booth on the outskirts.
Definitely won't be back and don't waste your time going as there are so many better places to hang out in Scottsdale. What a disappointment coming from My wife's favorite country artist. He could do so much better
