Would have been a cool bar but.... I went to the gold spike with coworkers on a business trip.  I was allowed to enter and they checked my bag on the way in.  After I was there for 2 hours I was approached by security and they told me I need to leave because of my bag.  I told the security employee, who was just doing his job, that he checked me on the way in and he can check me on the way out.  He told me that he was " being nice" to leave me into this regal establishment.

Really, "Being nice" ? Such a cheese ball line, and also it was insulting and  short of being an all out accusation.  Business owners like these are childish who unprofessional.  I hope the real owner of this company realizes what ammeter novices the  have working for them.

I arrived with 14 people, we left because the management harassed me. What kind of businesses owner kicks someone out due to being inside an establishment that allowed them to enter?
