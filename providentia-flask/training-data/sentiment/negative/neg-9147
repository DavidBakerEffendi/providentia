Let me start by saying that my co-worker and I went in last week and had a different server.   Young kid, probably out of college and although he was a little slow getting started, he made up for it and provided good service.   With a little more time and training, he could be excellent.  We did notice that the dining area consisted of me, my co-worker and another patron sitting at another table yet we sat next to a dirty table for over half our meal.  It took four people and numerous trips to clear a four person table.  Not the most horrible thing in the world but still, not very professional. 

Then there was today.   Fail.  Royally. 

We went back today.  How was our meal?   I wouldn't know since it was over before it began.  Last week and again this week, no hostess to greet you at the door so you're standing around looking like you're waiting for the 3:45pm bus to Nowheresville.  She finally shows up like she just came back from cheerleading practice   and seats us in the dining room.  There is no one else in there and there are two tables outside being served (total of 4 people outside).  A gentleman joins the dining area about 5-7 minutes after we arrive and he tells the hostess that he would like some ice water and she runs and fetches it for him.  Ummmm, it's hot outside...I sure would like a drink of something....Where's our waiter?  Then she winds up taking his order.  Hello?  Ma'am?  Bueller?  Bueller?  Anyone?!?!?!?  So he's got a beverage and his order placed and we don't have anything??!?  Two more minutes of waiting and it was over.  We left and I looked right in the face of the guy at the register who said absolutely nothing as we passed.  I wonder how long it took for anyone to even realize that we were gone.  My friend and I walked right over to Dickey's next door who must have overheard our conversation about your place because guess she gave us our beverages on the house.
