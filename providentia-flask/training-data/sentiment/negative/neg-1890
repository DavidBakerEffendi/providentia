Sigh. I had such high hopes. Seeing a touch of home (L.A.) being constructed brought gastronomic comfort to my homesick heart. Sadly, this Mimi's is only similar in name and branding. 

Because hope does spring eternal, we've given this location more "second chances" than Hollywood has given Charlie Sheen. 

Simply put: The service is horrendous. Everytime. The food takes forever and is often delivered cold or all together wrong. The muffins have been this location's only saving grace; that said, rather than deal w/this red-headed stepchild of the Mimi's I know and love, I found the recipes online and make the muffins myself.
