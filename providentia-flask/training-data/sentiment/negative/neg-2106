Every time I grab a pizza from this location (because it is so close to my home), the service is very poor.  The last time I ordered here one manager lady was eating and must have been on a break, and only one other girl was making the food and cashiering.  It took five minutes after being seen for me to be talked to.  I ordered wings and barely any mild sauce covered them. When I asked the girl to put more on, she rolled her eyes and went in the back. This was right after she handled my money! No hand washing occured.  Today I went in to get a pizza and the same girl was handling money and going to the back to make food. Time to call the health dept...
