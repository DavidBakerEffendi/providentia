Absolutely terrible.  I went here with my daughter to eat lunch. They didnt offer any luch specials. The lunch specials ended at 3pm and we were there at 2pm. Then we tried to use there Yelp discount coupon and the lady was rude stating its there address but not there coupon. She said she was calling yelp to fix the issue. We asked her if she was going to honor the voupon and she said no again. I guess now I know why there was nobody in there restaurant.  Maybe the blonde lady working there should take the blue streak out of her hair and become more professional.  She was rude and deserved to be smacked. The owner should shut his doors and hire people with common courtesy.  I will eat Little Caesars before this can get my money
