Service was exceedingly slow (more than twenty minutes between servings) and quality was lacking.

There were few fresh offerings at the salad bar and we were presented with the wrong bill twice.

After reviewing what was supposed our bill, the math was flawed but we paid the nominal difference without  complaint just so we could leave.
