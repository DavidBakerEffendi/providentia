I was pretty disappointed today when I ordered my food online and selected rapid pickup. I arrived and grabbed my bag (obviously I know now I should've checked my order before leaving). 
I ordered a group size chicken and rice. And a turkey on wheat sandwich. Well I got home and I was given chicken noodle soup. Which is fine BUT literally all I had was broth. There was no way to share it with "4 servings" because it had a couple of noodles and chicken in it. It was literally all broth. Then my sandwich had maybe two pieces of turkey on it. It was just thrown on the bread not even spread out. Pretty disappointed. It cost me $24! Plus time and gas to go grab lunch bc they do not deliver in mountains edge. I called and the refunded me but still. For the price you pay this is horrible. Will not be going there again.
