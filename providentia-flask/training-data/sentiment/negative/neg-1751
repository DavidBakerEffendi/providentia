AWEFUL.. We love buffets and we are not big in fancy restaurants but this place is just horrible ... there were FLIES in some areas of the food section ... food selection was sub-par ... the only decent thing was their hibachi which was cook in front of you and you know it is made fresh ... NOT worth the money and trip!
