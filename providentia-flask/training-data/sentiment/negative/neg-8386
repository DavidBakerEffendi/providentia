Alright, folks, listen up. I wouldn't do this unless it were really necessary but there's just no avoiding it. This place SUCKS. The employees completely lack any professionalism or customer service ability. They are clearly short handed and should try borrowing some trained staff from other locations to teach these new ones, who lack not only in the job itself, but in the area of customer service. People on the drive-thru line were BACKING OUT today because the wait was SO long. I did the same and went inside, where NOT ONE PERSON greeted me for at least 10 minutes. I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought there must be some invisible barrier between me and them because it was like I wasn't even there. When I pointed this out to the employee, he actually said, "What are you talking about? We greet every person who walks in here." First, are you calling me a liar? Second, that is NO WAY to handle a service complaint. How about an "I'm sorry for your long wait. Thanks so much for choosing Tropical Smoothie. What can I get you?" That employee should be FIRED. 

I left my name and number with the manager, who wasn't extremely good at placating me or making the situation any better. Instead, he kept looking over at his employees asking them, "Where are you guys at?!? What are you doing?" instead of jumping in and helping them out. 

I really hope the owner or area manager contact me because these issues need to be resolved. You are not in an area where poor customer service flies. This needs to be rectified and fast. Or this area will speak and you'll be outta here.
