What a terrible way to start the morning! This was our first time at and Einstein Bagel and our order was not a single bagel order either. We ordered a dozen and all we got was attitude! We even got robbed out of a bagel we wanted just because the guys behind the line didn't have all their bagels in order!!! :( The lady taking our order didn't even ask if we wanted to have all our bagels sliced she asked "if we wanted anything done to them?" Which we thought meant toasted or not? After all it was our FIRST TIME!  We also didn't realize they were not sliced so hence, NEVER ASSUME clients know how your business runs! Work as a team don't snap at each other!
