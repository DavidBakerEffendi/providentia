Disgusting!!! Horrible sewer smell as soon as you enter the restaurant. 
Do not come here do not schedule a birthday party for one of your kids at this location. Absolutely disgusting the carpet was filthy and all stained up and the tile floor is just as bad. Men's restroom smells of urine. I did not have anything to eat because I did not want to get food poisoning. The smell is so strong that you cannot smell the pizza baking.  We came here for a birthday party for one of my sons friends. The kids seem to be oblivious to the smell they are happy eating pizza and playing games but it is very uncomfortable being here as an adult. If I planned a peter piper birthday party for one of my children it would not be at this location (43rd Ave & Glendale).
