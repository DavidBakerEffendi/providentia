so i took my mom here on sunday before a concert that was taking place at 3pm at the Gila River Arena next door. When we got to the restaurant it was 1:38pm. I asked the hostess how long the wait for 2 people would be, she told me "10-15 minutes but should be shorter than that". So i put my name in and sat down to wait. I get it the place was busy but the table turn around seemed pretty quick so i wasn't worried. Then at around 2:05 i went up to the hostess and asked her about how much longer. the list that i was on wasn't even the list they were working off of at that point. She tells me it shouldn't be that much longer. I then asked her why she told me 10-15 minutes when it was already close to 30 minutes, she snapped at me and yelled "it's not an exact time i told you it may be around that time." to which i stepped back and said, don't yell at me, i just don't understand why you would say a lower time instead of estimating over, especially since you added in the 'should be shorter' phrasing. she then yelled at me again telling me to just 'wait or leave'. I then asked another hostess to speak to a manager. she told me she'd get me one, but never did. I saw a woman who i believed to be the manager and asked her if she was, she replied yes. I told her that i was sorry because i knew it was busy, and recanted what the hostess said. I told her i understood that it was busy, but rudeness like that was unacceptable. She told me she would talk to her. If she did i do not know. 
when we finally got seated our server was awesome! she really did a great job. However the rolls that they brought to the table weren't even cooked....pretty much warmed raw dough the food took 25 minutes to come out. All and all HORRIBLE experience, but then again when the first employee you deal with (the hostess wearing a beanie) has a major attitude and disdain to all humans it kind of lets you know what you're in for.
