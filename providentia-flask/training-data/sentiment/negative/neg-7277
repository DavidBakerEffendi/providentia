Who Manages this place? 

Service
Bad. My server was nice tried and checked on us multiple times excellent. But front gatekeeper Isabel was irritating especially as she asked us if we were military for a discount and being Toby Keith would figure he had a good support of military. We said yes as I am in Officer Candidate School, my friends both with multiple deployments in Army and other was marines but Isabel in a rude manner said well your not active. Which was infuriating.

Food and drinks
Food chicken fajitas were OK but still was hungry after. I ordered a whiskey mule but she said that they are suppose to carry ginger beer and was going to check. They are suppose to carry it but bartender never has seen it. I asked for ginger ale it's the same but there ale isn't ale as its made with sprite and some other and not the best. I ended up drinking water after the running around to check for it, I had finished my food
