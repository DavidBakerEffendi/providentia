Worst customer service ever called to ask if he could deliver to our hotel and he said no that if we wanted delivery we would have to meet him at the gas station by our hotel. I told him we would tell our gate security to let him in since the previous night we had delivery as well and there was no issue.he when on interrupting me and was extremely rude and before I was even able to let him know we will pick up he hanged up. We called again and he hanged up on us again. I will never try this place and I will be telling everyone I know of how bad of service you get here.
