Don't do it is all I can say, the high ratings are from people who have no clue about good Chinese food. Someone said Panda is better and they are right. My husband got curry chicken that was mushy and I got the pork with string beans and black beans and it was very salty. Service is good but the food is not good. Will not go back.
