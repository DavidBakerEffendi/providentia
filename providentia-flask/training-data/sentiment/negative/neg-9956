The cashier was nice but the service was slow. There was only one lady ahead of us, we waited like  10 minutes to get served. After we ordered, it took 15 minutes to make us 2 bowls. SUPER STINGY ON THE LETTUCE, BACON, AND CHEESE (i paid extra for). The counter was kinda messy and lacking fresh ingredients. The girl put little ripped pieces of cucumbers instead of getting some new ones. Ordered a large oreo shake, and was given a small. Honestly too frustrated to complain so I didnt bother. Never coming back to this location again, the HWY27 & Finch location is who you guys should be mirroring.
