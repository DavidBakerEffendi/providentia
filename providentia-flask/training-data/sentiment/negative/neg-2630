Try serving this food to a Jewish person and watch them laugh at you and throw it in the trash. This "Jewish deli" food is awful. Their house made chicken soup tastes like it came straight out of a can and youre quick to find out why. Here's a newsflash, when you make soup with canned chicken you've already failed. Gross. The "I Love New York" sandwich should be renamed "I've Never Been To New York and Have No Idea What This Should Taste Like". It was a hot, greasy mess. The "house made rye" was tasty but that's about it. I asked them what kind of meat they used, house made, Boars Head,etc, the kid tells me it's Sysco. Not appetizing that it's basically cheap industrialized lunch meat.  Listen people if you want to eat a real NY deli sandwich do not eat in this sad sham of a deli, go to Chompies or Miracle Mile and eat real quality deli food for the same price. Canned chicken in the chicken noodle soup?  That's just shameful. $11 wasted.
