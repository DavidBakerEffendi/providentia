Dissappointing.  When I ate there,  I decided to order Banh Xeo,  and my friend ordered Pho. First off the Banh Xeo was undercooked, and was rather tasteless, and was plated horribly. The Pho was bland and the beef almost tasted like it was going bad. The service was sad as it was only one person serving at the time. 

Not recommended for those Vietnamese people.
