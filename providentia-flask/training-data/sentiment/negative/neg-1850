This was definitely the WORST AYCE sushi experience I've ever had. Most of the reviews seemed decent, which is why I thought I'd give it a shot.

As soon as I walked in, it didn't look that great; we were seated near the window. The server asked if we wanted anything to drink, I ordered a Sprite. - Usually soft drinks are either bottomless or on the menu. - This can cost $1.75 and isn't refillable.

So, we ordered our Salmon Sashimi and they were cut into pieces to small, it was barely an inch by an inch. I've never seen salmon sashimi cut so small! We also ordered a lot of the sushi dishes, and the plates were not washed. My friend noticed some weird residue on the plates, and was disgusted.

We also tried the deep fried shrimp, that wasn't bad. Diced beef with garlic was perfect, unfortunately the service took forever, in an EMPTY restaurant. Just asking for water took over half an hour.

Just as we thought things would turn around, we ordered dessert and we were told only 2 of the 7 things on the dessert menu still exist. They should be taken OFF the menu if they aren't served anymore.

The bill took more than 20 minutes to come and we finally paid. If you want an amazing AYCE experience, make the drive to Markham/Richmond Hill.
