Brought a big party from work because I had been once before and had decent katsu. Ended up being really embarrassing for me. Among the six or seven dishes, we had food that was soggy, burnt, cold, room temperature, dry, old, sour, unseasoned...just the most dreadful assortment of food I had ever seen. Absolutely shockingly bad. The pork needed a health inspection. It might have been in the slow cooker for several days. I'm not joking. We threw all da kine in da rubbish bin. Not ono.
