This place was filthy. Girl behind the counter asked me 4 times what my order was after already putting it in. Someone told her that the trash can was full and she said "OK."  No one clearing tables, no one cleaning the trash, the food came out wrong. Just a miserable experience. And it wasn't busy, so no excuse.

I've only ever been to their other location, I'll never come back to this one. Can you imagine what the kitchen looks like if they can't wipe tables?
