I was in Vegas at Treasure Island with my wife, son and mother in law.  We ate one night at the Buffet at TI as part of our "resort fee" gave us two for one coupons to this $34 buffet.  We were all less than impressed.  The  "Baron of Beef" was so tough I couldn't eat it, the prime rib was super chewy, there was no seafood of any kind, and most of the other things lacked flavor.  The creme brulee was very good but that was about it.  I feel like eating at a Hometown Buffet would have been a better choice compared to this overpriced place.  Next time I'll go to the Rio for a similarly priced but WAY better buffet.
