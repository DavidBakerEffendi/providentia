Paradise Bakery in Terminal 4 C concourse is. The worst. I'm a big fan of Paradise, but this location is terrible. There's a line out the door and most of the employees are standing around. The manager on duty at 6pm on a Tuesday evening is rude and threw her employee under the bus, "she's new" instead of taking responsibility for being out of ingredients. I fly out of Skyharbor every week and I won't be to this location again.
