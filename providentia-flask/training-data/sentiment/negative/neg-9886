3am'ish, nobody to seat us. A few more minutes we are still standing at the wait to be seated sign. Still time passes. Our friend waves down a server, he then points to a just bussed table that has not been reset. It shall remain that way as I still have a fresh set of utensils from the last table. We are seated for nearly 15min until we receive menus. No drink orders taken. More time passes, then more time. Then more. Then our friend gets up walks to the service counter and flags the guy down to take our order. Waters & food, plus an apology saying it is someone else's section... where is the manager to coordinate the floor? Then we wait and wait and wait. Waters come 10 minutes later than the food comes all at once. Typical bar fare finger food. Burger fries quesadillas etc. Nothing to rave about, but the quacamole extra was spoiled. Chef argued with me. He claimed it was a fresh premade bag that was dated and he just opened. Spoiled tastes as spoiled will taste. Here is the end of the argument, I tasted it before he. He deemed it good before I did without a lick to his lips. Apparently his attitude is that labels on boxes and premade product stays good until opened without any check prior to serving it to guests. Then after this situation of telling me I was wrong he throws up a fresh avocado and says he will make the same batch fresh. Indeed fresh and a completely different product, but I could have done without the throwing it in my face attitude. The server pulled no strings nor did anything to placate the situation, basically we were soiled with sporadic and occasional service and a chef who could only read labels and was at best a by the numbers cook who was in dire need of supervision along w his front of the house cohorts.
