Shocked by the rave reviews here! Yelp emailed me about this place a few months back and today we were in the area and stopped for lunch. Service was incredibly slow at 1:30 on a Wednesday for three people... Sandwiches had no flavor, bread was stale, and lunch meat tasted like the cheap stuff grocery stores sell in Tupperware. All three of us agreed we'd never go back.
