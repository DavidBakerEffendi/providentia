First things first.......the ENTIRE staff here are not friendly and do not acknowledge their customers.  You wait for a seat at the sushi bar by signing your name in a notebook at the door, which means no person greets you.  The food is below average and extremely unappetizing in view.  Very limited selections and tons of the same stuff comes around and around.  The prices are low and if you like sub par sushi, it is better than mass produced sushi at the grocery store.  In all fairness, the 3 servers were handling a full restaurant.  I may try again as it is cheap and two items I had were ok, but I would not venture too far on the menu.
