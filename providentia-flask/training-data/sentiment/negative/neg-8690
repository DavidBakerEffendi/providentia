If I could give this 0 stars I would. I have been here a few times and have enjoyed the experience. However, today I had to wait for over an hour and a half for my food. Not only that, but they also ran out chicken. They were also down a cook which I understand, but they did not tell us that before sitting us. We overheard it from the table behind us. It would have been courteous to mention it before so we could know that we would wait a while or even go someplace else. We received our food which  some of the plates were cold. After all of this we received the bill and there was no discount for the wait or food being cold (which was mentioned). We asked the waitress (she was very nice!) if we could get a discount and she said that she had asked her manager before bringing the check to us. She then said she would go and ask again, which then the manager gave us the discount. This is where I thought it was ridiculous! The manager knew we had waited so long because he had come over a few times apologizing for the wait. I will not be coming here again and recommend to spend your money elsewhere!
