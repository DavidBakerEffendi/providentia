Great pizza but the service was awful.I understand it was busy but a simple" hi sorry we are busy we will be with as soon as we can" would have sufficed!I watched 2 tables get up and leave due to being ignored.Had I not promised my little girl metro pizza we would of done the same.Being busy doesn't excuse poor customer service.
