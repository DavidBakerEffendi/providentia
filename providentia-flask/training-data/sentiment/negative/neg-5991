I went to 6th Street Pub Saturday morning for brunch. I was really excited to see they offered brunch and wanted to try it out. I didn't realize they had gotten a new owner which is probably why my experience was DRASTICALLY different than the previous time I was there.
The restaurant had 3 Tables with us being the 3rd. It took 30 Minutes to get my cup of cold coffee. It took another 30 minutes for my food which was missing half the ingredients. When the ingredients were added they were raw and just thrown together. 
The Server was trying his best and I could tell that he cared. He was in the KITCHEN trying to TEACH the cook how to make the orders.. Here is my beef. THE OWNER WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME. 

Instead of helping run food or make coffee - basically help his staff support his customers in his restaurant; he was at the bar chatting to a friend and just staring at this server. 

If the owner doesn't give a crap about the very little customers he gets I don't give a heck about ever going there again.
