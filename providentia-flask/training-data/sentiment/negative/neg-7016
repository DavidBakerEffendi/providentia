I am actually sitting, well trying to sit, after paying for the buffet here. Mariana the hostess is running some sort of scam. Refused to allow our party of 8 even though we were more than happy to pay the mandatory 18% tip (for what I do not know). After we were broken up into 3 and 5 the 5 of us had to wait and it was suggested we break down into a 2 and 3 to get seated. Grudgingly Mariana allowed us to sit as 5. 

For the food - average at best. Meat selections were overloaded with sauce and dry. Pasta selections were overloaded with sauce. Stayed away from the shrimp (looked loaded with iodine) and crab. The pizza was the only good item. 

The desserts were generally tasteless. I tried almost all of them as the 4 people at my table each got an assortment. 

Odd thing about seating.... as we were leaving Mariana was happy to seat a group of 10 at a table... she seemed to know them well. 

Generally I avoid LV buffets for all of the above reasons. There are plenty of dining options that are a lot better and more cost effective.

Zero stars if possible.
