This place will ruin your day if you use the drive thru. You would think they'd have it figured it by now with all these negative reviews but sure enough nothing has changed. Management is a joke. Stuck in the drive thru for two smoothies for almost half an hour and my smoothies were halfway melted because they put way too much ice. Never coming back here or probably any other tropical smoothie again. Sorry guys I gave you enough chances.
