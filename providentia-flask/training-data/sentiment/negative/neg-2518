Let's start with the price gauging... Sunday before President's Day is deserving of $40 for breakfast! To add insult to injury, they don't tell you that you have to get your own drinks so I added a $10.00 tip to the tab. Again this was breakfast at 9:00 in the morning, the scrambled eggs were tastless, the bacon undercooked and I had to go to each designated country before stumbling on hash browns. Since I do not posess the skills to carry multiple things at once, I gathered my breakfast items then set out on the long journey to the very back of the restaurant to search out coffee. First urn bone dry, success on second urn. Grab some oj and head back to a plate of tepid food. So coffee is hot, but food is not. I feel if I did the reverse then I would have tepus coffee. Tried a plate of crunchy melon, it is Feb granted, but someone has to know as they cut it up that it just sucks. Not sure if I will stay at the Mirage again. Use to be one of my favorites, but the nickle and diming is just an insult!
