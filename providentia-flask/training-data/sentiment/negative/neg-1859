I used to like subway, until today. I had a turkey Ruben that was tasteless and horrible. I felt sorry for the poor turkey that gave it's life for that sandwich. The sauerkraut was bland and the usually tangy dressing had no flavor. It was one of the worst things I ever tried to eat. Both my kid and I ended up throwing over half of our meal away. Yes, it was so bad I didn't even give it to the dogs.
