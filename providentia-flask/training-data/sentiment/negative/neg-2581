EDIT - I am updating a 5 star review from a year ago to a 1 star?? HOW terrible!!!  My 5 star remains below...

It is with a heavy heart I write this review.  I never understood why this restaurant got such low ratings until lately.  I cannot keep my mouth shut any longer and will no longer consider myself a regular.  Today we arrived and noticed the restaurant dirty.  And they no longer had sweetener other than sugar (asked for Splenda).  When asked we were told "the economy is bad."  OK no biggie.  So order: biscuits and gravy, eggs over hard and crispy bacon.  Biscuits are like dry discks and WHAT is in the gravy?  Mushrooms or sausage?  So rubbery I dont know.  Eggs are runny and bacon is just fat.  Sent it back.  Comes back the bacon has OBVIOUSLY been microwaved to sawdust and the eggs are FRIED to a CRISP!  I was shocked.  It was repulsive.  I kid you not, I fed it to my dogs who were out in the car and they werent not even thrilled to have bacon!  The waitress even told us when I mentioned the bacon that the "quality has gone down."  UMMM OK!  Kicker - we were charged for it.  So long Egg & I.
