I really hate writing a bad review, but im going to.life is a learning lesson and this is how buisnesses get better, the waitress was very nice, there was nobody in there just  my wife and I, we ordered the appetizer first it was shrimp and soup together with onions in some sort of butter sauce, very bland only 6 shrimp and they were small.terrible appetizer...forgot what it was called??? Then I ordered the chicken parmasian it was better but not much the chicken was overcooked and not fresh, my vegtables tasted like they were out of a can, I will never go back to this place again and I seriously doubt they will be around very long, gordon ramsey would have field day in this place!!!dont go this place sucks!!!!
