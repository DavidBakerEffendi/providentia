Ok where can I start. I've been craving this place for months and finally decided to order some. So I called and placed the order. Told the lady exactly what I needed and that I had a free delivery coupon,cool everything was smooth.45 mins later the delivery guy arrives pizza and wing time excited. Me and my family sit down and open everything to start serving and we realize that we got the bone-in wings and I had told them no bone. I was like ok let me call them back at this time we haven't even started eating dinner. So I called and talk to the manager and he was very cool on the phone I also told him that I got charged for my delivery. he told I will get those right back to you ASAP and you could keep the bone-in wings as our mess up no extra charge I was like AWSOME..so we opened what we had and I could say that the pizza was not what I expected not to warm a little on cold side by this time I was getting a little upset.But didn't want to call back so we just started eating what we had while the boneless wings get here. About 20-25 later the boneless wings get here my wife opens up the box and...the boneless wings where very over cooked burned(see the pic I put up here) So I could say I will never order from this place again very disappointed didn't bother to call the restaurant again. Thanks by the way never got my money back for the free delivery coupon I had.
