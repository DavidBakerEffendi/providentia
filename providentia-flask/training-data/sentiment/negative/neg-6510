Had a very unsatisfying experience.  Service was very un-engaging and the food was mediocre...  The server forgot our cheese plate, even though she passed by us several times with out noticing or checking in us.  We ordered a bottle of a blended red wine from Rhone,  it was old and oxidized...  When server came by (25min) later to tell us our hot food was almost up, I then told her about forgetting the cheese plate.   Trying to sell me a dessert that I wasn't even contemplating at the time we just wanted our entrees.....  Few others to list, but overall very very disappointing.  Should of went to the parlor..    Good thing it wasn't my birthday........NOT!!! :(
