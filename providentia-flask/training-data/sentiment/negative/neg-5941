It was the most horrible pho that i've ever had. And the price just killed it. ---$15--- for a bowl of pho which i can have TWO somewhere else. 
I ordered pho tai sate. The broth was so dense and it wasn't hot enough to cook the rare beef. The noodle was so soft that i felt like eating baby food. I bet they bought cheap noodle or boiled it for very long time. 
Anyway, please do not be lazy to drive somewhere else to get pho.
