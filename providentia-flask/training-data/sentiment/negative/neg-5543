A last minute decision to come to Teharu Sushi turned out to be an awful one. It being a Sunday evening with a majority of restaurants closing early, we didn't have too many options so we came here.

We arrived two hours before closing and the restaurant was empty with the exception of the very few tables occupied. There were 4 sushi chefs working behind the conveyor belt yet none of them welcomed any of us upon walking in.

Having been to other rotating sushi locations in So Cal, Teharu sushi has limited options available and their kitchen items menu is pretty non existent. The plates cost between $1-$2. Everything on the belt was basic; California, spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, rainbow and spicy crab. In regards to the taste, the quality was poor as the seafood did not look fresh. Even the rice fell apart upon taking a bite.

Service was extremely poor. The server kept forgetting our orders, accidentally dropped our order on the floor and at times had to be approach to ask for items such as more napkins and drink refills. With the manager sitting directly across from our table, she decided to ignore our party while she continued to dine on her meal though it was obvious we were frustrated with the lack of service and disappointment in food. 

Never would I return to such a place that could careless about the food they serve or paying customers.
