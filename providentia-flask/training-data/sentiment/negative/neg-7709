they show pix on the menu of a spiral potato on a stick, i asked for that i even pointed to the pix on the menu cuz i couldnt find it on the menu. what i got was a lunch tray full of french fries... we waited a really long time for our food... like over 45 mins for fries and corndogs and the place was completely empty only 2 other tables of people. everything was mediocre at best...
