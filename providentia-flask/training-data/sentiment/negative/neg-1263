We went to this place several years ago and stopped for some reason I really don't remember why. So we discovered it again and loved the atmosphere so we stayed coming back, had good food and friendly staff the first two times we came but not today not even close. We sat close to 30 minutes after we ordered waiting for our food, people were showing up ordering and getting their food and we still weren't getting our order. (A burrito we were splitting) After I was thoroughly annoyed my wife went in and asked, bla, bla, bla they'd have it out as soon as they could a few minutes later we got an over nuked disgusting chunk we couldn't even eat after a good try though we left what was left of what some third world country folk would maybe accept on the table and walked out. Perhaps this is why we stopped coming before. Maybe in a few years when I forget this terrible experience I'll try it again .
