Don't order the so-called "Chicken Balls with Rice" dish (菜遠雞球飯) from their Afternoon Tea menu. It's a misnomer. There are no chicken balls and instead, it's cheap chicken strips (like the kind you get with noodle soups) in a goop of thick starchy sauce (茨汁). When I asked the server about this, he was like, "yeah, it's kind of like chicken balls but in strip form". Ugh. Waste of my $10.45. Rice was also hard and not fresh.
