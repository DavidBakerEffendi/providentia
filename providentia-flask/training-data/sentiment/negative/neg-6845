Worst customer service ever!! October 16, 2016 at 11:30 AM I take my daughter in for bagels. My 16 year old daughter orders a "plain" bagel with cream cheese and the lady (wearing a Browns jersey) said "I don't know what you mean." My daughter was confused and felt belittled. I asked her what does she mean and she said we are out of plain bagels. I said then you should have said that l, because you obviously know what my daughter said l. She made my daughter feel stupid, when in fact she was plain rude!! 

Never again will I spend a penny here! What has ever happen to customer service!
