Manager and staff need to realize that all forms of government ID are proof of age. In my mid 40's and accidentally hand them an ID other than my drivers license and they refused to serve me a beer even though the ID provided carries considerably more weight than an ordinary state issued drivers license.   When I realized what has occurred I provided my drivers license and the they were ok.  

Still, education is paramount!
