Went on a Friday night (5/18) and the waiter suggested to get All-you-can-eat Fish-n-Chips. After 1 refill, the waiter told us that they are running out and not sure if they have anymore.  After 1 refill, we left.

Waiter was slow and inattentive...and when a big table of 15 (or so) people left, service was no better.  Fried fish is good, but service is awful.  Too many good restaurants in Chandler....I won't be back anytime soon.
