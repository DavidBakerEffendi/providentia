The food is.... fine. Nothing wrong with it, nothing to brag about. But the service is insanely bad.  The waitresses may do nothing wrong, maybe it's the kitchen, not sure, but of the two times I've been here it's taken well over an hour to get my food.  Maybe I'll come back and just bring a sandwich in my purse for the wait?
