I had only booked this place for my vacation due to the high ratings and reviews of course. Although it was a nice stay at the time being, I am highly disappointed with what they charged me after checkout. 

We notice in their hotel room, they have a mini fridge with different types of drinks in them. And of course we are aware that it IS NOT free of charge. So my boyfriend and I, decided to walk to the Walgreens next door to buy drinks. We DID NOT take any of their drinks, but we were charged over $150 worth of drinks.. 

This makes me think that the person who cleaned up our room after we left, had taken some drinks and made them bill us. 

So to anyone who will be booking this in the future, please make sure you check that they bill you the right amount at the end of the day. It's been a month for us, and we just realized it.
