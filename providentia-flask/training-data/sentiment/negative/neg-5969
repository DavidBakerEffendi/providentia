Pizza was unimpressive and my slice was cold. The pizzas that they had out looked  as if they've been there for quite some time. As soon as you walk in there was an unpleasant smell that made my son want to leave. But we were hungry so we just chose to sit outside. We are not planning on returning to this establishment anytime soon.
