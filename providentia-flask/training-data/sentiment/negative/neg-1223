If you are a restaurant that has private rooms for private events (for example Office Christmas Parties etc) then you should be able to accommodate people with dietary restrictions. My office has booked our Office Christmas Party here. (ya it sucks it's a steak house and I'm veg!!)

I requested a vegan meal.  And now I keep getting requests from the secretary who is in contact with the restaurant about what I can/can't eat. Are vegetables and potatoes ok because the chef doesn't really know how to cook that "tofu stuff" very well. Answer: No vegetables and potatoes are NOT ok..this is supposed to be a high end restaurant!!! Honestly! I was asked if I can give them recipes because they can't figure out what to make. Ya....there this thing, it's call the internet and if you go on it and google "vegan recipes" there is a 100% chance that you will find something to cook. Lazy or incompetent. I am not sure. 

I totally get this is a steak house so I'm not even expecting anything amazing, but every high end place should have one vegan option and not be so clueless.

I will update after I actually eat here, but I honestly can say I am NOT looking forward to it!
