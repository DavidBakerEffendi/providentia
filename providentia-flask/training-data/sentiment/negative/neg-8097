If you want to get cheated out of your money then go here. 
I got only 6 beers and one shot the whole night and somehow my bill was $80. Each beer is $6.50 and a shot is $8.50.. you do the math. As soon as I seen my bill I waited for the bartender to come around and she didn't come around to contest it. What I am saying is they have 4 bartenders just throwing drinks on people's tabs and expect you to pay for it. And they tooked advantage of me because I had a credit card. NEVER coming here again!!
