I decided to go in as it looked like a great place to relax and drink coffee, WRONGOOO I go in and no one acknowledges our presence a simple hello is fine as we are not royalty lol however I decide what I want, I am behind a couple... few moments later they are done but the waitress/cashier never noticed or made it seem like we were next... she goes under the counter starts looking for stuff I guess coffee filters or something.. took her a few to comeback and ring up my one pastry pear almond scone.. anywho she sets it on the glass counter I swipe and no contact stilllllllll I wait for her to hand me my pastry .. never happens I grab it and say goodbye as a good bye was not given... that's not ALL I split the pastry with my mother and there is a hair!!!! Sooooo I will never buy or enter this facility. :)
