Possibly the worst breakfast experience I have had in Toronto.  Let me preface this with the fact that the SPACE is adorable with a lovely open garage window.  The server was also verty lovely but a lot confusing.  
The niceness of the place stops here.

-Came here for brunch.  Had a nice looking menu.  The portions looked quite substantial.
-We ordered coffee.  it was TERRIBLE.  I told the server that it tasted burnt and it wasn't very good.  I asked for an espresso.  They don't have an espresso machine.  The serer then told me there were no other coffee alternatives.  I said that was fine.  and then she proceeded to ask me if I wanted MORE coffee and THEN CHARGED it to our bill even though I told them the coffee was terrible and placed it on the side of the table to be taken away.

-The breakfast LOOKED amazing.  The actual food was VERY substandard.  I asked for eggs poached soft.  They were poached hard.  The potatoes were dusted with something that looked delicious but it tasted like boiled potato and nothing else.

-The rest of the breakfast was uninspiring and HONESTLY worse than one of those 3.99$ breakfast diners

-The entire place was rather terrible given that it looks like a cute space and the server was nice....enough... even though there was some clear issues with what to do when a customer tells you the coffee is terrible and still charges it to your bill.

My brunch mates all agreed we would nevr come back to this place.
