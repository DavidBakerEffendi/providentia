No no no - this place is not good.  Food is not good (worst veal parm I have ever had), service sucked (dude was trying to fake an Italian accent, really demeaning) and the wine was horrible (it doesn't matter if its free).  When you are in Vegas you should treat yourself to a quality meal.  Do not come to Battista's because it seems like a great deal (its not).  The money you save on the all-inclusive option just isn't worth it.  There are only a handful of places worth leaving the strip for and this isn't one of the them.  Please do not trust the positive reviews and stay away.
