Been to this Canes since it opened, will never come to this one again. First off they messed up an order and I went back to do a "meal recovery" that turned into a huge mess. After letting the manager TIA know what I was there for she was completely rude from the start. She made it seem like I was trying to scam them out of some chicken. I was basically treated like shit and every time I asked a question TIA would walk off and disregard me. Her actions as a manager show that she's not cut out for that job. Doesn't seem that hard to manage a place like this, pretty basic environment and meal prep. If I had known that I would of been treated so poorly I would of not worried about the meal recovery and just paid for it. 9 bucks ain't worth the hassle. Tia should maybe find another job where she doesn't have to see customers and/ or talk to them.
