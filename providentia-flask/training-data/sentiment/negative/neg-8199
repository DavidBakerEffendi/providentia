If there was a -negative star I would use it.  Unhappy servers who looked like androids from that movie zombies retuning from the dead! Took a break from studying college math to get a root beer float. Purchase drove back home to savor and watch favorite tv drama and dang no root beer seltzer. Had to drive back for refund. No offer of making for free considering high gas prices and 2 trips. Went back a week ago with God daughter to get 2 milk shakes they were terrible. Whip cream was nasty and no choc in chocolate shakes. We had to remake and remove whip throw up cream and add Hershey to make it chocolate. Two thumbs down no Sonic for me!
