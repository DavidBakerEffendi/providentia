I'm really not one to give crappy reviews.  If you check my yelp ratings, you'll see that I usually only review things that i LOVE or HATE.  

Battista's Hole in the Wall...i HATE this restaurant.  It's SOO over-priced -- yes you get free wine, but it tastes like vinegar; yes you get a "set" menu, but it sucks.  everything just  tasted SOOO bad.  I can't believe the waiters don't feel bad serving you this food.  

Also, that little accordion man...he's sooo creepy.  shamelessly panders by playing a BAD song to get a tip at your table.  
 
BEWARE.  DON'T GET TRICKED BY THE 4 STAR REVIEWS LIKE I DID.  DO NOT COME HERE.
