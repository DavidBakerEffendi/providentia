I reserved a table for 6 people weeks prior to ensure we get a spot when we came and we still had to wait about 40 minutes to get seated regardless. Wasn't sure why the reservation was even taken if we still had to wait. 

Then we had a problem with seating because they were basically telling us we had to sit outside instead of providing a table that was first available indoors. 

We ordered several app's and individual meals for the group and were disappointed with most of the food we ordered. The food was overcooked and had no flavor. Their menu doesnt bring any creatively and doesnt give options that are worth coming to this American Brasserie versus any other american style restaurant. 

Additionally, they added on a franchise fee to the bill which seemed odd. The server basically said that all the restaurants do this on the strip but that is a complete lie because that was the first time I saw that.

I will not be returning here or any of their other franchises.
