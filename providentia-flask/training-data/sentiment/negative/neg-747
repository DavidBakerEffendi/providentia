Ate here for breakfast. I've had better breakfast at Denny's. My eggs were way over cooked and the pancakes were like cold cardboard. I had to send them back. The waitress was very nice and embarrassed about the food. Too boot, the restaurant was full of these tiny little gnat type bugs that were flying everywhere. Even after being asked to move away from the window they were still buzzing our heads.Will not eat here again
