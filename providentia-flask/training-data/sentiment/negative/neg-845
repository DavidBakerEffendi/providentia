Top golf here tonight was a horrible  experience !!!! I will never come back again! First of all we ordered food my chicken was raw and when I asked about it they kind of shrugged it off like "oops that sucks " then our game kept constantly glitching so they made us move tables then at that table it continued to glitch . We had the glitch reset multiple times after the 4th glitch ( when we were an intense game btw) we asked for a manager for the second time that night ... she decided to sit there and wait for the glitch to happen again and once it did same dang attitude of " oops that sucks " this whole place had a whatever kind of attitude .... she paid for my raw chicken although no sorta about that and gave us 1 hour free golf butttt we paid for 2 hours and all 2 hours that system glitched . So overall this place has a crappy dosent care attitude : we don't care u had raw chicken we don't care u had a crappy 3 hours of glitched golf ... hello salmonella poisoning! #placesucksgolfballs
