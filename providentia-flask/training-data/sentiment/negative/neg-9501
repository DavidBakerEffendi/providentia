Ok ,this was my second time here .  My first dining experience was  great.  Service was good food was good.  But this time the  same dish I ordered eggplant parm  was totally different  bland, cold which is the worst .  My party of 6  also agreed with me about their entrees  ravioli , meatballs. Ect.. So I have to warn newcomers that this place has changed and not  my pick for Italian in Las Vegas
