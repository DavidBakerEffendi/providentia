After our first order we had high hopes... but unfortunately I have to agree with the other 1 star reviews. Their service and their food quality is quite lacking. After waiting an hour and 50 minutes we cancelled the pizza order because it still wasn't here (Almost 2hrs for 2 pizzas? Ridiculous)... The chicken tetrazzini that we received on our last order had literally no chicken. This place is not reliable, food quality seems to be very random and their customer service is equally horrible. I will no longer be ordering from East Side Mario's, as we gave them 3 opportunities to prove that it was just a momentary issue/fluke, but it seems to be a consistent issue.
