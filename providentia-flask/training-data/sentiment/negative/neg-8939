Mediocre place for burritos, definitely had better ones.

I ordered a small chicken burrito (~$8 You got to customize what you wanted in the burrito, similar to subway. The toppings weren't that fresh and the flavour of the chicken was a bit bitter. I can say that I didn't feel the best after eating it... so I don't think I'll be visiting again.
