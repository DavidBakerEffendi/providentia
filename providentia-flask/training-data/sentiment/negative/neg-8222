I am at a loss for words right now.... Seriously!?! This not what I expected at all from The Venetian. This is a disappointing way to begin my vacation.... We walked into two drying fans, not even sure the room was really cleaned.... Then when my husband calls down to the front desk they offer to "sub us out" for a two queen smoking room. Really? I am allergic to smoke. My husband is Spire Elite with IHG and this is what we get from a world class hotel. We have been looking forward to this vacation for 2 months. I try to make the best of things but even the head boards on the bed were dusty, the windows had smudges on them, the bath mat was not even straight. I walked into an amazing view, I was fascinated by the detail. Right now we would have been better staying at another IHG property. #disappointed
