Horrible service.  Only one bartender on duty on friday afternoon w/ baseball games and preseason football on today.  After sitting for 1/2 an hour without talking to ANY of the staff, they still charged me for a beer after telling me they were showing a game that they weren't.  Don't plan on coming back.
