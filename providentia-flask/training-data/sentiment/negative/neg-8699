Gross place. 

Disgusting servers who have no business serving food or drinks. Don't wash their hands, dirty silverware, bussing tables with towels that fall on the ground. Gross gross gross. Food is mediocre but can't hold a candle to the new, nearby restaurants in Downtown Summerlin.  Management clearly doesn't care to staff the place with professionals who care about customer service and health codes....instead they staff with people with no business handling food, drinks, or customers...and who drink on the job. 

Classy. Not.
