Ordered for an event our company was sponsoring!!  Let me say this is the 2nd time that they have been late. This time I told them 11:15 in hopes that they would be ready to eat by 11:45am when in reality it was Noon.  Needless to say Food didn't show up until 12:05pm  it was only 1 guy with food for 100 people and he had no cart to carry the food in and had no sense of urgency. We spent a little over 1k and expect the food to be on time, hot and if they happen to be running late at least a sense of urgency.  The food is great, but don't order from them for large parties especially if you don't want to look bad. Very dissapointed !!
