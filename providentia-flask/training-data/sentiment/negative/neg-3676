Ordered food online got there to pick it up and they inform me they don't have the order and have been having problems with their ticket system. How are you going to accept orders online and not know how to track them if something goes wrong. I called for a refund since the app charged the order to my card and couldn't hear them talking because of the music in the background. I had to go back in for the refund. Not a good look for this place. Won't go again
