Gross......Without boring you with details, well, it's just not worth the walk up the stairs......The 3 of us sat outside and ordered from the blonde with an accent that didn't have a nametag, nor did she give us her name, ever.  The caesar salad (first bite) was so bad I wanted to vomit. Old, wilted, rancid and soggy. I ordered tomato soup instead. It was so-so. My husbands burger was "fine" he said. My son's pulled pork was topped with cole slaw and we couldn't find the meat. The bun was non-exist because it deteriorated to nothing from the watery cole slaw.. fries with both were cold. The manager tried to make it better with the rancid salad but the worst part of this total eating experience was the security alarm of the restaurant next door that was piercing my ears going off for (true story) 25 minutes. I was going to shoot someone. The check took over 20 minutes to get to us after we asked for it. That was longer than it took to get our food. We will not go back. Once again, not worth my efforts of walking up those stairs. 
Good luck if you try this joint.
