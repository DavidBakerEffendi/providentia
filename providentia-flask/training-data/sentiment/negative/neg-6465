First, I almost never give a one star review, however, after trying to redeem my Groupon for a Pink & White set with a fill, the owner told me they would not accept it. I then asked if they could just use it towards another service, she said"No call Groupon for a refund!" So rude & callous to a potential client. I will NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place as she certainly must not want clients!
