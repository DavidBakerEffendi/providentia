So i ordered earlier for lunch waymen called me and said there was an issue with my card. I had given the wrong card number so i gave my new card number and all was fine i ordered the pizza knots pizza. Lest just say i was less than thrilled the pizza was not that hot soaked in grease and the crust right under the knots was still dough. I literally rolled up a little dough ball with it. The knots were ok tho. Fast forward kids wanted pizza for dinner but the knots were out of stock. I ordered 2 med pizzas. No1 ever called or showed up i called and after being on hold for 10 mins ELI finally answered and said my card declined and he tried to call me. So while on the line i check my bal and there is more than enough money on there, he claims he called and i didnt answer so i asked if he left a msg bc i did not receive not one call and of course he said no. His attitude was so fucking nasty and condescending that i asked for the manager and of course in a tauting manner he says he is the manager right now.... Long story short i got the number to the corporate franchise office from him and i will be calling tomorrow. I could have ordered the pizza again but he pissed me off with his attitde so bad that i three clothes on and went and got dinner elsewhere and as bad as i didnt want to leave hence the reason i ordered this in the first place i refused to spend another dime there
