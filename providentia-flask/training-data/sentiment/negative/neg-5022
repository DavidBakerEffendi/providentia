Our waiter was so sweet. He did a great job. But the food was so gross!! Red lobster is not the same anymore and over priced. Poor quality food.The manager did come to talk to us about the food. We let him know that our food wasn't tasting like usual. He offered us a different plate but we declined. We just wont be back.
