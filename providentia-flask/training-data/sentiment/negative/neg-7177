Dinner here was probably the worst experience I've had in Vegas this far. The service is ridiculous, we sat for over an hour at a table directly in front of the bar yet waiting for the check, being completely ignored by the staff even though the restaurant was almost completely empty. Service like that is never excusable but we wouldn't have been as mad if the food was good, but it was awful too. The garlic fries were thin and completely tasteless, the pizza was average at best, and the $8.50 Bud light draft was warm. Would recommend ANYWHERE else over this place, seriously walk down the street to Denny's and I'm sure you'll have a better experience.
