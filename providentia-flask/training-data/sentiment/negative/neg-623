I will try to be objective but the food was truly bad... so my experience was definitely tainted. I must say that I had high expectations after reading the online comments. We drove a long way to try this restaurant, especially the moussaka and taverna grilled chicken. Here is what we had:

Lentil soup: ordinary but still ok

Fried calamari: there was more oil than actual calamari and they were not cleaned properly. Horrible.

Fried zucchini chips: they were thick and extremely oily... like leaking oil in your mouth when taking a bite. Horrible.

Saganaki: the show is nice, the cheese isn't. Not good at all and I usually love saganaki.

Tzatziki: ordinary, store bought

Greek salad: almost no dressing... so basically just cubes of tomatoes and cucumber

Fried: generic frozen fries, but good. 

Rice: good

Slouvaki stick: ok

Grilled half chicken: looked good but was undercooked! We left it all there. 

Roasted potatoes: stale... must have been made a few days ago

Moussaka: the b√©chamel was rock solid, the meat was "beasty" (inedible) and the taste was just off. I will say that it was my first time trying this dish, so I don't know what it's suppose to taste like.

Service: our waitress was very nice and polite... we can't blame her for the food right?


Needless to say, most of the food remained in our plates.

I didn't even have the energy to discuss with management... if they are ok with serving this food, well there is not much my comments can do... so I just paid the bill and the tip and left.
