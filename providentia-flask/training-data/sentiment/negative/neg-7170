App is HORRIBLE! Second time I've gotten all the way to the end, and it won't take a payment. I have to then call in my order. The problem is not calling in the order, the problem is is I don't earn my reward points. And the store doesn't know how to help you get your points when you have to call in your order because they're app doesn't work!
