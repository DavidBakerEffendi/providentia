Arrived at approximately 8:20 pm with my husband, expecting to have a fun date night with no kids. Only to find out from the guy at the front cashier that they're closing and the cash drawer has already been taken to the back...but the website says they close at 10. That's an hour and a half until the posted closing time. We of course complain and ask for the manager, whom we waited for another 20 minutes until she finally came over and explained they close early when it's a slow night. Meanwhile there's a family of 6 at one lane who we watched get 4 trays of food, a couple at the bar ordering new drinks, and another couple eating. 

After the manager goes upstairs to grab us a coupon for our next time going, a group comes through the door wanting to bowl but gets turned away when they learn corner alley doesn't want anymore business for the night EVEN THOUGH THE TIME SAYS OPEN TIL 10! 

The amount of time wasted, we could have finished a game already and been on our way.
