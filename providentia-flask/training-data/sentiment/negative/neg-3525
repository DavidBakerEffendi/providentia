Carmen at the Terminal 4 Location has a bit of an attitude, took 10 minutes to make my two salads, and absolutely crushed all the apple chips in my figi apple chicken. I do not recommend this location, especially if she is working. Would be a more pleasant experience too if they had the same menu as other locations
