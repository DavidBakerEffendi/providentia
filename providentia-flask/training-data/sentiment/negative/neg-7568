New in town and we had a terrible experience here...from beginning to end.  Nice setting and the bar looked fun but loud and right in the middle of the restaurant.

After a reasonable wait, the hostess decided to offer us the seats right next to the door - which had been open the entire time we and others were waiting but went unoffered for obvious reasons.  We asked for a different table.

The hostess, very perturbed by this (I think she even sneered), did reluctantly take us in the back next to a very obnoxious table of women who were literally yelling across the table at each other. No one ever asked them to keep it down. They ruined the atmosphere for the entire back room.

Our waitress was nice and quite good. But margaritas - no thanks - and the food sounded good but was disappointing.  All and all, never going back.
