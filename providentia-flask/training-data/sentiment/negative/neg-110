This diner deserves 3 stars but I am adding 1 star because of my son. Jeff bought me breakfast and it was no special occasion. Cool huh! 
We had gone fishing earlier and he lost a huge bass and I did too. Good thing we don't have to depend on our fishing or hunting prowess for food like some people. We would probably starve. Anyway, back to the diner. We had built up a pretty good appetite and were looking for a good breakfast spot. Black Bear Diner came to mind from previous Yelp reviews. I chose the country fried steak and eggs, Jeff chose the thick sliced smoked bacon and eggs. Both breakfasts were ok but definitely not worth the $9.00 apiece price tag. The drinks and breakfast came out in less than 5 min. You read right, 5 MIN. So quick in fact, it made me suspicious and cautious. Everything was warm and APPEARED freshly made but the speed at which they came out pointed to pre-made, nuked or heat lamped. Probably left over from the early morning crowd and not being regulars we were given the left overs. We arrived about 9am.  At least Waffle House is cooked to order!  If you are not going to serve a freshly made product, then the price should reflect that and inform the customer! Boy, that would be a first. The waitress would say, "Excuse me, we made too much hash browns, chicken fried steak and biscuits this morning. Would you like a 50% discount on your meal or would you prefer freshly made at full price?" I would choose the former in a heart beat! So essentially my son paid a total of $22.00 + tip for left overs. My son works very hard for his money and to take his money using deceptive practices really pisses me off! I recouped some of the price by using all the butter and jelly on the dry baseball sized thing they call a biscuit! I am so pissed off right now I am taking away another star. No..make that 2 stars. LOSERS! I can't believe I told the waitress thank you... Makes me gag. It's no wonder fast food places flourish.
