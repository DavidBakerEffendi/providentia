A few months ago we noticed a Filiberto's coming to the corner of Cave Creek and Lone Mountain. We were interested to see where it was going in and then realIzed it was part of the gas station.  
Once it opened, we waited a few weeks to give it a try.  Before going, we looked on Yelp and saw the poor reviews one right after another. We decided to wait.  Then we saw a few people on FB rave about it so we finally decided to give it a try. 
It was an absolute mistake.  It was not great, not good and not even ok. I can only assume those raving about this restaurant we're friends or relatives of the owners because it was awful. 
We ordered two carnitas burritos and they were oily, fairly small, and had little taste besides the greasy taste left in  your mouth. There was a green semi-creamy substance that I think was supposed to be guacamole. It was more of avocado mayonnaise- yup as tasty as it sounds...
We will not be back.
