I'm not sure why the reviews are so high. Perhaps it was an off night. We had dinner here last night and if felt like one thing after another. Yes, we were seated right away... at a dirty table. Ok, wiped it off, we're all good. The bread basket is like something from a presliced bag from a grocery store. The caprese starter was good but they really need to take the tomatoes out of the fridge. They were cold, hard, and a bit grainy. The presentation and size was great. We both ordered the Chicken Saltinboca the procuttio was overlooked on my husbands and mine was burnt, the noodles and sauce were very salty. To their credit the food wait time was short. Our service was *terrible*. In the beginning I said to our server I would just like water, when we left my glass was completely empty not even ice in it and had never been refilled. Not that it wasn't requested. When asked about dessert we declined because we just wanted to leave already. I cannot recommend this place to anyone. :(
