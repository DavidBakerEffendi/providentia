There is no way to right this wrong. This is the worst sushi I have ever tasted in my life, and I have definitely tasted the full spectrum of sushi. The worst part is that I will never get that $40.66 for my husband's coke and our two charges for the buffet back. The service was good, but it didn't make up for several factors: (1) that my husband's crab legs tasted like they had been cooked, frozen, and thawed out (which, if this is what actually happened, causes a very unappetizing consistency that is both grainy and mushy); (2) the quality of the fish was terrible, and by terrible I specifically mean it had no flavor; (3) during my second round back to the buffet, to see if any better options had appeared, the options had diminished significantly, so I literally took three small pieces; (4) at least half of what was out there had cream cheese in it, which is not a replacement for quality (5) I looked for updates during round three, with none added, so went for dessert instead; (6) some fruit did not taste like it was fully ripened yet.

We each paid $17.95 for the equivalent of one regular roll at a place like Yellowfin. If I feel like there is just an issue with an item at a restaurant I usually complain, but this place is SYSTEMATICALLY WRONG. There is NOTHING that this place could do that would make me ever go back there. It truly is the worst sushi place I have ever eaten at. Please, please, please go to Yellowfin or KoFusion and support businesses who know what they are doing.

I'll never get over me... eating bad suuuuuushiiii.
