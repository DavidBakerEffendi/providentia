This was the most interesting restaurant I have been in. Place sucks. The food was like it was made in a microwave by a 8 year old. Super expensive for some really bland, boring food. 
Just because its vegan/vege does not mean it has to be terrible.

The decor is 100% salvation army, pieced together from a thrift store!

I used my groupon, paid an additional $20 and went to baja fresh after.

And it took an hour
