Buy a burrito somewhere else - complete garbage.  $15 for a "super" burrito and a water - the burrito was the size of a taco bell 7 layer burrito.  Sour cream and guac???  Though ordered, they must have run through this burrito in track shoes because those ingredients were outta there.

Ya feel me??
