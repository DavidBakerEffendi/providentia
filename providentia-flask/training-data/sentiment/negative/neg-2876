Do not come to this place. First thing I see at this Kabob place is pizza rotating on a heat rack that looks 2 days old. Me and my friends order simple chicken Schwarma wraps and wait in the dining area. About 20 minutes later only one of us gets our plate. The server didn't even look like he knew what he was doing AND I saw his hands touch our food when he served it which is disgusting. The rest of us were waiting for another 15 minutes which is a ridiculous time to wait for a simple wrap. The cashier and server came into the dining room to ask what we ordered about 3 times. It's really not that hard. Just make a chicken wrap 4 times. 

They then asked other diners what they ordered which shows us just how unorganized they are. When I eventually got my food I had more fries than an actual wrap. Service horrible and food sub par. Not coming back.
