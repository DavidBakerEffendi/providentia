I'm still in the store writing this review.... if that doesn't show how annoyed I am I don't know what will. But while me and another person were waiting to be taken care of, the "owner" was behind the counter telling the girl working what sandwiches to make for his 5 children so they can go hiking. This girl was working alone so there was no one else to help her, and he was just standing there watching her. I'm not sure what kind of customer service that is but he wasn't a PAYING guest. He was behind the counter ordering his employee around, getting sandwiches for free while two paying guest sat there and waited. The guest behind me left, that's how long it too. He could of easily waited for our TWO sandwiches to be made, to continue with his. But I guess he doesn't understand what customer service is. Hope he has a gooooooooood hike.
