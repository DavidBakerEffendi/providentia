I went for my anniversary dinner. I really wanted beef ribs and it's close so I thought lets go.
The food was horrible. Stay away. I got the beef ribs and they where served burned like charcoal and mash potato's where ice cold. Literally like potato salad. I will never go back there. Do yourself a favor and don't go.
The manager said she would give me a discount, but didn't. The bill was full price. 
I was disheartened and just paid the tab and left.  
They didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. 
The fact the place was mostly empty on a Friday night should have been my fist clue.
If you want beef ribs Bobby Q's is the place to go.
