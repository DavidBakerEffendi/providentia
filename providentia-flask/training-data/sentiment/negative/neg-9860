Why did i waste money here again? should have just gone to red robin's.
My expectations aren't high when it comes to chinese buffets but gahh...C'mon...Wtheck... Usually one would find at least one thing in a chinese buffet that they would like.. something hot, tasty, oily.. but no not even close, not one thing was good Everything was bland and the food was seriously poor quality. Everything plainly sucked.. All of it!! plus I could understand that the hostess was new.. but you shouldn't run around chasing after customers and telling us where to sit without directing us, like we own the place?.. jeez. Sucky food... I was seriously thinking of another reason to five them another star butttttt total waste of money. I would just stick to Buffet @ asia for a cheap chinese buffet 
im sorry but NEVER AGAIN.
