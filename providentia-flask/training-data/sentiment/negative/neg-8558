Went here for a belated birthday dinner just last Wednesday. I must say, it wasn't worth it! (1) First of all, the "Fortune Club" card can not be used towards any one under the age of 21...and each member of your party must have their own cards to save the $5. It's not much, but I paid extra  for several members under 21 of age. (2)The waiters were unsure on where to place you...they had us zig-zagging in line through out the floor for a table! (3) The vegetables were drenched in butter (4) The crab legs were dry and seem to have shrunken inside their shells, which made it difficult to pull out without getting your fingers all messy (5) the desert was nothing but baked chocolate choices. Fresh cut fruits or jello would have been nice (6) the meats were over cooked and have turned hard and dry--lost their flavors under neath the heated light (7) Drinks were re-filled with tons of ice, which made our drinks WATERY! (8) Staff rushing us by pacing around us, emptying our plates before we could even finish what we were eating...taking them without asking.     Maybe it was a bad evening for them....Will give it another shot, a last shot. We'll see how it goes again. If it doesn't change, we will definately NOT be going back!
