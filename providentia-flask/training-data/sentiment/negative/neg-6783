Went with my kids-not ideal. If you are a family, woman or not a single man or group of men, and as a mother of two kids I fit into neither of the latter, forget it. The owner saunters in with his kids and the waitresses (did not see one waiter) who are chosen for their "dimensions" suddenly are on their best behavior. Our waitress was actually waiting on a table of friends of hers and would come to the table with shots and serve AND TAKE ONE with her "friends" group. Our service was terrible, the food wasn't bad, actually decent, but the service and atmosphere are just not worth it.
