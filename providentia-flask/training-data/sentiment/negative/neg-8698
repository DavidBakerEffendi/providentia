This place is clearly popular since the wait to get in is usually 20 minutes. The problem is their inability to keep track of who is waiting and for how long. I took two friends here today, was told a 20 minute wait. After 35 minutes, I asked the girl at the desk who said "there's just two people in front of you." I sat on a bench in front of this person for the next 20 minutes as they sat group after group. After seeing at least 5 groups get seated, I asked again, only to be met with confused looks and NO apology. I could see the panic as the front end staff tried to figure out what they could do, which should have been seat us immediately. That didn't happen so we left. I won't be going back to this place ever again.
