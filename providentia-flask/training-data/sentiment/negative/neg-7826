One star for the horrible service....waited around for a while even though there were three empty tables. Waited another 15 mins to  get attention from a waitress so we could order the food. Don't understand how it took almost an hour just to get seated and order food. Everyone seated in the corner were complaining about how long it takes for them to get anything done.
