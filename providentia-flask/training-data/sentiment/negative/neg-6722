For the Women's Cup Final, 14 of us went to BLD to watch the game and to have a drink. There were 3 parties there. Our big party, 2 women in a booth and a sad lady at the bar. We arrived a little late and it looked like my friends had ordered drinks and snacks and when the US scored, we cheered! How exciting! We loved watching sports @ BLD. Then...the female bartender "shushed" us. She shushed us? For cheering in a bar/restaurant? In a very, very empty bar I might add. This is not a library, my friend.

Game over.

My girlfriends saw that terrible act and gesture as well and said the other bartender was giving them sass so that was the final straw. He said something along the lines of, "You guys need to be more quiet since there are other patrons here." Right, ONE other patron. Give me a freaking break.

We asked for checks and left. The sad lady at the bar seemed to be the female bartender's friend. She looked like a hot mess and was visibly frazzled. Sorry, not my problem. She was still drinking champagne though so it couldn't have been THAT bad. The two girls in the booth left by the time we got our checks. They were most likely not impressed by the staff as well. It was appalling. Did something change? Ownership? Management? BLD just lost a TON of business. Yesterday and the future. It was convenient since we all work at Intel and live within a few miles. BLD you have lost patrons that used to love going to your place to watch a game. But this type of service has unraveled the fact that your menu is mediocre and over priced. We found out later that evening from a friend that BLD has had a number of food code violations. No wonder the place is empty. Link for last year's article:

BLD - Below average, Low quality Dining. I'll be going to The Ivy Mediterranean Lounge right next door from now on and so should all of you.
