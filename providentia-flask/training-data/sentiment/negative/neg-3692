Doesn't seem sanitary to me...

I was extremely excited to try this place because of reviews and photos of their pizza online. I base almost everything off of reviews because reviews from peers always tell the story, granted there are always garbage reviews that are negligible...regardless. My experience was terrible. 

First off, if you step inside you will be disgusted, unless you like ordering food in a smoke pit. Went early evening, left in two minutes smelling like an ash try. The guy working there was super nice, however, the woman was extremely rude to the other employee while he was taking our order. Talking in a condescending fashion to him and yelling at him while he was talking to us. Not a great second impression. Once we were told it would be a 40 min wait we decided to leave and come back next time to try it, didn't feel like waiting tonight. After leaving (after two minutes like previously stated), I couldn't believe how much we smelled of smoke. Thinking about it, this concerned me as this pizza shop is constantly open to the bar. I don't like the idea of my food being exposed to smoke 24/7 prior to it even getting prepared.

I see other reviews talking of the smoke and most with people ordering delivery. If those of you who order delivery saw the atmosphere your food is prepared in i'm sure you wouldn't be as enthused about the product.

Don't get me wrong, I love bar food and frequent others in town, however, the cook area is never open to the smoke area...never in my experience! Whether it's a door or something that divides them. The ordering window is always open meaning the food is always exposed and at this point, all the food back there has been soaking in the smoke of all the people at the bar for the last few weeks...disgusting the more I think about it. 

In the end, never ate the product, although I'm sure it might be good, just might try another location...definitely not this one
