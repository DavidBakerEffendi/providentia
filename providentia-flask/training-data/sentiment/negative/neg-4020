Reservation for 8 at 6pm. Seated half the party at 5:50, didn't receive any service, not even waters, until remainder of guests arrived at 6:15. This is a beer bar. Their tables have taps built in, yet they hire waitresses that do not drink or know beer and could not give valid descriptions of beer on menu. Everyone ordered dinner. 7 plates arrived together. Last meal arrived TWENTY TWO minutes later, after being told by several employees "it will be right out". Because the fish went from frozen to deep fried, it was not good, and was not eaten. Comping that meal was a given. But what about the other seven meals that got cold as we politely awaited the last meal of our party? You couldn't offer a discount? A free round of drinks? Dessert? Nothing? 
I assumed this was a country bar with country music, country dancing, and a country atmosphere. Not so much. Every television had the UFC fight on. Ultimate review: Typical, Trendy, Scottsdale bar.
