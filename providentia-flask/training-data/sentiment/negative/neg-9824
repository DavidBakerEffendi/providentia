Jesus H Christ this place is terrible.  I don't know what was worse the service or the bathrooms.
Some colleagues and I decided to meet here after work one evening for Happy Hour drinks and appies.  Bigggggggg mistake.
We all stood at the bar where a friend had a tab started.  All the bartenders looked so flustered and confused and not one of them acknowledged that we'd arrived.  We waited about 10 minutes until finally we were able to flag someone down.
The beer selection was okay, and the wine selection was actually quite minimal considering the god damn place is actually referencing a part of a wine bottle.  I think it was seriously just one page long!
We eventually moved to a table where the service became worse.  We ordered some "Happy Hour" appies which were 9$ fries that were undercooked.  On what planet is 9$ the price we pay for Happy Hour fries. I head to the bathrooms.
I ask myself "When was my last Twinrex shot?" Because the bathrooms were a cesspool of disgusting.  Like stained toilet seats and messy counters, I had half a mind to just squat outside in front of the Calgary Parking Authority Building.  These bathrooms were disgusting.  Clean your fucking bathrooms.  I found out later from a friend that the male washrooms were no better, he cited "shit everywhere".  I got the bill, charged for an extra beer.  Then the server brought over the manager where I had to re-explain to both of them that I had been charged for an extra beer.  Awkward, table for 3.
All in all, this place is terrible.  This is not a great after work place, and given the layout, I wouldn't recommend it for large groups either.  I just don't recommend it at all.
