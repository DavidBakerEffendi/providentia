Every time I come to this location, I am highly disappointed. The staff is very unprofessional. I went through the drive through and the young lady that took my order, I could barely hear her. So when i asked her to repeat what she said, she got an attitude with me as if I did something wrong. Let's not talk about the fact that the rating at this place is 95, which I feel is low. When i got to the window, this particular young lady basically threw my bag at me. I knew I should've checked it before leaving but decided not to. When i get back to work, I notice there are no napkins nor any eating utensils in the bag!! So disrespectful!! Every time I come to this location I am always disappointed. Please hire a better staff and prepare them to be professional and to offer excellent customer service!
