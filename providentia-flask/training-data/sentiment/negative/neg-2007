Appetizers were yummy   calamari,  meat balls....  good        all great and first part of chop salad was delicious till I pulled 16" hair out of the salad and my mouth simultaneously.... ghastly and a little vomit ensued.....   they need to use hair nets in the kitchen for sure.... all other aspects good but cant go back!
