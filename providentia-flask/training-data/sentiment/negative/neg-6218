Boring.  The moment you walk in the restaurant is just so plain.  Sure there are bright colors but nothing stood out.  Boring.  

So I order my usual pizza sausage and green pepper.  It was ok.  Nothing stood out.  The pizza was ok.  That is it.  I can barely finish this review.  It was not bad, it was not good.  It was just there.  We had a Groupon, so I took a chance.  

It is pretty far off the road.  A bit annoying to find.  Also annoying?  The loudness.  The tables make you feel like you are eating with your neighbors.  I understand children must eat as well but to allow the amount of noise that was occurring to go unaddressed was unacceptable.  Needless to say, I was SO happy to go.  

Thank god for the Groupon because the prices are not worth it.  Please go somewhere else for pizza.
