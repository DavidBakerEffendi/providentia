If there was a way i could put zero stars i would. I had the WORST experience at this subway. We had a group of about 5 people we were on our way to an event. When we first walked in a lady walked out and said she was going on break and that a lady would be right out to serve us. We stood and waited about 2-3 mins till i had to say hello. This employee named Terry walked out and in the beginning was very rude. You can tell she did not want to make our sandwhiches. This Terry lady was rude about changing meats in the sandwhiches when i been to subway plenty of subways and others did it. She also messed up one of our sandwhiches. We requested ranch on it and she squirted it down with mayo. We told her it was mayo and she ignored us. We had to tell her about 3-4 times till she finally looked up and reliezed. I will never step foot into this subway ever again and if you do dont let Terry serve you!!!! Totally killed my subway vibe
