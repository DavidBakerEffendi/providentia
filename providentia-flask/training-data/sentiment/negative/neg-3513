Came in today for Sunday dinner. Greeted and seated immediately at the table with the  couch by the restrooms(one of my pet peeves ). 
I feel like we didn't get enough attention compare to the other tables our server had. I did come in work out clothes, socks and slippers. But that shouldn't explain the poor service. 

Ok let's talk about it-
got seated and they dropped off 2 water glasses with no ice and a vase of water. I guess they don't like their water cold here. So I asked if we can have ice with our water and he comes back with 1 glass of ice, so my girl and I shared this one glass of ice water our whole dinner. So dinner..

We ordered:
-New England fry
-kurobota pork chops 
-scallops
-asparagus
-Mac n cheese
-kids chicken & fries 
-garden mule (cocktail)
-Brookie (dessert)
-Dutch chocolate ice cream

let's start with the New England fry. It was basically fried calamari and whole bellied clams. It was good but nothing spectacular. The batter didn't adhere to the seafood well.

We ordered a garden mule to share since we just went bar hopping last night..one drink won't hurt right? We weren't very fond of it. she chugged it so she wouldn't taste it lol. 

Entrees: 
Lady ordered scallops with cauliflower pur√©e and greens. We both liked this dish. Seasoned well and plated beautifully. I had the kurobota pork chops which were pretty bland and it didn't help that it was dry either. I had to ask for more sauce but even that took forever because our server was never around. the only good thing on that plate was the slaw but that's not the reason I paid $27. I was unhappy with my entree and match it with neglected service, it was pretty much downhill. 
We also had Mac n cheese and asparagus as side items and both were pretty tasty. 

Dessert:
'Brookie' brownie and cookie combo topped off with salted caramel chunk ice cream. Sounds good enough right? while, the idea is good...the execution could've been better. the brook was a lil hard. I was expecting moist and soft. That salted caramel ice cream is to die for! Best thing I had tonight other than our one & only glass of ice water. 

Our dinner wasn't crazy expensive but at that price point..I'd expect more attentive service and staff actually coming around more often checking on us, filling our water. Instead of dropping off a pitcher & food and not see a server til check time. 

We live 16 miles away and drove here for disappointment. Happy Easter honey salt!
