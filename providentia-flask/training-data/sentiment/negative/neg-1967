This location is terrible! I usually go to the one in rocky river and I will never go to this one again. Limited selection which happens at these stores later in the day but I settled for some other bagels. The only kind that was up there that I liked. Then this worker came over to us and said "hey I just dropped ur bagels pick another kind" I was just like OMG like he literally dropped the only bagels they had in there! Then my friend and I just walked out because that was just ridiculous! This location just isn't good.
