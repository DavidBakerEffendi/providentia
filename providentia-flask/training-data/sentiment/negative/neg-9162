This was the worst buffet I've visited in a long time. First of all, each type of cuisine only had 3 or 4 selections to choose from and mediocre at best. The pizza tasted worse than a 5 dollar frozen pizza you'd get at the store, the sushi had no flavor, the meatloaf looked like something that was thawed out last week! 
Overall bad, didn't even try the dessert.
