Can you say dirty.  I have gone there several times and every time I go there are glass dividers between the booths and they are filthy.  I look around and seriously it was crazy.  I said something to the girl up front but she was on the phone and didn't really care what I was saying.  I haven't been there for a couple of months.  I just felt the need to say something.  I will not be going back.
