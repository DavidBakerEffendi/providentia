I attempted to go here on a Friday night because a friend said it would be fun.
Myself and two friends walked up around 10pm. The doorman was super rude and told us we had to go. The reason being because I stepped over the rope on the side of the building where a line would be. Keep in mind there is no line and its 10pm!! Me and my friends are all mid 20's, attractive and slim so it wasn't an appearance thing. It was all because the doorman had an attitude. I have never ever been treated with such disrespect nor turned away from any bar or night club. I strongly recommend taking your business elsewhere unless you are willing to deal with the nazi doorman.
