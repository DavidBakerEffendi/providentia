I'm not sure why this place is rated so high. 
As a test, go to Panda Express and this place, order the orange chicken and have someone taste them both. You will see that there isn't a difference in the taste. 
I expected more from this place but the food is just your basic frozen food cooked in a wok...or microwave. I will say that my wife the lemon chicken and it tasted like it was cooked, left out, and then reheated, you know it had that "reheated" taste. 
Unless the reheated taste is just the taste of the food and in that case it's just bad.

The service I guess was nice. 4 people on staff at the time, all were standing around talking. One guy was standing in front of the register playing jewel craft and he didn't acknowledge I was there. A girl took my order after shooing the guy away so she could enter my order in the register.

We also got pot stickers and they tasted like chemicals found in cleaning solution. My only guess for this was that they were sprayed on accident when someone was cleaning but it ruined them. They were also still raw and very under cooked. One was still cold in the middle.

If you want really good Chinese food, I suggest going to China Palace instead.
They are always nice and helpful. I like their orange, sesame, and lemon chicken and it has a nice crispy taste to it, not soggy like Tott's.

Overall, if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you.
