I really did not like 800 degrees pizza. 
The first person that took out order was nice but the second person that continued with adding ingredients was rude. She did not want to add a second cheese even though we understood it would cost more. I get that the pizza cooks at 800 degrees but they leave it in the over for such a short amount of time that the crust gets burnt but the ingredients don't cook as well. The slices are really soggy and everything keeps falling from the pizza. It came out to about $16 for an individual pizza. For that price I could have bought 2 pizzas at pieology which is down the street in which you can include unlimited toppings and not be charged 1.50 for each. 
Seriously crappy pizza.
