I have spent many a time at airport restos and I'm pleasantly surprised whenever I find unique items on menus because it suggests that the business owner is trying to think outside the box.  On a recent trip, I found 360 Gourmet and was excited to partake.  Unfortunately, this resto manages to take a good concept and royally mess it up.  The concept: choose your own protein (including tofu) or veggie; prepared in a style you want (bowl, burrito, wrap, etc.); with a sauce of your choosing (thai, indian curry, etc.), and voila!  I was excited when I saw the bevy of options (shrimp, tofu, veggies) for non-meat eaters... until I found out that there was no shrimp.  Well, no mind... I'll go with tofu and some veggies.  Can I get that with thai sauce? Sure, says the lady who is making my order.... but then manages to also serve my thai tofu/veggie bowl with a heaping helping of guac. and sour cream...which I didn't discover until I opened the bowl, anxious to dig in.  After paying (almost $13!!) for my meal and a regular cup for diet soda, what I found in my bowl looked like vomit.  Literally.  I mean, I was ready to throw out the bowl on looks alone.  And then I tried it... and so did my man... and it tasted as bad as it looked.   I am shocked and dismayed at the quality of 360 GB and would recommend airport travelers to look elsewhere in McCarren to get some eats.
