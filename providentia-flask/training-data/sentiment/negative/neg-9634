This was my second visit - with our neighbors who want to try it out. The tried several different things and were so disappointed. Did not finish even 1/2 of the biryani that they were most excited about. The rice was undercooked. The Chana masala that I had liked last time was sour. The legume soup was tasteless. The only saving grace was the samosa chat, mango lassi and kulfi. 
Seems like it is getting worse.
