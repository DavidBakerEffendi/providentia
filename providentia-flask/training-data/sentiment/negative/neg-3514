Worst service ever. Waitress, hostess and the lady who served us. Can't stand ppl who think they going to get tipped with non existent service. Waitress took off when one of the ladies in our group asked her to skip her first so that someone in our group who knew what they wanted could go first. Then I had to wave her down to get our order down. Then she asked if there was something wrong with the service. Well obviously if you didn't get a tip! Won't be going there again.
