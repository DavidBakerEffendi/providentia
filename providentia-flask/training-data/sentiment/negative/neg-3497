We came for Pi day. Surprisingly it wasn't busy at all. We were greeted by a super friendly girl who seemed to be the only productive one of the bunch.  She literally was doing everything. There were 5-6 employees behind the counter.  It was very unorganized. They were only putting two pizzas in the oven at a time. There was one girl who was simply cutting the pizzas.  She had a number of pizzas to cut but she was wandering around and being extremely slow.  There were three of us who ordered right after each other, all in the same group.  It took us 20 minutes to get our last pizza. She was cutting pizzas one at a time and delivering them.  We saw all three of our pizzas come out at the same time but she cut other peoples pizzas who ordered after us and skipped ours.  They were out of all the teas but one.  We asked if they could refill it twice.  We got two different answers.  The final answer was it takes 8 minutes to brew, but no action to refill.  I would have understood if the place was packed but we got there before the rush even came.  We took our pizzas to go, one of which was not completely cooked through. Half of it was raw. Would have returned it but did not want to wait/deal with the terrible customer service.  Will continue to go to Blaze.  Much better service and supply change management.
