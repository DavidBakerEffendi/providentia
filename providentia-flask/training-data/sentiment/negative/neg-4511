Co-workers and I decided to order take-out from Pei Wei for dinner, last Friday night. This location seemed like it would be the closest to work, but still ended up being quite a drive. With the construction going on near ASU, it took us nearly an hour to get there and back.

When I went to eat my food, was rather amazed to find a staple lying on top of my rice underneath the lid! Also found what appeared to be some facial hair in our chicken lettuce wraps as did my manager in his entree. Aside from all that, the food seemed subpar compared to the many other Pei Wei locations I have visited. 

Tossed the food and didn't even bother to call and complain.
Definitely will not be going back.
