We had a party of 8.  Came in to have Margaritas and dinner before heading to watch a fitness competition across the street November 11th.  3 of us ordered their signature margarita.  Others ordered Mexican beer.   Beers came out warm with NO offer of chilled glasses.  Our margaritas were the worst margaritas we have ever had.  Each of us took a sip.  Asked immediately of the waiter to either try and fix them or just offer us a beer.  His response was that the margaritas could not be fixed.  It is a premix and we would have to pay for them regardless.  Wow, great customer service (NOT).  With the lack of concern and service as well as underwhelming drinks, we decided to pay up and head over to the competition.  We hit up a restaurant up after and spent $350.  Had a great time with better than average food.  Can not see how they are called Margaritas and have the worst one each of us ever had.  I am not one to post negative comments often, but this was historically terrible in our book!
