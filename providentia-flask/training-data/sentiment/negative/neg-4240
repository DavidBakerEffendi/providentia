So I guess I spoke too early? We had such a good experience yesterday at breakfast we decided to give it a whirl for dinner. We got seated right away. It wasn't that busy. Perfect I thought, "I'm starving!" So we go through the menu... I'm getting the Sin City burger! My girl even figured out what she wanted.... So far it's been about 7 minutes. No one has taken our drink order, said "hi I'll be right there" nothing.... The people next to us got their food, changed their minds, asked for it to go, got boxes for everything, got their check, paid and left and still we sat there... Feeling kinda dumb at this point.  It has now been almost 10 to 13 minutes with no service what so ever!  So I asked my girl if she wanted to go and she what I was thinking "yeah let's go. They don't seem to care that we are here."  So we got up and left. No one said a word. So FAIL today Toms . So we ended up at New York pizzeria.
