I have come here twice and I have been disappointed. My second trip consisted of a very loud environment (can't have a decent conversation here), waitress not explaining/placing orders properly and getting attitude from the manager. I got the Oreo milk tea and I was so excited to try it. Once I got it, I realized it was a tube of ice in a cup. I did not realize how much ice there was until I dumped it out in front of me. I called the waitress over and she went to speak to the manager. She came back and told me that the manager will not give me another drink because I "finished" the one I already had. Really? You literally gave me a tub of ice with some tapioca at the bottom which I struggled to get out. The waitress went back to the manager and she was not concerned at all. The waitress gave her the receipt and she threw it out. She walks over to our table with so much attitude and asked me what my order was. I did not realize they were closing cause the whole place was full of people. The second drink came and I almost threw up. It was all powder probably "blended" in a dirty blender. Mind you, this drink was also full of ice. I knew I was not crazy cause I had all my friends try my drink and it was disgusting. Way to go Bubble Republic. You failed twice to make the same drink. Repulsive drinks and service. Never coming back.
