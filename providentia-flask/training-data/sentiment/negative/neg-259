I was very disappointed in the food here. They  are overpriced for what they give you. When I think chicken wings & Chinese food in the same sentence, I don't expect to see little drummettes & not a whole wing. It sucks that this is the closest Chinese restaurant in our area. We drive about 20 miles to the east side for decent Chinese food.
