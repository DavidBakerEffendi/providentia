Sloppy work, the side edge of my big toenail was completely missed, and there are little "slivers" all over of pieces of nail not completely trimmed/filed off.  Didn't lotion/massage my hands at all, and the foot massage was REALLY short.  The tub wasn't filled with water when she had me sit down which is unusual.  There's a bench seat that ends up being a bit uncomfortable to sit on...it's at a weird angle, too high.  
I just left and am already planning to squeeze another appointment in somewhere else super soon before I go on my vacation.  I don't want janky looking nails.   I will never return, it was a waste of time and $$$$.
