Love me some McDonald's on the way home from Las Vegas. Made it over there this morning just in the time for breakfast. Was very disappointed why I reached in for my sausage mcmuffin with egg and someone had already taken a bite. Gross! Pick a different location for your post partying feast (unless you like partially eaten breakfast sandwiches).
