I tried really hard to like this cafe. My husband and I tried this place for a quick lunch. If only it was quick. When we came in the gentleman behind the counter let us know that it was counter service and then have a seat. No problem. We ordered and proceeded to sit outside. The seating was a bit odd and mismatched, somewhat uncomfortable. The noise from McDowell made it hard to have a conversation. After about 30 minutes, a man came out and asked if we had ordered the tamponade. We said no. He said, "well you can have this, it must have been extra." We let him know, by description, the two sandwiches we were waiting for. 10 minutes later a woman came out and put them in front of us without apology or letting us know what she was leaving. 

The food was okay, but not good enough to overlook poor service and a 40 minute wait. 

I went to the restaurant website and sent an email in hopes that it was a "one off" day and would have appreciated some feedback. None came. As I said, I really wanted to like a local neighborhood cafe but can not recommend at this time. The search continues.
