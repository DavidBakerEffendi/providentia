Horrible service for over priced food. Tonight was a joke. My father never got his food, and asked for his money back; the guy couldn't have cared less and never offered an apology or tried to make it right. We sat at our table and watched the staff walk around aimlessly while food sat on the ledge ready for serving for far too long. My 'iced tea' was hot, and they wouldn't give me a re-fill. 

I'll never go back, and would never recommend to anyone I know.
