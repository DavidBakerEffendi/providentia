Food is great but no sauce for the meat, I don't know what's the right way to eat it but every time I order uber eats for this type of food I expected the sauce to come with it. It's OK if it's extra charge but plz put into the sides option with all the combo. When I see the menu I thought that's like extra sauce so I didn't buy it.
