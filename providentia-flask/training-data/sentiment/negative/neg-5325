I went in to get some dinner with my sister , the server was awesome, we ordered some chicken tenders some for me and her , not only did the food take forever , mind you that it was dead in there, not busy at all, 40 minutes later we got our food, bit into the chicken just to find out it was completely RAW, BOTH OF OUR PLATES OF CHICKEN were raw. it was disgusting. the manager came to our table just to say sorry and take the plates out of our way, he took the chicken tenders off the bill, but couldn't even comp the drinks, what a waste of 40 minutes to not even eat. I work at a restaurant and my mangers always make sure to make the guest feel comfortable and satisfied , but here that was not the case the manager didn't even care that the chicken was raw.
