This one is a fiasco. Compared to the one (same name) in Irvine, CA it is a joke. The food taste really bad, the service is way below par and they don't care one way or the other if you ever come back. I guess they have enough local citizens from China where they do not have to miss anyone. We use to go there a lot for we do love chinese food but after going to California and eating at the Sam Woo in Jeffrey Rd. (Irvine) is like comparing a cold burger to a freshly made In and Out. We ordered several dishes and most were served cold and tasted like, really prefer not to say it. I would encourage patrons who love chinese food to go to the Pin Pan Pon in the Gold Coast Casino. At least there the food is above average. Besides the fact that they only accept cash, Sam Woo in Spring Mt. Road is not worth spending your hard earned money. Bad Attitude, Terrible Food, what is there to like? 0 Stars!
