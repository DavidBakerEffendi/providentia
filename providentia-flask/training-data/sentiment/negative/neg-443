Update: I hate to drop a business from 4 to 1 stars but the last 3 times I have been there (and brought friends that I have bragged to about the quality of the food) I have been so dissatisfied that I won't return. I gave it 3 tries and wanted it to be good again but the food has consistently been dry, overcooked and/or burnt to the point that it is black and like charcoal. I'm not talking about a good grilled and crispy outer crunch. My daughter ordered the Mac n Cheese. How do you ruin Mac n Cheese? It was dry, very little cheese or cream or something to make them more than cooked noodles. We asked if they would add some cheese or something it came back no better than it left. The wait staff is still great, the beer tasty but the cooks need to be replaced before I will return :(


I love this place. Would never have known they were there except for a friend who took me there. Fun atmosphere, especially on the weekend it does a great business. The food is excellent, although expect to clog an artery. Mostly very fatty foods. They make their own beer and it is good. The BEST WINGS I have ever eaten are here. Do yourself a favor and order the regular hot wings. I have tried a few of the other "more interesting flavors" but was always disappointed that I didn't get the regular hot ones. And the wings are the full sized ones, so a half order is always enough for me. Service is always good but expect to wait a little bit to get a table on the weekends b/c as I said, they get busy.
