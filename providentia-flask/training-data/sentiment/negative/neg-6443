If you are dark complexion I would not recommend this place. 
They will sit you in the back next to the restroom even though there are plenty seats in the opening. 
Also instead of educating us on the recommended menu items the waitress told us that there was a dog section outside for dogs to eat even though we had no dogs with our party as if she was referring to us.
Weird experience
