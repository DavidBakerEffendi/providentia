Can't even begin to express the horrible experience a few friends and I had here. We called in an order for pick up and upon giving our first order they tried to rush us off of the phone when we weren't even close to finishing the order. One of my friends ordered  a wonton soup and general tso's chicken.. When we got to the restaurant it was pouring rain outside and there was not one customer in sight and once again we were rushed out the door.. The poor service was one thing, but after driving 20 mins back home we realized we were missing 3 orders!! We did not get the wonton soup ordered or the General tso's along with a few other things, but I mention these specifically because we called back to complain and explain (at this point we were irritated and over it) and the same rude lady working there said "you did not order the wonton soup.. When we ordered we were pacifically asked if we wanted a small or large wonton soup and we responded with a small so there is no way they did not "get the order" it was just purely neglected. Bad service, and messed up orders. Not even worth the trouble.
