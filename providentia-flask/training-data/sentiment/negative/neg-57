This is my second visit that things still seem so unorganized. Signed up for the app like all the advertised signs on the door say.  5 min later go in the store and turn out they sent expired coupon. Manager made zero effort to gain a new customer. The first visit I ordered the 4 piece and requested certain pieces and offered to pay the difference to get the piece I want and they told me they could not do that and will not do that even if I pay the difference, they even asked the manager and the manager was extremely rude. Customer service is obviously not important at this company and gaining new customers.
So when I get back to work I am talking to my employees town but how rude the management is in this place and the lack of respect they have for customers. I pull up the app and show my employe The app I just downloaded in the The coupon that the manager said was expired. As I start to review the coupon I realize that the coupon is not expired and does not expire until next month. The manager saw the date of the 18th but never looked at the month, unfortunately I was so upset with the situation I did not pay attention to it either. Needless to say they lost a customer and a lot of work by mouth just cause I can't even pay attention to simple basic things
