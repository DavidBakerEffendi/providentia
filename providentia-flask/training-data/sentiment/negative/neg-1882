I just had a Chorizo burrito supreme and an elote delivered.  The tortilla was crispy as though it had been overdone.  The lettuce inside looked wilted.  Once I got through half the burrito, the Chorizo virtually disappeared. The Chorizo itself was dry as though the whole thing had been overcooked and to top it all the burrito was really cold.  Very disappointing.  I ended up tossing what was left.
