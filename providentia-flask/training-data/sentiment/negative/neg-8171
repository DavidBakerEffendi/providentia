This place was pretty bad. For 15$, we got to fill our plates from an assortment of terribly prepared foods. There is also the option to have a freshly grilled steak or other meat product. I asked for a medium well piece and was given a rare steak. At least the second time "Sir" (as his name tag said) got it right. The steak and rolls were basically the only good thing, because everything else tasted almost exactly the same - bland, cheap, and nowhere near worth what I paid. Even the drinks were bad. This restaurant provided terrible products at a terrible price, and I can't even believe that people still come here in large groups. 

Stay away, even McDonald's beats this place.
