Just went in and had the absolute worst customer service ever at subway. Just because you probably got stuck working a Sunday night doesn't mean you have to emit that bitterness to the customer. I walked in and waited forever for someone to come out from back. Then someone finally came and this skinny white dude didn't even acknowledge my prescence. No hi, nothing! Long story short the kid made my sandwich with attitude. Never makes for a yummy sandwich! Now it's a shit sandwich which I'm still going to eat because I'm hungry! Ha. Then he checks me out and doesn't even hand me my sandwich and bag, I had to practically reach  over the counter to get it. Maybe if you're so unhappy with your life you should do something about it!
