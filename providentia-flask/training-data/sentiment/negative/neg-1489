This review is based solely on the lack of customer service at this location. 

We'd planned for days to have an early family dinner out on Saturday. We arrived a bit after 4 pm. We walked in and the young man at the host's podium did not look up nor did he greet us. Well,ok, maybe you're new and don't know how to appropriately greet your customers. He told us it was going to be 5 to 10 minutes of a wait. We looked around and the restaurant was barely full at that hour. Why the wait?  Very curious. As we moved toward the seating, I thought it was odd that the rude host didn't even bother to ask our party's name or the number of people who were dining. My husband went back to the podium to give him our names and again, no eye contact from the host and a mumble that he didn't need it. Again, very strange.  The host seemed immersed in his work of some kind; reviewing a chart over and over. Come on!  If you're the host, do your job!  

While my husband and son used the restrooms (which they reported were gross and smelled of urine) I sat there getting more miffed by the second. Why should I give this place my hard earned money? No way. I decided we were leaving. 

On our way out the manager opened the door for us and thanked us for coming. Hah!  I asked him if he was the manager and he said he was. I promptly told him that the host was rude and recounted the story. It appeared as if he was going to reprimand the offender but guess what?  We did not receive an apology from the manager. That is the very least he should have done. It starts from the top down and I know who the main culprit is.  I've decided to never go to this chain again! Ever!  Get your team together manager or this location is doomed.
