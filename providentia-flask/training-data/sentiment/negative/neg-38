This place is quite large with a 2 floor patio with casual plastic patio furniture, indoor and outdoor bar and 4-5 sand volleyball courts, lit at night, that appear to be recently renovated. 

Their beer selection is what you'd expect for a suburban bar. 15 taps at the outside bar (about 2-3 crafts) and about 5-6 taps inside. 
Food (most entrees are sandwiches with fried appetizers under $10) and drinks are very reasonable priced. There's valued specials like $1.50 tacos on Wednesday nights and the ground beef in them is not greasy. Their 'signature burger' - A Razzle burger is two 1/4 lb beef patties) in between 3 buns with McDonald's sauce. These are the places' saving graces. 

The drinking water is from a well and is horrible. None of the 14 people in my party finished their glass of water after we ran 10 miles immediately before coming here. This is frankly unacceptable. To be extremely charitable, it's enterprising, as the customer's alternatives are buying bottled water and Gatorade. It's disrespectful that you would serve it to your customers. Excessive iron is my hunch for the cause. 

I'd buy a water testing kit to bring here next time but you already lost about $1,500 of service from me and my 15 teammates for rest of this summer.
