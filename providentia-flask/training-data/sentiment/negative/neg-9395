I'm so conflicted by this review. I expected so much from the reviews...maybe because I live in New York and I've eaten my fair share of meatballs. I was not amazed or satisfied with these meatballs. I tried their beef, chicken, pork and veg meatballs. It's hard to even pick a favorite from the four. The meatballs were flavorless, mushy, and just not right. The appetizers and sides were good however. I loved the quinoa. The cheesy bread and salad were solid choices. But the star of the show should've been the meatballs and hence the 1-star. Probably would not give this another chance. Sorry!
