Horrible food. Went here with my gf and everything down to the sausage was disgusting and gross tasting. Hash-browns are extremely undercooked. Low quality foods,cooked like crap. This place used to be some other dump a way long time ago and I remember going there then even and throwing my food out and going across the street to mcdonalds.
