We've gone here twice. Once with our 4 kids and once just the two of us. The food is just down right nasty. Burgers are dry, fries were soggy almost translucent greasy. We only went the second time because we believe in giving local business at least two chances (everyone makes mistakes). You'll be making a mistake if you expect to get good food here. 
We are Harrisburg locals and this restaurant is yet another experiment from the many thousands of new yorkers who have emigrated here.
