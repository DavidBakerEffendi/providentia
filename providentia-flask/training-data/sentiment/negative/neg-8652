This place was one of our favorites... We really enjoyed their food but the customer service especially with the owner turned us off. It seemed as if he was annoyed that we did not order any soft drinks or alcoholic beverages. It doesn't matter where I dine... I ALWAYS order water and nothing else. Our family bought a handful of groupons and unfortunately we won't ever go back. The last time I dined at the restaurant I over heard the owner say "oh look there's 2 waters again" which made me feel very uncomfortable.
