$3 cash only entrance fee per person- no matter what. 
We were going to use the batting cages and we had a group.. 3 adults and 2 children were with us who were NOT going to be using the batting cage at all and yet we still had to pay $3 each for them.. to sit. $25 per hour for use on the cage.. we reserved 1 for 2 hours. In that time, the pitching machine stopped throwing balls twice, got caught on the cycle once (was supposed to stop after 25 throws but it just kept going), and random people kept trying to take our cage. We'd have to tell them that we reserved them, and had they looked we were actively switching people out and using it. On top of that, when we first walked in, NO ONE was using the batting cages and the woman at the window said that they weren't letting people use them; after arguing with the manager, they finally let us use one. Shortly after all the other cages were being used. What did they mean they weren't letting people rent them out? Obviously they didn't want the money? It's $25 PER HOUR on top o the entry fee per person.

A previous time we went, we wanted to rent out 3 of the cages... they had a problem with that. No one else came by that day... so they missed out on $75. 

Poor management, nickle and dimes everything, food/drinks are expensive.. the idea is nice. the fields are nice. But this place in general is a joke.
