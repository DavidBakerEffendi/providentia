The hotels customer service was the WORST I've ever experienced in my entire life. I stayed there for my birthday weekend a week ago either four friends and was told we could only have two towels per room. After much haggle, I was finally able to receive 4 towels (one per person) and received numerous calls at 5:30am about blankets. Really ?! The following day I called the front desk and it took an HOUR to receive extra shampoo and conditioner for us, and we ended up being late to a dinner we arranged for my birthday. I complained to a manager about the middle of the night calls on a Friday night, and the extreme delay and struggle of obtaining shampoo and I was told it would not happen again. The following night we received the same issue with receiving extra blankets. I called and spoke with a manager named Erica the following day and she was unable to track down the person calling and saw how upset I clearly was and refunded me the resort fees for the inconvenience. When we checked out I was informed that they had made a mistake on their part on charging (even though I booked the hotel through booking.com) and that they would deduct it from the refund I was suppose to receive for all of my inconvenience. Nice, right ? I called today to respond an email about my refund and was put on hold for FORTY MINUTES only to be hung up on. Even after my stay at this wretched place they're still giving atrocious customer service ! I HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest staying elsewhere such as the Bellagio and only going to the Venetian to shop and dine. If you do decide to stay at this hotel it's guaranteed your stay will be ruined by their staff !!
