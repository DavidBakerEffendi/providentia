Their customer service is absolutely horrid, it comes with the culture but come on. I like the food but the customer service is appalling, they help out Koreans first. You could be seated the same time as another Korean party, and not even have your order in, while they are having their food served. Overall I would stay clear of this place, there are more professional places.
