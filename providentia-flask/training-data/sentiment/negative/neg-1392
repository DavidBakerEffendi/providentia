The review is actually 2 parts for this restaurant.

The quality and taste of the food is 5 stars. The reason I rate it 1 star is that the restaurant smells like pinesol which they use to clean the tables. They actually put it in a spray bottle and spray it on the tables to clean them off. This would be fine after hours but when I'm sitting at a table and eating pho, the last thing I want is do get a face full of pinesol spray because if it's hitting my face, you know it's going into my soup.

The last time we ate there, i was halfway through the meal and they sprayed the table next to me and as soon as a waft of spray hit my face, i pushed the pho away and told my wife I was done. 

A few minutes later, a couple came in and I heard the woman whisper, "It smells like a bathroom in here". I told her it was the pinesol. They took their order to go.

It concerns me that if they are spraying out in the dining area, i'm sure they're spraying in the kitchen so unfortunately we will not be going there again. We have tried superior pho before and while we didn't like it quite as much, we'll give them another try assuming they don't do the same thing.
