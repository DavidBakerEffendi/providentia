I was very excited to come to this restaurant because I always see the parking lot busy & being from Montana I love anything with a mountain-like feel. The ambiance is great inside & I love that they allow dogs. 

The food here was great! I could probably eat the Grizzly Fries all night long. The lemonades are tangy, yet yummy. The sticky ribs with the plum sauce were amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the umami fries. They tasted bland & lacking that delicious umami taste. I'd definitely recommend the buffalo chicken lollipops to start. 

I wanted to give this place 4-5 stars but I was so upset with the lack of customer service that I do not want to come back at all. Our server Yanique was basically a ghost, which was odd because she servers tables all around us & seemed wonderful. She would chit chat & check back on people constantly. My husband & I, barely saw her at all. Anytime anything was delivered it was by someone else. It took forever to get even a water. She never asked how our food was, never asked if we needed anything else, never asked if we'd like dessert...I've only ever experienced this kind of service once before & it was poor service based on racial discrimination because my husband is black & I am an Asian woman. I sincerely hope this is not the case but that's the only difference I can see between our table & the other table served around us. When we spend $60+ on a meal I at minimum expect to be treated well.
