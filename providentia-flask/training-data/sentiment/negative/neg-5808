HUGE disappointment. We had high hopes coming here after reading the reviews for this place most of which are four or five stars. Turns out the slams were more accurate. We ordered the chicken fried steak and mini KooKoo bites (basically popcorn chicken),which came out to about $25. Visually both lookedpretty good, but that's where the praise stops. The steaks and nuggets were utterly tasteless and uninspiring. There was no flavour, no dipping sauce, no nothing. We tried a few of the different powdery condiments which were all pretty gross variations of different salty flavours (e.g., lemon, plum). The accompanying fries were straight from the freezer, tasteless and like biting into a hollow cardboard stick. Everything was so bad we only finished about half of the food, which then sat on our stomachs like a ton of bricks for the rest of the afternoon.

The condiment stand on our table with the ketchup bottle and powder shakers was also seriously gross. The shakers were all sticky and dirty, but the ketchup bottle on our table was particularly nasty. I used a napkin to pick it up and could still feel I could still feel a sticky layer of dark gunk on the front of the bottle. Rather than buy new bottles of ketchup this place would rather saver a few bucks by continuing to fill up the same old disgusting bottle.

The bubble tea that came with each combo was decent, but that's about the only good thing I can say because we'd never be KooKoo enough to set foot in this place again.
