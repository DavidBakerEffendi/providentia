Update review:

I used to love Gal's Sushi.. it was high quality sushi and Korean food all in one place..and a great dinner spot with friends throughout highschool and university.

I recently came here and was extremely disappointed. We arrived for dinner at 6 and surprisingly.. for the huge decline in food quality.. this place was still at capacity.

I ordered the 18 pc maki combo ($15).. it came with 6 pcs spicy salmon, 6 pcs shrimp tempura and 6 pcs crab meat maki.

The rice was awful. Just looking at it you could tell that it was mushy and too wet. Upon tasting it.. it was mushy and warm.. something tells me they ran out of sushi rice and used regular rice they serve with the Korean dishes and just slapped something together. I'm not sure if I had a one-off experience.. but this is definitely the last time I am coming here as the prices are pretty high for the low quality food I was given.
