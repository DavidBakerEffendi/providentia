I have no idea where all the other good reviews are coming from, they couldn't have possibly eaten at the same place we did. It is very small, and very dirty. You would think they would be able to keep it clean and I am not talking about messy I am talking about caked on gross, I would never put my child in any of the boosters or high chairs. Staff seemed more concerned with having "fun" at work than taking care of customers. We tried to order wings but for some  reason that wasn't possible and wasn't really explained. So we both ordered burgers that were just frozen patties, the garlic parmesan fries were good if most hadn't been swimming in greese. After reading the reviews we were excited to try it, I am really at a loss as to what happened and why so many good reviews, when it was so very bad. I also am not sure if the bar attached is part of them or a different establishment.  We didn't venture into the bar since the 2 men standing in the doorway were haveing an argument.
