Went here with a camp card for buy one get one free.. used once and they punched a hole in my card and told me the 2nd time i went its not valid. Apparently the cheap owner decided not to give more then 1 use on a multi use coupon. I will make sure to go to another dairy queen in the valley everytime i want dairy queen. They also have the worst customer service saying it is policy and to call the manager. It is a multi use coupon maybe the owner should learn what that means. Also good job wasting your product as i did not purchase the blizzards because i went to another dq that accepted the coupon. Your loss not mine. Hope the owner sees this message as i am also sending it to dq corporate.
