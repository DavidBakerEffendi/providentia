The First time I went It was great, this time I went,it appears that all the sucsess has gone to their head..............EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!
called Heath Canada , and City of Toronto Heath Inspector!
We took off hungry,and for greek food just head to Golden Pizza 1 min. drive...Perfect! 
Or just drive south on Pape, and go to Greek Town 2 min. away! worth the drive!  
unless you want to get sick..Why do i say this?  
The guys on the grill, the one that i seen had a pony tail greasy greek that had his bear hands on top of the six souvlakis  trying to keep them warm for 20 seconds and then into a pita on a plate, this is the truth!!!!!  Grossed out to the point that  i was glad i ordered just a greek salad. I heard of people getting the runs, diarrhea  ( BOTULISM) and know i know why! 

Do people realize how much bacteria sits under our nails,and under heat our hands get sweaty? Do not take my word for it ,but go take a look for yourself! do not take my word for it. i have a small Video clip where the cooks warm up pita bread on the grill and they use their hands and pressing on the pita that soaks up the sweat from the hands like a sponge!  to me that makes my stomach sick just thinking about it!  
when it comes down to it, screw that,i do not need food bacterial infections,or worse , food poisoning. all their food is precooked, so when your there ordering,or sit down dinner, take a closer look!               
now eat at your own risk!!
