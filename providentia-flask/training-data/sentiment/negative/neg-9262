The experience of golfing off the edge was fantastic and fun but my disappointment comes mainly from the staff. Our waitress never returned so we ended up going to the bar to order a drink. Then the continued immaturity from the staff was ridiculous. Staff were chasing each other around the bathrooms/restaurant area flirting constantly. Then towards the end when we were leaving, they were goofing around behind the bar that ended up in a glass being broken. Did they handle that professionally? Nope. They started creating more of a scene than was necessary at all. One of the younger guys was d*cking around with the bartender very loudly saying, "what the f*ck did you do that for, it's all your fault!" In a joking and completely unprofessional way. All customers were looking at them by this time and instead of apologize for the interruption they continued to goof around and curse behind the bar. For the $50 an hour that they charge to golf, I'm shocked that there was no management or maturity among the staff. Extremely disappointing.
