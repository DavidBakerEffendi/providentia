After years of being away from home I decided to go to my favorite deli for my first meal back. I spent the rest of my trip regretting my decision. I ordered 1/2 Salmon Salad sandwich and matzo ball soup. The matzo balls were tiny and the soup didn't taste as flavorful. My spouse ordered a brisket dip, and for the the first time ever he didn't finish his sandwich. He said the meat tasted tiny and rubbery. Little meat flavor and we could tell it was reheated in a microwave. We also ordered desserts to go that were sugar filled with little flavor. We spent the rest of the night sick in the hotel bathroom. I think the amount of attention and pride in the restaurant has significant declined. A local favorite that I continually bragged about became our only disappointment in the trip.
