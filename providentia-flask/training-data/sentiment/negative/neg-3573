So disappointing. We were looking forward to spinach pie somewhere in our 'hood...I have to say everything was sub par:

- tomato salad was not fresh; veggies were tired and soggy
- flat bread tasted like it had been sitting at the back of a spice store for way too long -- took all night to get the horrible taste out of my mouth
- olives had a funny aftertaste
- red wine was warm (ew)
- spinach pie was so-so; had no flavour 

I suppose the lentil soup was okay, but I've had much better. It's pretty bland.

I'm writing this in the hope Momo's will change its ways; I hate panning independent businesses and I'm not a picky eater but wow. It was bad. Maybe just an off night, but we won't be returning to find out.

Our server was very nice, however a different server pounded on the bathroom door while I was in it.
