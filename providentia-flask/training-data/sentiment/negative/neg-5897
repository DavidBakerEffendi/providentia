This is the second time I have come to this location and they've messed up my order. I didn't check both bags until I got home and they forgot my nuggets! They gave me the sauce for them but didn't put them in the bag. Last time it was fries. It's not rocket science. The people who work here really struggle to do a basic job. Ugh.
