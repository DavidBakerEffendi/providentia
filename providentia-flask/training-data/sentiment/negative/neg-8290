After reading all the rave reviews of this place we decided to try it! Bad move! Perhaps it was a fluke but we had an uninterested waiter, awfully strong and non-mixed bloody mary oyster shooters, and two bland, overpriced entrees. I was excited to try the lobster grilled cheese, but it was incredibly bland and lobster was a little over-cooked. My boyfriend had the seared ahi caesar salad that was incredibly fishy and actually made him run to the bathroom afterwards. I wonder why...?  We got out of there as fast as possible but not without feeling incredibly frustrated with the service and the poorly made, way overpriced meal we had paid for. Will NEVER go near that place again.
