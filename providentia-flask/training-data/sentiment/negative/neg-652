I have never had such terrible service as we received at this place. We got there around 5 and we had a couple groupons. No where on the groupons did it say one per table ( I think they were for a pizza and some wine). The waitress gave us total attitude about using them. She finally allowed us to use 2 of the 3 ( we had 8 people).  It took her almost an hour to take our order and then she told us we could not leave off any of the toppings on the pizza because they only had one cook and she wasn't going to confuse him (we wanted mushrooms left off one pizza, difficult and confusing I know). After another hour we finally received our pizza. We decided to try dessert which took us another hour to get.  Never once did she refill my coke or offer drinks to anyone else at the table. At 9 we had to leave and could wait no longer for the check so we gave the group we were with some cash and left. They said it took another half hour at least for them to pay and leave. 4 Hours for pizza and dessert is nuts!!   


The waitress gave us attitude the entire time. So much so that we are still teasing the girl who arrived there first about what on earth she could have done to have angered the waitress before we got there. PS. She didn't do anything, she didn't even have a drink when we arrived.

By the way I love dogs! I have had one all my life and even volunteered at humane societies. However, when I go into a restaurant the last thing I want to see is a dog sitting on a chair at the bar with his head on the bar. Gross!

Never again.
