We were driving toward this location (3/4 of a mile away) at 7:35pm today when we called for a pickup order of 2 sandwiches. Trying to be courteous, as they close at 8, we called ahead. We were told by the guy to call another Caprioti's that closes at 9pm. She was told it was too late for pickup orders. So then she said well we'll be there in a few minutes and maybe then they'd like to make us some sandwiches? By then he kind of changed his tune, but I was already irritated.  Off to a biz that wanted money. Why can't these small businesses treat customers right?  Do these workers understand they are going to be replaced by machines? The service will certainly be better.  With large sandwiches inching closer to $20 each now, you're better off going to a true restaurant. You clowns won't be getting any more beer money from me.
