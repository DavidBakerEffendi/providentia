This is one of worst sushi bars I ever been too . The service sucked the waitress took like 20 mins to give me a refill of my water . And to top it off she came over and tried to see if I tipped her a lot of money or something that's just very rude you should wait till the customer leaves to get the check. So 0$ tip for her . The sushi was the most bland sushi I ever ate . Never going back again .
