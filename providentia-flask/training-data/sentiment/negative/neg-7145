This is the first time I've ever written a review without having sampled the food. I want to just state that right off the bat so you don't immediately dismiss me as a weird, obnoxious crank.

So we walked into the place at around 12:00 on a Saturday and there were five or six people in line waiting to order. It'll move pretty quick, I said to myself.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

The person at the head of the line was asking all kinds of questions about additions and replacements and combos and the clerk taking her order was indulging all of it. Look, some people have no consideration for the people around them. That's just a fact. But even if that's so, the clerk should not have allowed this to go on for more than a minute.

This went on for a full five minutes. And I was getting more and more annoyed. But fine, the idiot finally placed her order and a couple more people placed her order and it seemed like we were getting somewhere.

Not quite.

The person directly in front of me began by asking a series of questions. Yes. He himself had stood through that inconsiderate goon at the front of the line and then, when his turn rolled around, he decided to pull the exact same nonsense. And, making things worse, he was placing an extremely large order. I stood through five minutes of this and then I was out the door.

I know I'm probably coming off as unreasonably impatient here. But we're living in a society, okay? You have to have *some* consideration for the people around you. And if you can't do that, then it's up to the people in charge to step in and say, "hey, this behavior isn't acceptable."

I'll never return. (This goes without saying, no?)
