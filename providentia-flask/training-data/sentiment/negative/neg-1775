The food is wonderful and the server, Autumn ,  was wonderful but the reason why I will never eat there again is because of manager Christie Vay.  She is very disrespectful and condescending and because of her attitude and unfriendliness , the whole experience was ruined . We have been guests on several occasions at the Wynn and Encore Tower Suites .  I don't ask for better treatment because of that . I ask that every customer be treated with respect .  I doubt she would be rude to the VIP players .  It was just so disappointing and now that Mr. Wynn is no longer affiliated I'm guessing this is what will be .
