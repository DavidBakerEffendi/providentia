We came in around 1230 pm (lunch hour) after being lured in by the sandwich board sign boasting pizza in a cone! Excited, my boyfriend and I waltzed into the place. There was no customers in there at all, and no servers to be seen anywhere. I guess if we wanted we couldve scooped ourselves some gelato and took off! Haha. After about 5 minutes of checking out the menu and wandering around the shop, we are like "where the hell is the people who work here??"
I kicked the top stair a bit and a couple mins later an uninterested guy ran up the stairs. After giving our orders, we were informed the cones were not ready, and wouldnt be for another half hour. This left me wondering what the hell he had been doing all this time, since the place was clearly deserted for a while. He told us we could order gelato while we wait, as if that would be a suitable option for lunch. Having nothing else to offer, and no genuine effort to keep us or have us come back in a bit, we found somewhere else to eat.
