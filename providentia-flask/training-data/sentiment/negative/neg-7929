I went through the drive thru. The temperature and texture of the fries you could tell they were extremely old. AND I had to wait 5 minutes to get them. When I went back to Ask to exchange for fresh fries, the workers and the manager,Tracy were playing with the managers hair. They continued to complete orders without washing their hands. Including my fries.

No apology, nothing. "Here's your fries" and back to the managers hair.

There is a Burger King right up the street. Go there.
