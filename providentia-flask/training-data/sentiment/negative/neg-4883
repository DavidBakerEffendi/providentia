I went there for dinner around 6 on a Monday night.  The line wasn't as long as I expected and it moved quickly.  We were seated within 10 minutes.  Anyhow, the meal was a huge disappointment.  I was expecting great quality food after reading the reviews on yelp and trip advisor.  At first, I was a bit overwhelmed with the selection, but after walking around several times, and narrowing down what seemed appetizing, there wasn't much to choose from.  The salad bar was a joke, with few selections of veggies and mainly green leaves.  I got prime rib (cold and tough), kobe sirloin (tough and tasteless), pesto mashed potato (probably the only yummy side I could eat), something that looked like beef stew (tender and flavorful and but too cold!), creme brue le (gross....the inside was watering), rotisserie chicken (cold and bland), crab legs (I could only wish it was served steam instead cold).  Argh....bottom line, I wish there was a microwave to heat up my food!
