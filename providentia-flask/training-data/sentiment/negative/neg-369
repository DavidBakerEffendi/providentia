Visited on a Saturday around 12:15 pm. Both drive-thru lanes were about 5-6 cars deep so I decided to go inside to save time as I was running a little late for an event. When I got inside, there were 6 people standing at the counter waiting to order. There was only one cashier and she walked out from behind the register and announced to everyone that we had to order from the automated touch-screens behind us because "that's how we're doing it now".

There were 2 screens to choose from and a group of 4 people went to use one of them so the rest of us lined up to use the second screen. I asked the lady "We can't order at the counter?" to which she replied "No". Meanwhile, 3-4 more people walked in and up to the counter. While the lady was showing the group of 4 how to place their orders, a young man stepped behind the counter and took the orders of all the people who had just walked in. So apparently we were lied to about being able to order at the counter as well as jumped in line by those who were allowed to do so.

Eventually, I got my turn at the touchscreen and placed my order. Went to wait for the food and watched all the people who walked in after me get theirs first. Needless to say, I ended up being even later than I thought not to mention irritated at being lied to and then passed over in the queue. Guess I should have stayed in the drive-thru lane, although judging from other reviews I probably wouldn't have fared much better....
