I'm just waiting for this restaurant to appear on Ch 5's dirty dining.  I ordered your basic run of the mill Pho Tai.  The bean sprouts were slimy, the lime was rotten.  Needless to say, I didn't add anything to the soup except for some chili sauce.  It wasn't very good without basil, sprouts, etc so I only ate about 1/3 of the bowl.  Luckily I only live 30 mins away from this place because I barely made it home in time for EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA.  I have called the Maricopa County dept of health and reported the incident.  If you value your health, stay the hell away from this place!!!
