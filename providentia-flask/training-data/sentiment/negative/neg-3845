If it was possible to give this place zero stars I would.  I hate to give low reviews, but the manager I met of this location is incredibly rude and this place is so poorly run I'm surprised they have any business.  

I met up with some people on a Thursday night.  I went inside to try to get a drink because the outside bar was crowded.  There were maybe 3 bartenders standing around inside.  They came up to us and told us the main bar was reserved for a private party so we had to get our drinks elsewhere.  Ok, fine - I go out to the outside bar, but apparently there was no way to get a drink from there (the line was very long and not moving).  My friends had been there for an hour and said they were still waiting on their food and one guy was waiting that long for his first drink.  At that point, I decided to go somewhere else since we weren't going to het service.

Fast forward a couple of months.  One night we had gotten some beer from the Beer Temple and decided to play some cornhole on the shared outdoor space (the Beer Temple has their own cornhole boards that don't belong to PSH).  That space isn't owned by PSH; it's an Ayrsley community space.  The manager came over specifically to us to see if we had bought anything from PSH and to try to get us to leave.  She did not aproach the other people who were clearly PSH customers.  Even when we informed her that we were allowed to be there, she was quite rude and clearly not happy that we weren't leaving.  When I went over there later to ask her about it, she said she talked to everyone there who was having a drink and made the excuse that she was liable for any alcohol purchased from PSH.  Apparently this is frequent that they are rude to the Beer Temple customers on the shared space.

There's really no excuse for this behavior to me.  I'm sure some people have had great experiences, but I will certainly not support a business like this.
