This place is AWFUL!! We ordered maybe $100 worth of food and the cashier made a mistake no problem,   manager arrives and couldn't perform the simple task of splitting the bills in half, causing her to charge one of my friends $28 3 times on his credit card...the remaining 28 were paid with a 100, was given the wrong change and it took over 20 mins 2 managers and various over charges on a card to get simple change ..we got NO apology, and ATTITUDE when confronted with the problem. The "manager" then proceeds to lean on to her elbows heavily sigh and look at the computer..all the while I'm thinking what is this chicks problem? We didn't make the mistake?

ON TOP of that, some of our food came out cold all the while half the party is at the register for 30 minutes dealing with an employee who can't admit she fucked up.

Don't go here, save your money.
These people were completely unprofessional. 
If I can give 0 zero stars I would.
