Here's a few tips Pho Bamboo: 1- change your hours of operation on your website. If you're not open 10am-Midnight Saturday-Sunday.... don't have that show on yelp and your website. 2- if you close at 9pm, lock your door and turn your "Open" sign off when it's 9:23pm. 3) don't recommend we go to your "other location that's open til midnight" (pho Tempe) only to find them to be closed. Awful customer service and I don't recommend to anyone. The place was a mess too so maybe it was a blessing in disguise we weren't able to dine here.
