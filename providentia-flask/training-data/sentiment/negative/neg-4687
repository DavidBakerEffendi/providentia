Slow service. Staff was pretty stuck up and yet didn't know what German Reisling was when I tried to order it. Small, small and smaller portions. On top of it not being very impressive quality. Super expensive. And after 2 hours of being there I am broke and hungry again. No thank you. Will not be returning here.
