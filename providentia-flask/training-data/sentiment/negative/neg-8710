This place has gone to hell! I just paid $12.00 for a plate of fat and grissle, smothered in cheese. They call this carne azteca. Not the first meal I've complained about either. Ever since Martin left, this place is mediocre at best. We used to love their food. Now we're just happy if its edible! I guess they think these small town gringos don't know the difference between good food and garbage. We'll just smother it in queso, and they'll love it. Get your shit together, and have some pride in your work.
