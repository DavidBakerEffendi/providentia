I came here once and ordered the vegetarian and I can tell you it will be the last time I eat here. The sandwich was borderline inedible. It was essentially just a pile of mayo on white bread, just a few shreds of iceberg and a little tomato. I didn't see any of the avocado that was supposed to be on it and I asked for sprouts which weren't included either. Sent it back, they added the sprouts and avocado but it was still a sad excuse for a sandwich.
