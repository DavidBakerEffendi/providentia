Arrogance or ignorance?  I don't know and I don't care.

Dec 7th, I got home and considered my options.  A stuffed pizza from Oregano's, God, that sounded SO good. I called at 8:13pm and ordered the pizza.  "You know this pizza takes like an hour" the super-happy server asked.  "Yes I do", I said.

At 9:00, I left my place at 20th St. and Missouri Avenue.  7th Street was closed.  ?!!!  Central Avenue: closed.  7th Avenue, closed.  A parade...

Oreganos: Thank you for calling Oreganos!
Me: Hey, that pizza for Teddy?  Won't be able to pick it up...
Oreganos: Why is that?
Me: BECAUSE ALL THE STREETS THAT LEAD TO YOUR RESTAURANT ARE CLOSED!!!!!!!!!!  Why wouldn't you tell me that?
Oreganos: Oh...I thought that parade would be over by now.  (Laughing) I could 'run it out to you'...oh, just kidding!

Literally, while hungry, an entire 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  Oreganos didn't know or didn't care...that The Parade of Lights Parade all but closed access to their restaurant.  Fool me over and over again.  All for the love of a stuffed pizza.  

Hey!  Oreganos!  I'll come back, at some point.  But my point now is, it'll be 6 months-year from now, instead of one/week.  Any kind of customer service, "Gee, sir, I'd love to get you that pizza but you'll have difficulty getting in here until 9:45", that kind of customer service.

So, I could not go south but I could go north. I ate a delicious pizza from the new Rosatti's on 16th and Missouri.  Fabulous!
