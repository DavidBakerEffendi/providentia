Living in phx for 10 years now this has got to be the worst Mexican place I've gone too.  They have weird tortillas that resemble pizza crust but taste like cornmeal.  I ordered enchiladas and they came out like soup with everything piled on top of those gross tortillas.  My gf ordered a wet bean burrito and she asked for medium and it tasted like it was cooked with ghost chilis.  We both like hot but this was absurd!
