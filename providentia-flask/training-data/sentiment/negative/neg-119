Consistently giving us inaccurate orders. Specifically on one shift however. The mid shift will always at least forget one item, if not completely mixing up and order with different items. Not to mention waiting in a fast food line for 20+ min defeats the purpose of "fast food". We now only come later in the night due to constant lack of attention.
