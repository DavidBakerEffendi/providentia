Decided to go here for a quick lunch because we'd heard so many good things about it. The menu sounded really great and we had a tough time deciding what to get but we both ultimately ended up disliking what we ordered. The chicken panini was tough, dry and had barely anything in it. The southwest salmon wrap was just plain awful. I couldn't finish half of it and my boyfriend couldn't even take a bite. It was very mushy and tasted awful. I waited for the waitress to come over to tell her I couldn't eat it but she only came back to clear our plates. When she asked if I wanted a box because I didn't eat it I told her "no, I didn't like it". To which she just said okay and brought the check. She didn't offer anything to make up for it. The French fries were pretty good. But other than that, avoid it.
