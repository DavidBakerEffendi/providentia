Food was okay.
Not amazing but pretty good.
Asked to give them a tip at cashier and i gave $5 not knowing eveything here is self service.

Waited 30 mins and i realized that they skipped my order bc people behind me were getting their orders. When i asked them if my order is ready they did not say any word. Waited another 10 min and i recoeved "some" of my order and she said rest will be ready soon. Waited another 20 mins then i asked for refund for the food that i did not get. 

I will never go back to eggslut. Its not worth spending  hour waiting.
