Food - 
we ordered and shared the sesame ice cream crepe. The verdict: the crepe was dry and almost crispy-like (not even close to how a crepe should taste like). Oddly, they filled the crepe with cut up sponge cake ?!?!!!

Service -
When we arrived, no one came to greet us instead 4 servers were just hanging out behind the counter and yelled out sit wherever and when we choose our spot they said "not there" (because we needed to be at least 3 persons) and then my friend pointed out a group of 2 who were sitting at a 3-4 person table and her excuse was to blubber no and forced us to sit in between two busy (and might I add super tight) tables. 

I've lived in this area for at least 10yrs and it's my first time at Pastel. Man, what an awful experience. 

I am going to warn my friends NOT to go here cuz honestly, their customer service was unprofessional and their food was not measurable to a delicious crepe dessert.
