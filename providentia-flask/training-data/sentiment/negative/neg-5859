You almost ruined my day with your extremely poor service. My buddy and I stopped in for soup and salad - thinking that would be a good quick lunch. My waiter couldn't have been anymore dead inside if he tried. It was extremely hard to get any service out of this guy. The waiter was bad but, the process is worse - so slow. Not the place to go for a working lunch. Slow - awful service but, the food was decent. Won't be back to this location...ever.
