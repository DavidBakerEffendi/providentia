Went here because of the ratings just for it to be a on the contrary from everyone's options on how good the service is here. The whole time there our waitress was not attentive after getting our order she never came back not even to ask if we needed refills on our drinks. Secondly it took forever to get her attention to give us the check... the place isn't big so she couldn't have missed us. When it's time to give her our card to pay she's in the back talking.I raised my hand so she could see and her and the cook started talking shit as if we can't hear them saying that " I don't understand why they get so mad when they're just going to tip a dollar.. first of all a dollar is probably too much to tip a waitress who can't even manage this ten by ten ft establishment.
