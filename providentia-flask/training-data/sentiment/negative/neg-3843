This is our second stop here. Love the name, but that is all. 

First stop we went through drive-thru. The barista seemed cool. He was funny, so we were really disappointed when our lattes came out far from hot. 

Today we decided to give them a try, but decided to go inside for our lattes. Two people were ahead of us, and had already ordered. There was nowhere for them to wait, so they were both at the counter. Weird configuration inside. Too many tables. 

We stood there for a minute and decided what we were going to order. There was a barista running the window, and two other employees off to the side. Making sandwiches??? Coffee??? I don't even know. 
None of the three greeted us. 

After waiting for about three minutes with no progress and no greeting, we left. The vibe in there was an unhappy one. No one seemed happy about their jobs. 
I don't know how this place has such great reviews.
