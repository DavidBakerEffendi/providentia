There is NOTHING remotely resembling a crepe from France at "Paris Crepes" in Montr√©al. 

In the mood for a crepe, I stopped in and asked for the most basic crepe: butter and sugar. This was $5. FIVE DOLLARS for basically 4 tablespoons of milk, flour and egg. 

Oh, best part - if you want to eat it there and sit down? It's Six Dollars - for ONE crepe.

I asked the delightfully dim girl behind the register if the $5 crepe was particularly good, soaked in Brandy or had some other reason it was so pricey. Blank stare. No answer.

Silly me, I fell for it and shelled it out to satisfy my curiosity and hunger.

It was palid, undercooked, tasteless and very, very moist. Very little butter, a light sprinkling of sugar and that's it.

Best of all, the "chef" folded it in thirds and then wrapped it completely in newsprint - ensuring the delicate taste of newsprint had permeated into the crepe by the time he handed it to me, lo some 15 seconds later. 

It tasted like paper. I wanted to spit it out.

You know, in Paris, they use a small newspaper cone so your hands don't get greasy - but because the crepe is cooked slightly crispy, with lots of butter and usually has a dash of some liquor. It works and soaks up the grease.

This does not. It works the other way and the paper flavor goes into the moist, undercooked crepe.

Anyway, this has all the makings of a tourist trap owned by some well-to-do family who bought it from the original owner and has NO CLUE on how to run a restaurant. My guess.

Avoid.
