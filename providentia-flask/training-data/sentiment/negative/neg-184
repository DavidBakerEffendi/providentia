Fail!!!!!
Don't come here!!
Food sucks !!
Go to demetres down the street!
Not sure why they haven't listened to the reviews on Yelp! You need to change this menu and the chefs because the foods bland and awful! 
My boyfriend got the all day breakfast with a scrambled egg crepe and the egg was not even cooked all the way and the crepe wasn't even cooked! 
He also ordered chocolate chip pancakes and they chocolates were on the top sprinkled lightly and nothing on the inside.. they were basically 15$ plain pancakes !!! 
The only good thing we had was the white chocolate milkshake but it was so tiny !!
