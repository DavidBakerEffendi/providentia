**Pathetic service and bland food**

The worst indian restaurant i been in the US yet. My friend ordered a Sweet Lassi and they served Salt Lassi. 

We had to call the server everytime we need something. Always unattended by them. Even though it was not a busy night and there were more than 3 servers working. 

We got chicken pieces in an egg biryani. If you are a vegeterian think twice before you eat here. The food was def not fresh and was flavourless. 

Never going back. And do not suggest anyone to try this place out.
