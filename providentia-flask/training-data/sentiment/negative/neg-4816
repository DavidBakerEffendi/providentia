Went here yesterday for lunch, arrived at 1145ish and sat at the bar. There were two others sitting when I arrived. I sat there for 15 mins while the bar tender did not even greet me. I had to get my own menu from the wall right as you walk in, and the only way I knew where they were is because I saw 4 parties get sat and that's where the servers were pulling the menus. I was finally acknowledged after I had my menus. I then asked for an Iced tea, and it looked like I was bothering him for asking. Again it was about another 5 mins before I received my tea. He was too busy dealing with take out orders, and seating other people as they walked in. It was about another 5 mins to place my order and when I did he looked at me and said I drank my tea to quickly. Who says that? To top it all off there was a lady that walked in a few moments after I received my food and sat at the other end of the bar, and the way he spoke to her was astonishing. He could barley hear her as she was soft spoken while trying to order, and at one point he threw his hand up and said never mind lady. I could not believe it. He gave me his name but I'll keep it to myself as I am not that guy. Poor service and I was ready to walk out before I even received my tea. Will never come here with that type of service. The food was perfect tho so if you feel like being ignored and want to wait 20 mins before your order is taken, then this is the place to come and sit at the bar. Unreal!
