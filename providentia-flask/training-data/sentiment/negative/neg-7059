Tonight was the first night that I have gone here and I mean I get that they were close but also VERY rude. My nephew wanted milk so my sister went to get it. The worker there said "if you wanna order something go to the bar" so my sister went to the bar and the bartender said "you have to get the milk from them and I can ring you up here" so then again my sister was walking back to the female worker and asked she then said "wait" and left my sister standing there for 5 minutes laughing in the back with other employees. They constantly looked to see she was standing there with my 1 year old nephew for a carton of MILK. I honestly think management should train their employees to know that even if their closed it won't hurt to pass a carton of milk over the counter.. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! and I've worked in customer service most of my life!!!
