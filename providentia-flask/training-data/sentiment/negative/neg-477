Walked into this place because I saw they had dishes that had Duck in them. Walk in and I see that they have ducks hanging already ready to go. I also see that they have to go boxes for rice AND DUCK. I asked the guy if I could have duck wings and feet on the to go box. He said, in his broken English, they only sold whole, or half a duck. I asked how much was the whole duck because I couldn't see where the price was on top of the board. He just ignored me and turned around. Now I was in disbelief and that pissed me off. 

  Hate being ignored. Can't he cut up some effing duck feet and wings from the whole ducks? Shit if this place doesn't sell that, like he says, which is bullshit because they have the prices and boxes. Hes lazy ass just didn't want to take the time to make it. Mind you that place was open BEFORE the scheduled time of 11AM. But closed to customers. So what the hell was he doing before that he didn't have any already cut up?

  Oh I know! He was just sitting on the table where you CUT THE DUCK reading a newspaper. Now that I write this down I am so glad I didn't get anything from here. After this I went to the 99 market and bought me some frozen ducks legs and I felt like going in and launching them shits at his face and saying, "You don't have duck feet?" "Here!" *throws them at him* "Cook them shits up!" If someone would have filmed me I would have done it. Asshole. Hope he chokes and dies like those ducks!
