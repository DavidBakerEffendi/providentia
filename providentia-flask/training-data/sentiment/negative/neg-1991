Went here because of watching it on food network and wanted to try the spaghetti pie. My stepdad and I went when there were very few customers. We were greeted by a very annoyed looking waitress, and when my stepdad asked for a table closer to the tv( no one in the place) she rolled her eyes and did. To make matters worse, we could smell the bathroom. (We weren't even close to it.) I couldn't find the spaghetti pie so I ordered the Mediterranean meal and my stepdad ordered the lasagna. The food was great but could not make up for the rude service and terrible experience. Ever since then, I have hated the place.
