My fianc√© & i arrived here on 7/30/18, we already knew what we wanted to order so I go up to the counter & was COMPLETELY IGNORED by the two ladies chit chatting to each other as I stand right in front of them. No hello no nothing they kept talking as I stood there ready to order. I was about to lose it & say are you guys done talking or are you gonna take my order?! But as soon as I was they finally knowledge me. So anyways we order two carne Asada burritos. This time they didn't give us no chips. Which the first time we went they did so that was disappointing as well with the customer service. In total it came out to $19.46 pretty steep but very good burritos so worth it. But the customer service is very bad, the cashiers name is ADILENE & the other more dark skinned lady I couldn't catch her name. Both need customer service training. The only nice employee was the cook that came out with our food & said thank you. Anyways it's pretty pricey but food is very good! But guess you can't have it all because CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BAD!YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!
