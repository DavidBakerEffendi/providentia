If you enjoy below average noodle dishes this place is for you. We went here thinking it would be a reasonably priced meal before our show and we were less than impressed across the board. Calamari balls appetizer were better suited for playing jacks. The noodles were spectacularly unimpressive. They brought us a plate with basil so wilted we had to ask for some fresh to use for or meal.
The only thing good about the whole experience was that it didn't last to long and it has a big window looking out to the sports book.
Don't waste your time or your money there's a McDonalds upstairs.
