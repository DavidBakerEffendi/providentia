One of the worst service i've had in a while.

3 of us sat on a table for lunch. We placed our order pretty quick but waited forever to get water. From my understanding, Pho is simply broth you pour into a bowl and add meat/veggies. It took our table (of 3 guys) almost 30 minutes to get our order and the place was not at capacity. After we finally got our food, I asked for some cilantro and other stuff on the side. It never came and I wasn't surprised. 

Furthermore, the table next to us had an accident and the baby sitting at their table spilled his food. After the table paid and left, I heard the server (also our server) constantly complain about the party complaining about their service. 

It wasn't hard to see that the service wasn't good and everyone had every right to complain. The Pho was decent but not great and I was starving waiting for my food. Probably better pho places around the area.
