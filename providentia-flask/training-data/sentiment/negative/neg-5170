My wife and I went to have lunch, and immediatelly we noticed our waitress had an attitude towards us, but mostly towards my wife, we couldn't put our finger on it, but she was rude and she wouldn't make eye contact, through out our entire stay, food was ok, nothing special, "over price¡¡, oh almost forgot, a lot of flies
