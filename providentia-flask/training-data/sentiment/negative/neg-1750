We had just returned from out of town and I was craving Mexican but the man wanted to watch the game. We decided to use Eat24 to order Chuys and unfortunately we both agreed we should have starved instead of ordering from them. But to back it up let me mention that I was super excited for my Elvis combo. I wanted to try a little bit of everything with all the meats! I also ordered a soup because I love tortilla soup and I am pretending it is fall already so it is prime soup season! The man ordered a chicken "big as yo' face" burrito.
 
Now it probably wasn't the restaurant's fault that we waited for 2 hours before our lukewarm food showed up. However we were getting 'hangry' by the time it showed up only to find we had the completely incorrect order! Ugh! Since the receipt for what we ordered was in the bag of different food I think I can put this one on the restaurant. So this review is for the random food items we received.

Nachos - the chips were super-duper salty and the salsa with them was not impressive. Whoever ordered them left off the cheese and beans which would have made it better I think. The chicken fajita burrito that we received had a couple pieces of chicken and a little bit of cheese. The rest was all beans. If you want a bean burrito definitely order this item, but not if you want chicken. I had the unfortunate experience of the veggie enchilada which had very few vegetables or cheese and a semi spicy sauce but was mostly tortilla. The best part of the meal was what I think was the deluxe tomatillo sauce. Thank you random stranger for ordering this it made eating everything much better! 

Now all of this would have probably warranted a 2 rating except for a couple things. First, Chuy's charges a "packaging fee" for to go orders. I didn't see any mention of this anywhere on their website. Hidden fees are not cool! The other reason for the low rating is that both of us had upset stomachs after eating our various items.
