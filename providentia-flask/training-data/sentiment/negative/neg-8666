Went on a groupon $20 for $10 deal, I was disappointed even having spent $10. Ordered a burger and salad. Menu stated "mixed greens, red onions, carrots, tomato, cheddar cheese, wonton strips", I received a handful of iceberg lettuce, a tiny bit of grated cheese, and an under-ripe tomato (no carrots, onion, wonton strips etc.) Salad came in a styrofoam container with a plastic fork, even though we dined in; I don't expect fine china, but you can't do any better than styrofoam? 

I didn't have huge expectations, burger was decent, on par with a in and out/five guys but at 2X-3X the price. Manager (owner?) seemed to be trying, but I can't imagine this place will be long for this world.
