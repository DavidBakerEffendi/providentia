I tried to give this place one more chance and unfortunately was disappointed once again.  The bartender Bobby, seems to not be happy being a bartender.  I asked if they had any happy hour specials and he said (with a straight face) "it's always happy".  He proceeded to say, "what do yinz want?"  I had to ask for a list of wine and cocktails so I could decide because he didn't bring any drink or specialty drink menus to us.  We got the Polish Mules, much like a Moscow Mule but with Belvedere vodka.  He then proceeded to tell us that he had to charge us for each bottle of ginger beer separately.  So, when the bill came we were charged $7.25 for the vodka then there was an upcharge of $3 for the ginger beer?????  When we went to close our bill, we were charged for another full ginger beer but only a small amount was used.  At that point we asked for the bottle of ginger beer to go since we paid $3 for it anyway.  I really want to like this place but I have had the same experience about 4 or 5 times.  I don't feel welcomed, I feel like an inconvenience to the staff (Bobby) How can anyone want to go back to a place that makes happy hour make you feel awful?
