The steak was great, but the service was horrific.  Half the food didn't come.  The sides came after the steak.  We had to request to speak to the manager 3 times, who turned out to be very rude and didn't want to hear our side of our story about the bad service.   It took a long time to get the bill.   They had a ton of excuses for the bad service, but didn't want to offer any decent resolution for our problems.  The horrible service didn't make up for the good food quality.
