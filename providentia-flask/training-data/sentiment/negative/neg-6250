The only things I enjoyed were customized pasta, mashed potatoes with gravy and the dessert here, otherwise everything else was mediocre or really bad. Sushi was a let down, the roast beef was dry and lacked flavor, the mac and cheese was a funky cheesy, the salad was lacking something I couldn't exactly put my finger on, and the mexican food was beyond horrible.
For 30 bucks per person, the selection was limited and the seating was pretty crowded. I got hit on by some creep during my meal, so for sure I wouldn't want to come back here.
