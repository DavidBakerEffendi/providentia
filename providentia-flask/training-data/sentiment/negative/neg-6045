So it's raining, I didn't feel like going out.  

I made the mistake of ordering from this location.   

The store is literally 200m or less from where I live so how long should it take?   Keep in mind it was a tough order, a medium pepperoni!    Well it was about an hour and 10 minutes.   

The pizza was cold and dry.  

Does this alone deserve one star?   Nope.  

The rude response every time we called to figure out what was going on.  Eventually the person on the phone hung up on my girlfriend.  I had to take the pizza back to the store to get a refund as they couldn't process it over the phone and they couldn't send the driver back as the manager wasn't around.    Ridiculous.   Our love affair with dominoes is over.    Never had this problem with the Bathurst location.
