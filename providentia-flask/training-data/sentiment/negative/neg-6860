This place sucks so bad when it comes to service for breakfast.  Had a waitress tell me she just started her shift and couldn't deal with me. Then has her manager wait on me to which they could not manage to cook the bacon.  Mean while watching the lazy waitress talk to everyone waiting tables including the manager. That was waiting on me not going back there. I got better service at Denney s.
