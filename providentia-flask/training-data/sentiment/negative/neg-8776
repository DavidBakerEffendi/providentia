I was really disappointed at the service I received here a few days ago.  The line wasn't super long by any means and they had quite a few people working, however, the person manning the register was also in charge of cooking the pizzas and he was running back and forth.  Needless to say, my pizza was burnt around the edges and way too soft in the center.   I also asked for only half my pizza to have spinach and artichokes but the guy put it on the entire pizza and realized only after the fact.  I really didn't want to wait for another pizza to be made after each mistake so took it as it was and continued to be disappointed, not that they offered to remake it anyhow.  

This was my second time here and both times I have been disappointed so I will definitely not be returning, nor can I imagine myself recommending this place to anyone in the future.
