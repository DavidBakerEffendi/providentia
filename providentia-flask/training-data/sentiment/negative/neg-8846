I will never stay here EVER again... For the price the room was ok... Planet Hollywoods suites are much nicer an 1/3 the price. The thing that upset me the most was when housekeeping came some of my make-up went missing. The daily charges are outrageous an when I asked about them the front desk clerk was so rude an I was very nice when asking... Had a amazing time with people I was with but the hotel itself will never see my business again.
