We came here today and were placed on the middle floor. I am guessing they were having issues with the misters because they were coming on just be shut off. I myself got sprayed with water, which had scared me but the maintenance man politely explained what was happening and I totally understood, he even comped us for the scare! Which was the best part of our experience. When they failed to come back on I asked a manager what was going on, and was told the bay next to ours' fan had a leak and the guests did not want to wait for the issue to be resolved and just wanted the fan. I don't see why their request has to ruin the entire floors experience. My wife was hot and really wanted the misters on. Ours worked just fine. I understand customer service but the need of the many out weigh the need of the few! Plus, it was a grown man complaining about the fan. Thanks for ruining my wife's experience, diva!
