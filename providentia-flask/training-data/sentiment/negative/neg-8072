We've been to a lot of bbq joints and this has got to be the worst! First, we were greeted by an employee with several hickeys all over her neck. There were three of us in our party and we each had to repeat our orders because she was unable to focus.
We got our food pretty quickly, but just as quickly we were all extremely disappointed. Everything from the appetizer to the meats and sides were very oily or greasy and  without much flavor.
We spent ~ $50 and threw out most (almost all) of our food. It was a huge waste of time and money.
Word of caution- if anyone has high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc.., steer clear of this place as there is a lack of healthy choices on the menu. 
As it was getting late, and we hadn't eaten our dinner, we headed over to Dean and Deluca to grab a quick and healthy salad and soup. They offered quick and friendly service, and quality ingredients, as usual!
If you're in the mood for bbq I would suggest trying Midwood Smokehouse as a much better alternative.
