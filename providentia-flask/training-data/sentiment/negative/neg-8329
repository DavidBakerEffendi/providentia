Well the chips and dip are pretty good. Service sucks though. I asked for sour cream literally like the minute we walked and and they brought the chips and dip. It took roughly 10mins and 3 people later to bring out some F*#king sour cream.
Not impressed. Staff sucked, food was OK. The only thing I give them 5 stars on is the atmosphere, You walk in and you know your in Mexico, you just know it. It's very festive. Why would you close at 9 o'clock? The food let me talk about that, O yea I can't because I don't remember it, I just know it took 30 minutes to get some sour cream...CRAZY!?!. I tried to look at the drink menu that was on the table but it was just so sticky and dirty. I won't be back EVER!
