Oh man...big mistake...ruined my last dinner in Vegas.

My party went over to Caesars Palace, but after seeing the price of $50 a person, they opted not to go (even after I offered to pay for the difference, wth?!). I was super excited to try the renovated buffet. 

A person who shall remain nameless suggested this place. Since we were all staying across the street at Palazzo,  why not?

Meat undercooked, "freshly made ramen" that tasted worse than Cup of Noodles. No meat options. They even ran out of Salmon sushi 3 hours before closing. 

It's true,  you get what you pay for. We saved 25 a person but we missed out on a potentially great dinning experience. "Be true to thyself."
