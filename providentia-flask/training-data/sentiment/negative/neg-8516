I've been to this location twice now and I'm convinced that they are the slowest Jersey Mikes in the country. I understand that when you're a new location the employees will be a little slower but this is ridiculous. These guys need some major training. How hard is it to make a sandwich? For the love of God it shouldn't take 20 mins to get a damn sub! That being said I do still like their sandwiches.
