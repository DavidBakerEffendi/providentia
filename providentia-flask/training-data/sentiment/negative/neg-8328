One of the lousier restaurants in Montreal. Before we get into the food and all that, I'll have you know that it randomly closes despite taking reservations for that night. I know someone who reserved a table for a business meeting there at 8 pm with out-of-town execs, and when they showed up the doors were locked and the place was closed for the night. You're probably thinking who the hell would have a business meeting there, when Milos, Ferreira, etc exist, but that's besides the point.

Now for the ambiance - the interior is wall-to-wall plaster reproductions of ancient greek murals and there are framed pics of Greek islands and all that kitschy shit littering every wall. A real eyesore. 

The staff don't give one shit about you or your order. I have seen appetizers take more than an HOUR to come out from the moment you order. In the meantime, they bring you stale bread and a dish full of sunflower seed oil to dip it in. Literally, stale bread that was baked two weeks ago. 

Now, the rest of the food has moments of brilliance - the sausage, chicken, and lamb meat platters are really good, and the Greek salad is satisfying. There isn't a whole lot on the menu to be honest, but what's done well is done really well. 

I don't know why the owner(s) don't just strip out all the ugly decor, run the restaurant responsibly, and encourage the chef to keep it up. It could have been very decent, but once again the lazy Quebec loser attitude and allergy to money torpedoes another business.
