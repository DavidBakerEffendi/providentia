They made my burger wrong, I paid for a 1/2 lb. Double no tomatoes,  I got a single with tomatoes,  I told them they said tgey fixed it. I hot home and had a single, it was dry like McDonald's. Fries were way too salty. I'm a big Wendy's fan 3-4 times a week,  not this location. The manager was cussing (trying to keep it under his breath).
