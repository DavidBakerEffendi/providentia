This restaurant serves extremely good cashew chicken and soup but I would now recommend everyone to AVOIT IT. I was polite and cheerful but waiter in charge was aggressive and insulting, as if I was some lame intern he could boss around.

I complied but told him was attitude was disrespectful. He said yes and told me to do just what he said, raising his voice.

I walked away. A shame, I considered it at one point as the best Chinese restaurant around the 'hood. Always keep your head up people !
