This is the epiphany of fake Chinese food that reminds me why I tend to avoid Asian food in Montreal. Don't get me wrong, I love shareable sub-$10 plates with huge portions. But the food was so covered in starch and gelatinous sauce that we didn't even bother taking out the half-plates that we couldn't finish. Our first impression of the Salt and Pepper Pork Chop was "hey that General Tao chicken is mighty heavy!" (the general tao chicken we ordered arrived later it turned out). A few pieces of the glucose-heavy deep fried meat spelled game over for me, so we were quickly moving on to the MaPo Tofu. It was neither "ma" nor spicy, probably the worst attempt at MaPo Tofu I've ever tasted but at least it was edible. There's a limit to "mild", at some point it just becomes lifeless.

I noticed that the majority of plates coming out of the kitchen were one kind or another of General Tao [insert your meat]. Not to be confounded with actual Chinese cuisine.
