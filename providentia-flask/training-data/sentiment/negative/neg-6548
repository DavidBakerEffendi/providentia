Literally the worst service I've ever had in my life, easily. I can't remember what the food even tasted like or what I ordered to be honest. Must have blacked that out, all I can remember is thinking "where is the manager or one of the other employees of this empty restaurant to help this clueless waiter get the check right" after he messed it up for the 5th time. This was 75 minutes after we were ready to leave the restaurant, at 11pm on a work night. I mean, we had 8 people, but he said splitting the check would not be a problem, and after a half hour we told him just to give us one check and he refused and instead made us wait another 45 minutes. Amazing, really, if you think about it.

Never going back.
