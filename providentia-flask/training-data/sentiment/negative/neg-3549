Unbelievably bad service. I stopped in for lunch, approximately 12:30 on a Wednesday. The place was dead. There were three tables occupied, two of which had already eaten and were preparing to leave. The third was seated with one older couple. I was alone so that basically meant the server had all of 3 people to wait on. I sat, unacknowledged, for over 10 minutes watching her repeatedly run in and out of the kitchen or the service area, most of the time empty handed, as if she had a full house. The other couple had drinks so they had clearly already been waited on. It was incomprehensible to me what duties the server had that were so pressing she couldn't even swing by to take my beverage order. She stopped once at the other table to answer a question and then walked away, still without even looking at me. The gentleman from the seated couple got up and brought me a small newspaper, saying with a laugh, "To give you something to do because it's looks like it's going to be a while." I read a story about the history of The Sundance Kid and still had not been waited on. I was one person - how long would it take for her to take my order? 60 seconds, maybe 90 at the most? When I finally saw her make bussing a table and answering the phone a priority over getting my order, I'd had enough and left for another restaurant where the servers are capable of doing more than one thing at a time. I will not be back.
