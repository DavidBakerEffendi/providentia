My order was SHAWARMA chicken!!!
It's says PITA SHAWARMA CHICKEN but what I got was chicken in a an Arabic bread W.T.H
If you don't know the different between Arabic bread and pita bread there is big big different 
This was my second time there first one I thought maybe they are out of pita !! Big deal BUT now WHAT disappointed!!!!
