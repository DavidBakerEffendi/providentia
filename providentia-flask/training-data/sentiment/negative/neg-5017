I always try to look for the best out of a place, but it was difficult to find the good in the Treasure Island buffet. We decided to try it because we had the 2 for 1 coupon from the hotel, against my better judgement after checking yelp. The place was clean and simply decorated so we felt comfortable. The first problem was that there was a long hair in the tongs to get pulled pork, when my husband told the person behind the counter he just smiled and said "ok." We tried a little bit of everything from the BBQ section, we got slices from the pizza station, and salads from the salad station. All of the meat was dry and visibly old. You could tell it had been sitting for an extended period of time. The pizza tasted worse than Chuck E. Cheese, and the Cesar salad dressing was salty and tasted horribly. The dessert was ok. We had some cookies and sweets and they weren't bad. Another thing that I didn't like is that I heard the waiter in our section speaking very rudely to tourists who didn't know much English, which I find extremely offensive. We were so annoyed and disappointed with the experience that went to complain but there was already someone complaining and yelling not at the manager that we didn't want to wait. Needless to say we will never go back to this buffet or recommend it to anyone.
