I was very excited to try OMG sushi... turned out to be very disappointing. 
Bad vibes from staff, most of the sushi was excessively thick with extra rice, waited a long time for orders, had to reorder a few items i already ordered that they wrote down but they didn't put the order in and then when i asked about those orders they said its being made but after more waiting they still didn't put order in, it was far from busy, 3 tables to serve (thats including me) and the sushi chef wasn't busy with other orders. 
Some of the sushi rolls had huge chunks of rice & and seemed to be skimpy on the fill of some of the rolls.
Definitely appeared to be shorting customers to save a dime.  I knocked off some of rice because it was a bit ridiculous on some of the rolls and was surprised by the pettiness of the manager to say she was going to charge me for it, it was only about a tbsp of rice. 

here's what i tried:
James bond 
Amigo 
Super mario
Irish 
Omg pizza
Japanese lasagna
Sexy lazy
Oh kelly 
Taste like girl friend
 Sweet 16
Ssan cho
Touch down ( worst)

Dont waste your money here... Sakana Sushi is a much better choice!
