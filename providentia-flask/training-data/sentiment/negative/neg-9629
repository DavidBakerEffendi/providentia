ATTENTION OWNER NOT sure why when you place an order ahead of time wait 20 minutes for it at the restraunt then is brought to the front and the host sees it looks at the ticket and then takes the waiting people to their seat before giving the to go order. It doesn't make any logical sense the order of operations here has been like this for months and I have to voice it now!
