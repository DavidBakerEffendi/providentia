Have to say that we were beyond disappointed. First, they were out of a couple different types of fish that we ordered. We could have dealt with that if everything after tasted great. We were too afraid to grab anything that came out on the belt because we could tell that most of it was old and far from fresh. The service was subpar as well. It was one of those bad experiences where you leave feeling full yet empty because you paid to eat shit food. I guess it was too good to be true to find a decent sushi place that doesn't break the bank. A bit scarred and don't know if we'll ever be back. Guess we'll be going back to expensive sushi that we know will at least be fresh and won't give us the stomach flu.
