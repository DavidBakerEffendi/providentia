My mom and I went to this location for a morning smoothie. I remembered seeing a groupon available and I bought it waiting in line to order for 5 for $15. When I ordered the cashier rudely told us they don't participate in Groupon's and offered no apology. On the door is a whole letter explaining they aren't accepting Groupon's. They need a sign simply stating "Groupon's Not Accepted" because who is really going to read an entire letter while walking in? We spend over $17 for 3 smoothies. Plus the $15 for the Groupon. Of all the locations in the valley only 4 aren't accepting them. These locations should just be a part of the team and not give Jamaba Juice a bad name.
The smoothies are just ok and the staff looks miserable in silly hats they are obviously forced to wear. I won't be coming back again. I'll take my business to a team player location even after my Groupon's are used up!!!
