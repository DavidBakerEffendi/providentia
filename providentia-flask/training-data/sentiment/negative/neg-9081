If I could give this place zero stars I would!! Worst experience at the blackjack tables ever!! Timothy and Lulu the managers at the blackjack tables were picking on a black guy and accusing him of stealing chips!! Unbelieve how they were treating people at our table just becuause we were having fun!! I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE! THERE ARE OTHER HOTELS WHERE YOU CAN GO AND SPEND MONEY,  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE PEOPLE!!
