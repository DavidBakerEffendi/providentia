If this place was in chicago it would lose business to red lobster!  The food is ok but the quality of service could be better at a 4yr olds tea party.  If you like this place then you prob also like long johnsilver, and ass in the box.   Bread was cold, vegetables are better from seamer bag, and ask for extra salad with your dressing. Good luck
