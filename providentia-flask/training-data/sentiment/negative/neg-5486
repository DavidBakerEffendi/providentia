Although the visit started out as pleasant, it ended very poorly. First off, the food was okay and the piña colada was delicious. The guac was just some chopped up avocado with not a lot of flavor, and the carne asana taco was flavorful. The service was slow, especially since there was only one other table in the entire restaurant that the server was helping. We had asked for 3 shots of inexpensive tequila reposado, and ended up getting charged $36 for 3 shots (which we were told would be $8 each, not $12). The piña colada was advertised as $8.00 but we were charged $8.50, the guac was advertised as $6,  but we were charged $9 for it. The server, Miros, said that this was all due to "tax", but tax was also taken off of the total amount. She was very shady and rude, and didn't give us any straight answers. Both my husband and myself work in the service industry so we are usually very understanding and always appreciative of the service we receive, but this was just unacceptable. We will not be returning. We are highly upset and dissatisfied.
