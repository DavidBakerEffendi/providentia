They want to charge fogo de chao prices, for sizzler quality meats. 

I love trying local businesses, because murrica. Came here under a groupon, and would still not pay what they're asking. He came around with sirloin and started cutting. I looked at the piece, he looked at the piece. All fat, but he continues cutting. The meat was chewy/rubbery.

The salad bar was at room temperature, I took a bite of the mushrooms and stopped immediately. It was a bacteria cess pool. 

They advertise tri-tip, but no tri-tip. The best part of the meal was him coming around with (I shit you not) garlic bread in a skewer. The best part of the $80 was Texas toast and fucking garlic butter. 

I would have been better off spending the extra $15 a person and going to fogo, with at least decent quality meats. 

I'd maybe pay $15 to come back in the future.
