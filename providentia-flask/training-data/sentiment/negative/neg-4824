This buffet was a huge disappointment. For Bellagio being such a luxurious place I figured their buffet would be something to remember and brag about. To start you have to fill your own drink, first time I have ever been to a buffet that didn't do this for you with servers. Right off that made it fill much like a high school cafeteria. The food selection was not anymore impressive than any other buffet. The flavor was bland and lacking in authenticity. Huge let down Bellagio!
