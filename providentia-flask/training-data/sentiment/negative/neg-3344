My party and I chose Sushi Samba because of the advertising, but it was not at all what it was cracked up to be.  
The food was excellent But the ambiance sucked.  It was loud and cramped and it was difficult to hear the person sitting next to me.  The service was distasteful.  The waiter encourages to let the staff order for you, and you giving them a budget.  We weren't aware that they were doing this and we realized this as food that we didn't order was coming to the table.
Not my taste, as far as hospitality goes.
