Shame on them.

I was feelin' them for the well-priced $4.99 lunch special... but NOW they require that you buy a soft drink bringing the total over $7.  It kind of takes the fun out of being able to find a great lunch deal and just lumps it in with all the other lunch places.   Given also that Chinese food is incredibly cost-efficient to make, it's a shame.  They should have cut costs with all the extra stuff they provide you with - designed ornate lunch paper bag, special containers for the food, etc.

I still stand behind my initial recommendation of their actual cooking, but do not like their way of doing business.  Advertise the $7 Lunch Not-So-Special and see how that works out. 

dmo out.
