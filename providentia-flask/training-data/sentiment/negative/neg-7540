So this place was recommended from the university tours guides. Was hoping great local place. 
First we day outside and literally had to wait about 15 minutes and ask twice to place our order. 
The waitress never cleaned our table off and after finally getting their "famous" brats we had to get our own napkins, etc. I was hoping maybe the food would make up for bad service but it did not. 
This is a dive bar at best. And drink/eat inside so you can place orders directly at bar.
