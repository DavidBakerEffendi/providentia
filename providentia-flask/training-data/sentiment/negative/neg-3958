I wouldn't call that a burger... There was no flavor and ordering saut√©ed mushrooms (one of the few toppings they charge for) was a joke. There were hardly any mushrooms and the burger was actually smaller than the bun! The fries were hard they were cooked so long and the cheese sauce also had no flavor. It tasted like those cheap cans of eerily bright orange cheese sauce. Everything was just sitting in grease. There are plenty of burger places that make fantastic burgers... Try a different place!
