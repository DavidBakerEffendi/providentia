Today at 5:15pm, I received an email informing me my pizza would be delivered in 5 minutes.  30 minutes later, I was called by a young lady, asking several questions about my order.  When said said it would be another 45 minutes, I questioned her, and offered to pick up the pizza instead.  She hung up on me.  I called the manager, and cancelled the order.  The trust they were given is gone.  That would have been my first time, but instead, it will be my last.  I bought pizzas from Blaze on Horizon Ridge. Too bad Metro Pizza doesn't deliver.
