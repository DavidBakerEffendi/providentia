I am very upset with this location. I placed an order online for pick up and set my pick up time for 12:20pm. I arrived at the location and paid for my order and I was told that it would only be 5 more minutes - which I thought was acceptable. 15 minutes go by and I'm a little frustrated at this point. I asked the hostess if she would be able to find out how much longer until my order is ready. She went into the kitchen and came out and let me know just a couple more minutes. I got my order at 12:46....
26 minutes later and I receive my order that I should have gotten at 12:20. I am very upset with the service I received and I will definitely not be coming back to this location.
