I came to Panera bread for the first time, I was so excited to have one of their sandwiches because I had heard alot of good things. However when I got my bacon turkey bravo it was not fresh. The bread was soggy, the meat tasted like cardboard the tomatoes were just a gooey nasty mess as well as the lettuce being not fresh I would like to recommend not coming to this location ever 12 dollars for a soggy non appetizing stinky sandwich I will never return to Panera bread 

Furthermore the staff was very unreceptive the manager tried to tell me the sandwich was fresh and obviously had been sitting and soaking in the sandwich juices since morning NOT FRESH!! please Panera bread stop lying to and overcharging customers

P.S. learn how to count! When the return was made the MANAGER gave me incorrect change because she was upset about the sandwich return
