This place used to be Singapore Sams. Since then it has changed hands several times. I decided to give this place a fair try, not really expecting much. Don't knock it until you try it, right?

They have a day time buffet, that runs along side dim sum service. We request dim sum, and we get seated. Then for a long time afterwards we weren't served at all. The 3 waitresses serving the total of 7 tables (5 of which were doing buffet) were stupendously busy. I wish I knew how to look at busy at my day job. Then people would think I'm actually working all the time.

When we finally did get served, our food took nearly half hour to arrive. All of it was lukewarm.
Most of it was unsalted. And the soy sauce was bland/diluted. Upon going to the washroom, I passed by the buffet and realized many of our items were at the buffet. So then...why did our food take half an hour? The menu also has a few items that are translated wrong. We got a few things that we didn't intend to order. Overall, the meal was $60 with tip between 3 people. 
I don't think I'll be coming here again.
