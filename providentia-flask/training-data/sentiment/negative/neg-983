How can two restaurants have such  different portion sizes? I live in Mountain's Edge, the food at the N. Decatur is so good that I was happy to see a location was opened a bit closer to me on Rainbow, so I decided to check it out thinking everything would be the same. Boy was I wrong. The meat wasn't as seasoned and the size of the burrito (that I always get) was on the anorexic side. I tasted mostly flour tortilla... I was very disappointed and have not been back since. Yes the N. Decatur location is in an unpleasant neighborhood, and if you go late at night there may be a fight that breaks out amongst the intoxicated customers waiting on their food,...but SO WHAT!! the food is worth it!
