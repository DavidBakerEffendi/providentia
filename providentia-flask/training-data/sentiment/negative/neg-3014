From amazing to DISGUSTING. I used to come here regularly with my boyfriend and it was my favorite burger place. The last four or five times, every single time, my burger has been absolutely gross. It looks cooked mostly through (and I'm certainly not scared of a little pink) but the inside is cold and mushy and a horrible texture, like semi raw I guess. I kept giving this place a chance thinking oh it's really busy right now, oh maybe they have new staff tonight and it used to be so amazing but I'm fed up. 

I think I'll try the other location on the strip, hopefully they are better. The jazz fries have always been amazing here, so there's that. Sad to say I won't be back after almost a year (and my boyfriend even longer!) of going here.

Update: their strip location has closed. Says a lot. And their food truck was out of commission for repairs when I called.
