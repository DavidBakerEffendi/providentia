Im from New Orleans so I thought my Mom would love this for Mothers Day...WRONG!! The service was excruciatingly slow..was seated literally 20 mins before water arrived, antother 6 before 3 of the 5 drinks ordered came to the table. food took forever to come from the kitchen (and no, they werent too busy) and it was below average!! If youre looking for hometown food SKIP THIS PLACE AND HEAD TO LOLA'S!!!
