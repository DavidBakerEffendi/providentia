Yikes! I am crying as I update this review, but it must be done. Service is still excellent.

HOWEVER...we went in for our weekly dinner at Jogoya earlier this week, and immediately we noticed that the food (other than the sushi), looked plain old sad. My mom is a chef and said that from her experience, the food looks like it was reheated and not fresh like usual. That's when we should have walked out. But we love this place, we're starving, and did I mention we love this place?

Fast forward 12 hours later and both of my parents and I are stuck in the restroom....ugh!! I don't live with my parents so there's no other food that we shared. Sad sad sad week for us here!
