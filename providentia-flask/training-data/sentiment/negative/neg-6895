This place is incredible and not in a good way. Every time I go I order at the menu they ask me my order again at the window (which makes me wonder if they wait to make my smoothie once I've pulled up to the window). It seems as though all the employees are High School punks who are high on God knows what. The smoothies are hit and miss, most times tasting like water rather than the fruits they advertise, and honestly I'd rather go to Sprouts across the way and make my own smoothies at home. Very disappointed seeing as there isn't another smoothie spot as close to my home as this one.
