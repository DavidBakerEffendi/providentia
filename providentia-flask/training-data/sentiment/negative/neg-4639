If you're heading to the Rio for pho, drive the extra minute to go to any other pho shop in Chinatown. The soup isn't hot, it's not good, the onions aren't fresh, and the meat is chewy. It's a shame that this place appears to be owned by Vietnamese people because it's by far the worst pho I've had (and that includes the instant variety). Whenever I eat pho, I drink ALL the soup...it's just too salty and lukewarm to do that here. Free fortune cookie though, yay, lol.
