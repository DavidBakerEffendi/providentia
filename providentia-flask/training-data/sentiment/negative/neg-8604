Had lunch there today.  I was attracted by the menu.

Had the basic $13.99 chimichanga.

It came back soft. So soft.  A Chimi is spoda be HARD FRIED.

When one whacks a fork across it?  It should  meet resistance!I  it SHOULD CRACK WHEN THE FORK HITS IT!!!

It should NOT BE SOFT!  IT AIN'T A BURRITO?

IT SHOULD BE CRUNCHY!!!!

Not so here.

The initial chimi was rather "week cheese."   As it were.

I sent it back.

The kitchen was **&&%ING with me.  

The next SECOND CHIMI was even more horrible.

I declined to send it back for a THIRD TIME?  HELLO?  WE DON'T DO THAT?

It just truly sucked, sucked and sucked.  HELLO?  IT REALLY SUCKED.

I could not even begin to eat the crap they put in front of me.

I split the extraordinarily awful turd they put in front of me to open the center.

I ate a bit from the inside out.  The internals were great.  Too bad they don't know how to make A CHIMMI?

The center was awesome; so was the topping that lay around this excuse for a chimmi?

These dudes need to get their stuff packed LOTS TIGHTER.

THAT WAS THE VERY WORST CHIMMI I EVER ATE?

IBEN EATING CHIMMIS FOR 30 OR MORE YEARS!

THIS WAS JUST A TURD ON A PLATE.

ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRG.

The bartender din't charge me for it, plus to him.

That is a sign of a relatively well run restaurant.

The KITCHEN NEEDS TO GET THEIR COLLECTIVE **SES KICKED!!!

IT JUST SUCKED SO BAD!!!

AGAIN, THE VERY MOST DESPICABLE CHIMMI i HAVE EVER BEEN SERVED!
