i will never come back here again with my family.  we went on a christmas day.  the staff was very friendly and helpful.  the sashimi was fresh.  the tempura was a disaster.  the vegetables tempura were barely coated with the tempura batter like none at all!  the shrimp tempura was cold and limp!  we had some of the fish and they were not bad but very greasy.  orders came late and we had to order again and so in the end we got the same order twice!  the sea weed salad had some much liquid in it at the bottom of its bowl.   strange this was.  the miso soup was heavily diluted nearing the realm of blandness.  the meat skewers were good though.  

the dessert?  terrible!!!  the mango pudding tasted nothing like mango pudding.  i eat almost anything but that mango pudding was disgusting and i had to spit it out and i never spit out food even at home.  the mousse was basically flavoured whipped cream.  the good desserts were the ginger milk and the fried banana.  they come highly recommended by me.  

so a few good things but all in all a terrible place to eat.  

sorry matsuda, truth hurts but it's for the best.
