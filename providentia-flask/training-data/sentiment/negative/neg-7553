I have had my fair share of Chinese buffet. This was definitely the worst among all. Over the last four years, I went to this restaurant four times at an approximate interval of one year. Each time I went there, I felt that the quality degraded compared to the previous time. This time I felt like puking. The food was gross, stale and full of soy sauce stench. Remember it's a buffet and I found not a single item to be edible. All of the food items seemed to be recycled from week-old leftovers. Horrible, slam dunk horrible. I would probably try to report this restaurant to the corresponding food inspector. Please avoid this restaurant at any cost for your own good.
