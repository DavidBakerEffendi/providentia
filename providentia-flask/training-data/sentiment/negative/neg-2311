The place looks pretty cool inside. We were really excited to celebrate our occasion here because the food and drinks had such high praise. I ordered a Kiss my cucumber that, as advertised, was a bit short of a mojito. Yes please! When it arrived it was actually really gross. Gin, water, and cucumber doesn't sound like anyone's choice. Not wanting to dampen our night out I thought maybe if I add some sugar and lemon it would help but no. Brought it up and the Manager was so snotty. Read your menu, know your product before you argue with a customer. At least offer to take it off the bill.
Accepting that it's just a drink and moving on I ask for a box to take my food, which was pretty decent, the server gave me a warped to go box. 

Gotta laugh at their consistently to not give a shit about you, the customer.

Lol; high-five! You guys suck!!
