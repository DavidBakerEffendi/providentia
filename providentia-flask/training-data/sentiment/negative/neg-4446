Great location and decent food and vibe however one star review due to appallingly rude service.  Skip it unless you enjoy verbal abuse.

Was here earlier tonight with three girlfriends for dinner and drinks.  Service was aggressive and unfriendly from the get go however really crossed the line into rude at the end of the night.  We asked if we could have separate bills and we were informed it was not possible 'because the system was 15 years old.'  One of the girls in our group asked for clarification, wondering how it could be impossible to take the time to split a bill in a nearly empty restaurant at 1040pm.  The female server was full of attitude: 'If it was THAT important to you, you should have mentioned it at the start.'  She was rude and shockingly unprofessional throughout this interaction.

We ended up doing the math (I've attached a screenshot of how crazy this bill got), tipping as little as possible, and leaving.  A disappointing end to an otherwise nice evening.

Location is good (just north of First Canadian Place), didn't like the oysters (better at Chase and with better presentation), dessert was good, wine average, and service terrible.  Prices aren't really worth it either ... food is nothing to write home about.  Not bad but certainly overpriced ... $24 for shrimp tacos for example.  

Chain restaurant food at Daniel Boulud prices in a gulag service setting.  Skip it, so many better places to go in financial district.
