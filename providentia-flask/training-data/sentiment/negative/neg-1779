I guess this review is more associated with LJS corporate offices, but since those morons at corporate provide no way for consumers to contact them, I am using Yelp to voice my frustrations.  My family and I went to this location yesterday and had a bunch of coupons issued by corporate -- preprinted and mailed coupon flyers for discounts and "free" this or that.  I also had a "free" meal coupon issued for my birthday or something.  I was told by the manager at this location that they never honor any of these coupons and there is only store in the entire state of AZ that does (one of the west side of the valley).  Now my question is this:  WTF is the problem with franchises not honoring corporate coupons?  Why does corporate send us coupons if they are worthless?  This make absolutely no sense to me and makes me believe that LJS' corporate management are all idiots! Or.....maybe franchisees are lying about this situation and just not wanting to honor the coupons.
