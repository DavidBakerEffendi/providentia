Extremely disappointed with our sandwiches. We were recently at a party that served sandwiches from Capriotti's.  They were delicious so we decided to pick up some sandwiches from our local shop. Needless to say... they were disgusting.  The roast beef was so dry it was impossible to chew. It was cut in slabs and also cut the wrong direction Making it even tougher to chew.
We ventured out in the  middle of a rain storm passed several other sandwich shops only to throw the mess away.
