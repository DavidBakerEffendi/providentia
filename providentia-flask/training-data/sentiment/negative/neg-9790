The food is excellent but the last two times we've been here the service has been horrible. Last time my wife didn't even get to eat because the food took so long to come out. We waited for 45 minutes and she finally had to leave without eating. Now today we're sitting here with empty cups and had to ask the waitress to refill them after 15 minutes. The service used to be excellent. Not sure what's happened but if the level of service doesn't improve your business is going to suffer. Disappointed to say the least. AND.... I just found a HAIR in my Mac-n-cheese. The waitress didn't say a word when I showed her. Then a "manager" came over and seemed annoyed that I told them to take the food away that I couldn't eat anymore. This place has gone so far downhill it's not worth coming here anymore. If I could give a 0 rating I would.
