I've been by this place a thousand times and decided that I would stop by yesterday, I thought it was going to be great.  Well I was soo wrong it sucked really bad the best thing I had was the chips they give you.  I ordered fajitas and you should never be able to go wrong with fajitas but these were really bad, mine had no flavor in any kind of way I believe they cut up a whole onion and put it in my box it was just really unpleasant.  Will not be going back, however the waitress was really nice.
