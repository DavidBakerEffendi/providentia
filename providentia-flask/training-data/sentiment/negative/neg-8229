My husband loved this bar last time he was in Vegas so wanted to take me this time they weren't busy got right in order two drinks and water drinks came no water eh no big deal. Food came was ok nothing amazing still no water. Waitress came oo forgot water I'll be right back. Didn't see her again till she brought the check. They weren't busy, food was just so so and wait staff bla no thanks not returning
