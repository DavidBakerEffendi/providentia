I have a huge issue with this store. First off staff has always been nice and store is clean. I agree with the other review unfortunately a lot of homeless but not as bad as the Albertsons down the street they sleep right in front of the entrance, but back to my issue. 

Please be aware when you get your groceries. Almost every time I have gone in I come home and something wasn't bagged or was not put in my cart and left behind. Bottle of wine , shredded chicken , bread , just to name a few things that are missing. And this is not cheap stuff. I bought recently shredded chicken 10 bucks worth ...never got it sure as heck was on my receipt though . I have had to go back and get wine they forgot to put in my cart a couple months ago. I mean I can't go through every grocery bag before I put it in my car .


But like I said store is clean and staff is always super nice - can you please just get all my groceries I paid for in my cart ???? If it was just one time I wouldn't be so harsh but I am almost to the point I will drive a little farther to another Smith's to make sure I get everything.
