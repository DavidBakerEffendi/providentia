Went there with my wife an 5 year old on a Friday at 5:15.   Really wanted to sit on the patio but the three open tables were "Reserved."   Annoyed that these same three tables were still open when we left - the main room was mostly empty at this time. 

Kids menu is good and our son liked the chicken fingers & fries.   We ordered two of the seared ahi tuna salad and requested cooking 'medium'  - but they were quite disappointing.  Server indicated they are about 6oz of tuna.    The salads were simply some greens with an array of very thin sliced pre-cooked tuna that had no flavor at all (bordering on not so fresh). There was nowhere near 6oz worth, either.  The tuna wasn't edible in my book and I'm usually not too picky (pushed it to the side and ate the greens).  The server seemed new and obviously didn't know this dish - he should have told us that this was pre-cooked and from the fridge when we told him how we wanted it cooked.  The manager couldn't comment on it either, but offered to replace the order.   Unfortunately, that wasn't much of an option as our 5yo wouldn't have the patience to start over with waiting for new dishes - I'm sure other parents can relate.    They did bring out a grilled chicken breast for us.   Left hungry and annoyed that we were still charged for one salad - because a lousy meal is still worth 50%?  

Also, it was difficult to read the menu.  I know my eyes aren't as good as they used to be, but all the descriptions were in tiny italic print and many in a light blue font.  

We were here previously about a year ago and enjoyed it then.  They used to a have a grilled mahi mahi sandwich that we liked, but it's no longer served.  I've had the steak salad and burgers in the past which were very good.  However, won't be rushing back - there are so many good restaurants in the area.
