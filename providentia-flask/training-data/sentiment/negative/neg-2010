I keep trying this store.  And the service here is uniformly awful. No one seems to be working there. It's just a big joke to the crew.  Tried again yesterday and the vanilla frosty machine had a problem.  The staff addressed this be screaming "DID YOU FIX THE FROSTY MACHINE " over and over again to no one in particular. Honestly, I'm not even sure I got the right sandwich (Baconator vs. Jr. Baconator). I do know for absolute sure that hte sandwich was hours old. I'm done with that store.
