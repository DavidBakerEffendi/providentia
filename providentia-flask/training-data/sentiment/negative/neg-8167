Very very disappointed ... We went there several months ago and they were out of everything that we ordered...that being said once we got our food everything was fine so we decided to give it another shot.

Went there tonight and my husband and daughter got tavern salads and I ordered the shrimp BLT salad ... Which was literally supposed to be lettuce, tomato, bacon, Bleu cheese crumble and shrimp.  When the waitress brought it out it was a tavern salad with shrimp (fries and a bunch of veggies I didn't want.. When I pointed out that it was wrong her excuse was she was new do she didn't know and asked if I wanted it remade.  I said yes cause I wanted it to be what I ordered ... When she brought it back it was the same salad minus the fries and added the Bleu cheese and bacon ... So I still had to pick out the veggies I didn't want ... After pointing out again that the kitchen needs to make sure they know what's on the menu - no offer to have manager speak to me

So that being said and 2 ODD experiences - I will probably never go back!
