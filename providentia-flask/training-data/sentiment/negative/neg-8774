I am a vegetarian, and typically love places like these. I found a Groupon, and was really excited to try this place out. First off, you seat yourself and order at the bar. After you  order you pay at the counter with square which prompts you to tip 15 percent, 20 percent, or 30, which made me really uncomfortable when I am expected to get my own water and silverware. As far as food, we ordered coffee, alcohol, an appetizer, and four entrees. My son's avocado sandwich and my moms meal were brought out 10 minutes before the appetizer. We ordered my son's sandwich with no spinach but they added it anyway. I picked it off. He started complaining right away that his root beer smelled bad, and after smelling it myself it was clear that the glass was unclean, and smelled musty. 

They added sauce on my husband's after he asked them not to, and when we complained they said oh well the guy taking the orders is new. After our meal i mentioned that the root beer smelled really badly and the bartender smelled it, admitted it smelled bad, but didn't really care and acted indigent. I ended up spending over fifty bucks for lunch, and no one left happy. Avoid avoid  avoid.
