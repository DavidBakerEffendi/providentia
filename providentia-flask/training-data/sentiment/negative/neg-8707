Went to dicks around 9pm last night i talked this place up and sadly was disappointed. I notice we had to ask for hats which i usually never have too. i explained to the waitress that my friend had never been. Hinting we wanted the full experience but sadly we were ignored the entire time besides when ordering, when they brought the food and when they brought the bill the waitress disappeared after we ordered (never seen her again Worse dicks experience of my life especially when paying over $100 the food is mediocre but i mainly go for the experience however no experience plus mediocre food yeah never again. I didn't leave a tip i was appalled at the service than as we leave the guy (total different waitress) says thanks for the tip yeah your welcome no tip for bad service i could have given my $100 to McDonald's for better service at least we would have gotten a smile 0 stars for last night from me
