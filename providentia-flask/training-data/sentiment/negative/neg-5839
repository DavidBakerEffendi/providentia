Worst experience in a while !
Walked in to employees arguing amongst themselves and ignoring the guests at the register.
Once she decided to help me I had to repeat my order twice while being interrupted by the constant arguing about the side work.
The crew was not wearing hats, they were using cell phones on the front and were unapologetic about the poor service provided.
Will not visit this location and continue going to the rainbow and flamingo one; at least there are respectful there.
No manager seen or perhaps she was part of the motley crew!
