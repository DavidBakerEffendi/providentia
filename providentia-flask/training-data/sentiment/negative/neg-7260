I just ordered online from this location and it said to be there at 12:50 so I was there at that time but my order was not ready. The staff member making the sandwiches also was the assistant manager and he said that he only knew part of the order because the receipt tape ran out of the printer and he didn't get the details of the rest of the sandwich order. Had I not known what my coworker had ordered I would have had to drive back to work ask her what was on her sandwich and then drive back to Subway because I had already paid for these two sandwiches which subway had taken my money out of my account but didn't make the sandwiches because of a printing issue at the franchise restaurant. Luckily I have an excellent memory and I remembered exactly how she wanted her tuna wrap. I asked the asst manager if I couldn't remember would he have funded my money for the one sandwich and he said corporate would have to refund me because I ordered online. It's ridiculous that a problem created at the franchise level is rectified Days Later by corporate. We finally got our wraps thanks to me not Subway and I will not be ordering via online or maybe ever from this location because my time is important but Subway doesn't think so.
