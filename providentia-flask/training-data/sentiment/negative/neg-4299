BIG DISAPOINTMENT!!! The food all accross the board was bland, it was either all salt or all sugar no flavor and very little options. It's a smaller room compared to other buffets so not many stations to choose from. Their infamous crab station was ok nothing special but I guess there isn't much to expect from boiled crabs. I'm a vegas local and I've heard so much good things about the bellagio buffet, so i decided to go check it out, should have stuck with bucchanal or the PH. I'm giving  it one star because the grilled salmon was good and the waiter was efficient, other than that it was a big waste of money. Went on a sunday for dinner $129 for 3 adults tip not included, I didn't get my money's worth so i hope this review helps someone.
