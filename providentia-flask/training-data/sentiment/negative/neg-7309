I have never written a bad review, but I must say that from these other reviews I had such high exptectations-and was SOOO disappointed!!

There were obvious problems in the kitchen last night. This was what I hope was not a busy night, apps took 25 mins, and entrees came out after the table next us, who came and order.ed well after us- WERE FINISHED! When our food made it to the table one was wrong and one was cold

There are bad nights in kitchens all the time, but the service made this the worst dining experience in recent memory.  The front waiter took our order and we didn't see him until after we flagged him over wanting to cancel our food that it took so long.

After all this was going on and my guest was fuming about the ice cold halibut- the matred never came to the table to apologize and try to make it right.

My friend left without having an entree and feeling very under served.  Worst dining experience.  Another case of a celebrity chef slapping his name on and photos up  in a Vegas restaurant.  I can only hope that he doesn't have a daily hand in that mess.
