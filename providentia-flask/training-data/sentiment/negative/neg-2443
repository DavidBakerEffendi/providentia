That one star is for the good sauce that came with my order of a Chicken Shawarma platter. Well, that's about the only thing good about this place.

It was late afternoon when we first went to this place and no one greeted us at the door. We sat at one of the tables but no one came to offer us menus. We stayed for a  few minutes and watched a group of guys enjoy their sheesha and still no one. We decided to leave.

The second time we went there was around lunch time. We sat and finally someone talked to us and gave us a menu. We kept asking if we can order just the wrap and not the shawarma platter with fries and our server would say yes but at the end of his sentence he'd always say it comes with fries. We got so confused and frustrated that we just ordered the whole platter. When our order's ready they didn't bring it to our table. Instead, they waved for us to go to the counter and pick it up.

The chicken shawarma was good but I don't think it's good enough to compensate for the really poor service.
