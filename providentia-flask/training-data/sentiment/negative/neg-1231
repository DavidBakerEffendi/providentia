So, I was sitting in the waiting area waiting for an order for pick up. I'm tucked away in the corner playing around on my phone and I hear this young female employee practically screaming to a co-worker about how she deals drugs. She also said something to the effect that she had to start dealing harder drugs to hang out with some people. So loud to the point where the co-worker she was talking to hushes her up and let's her know that a customer was sitting in the waiting area. I get that young people making pizzas aren't the highest quality employees, but come on.

I was kind of grossed out, because it's likely that a young girl slinging drugs on the side probably isn't a stickler for hygiene and food safety.  However, and I'm not proud to admit this, I ate the pizza and wings anyway.. because well, I was hungry and fatty needs to eat.

Pizza was good and the other kid working was polite. Still probably won't be back for a while.
