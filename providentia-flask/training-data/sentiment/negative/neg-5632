I ordered the naked nuggets, and upon pickup, the order was cold, but I didn't mind. I bit into it, and the first thing i notice was how squishy it was, immediately i was alarmed and spit it out. I threw the rest out and kept one to take a picture. This meal was absolutely horrendous and alarming, if you can't cook simple chicken, what can you cook? I ate one piece without a second thought, because I assumed, the cooks would know how to...cook. Strange huh? The second piece was when my attention was caught. I will most likely get sick, or food poisoning, and possible salmonella because of how uncooked the chicken was.
