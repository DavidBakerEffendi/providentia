Zero star unfortunately there is no option for zero star. Worst experience ever. I bought a chicken sandwich which I found it was uncooked and show it to them. One of the employee came forward and argued even the son of owner came and gave me reason that his fryers at 350 c and can't be uncooked without looking at the uncooked sandwich... surprised with their most stubborn nature towards customer...
Not willing to go there anymore even employer don't know what customer service is...
