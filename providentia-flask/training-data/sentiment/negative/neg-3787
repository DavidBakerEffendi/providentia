Today was my last time at this potluck location. 
Typically i come here st lunch time for a quick bite. No matter what time I go, they're always out of something. Patties, festival, plantain, they're always out! None the less I always return. Not anymore! 
Today I went in with my husband and daughter around 6:30pm when we walked in there was no one around. It seemed like there was no food out left either so we waited for about 5 mins for someone to come out. Confused, my husband said "helloooooo?" in a humorous manner. 
A woman came out of thr back, looked at us but chose to get her cellphone and make a call as she walked away. She didn't say anything to us. She didn't come back. We left. 

Honestly this place has gone DOWNHILL
This woman always has an attitude when I go in and this place needs CHANGE. I used to come here for large portions of hot fresh food and now it's lost quality 

The ok food doesn't outweigh the terrible customer service and the fact theyre always out of something 

Save yourself the headache and go to the hurontario and Dundas location
