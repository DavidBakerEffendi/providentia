DON'T GET THE BOBA HERE, I BEG OF YOU. IT IS AWFUL AND YOU WILL REGRET WASTING YOUR HARD-EARNED CASH ON IT. It was watery (did they even put any tea or milk or sugar in it????) and I had to put several packets of sugar in it to make it taste even remotely tolerable (granted, I have a sweet tooth, but if you're a boba lover, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. Go to Asiatown and get one at Koko Bakery. YOU WILL THANK ME). Food is also not good. A Chinese restaurant can't mess up lo mein, right??? Well, this place's lo mein wasn't good. Flavorless and ugh. CSU students deserve better Chinese food options.
