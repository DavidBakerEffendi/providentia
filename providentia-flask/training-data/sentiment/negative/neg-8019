I have so many problems with this restaurant. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WHATS EVEN WORSE IS THAT THEY ARE WAY OVER PRICED. UMMMM since when does 800 degree pizza charge $1.50 FOR EACH TOPPING ?!?!? The 800 degree pizza in California doesn't. Two personal pizzas came out to $40.00. You're better off ordering dominos. Also no one knew what the gluten free crust was made of. The person at the front who takes care of the crust left for a good 10 minutes to see where the gluten free crust was. Then the chick who took care of the second part of the station came back with the crust with the biggest attitude ever. I said I wanted onions and pointed to the caramelized ones and she threw raw onions on top. I corrected her and she started flicking the raw onions off and tossing them into the area where all the toppings were. The raw onions were landing in other toppings. God forbid someone has an allergy to onions. Moving on we get to the third section and the guy starts counting each toppings up. I was literally in shock and was like what the f***! I walked to the front of the line where nowhere in sight does it say each topping is $1.50 each. Seriously do not come here.
