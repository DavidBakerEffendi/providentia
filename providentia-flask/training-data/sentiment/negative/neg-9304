What happened to this place?
Cora was known to serve fresh and succulent breakfasts - making it well worth the cost (and more). In 2016, it's far from it! The coffee is awful (and don't give me the "free refill" excuse). The pancakes/breads taste like they've been sitting in the kitchen for days on end...my toast was stale and OVER-buttered. I guess they really had to get rid of their butter(?). The eggs were fried not in a delicious way, but in that these aren't fresh & the taste needs to be hidden.

Terrible service. Old fruit. Terrible batter. Bad bacon....not going back!
