Came here on a weekday night way back when bc I wanted to check out the new sushi place that opened nearby.

I was immediately drawn to the higher price of their dinner menu compared to other sushi places. As long as the food was fantasticâ€‹, this wouldn't have been a problem. Speaking of their sushi, appetizers, etc., I mean it was alright, but there was nothing special about it. Especially not to justify their higher prices.

In regards to their service, it was absolutely horrid considering it was a weekday night and it was pretty dead when I went.

In short, Ichiki is obnoxiously overpriced and definitely not justified by their quality of food or service.
