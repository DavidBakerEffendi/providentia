everytime i have been here it just appalls me this place is still in business.

"This place seems like a total dump," while it may be out of context to Jaime M's review. i will confirm this place is a dump. it's horrid. i have on more then 3 occasions seen roaches scurry across the ground. on one occasion witnessed a minor stirring beans in a large pot. never have i had a good experience here. some of my family members love this place and come and drink margaritas from noon till they decide to leave. so i have been here enough times to know this is not a one time occurrence bad review. margaritas are cheap. but that's because they are shit. in my opinion. i like tequila with my margarita mix. umm thanks.

the food. ugh. more then a few occasions i have had intestinal discomfort. the taste is good. but the second coming of Jesus 40 minutes later is not good. i hate to give this place such a bad review because my family will hate me. but I've voiced my review to them enough they should expect this.

stay away. there are MANY Mexican restaurants in Arizona. and if this is authentic Sonoran. holy crap. i prefer the non-authentic Sonoran i get from other restaurants. i would go to Manuel's over this place any day.
