This place is gross, disgusting, dirty, and a complete rip off. The serving counters are filthy and so close together that you're  rubbing derri√®re with total strangers. I will NEVER eat at this overpriced dump again. They don't even serve real ice cream here! Go to Aria buffet it's clean and deeeeeelicious!!!
