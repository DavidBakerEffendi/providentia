This location is terrible. I've been to the Ahwatukee and Chandler locations and have never had a problem. I've been to this Mesa location 3 times and each visit has been bad. Rude cashiers and this latest time I was put on hold for 7 minutes with no answer. Not sure why I think anything will change. Drive a few extra miles and go to one of the other locations.
