I wish I could leave fewer stars. This experience has the potential to be one of my worst dining experiences to date. I placed an order for 2 people and was told it would take 10-15 minutes as it was lunch time and a bit busy. It ended up taking 40 minutes and I only got my food when I requested a refund because we no longer had time to eat during our lunch break. Not only did it take forever but the food was absolutely, horrifically terrible. Horrible experience, stay away.
