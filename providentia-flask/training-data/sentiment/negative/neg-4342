I've been here through every step on the way, they've changed the menu about 6 times. The cooks constantly change. Sometimes it's insanely hot, sometimes it's bland. They took the cold case stuff off the menu, and the green beans. They've severed me meat when I requested none at least 3 different times. I'm usually so accommodating to authentic Chinese places. But this place is just awful. Menu, staff, cooks.... Makes me sad to lose an authentic option, but we still have Chou's, and Chengdu around here.
