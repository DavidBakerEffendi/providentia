The sushi is mediocre and the service is poor, even by ayce standards. Flagging down a staff member to order is impossible u less you wave your hands like an imbecile. At least 7  ppl walked by obliviously. The don't get paid enough to care.  If the food was above average i would give it 3 stars but unfortunately it is not. I can go to better ayce  places with better quality  food and the same shitty service. 
Warning: they cut order qty in half as portion control. Your order 6  they give you 3. You order 4 and you get 2. Another thing is that the teapot lids are loose as hell and have some sort of crappie cable that doesn't even hold it on. Therefore if you pour the tea you run the risk of the lid falling off and getting hot tea all over yourself :/
