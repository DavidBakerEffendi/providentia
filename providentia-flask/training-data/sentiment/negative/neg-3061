Seriously the worst service I have ever got in my life . We called in to order a pizza and the kid on the phone couldn't even figure out how to take my order then I told them 3 different times we had cash and to please bring change for it . You think they brought change ? Nope they tried to give us change back as if we were tipping the kid 20$ for the delivery . 3 timesssss I told them .  Horrible cold pizza too I will never eat with Pizza Hut ever again . Ever!!!
