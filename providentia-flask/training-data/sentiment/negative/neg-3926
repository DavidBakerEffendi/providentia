By far the WORST buffet I have ever been to.  How can a 4star Hotel like WestGate allowed this to happen is beyond comprehension. 
The name is Fresh Buffet but nothing in there is fresh.  
Prime Rib was chalk-dry. 
Shrimp cocktail smelled like it has gone bad and slimmy. 
That was the last draw for me. 
Absolutely horrible.
