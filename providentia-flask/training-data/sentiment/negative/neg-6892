Terrible unorganized place. I use to come here every week. Unfortunately, times have changed and the last 8 times (yes I'm counting) 7 of the times they ran out of tapioca. 2 hours before closing. Absolutely ridiculous and the manager obviously doesn't know how to handle the inventory. I also just saw the waitress grab a piece of chicken off of someone's old plate then she wiped the grease off her fingers onto her pants and grabbed our drinks. Nice BR
