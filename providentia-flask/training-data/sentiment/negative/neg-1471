My expectation of Rics Grill is that of an upscale casual franchise steakhouse and at first glance, that's the feeling it conveys by the large wine bottle glass display at the entrance, the funky bar set up and comfortable trendy seating throughout the dining room.


And that's about it hehehe.  When it comes to service and the meals, that's a whole different story.  Take an elegant place and add Denny's greasy spoon service and you get this Rics Grill.  Our party of 7 endured a dinner that stretched the span of over three hours.

The highlight of the evening was the red lentil and beef soup which was excellent and came very fast; had I known, I would have grabbed a bowl to go and avoided this sad experience.. read on lol.  After the good start from the soup, things went downhill from there.  Next some appetizer of stuffed mushrooms came to the table which were ok and about an hour and fifteen minutes (yes that's over an hour later); the steaks.   

I had the 10oz New York striploin which was terrible, tough and fatty, appeared panfried and not flame grilled with the broiler marks.  What kind of a steakhouse panfries its steaks; yuck!!!!   I had ordered no starch and steamed vegetables for my sides.  Well, the vegetables looked great and farm-to-table as advertised BUT, yes, unfortunately there is a BUT- the veggies were swimming in butter; I mean there was so much butter lathered on those poor veggies that the carrots alone could do laps in that fat pool!!! Not to mention the rest of the party got their meals spaced out so we each finished at various times; had they waited for everyone to get their plate; everything would've been cold and worsened the aggravation!

Desserts were so-so. We had given up by then on loitering any longer and wanted to leave ASAP.   So, we spent all this time in there, only to remember how carrots do laps in a pool of butter accompanied with trailer park service.  Would we return or recommend Rics again? "No, thank you."
