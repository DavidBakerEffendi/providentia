I am honestly struggling to say anything nice about this establishment...Incomprehensible and needlessly complicated ordering system, overpriced, dirty, and with terrible food to boot.  My elderly mother's favorite place to eat - giant shocker. I've eaten here several times for her sake but never again, I love my mother, but not THAT much.  

Salads are overdressed and tend to have off greens, soups taste like they came right off the back of a Sysco truck and are woefully over salted but otherwise under seasoned. Pizza is totally inedible, the sauce seems to be composed solely of HFCS and tomato paste, the cheese is gummy and flavorless and the less said about the crust the better.  Calling this pizza is an insult to pizza. Pasta is overcooked and I have yet to find a sauce that I'd be willing to take a second taste of.  Even my husband, who is generally happy as long as his meal involves chicken, cannot stomach the food here, even though he's tried the sandwiches and pastas here several times.  I truly have yet to experience a meal where I could eat more than 3 bites of anything  before throwing in the towel in absolute disgust.

I just don't get it, I really don't, from the reviews on here, it seems like people actually LIKE this place.  Do people enjoy eating bland food at sticky tables? Am I missing something here? The staff is very nice and I think they have wi-fi as I often see long diners on laptops inside, but this doesn't make up for the general awfulness of the place. No more and then, Za's, even for my mother's sake.
