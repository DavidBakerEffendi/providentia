Can't believe this place has such high reviews. I was in late Friday night, bartender was more worried about taking as many shots as she could (4 in the half hour I wasted my time here), swearing and talking down customers from shifts before, than taking care of new paying customers. There weren't more than 15 people in the bar, but she was "so busy" she couldn't answer the two questions I had about the menu and drinks without giving me a ton of attitude. My group all got their food while she "forgot" to bring mine 5 feet to the kitchen (while taking another shot). Lost customers forever and from there the bartender got worse. After a fake apology from the bartender she then asked another customer to go out for a smoke break, came rushing back in when one in my group needed a box, and gave us a ton of attitude, so unprofessional. I've worked in the industry for over a decade and this is by FAR the worst and most unprofessional experience I've ever had. I don't care how great of food or drinks people think you have, the service wouldn't make up for any of it. It's a joke she's in charge of your restaurant, should be fired immediately for taking shots alone. NEVER going back.
