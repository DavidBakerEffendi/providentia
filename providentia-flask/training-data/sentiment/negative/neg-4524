Well.. the death song is again being sung at this place i fear. Another concept change? Come on guys get something good and stick with it. There's a revolving door of foods, menus, concepts and thought patterns going through this place "where neighbors meet." Actually, I've run out of neighbors that will go to this place any more.

One thing about the food biz - can you say CONSISTENCY? Every time we've gone there the last few months it's something different or the menu has changed again. (and I'm still pissed at that day old 1/4" meatloaf sandwich for $13.) Things go on, things come off. The food is wondering around somewhere between Frankfurt spaetzle and California pasta with some burgers and garlic pizza thrown in just to make sure they cover all the culinary bases.

This place could be cool with an outdoor patio good to enjoy the weather, some TVs and  a big screen (although the cage fighting is a bit much during our dinner), and some of the bartenders are good although drinks are inconsistent from one to the next. (geez i hate that Pope lime mix - buy some limes and do some fresh sour mix for change)

Anyhow, for our group, we'll find another place to hang until this place changes hands and someone with actual food and management experience takes over and gives the area what it wants. Hate to see places go by the way side but then again, why spend money when you don't know what you're getting from one visit to the next. 

With this place I'm always afraid our next visit will feature corn dogs on a stick with spinach and clam based BBQ sauce.

Good luck guys.
