Novelty wise, the experience gets 5 stars.  It's really interesting to experience the pitch black darkness and to interact with your dinner mates without being able to see them.  Our waitress Chelsea also deserves 5 stars.  She was pleasant and efficient and did a great job of ensuring everyone received their food/drinks with no spillage or mishaps.  She is a real find!

The food though is just what others have said, overpriced, bland, just nothing that would wow your taste buds.  The food didn't even have the smell of food to excite you, certainly not fresh made or quality ingredients. 

But the clincher?  The horrendous bar/checkout staff.  I wont even go into details as any business that would employ such ignorant staff, clearly doesn't care about customer service.  Nothing but a money grab.  Take the advice of others and create your own dining in the dark experience with better food and ambiance.
