Totally disappointed here, people. Server forgot to input my order and the place wasn't even busy. I ended up getting the wrong order after a lengthy 40-minute wait. So the manager gives me a $2 coupon for my next visit. It's still sitting in my car. 

Not too generous on the pours... and the Malibu Pineapple was too watery. Definitely a downer in my book :(
