I come here ALL the time and spend a decent amount of money each time...the more i drink the more money I'm likely to spend (I'm a shots for everyone type of drunk). It's usually fun, and drinks are reasonably price. Bartenders in the back are pretty awesome. It's the front bar that's the problem, and security. I don't know if their head is inflated because of their Real World season, but the staff looks like they hate their jobs. I'm not sure they train staff on "customer service." I've worked in retail, so I don't necessarily believe that the customer is always right, but common courtesy every customer deserves at least. I'm literally talking at the very LEAST a smile from the bartenders and a "what can I get for you?" Everyone looks miserable as hell unless they are talking to each other or someone they know.
