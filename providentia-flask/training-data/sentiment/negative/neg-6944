I am giving it one star for their horrible service, but 4 for their food. I think Yelp should develop a rating system separating food & service. Beerbistro, among other places, is an example of a place that needs such a separation. 

The food's good, the beer's good, but the staff are not. The hostess looked very annoyed when we got there, although there were only 2 people waiting after us. Even though we went 10 minutes ahead of our reservation, we were sat down 15 minutes into our reservation. What is up with that? I saw the manager kept walking around and to the hostess counter, and he saw us waiting, and said nothing. Being the hostess of this birthday party, I felt embarrassed about how they are treating my guests at my party.

Having a group of 8, I requested for us to be sat together and they failed to do so for us because they didn't have a big enough table (which they never told me on the phone). Fine, we sat separately. 6 on one, and 2 on another. 

The food came out on time and so did the drinks. The mussels, beer, and pasta were fantastic! Everything was almost forgiven with their great food & drinks. At the very end, I requested our waiter to please take a picture for us and he DENIED me, quote "Sorry, I have alot to do, and do not have the time to do it." Excuse me? It takes literally ONE MINUTE when everything set up already by my friend who is camera savvy and had it set up. No tripod, just a regular camera. I was so angry at this fact, but I decided to keep calm and not say anything to the manager. 

I want to return for its food, but their service really is making me think twice.
