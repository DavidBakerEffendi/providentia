I ordered a hot dog, loaded fries and a salad for delivery. when i questioned my total (which was very high considering the food I had ordered) the idiot that took my order failed to mention that there's a $3 "delivery" fee. My food took over an hour to arrive. When I handed the delivery man a twenty he did not even pretend that he was going to give me change. Had I been notified of the "delivery" fee, I would not have tipped him. Oh, I ordered a 20oz soda, which had leaked all of the cup.

The hot dog and fries were COLD when they arrived. not even warm. The hot dog looked as disgusting as it tasted. I could not finish it. The fries were disgusting and had 2 different kinds of "cheese" on them. I could not finish them either. 

The only redeeming quality of the meal was the rance dressing, which was good. Very over priced for what you get. 

I will NEVER eat here again, and would not recommend wasting money on the crap they tried to pass off of as food. 

If you're looking for a good hot dog and fries go to Luke's of Chicago, where they actually know how to prepare a quality meal.
