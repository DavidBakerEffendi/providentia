For those of you who did not think that the westside could not exist in Rhodes Ranch, then you clearly have not been to this burger king location. Right off the bat walking in you could see that coke, Dr pepper, hi-c, and zesty sauce were all out.  Not a good sign but we took the gamble anyway. The onion rings were cold and had more leather than an old boot. The whopper was not our way!! It was their way and looked like it had been dragged through a cat's litterbox!! The chicken sandwich looked like it belonged on dirty dining. But hey, it probably tastes like chicken. Meanwhile both on and off the clock employees continued social media hour at the front counter taking selfies and shucking and jiving for all those to see and hear. The only bright spot at this location is Latonya who is a 50 something year old women trying to do the job the correct way. She was nice enough to remake the order and get the food right. However it's unfortunate that she spends most of the shift babysitting teens than customer service. We choked down what we could of the meal and then to put the cherry on top of the miserable evening, we had to race home because Montezuma's revenge set in. And that's nothing but the truth... so help me.. you know the rest...
