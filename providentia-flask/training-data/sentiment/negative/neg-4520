We decided to grab something quick so we stopped into this Arby's.  OMG!!!! First the drive thru line was all the way to the front of the restaurant,  so we walked inside to order. BAD mistake! The line for walk up order was long as well. Every employee working looked like high school students with NO directions. They were obviously under staffed for a Saturday afternoon. It took us 15 minutes total  to order and receive our food. As a business owner myself I know better then to be under staffed on a busy Saturday lunch rush.
