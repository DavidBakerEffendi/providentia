4 Stars for being a Packers Bar - 1 star for changing the Happy Hour menu and skimping on portions. We ordered the potato skins and on a huge plate 3 of the tiny-est skins you have ever seen showed up. I had to check the floor to see if the server dropped half of them. WTF? I used to come here at least once a month, but now, I can get ripped off on my own side of town and blow $50 on a good happy hour. Too bad casey's.
