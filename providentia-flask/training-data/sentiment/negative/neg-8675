I have been here before and did not have a real favorable experience with the food this morning I stopped in thinking I would pick something up not realizing they are closing go into the bathroom take my seat and the lights go out it's completely dark. Thank God I'm a smoker and I carry a lighter but I was not able to find the light switch in the bathroom anyway. When I go out and let them know at the counter that the lights are out in the bathroom while I was using it he says sorry we're closing and gives me the opportunity to finish using the bathroom nor does he truly apologize for having not checked the bathroom and making it dark in the first place. Just another unfavorable experience at this dump in the wall I highly doubt I'll ever give them another try. So far the two times I have been there the food was garbage and then it goes dark in the bathroom and they don't even let you finish using it.
