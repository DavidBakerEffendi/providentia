Went there last night for a family dinner. I use to really like this place but over the years it keeps getting worse and if I could give it a negative star I would. The food was very poor quality and and with all the other choices for Asian food in this town it will be another 5 years before I step back in this place. You have to chase down a server to get a drink refill and I was pushed out of the way several times as employees were walking around shouting into radios about what need to be refilled. 

While I was there I walked into the bathroom and it smelled like urine and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. All the stalls were broken and graffiti everywhere. Both paper town dispensers were out and the sink area was  gross. Makes me wonder if the employees ever wash their hands.
