I was told this place had great food and killer chocolate malts. I have never been so disappointed in looking at food. I ordered corn beef hash and since I was on a job a block away I figured I'd get the food to go. Literally a 30 second walk to the office. The corn beef hash was more small cut up potato hash with a bit of square pieces of some meat that had no taste. The entire thing was nasty. Let's get to this awesome chocolate malt. I pulled off the paper from the straw after walking out the door only to get a chocolate milk not a chocolate malt. Considering it's 26Â° outside this couldn't have melted from the door to the street. I really like eating in different cities each week but this was the worst experience I've had in years.
