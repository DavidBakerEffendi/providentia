Stood in restaurant for 10 minutes and no one was there to seat you or take order. Even called out hello. Sign and posted hours said open. Then, tried to call to make carry out order and the refused restaurant.com certificate. Certificate does not say 'dine in only.' Said it was a typo that they had not yet corrected that the certificate was wrong. Poor way to run a business.
