I'm never ordering from here again. I've been ordering for delivery from Palmeros for almost 2 years. The food is mediocre but it's cheap. The last 4 times I've gotten anything from there it's been at least 15 minutes later than said. Today it was 30 minutes later than confirmed in eat24. That's an hour and 15 minutes... Ridiculous.
