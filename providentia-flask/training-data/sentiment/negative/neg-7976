This place has a low rating for a good reason.

Everything in my order was wrong. I ordered delivery for garlic knots and a pizza with onions, black olives, tomatoes, and the hut favorite crust. I was highly disappointed to find that the garlic knots had literally no garlic or any form of seasoning on them. It looked like they threw pain dough into the oven. How do you bake that, look at the end product and decide, ehh I don't think any one will notice? These disgusting dough gods were completely inedible.

Also, the pizza had no hut favorite crust on it and was extremely sparse when it came to toppings. 

This was in no way worth what I paid. There are plenty of other pizza huts nearby. Save yourself the annoyance and go to a different one.
