You don't serve a 15 dollar bowl of ramen in a cheap plastic bowl! Plastic bowls don't retain heat! Besides my cheap bowl sliding all over the table while trying to consume my once upon a time hot soup it was pretty good ramen, except the chasu was overboiled and disintegrating into the broth, it was worth trying except If I would have known a soup place didn't know how to serve soup I wouldn't have bothered, another hopeful ramen expedition failure! not worth a return visit as well
