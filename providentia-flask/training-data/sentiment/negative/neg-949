I received absolutely TERRIBLE service here.  The website misquoted drinks available for happy hour and the owner sent out an overweight blond e woman to us.  She was rude and condescending and treated us as if we were ripping her off.  She said to us, "This time we'lll correct this but just know that next time you come we will NOT give you your money back."  Fine, easy! We wont be back and as promised we'd leave honest feedback online.  Thumbs down for Maizies!
