I really wish I could get my money back. I'm an Italian from NJ and I'm not too much of a pizza snob, but I know good pizza. When I pay more than $26 for a 6-piece margherita pizza pie (delivered), I expect it to be at least pretty good. With the reviews this place got, I was incredibly disappointed and really regret my purchase. The mozzerella taste was decent, the sauce was fresh and homemade tasting, but completely lacked salt and garlic. There was so much sauce and so little mozzerella (and tomatoes) that the sauce overpowered the mozzerella and gave the pizza a bland smushed tomato taste. There were like 10 pieces of basil on the whole pizza and they were also completely flavorless (probably not fresh because I grow basil and would use it on homemade margherita pizzas and can always always taste it). The crust of the pizza was tough and did not taste good at all. The pizza was delivered rather quickly but the pizza was cold when I got it. I had to heat up a couple slices for 45 seconds. I definitely do not recommend this place - save your money. Huge regret.
