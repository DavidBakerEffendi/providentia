I wasn't impressed at all. I was so excited to eat here since it's been a while since I've had Filipino food. My husband and I went there for lunch before heading back home and the meat was tough. I got the mechado and bistek and he got the chicken adobo and bistek. We also got some lumpias and BBQ. The only thing we both agreed on liking was the BBQ. The place was very outdated, the seat cushions were ripped and torn and it looked dingy to me. Plus the customer service could've been alot better. The lady who put our order together seemed nice enough but the guy who rang up our order didn't even crack a smile. When we do visit  Vegas again, I wouldn't come back here. I gave it 1 star for the BBQ. Wish we went somewhere else. Very  disappointing and forgettable visit.
