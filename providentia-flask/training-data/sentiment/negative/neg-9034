I met with a few friends for lunch here on Saturday. They did not post on their website that they only serve brunch and not lunch on Saturdays. We decided to stay anyway. I ordered the BLT with collard greens and my spouse ordered the unchicken and waffles with a side of home fries. Bland, boring and left a lot to be desired. The waffles were dense and chewy, the BLT had no flavour and the tofu was not crispy... The unchicken was uninspired and just average. Save your money. Perhaps their dinner options would be better.. But I doubt it.
