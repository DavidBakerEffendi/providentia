HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!! I have had my fair share of Jamaican food this place is the epitome of bland, lackluster food. It deserves no stars,the brown stew chicken taste as if it was boiled in a pot of vinegar. I refuse to discuss how horrible the oxtails were, your better off going to Mama Rose or Leon they blow this place out of the box.
