If I could I would leave no stars all we order was a grilled cheese a caesar salad and a slice of cake it took 1 hour and 10 minutes to get this INSANELY simple order and of course by the time we got the food the sandwich which was supposed to have tomato and basil was a soggy rubber plastic sandwich with steamed fries I will never make the mistake of ordering from here again.
