Sonic is one of the worst fast food places around. I don't really like anything on the menu, but damn if the branding always makes me want to stop when I drive by. I love the idea of carhops and 50's hamburgers, however, as I mentioned above I always leave thinking, "Wow, that was really nasty and now I feel sick".
