Is there a zero star option?? Extremely poor customer service. 35 minnutes and never even received my order. When asking for a refund they refused to refund my drink.. I will say they did offer a 10 dollar gift card for my next visit. That was very nice. But I was not even offered anything else from the menu. Just a " yeah sorry that didn't come out. It's new and we are new"... I'll tell you. Not a great start or impression. I will probably not return. The food must be good. The rest of my table did enjoy their meals that they received.
