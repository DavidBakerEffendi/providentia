We left the Arrogant butcher because of the supremely poor greeting and treatment from Rachel. We were enjoying the CFP experience and checked in for dinner. There was a wait and we were told they would text us when a table was available. When we received the message our foursome had become separated and I raced in to confirm our table and request a moment to retrieve our gang. I was told by an unnamed female assistant at the receiving station that we would be seated or next in line when I returned with my crew. When we presented to Rachel within 10 minutes she told us we missed our table and we would need to get back in the queue. When I pleaded my case about waiting, texting and gatherings my party she just shrugged with a sarcastic smile and told me that it was their policy to sacrifice our position if we were tardy. And she claimed that she had just sent her assistant home and therefore unable to confirm my claim. I politely encouraged Rachel to examine their texting history to see when we were contacted. My suggestion was not appreciated and we told again by the unfriendly Rachel that we would just have to get back on the wait list. No apology. No smile. I sure hope that Rachel was more polite to the Alabama and Clemson visitors. We left the neighborhood to dine at the culinary dropout where we spent our cash.
