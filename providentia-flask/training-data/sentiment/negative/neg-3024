Went to ESM last night for supper. We arrived with our 2 children ages 3 and 9 months. We were shown to a booth and when asked for a high chair so we didn't have to hold her while we eat we're told can't put a high chair here is a booster seat ok...for an infant. We said no so we're given a small table where we could put a high chair. We ordered the bogo pasta so we could have the second one for lunch the next day. We waited forever for our salad and didn't even have cutlery. Then while waiting asked for a second loaf of bread for our meal. Our pasta arrived. No bread. We ate our entire meal (though our waitress started removing my plate before I had even finished while I was giving something to the baby) and then they brought a loaf of bread. Our waitress asked if we wanted dessert to which I replied "no thanks, we're good". Then she turned to my 3 year old and asked him if he wanted dessert. I again relied "no" and then I had to deal with my 3 year old upset because the waitress asked him if he wanted dessert" when I had already told her no. You don't ask a 3 year old if they want dessert. The answer is always yes and then the parents have to deal with that when they already said no. 
Went to pay and use my groupon $10 voucher only to be told can't use it due to what we ordered (which I understood after). Paid, got our second meals to take home and left. We discussed our terrible dining experience on the way home. 
This morning I took my pasta out to heat up for lunch. Noticed underneath a sticker that said "Saturday". So that would make my pasta now 4 days old. I heated it up and it was so rubbery I could barely chew a bite. So in to the garbage it went. Will definitely NOT be going there again. TERRIBLE.
