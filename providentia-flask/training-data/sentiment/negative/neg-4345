Seems like a nice place until I checked out. I paid another's bill of $60 plus my $30. I was charged $130. I admit I was feeling the effects of their awesome margaritas. I did ask how $60 and $30 = $130. Too wasted to fight it. Seems like they took advantage of the situation. Paid cash. So, no way to dispute it.
