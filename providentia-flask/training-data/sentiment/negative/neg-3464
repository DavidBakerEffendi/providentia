This smaller outlet of Poke Express is disappointing.  Would rather make the trek up north for much better poke.   Service is good, but the issues here are the brown discolored fish I've seen more than once in the glass display case.  Often times they cut with the grain or there is too much sinew in the poke.  Just doesn't taste the same or have the nice texture that you would see at the location on Craig Road.
