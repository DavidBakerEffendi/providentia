I wish there was a -10 star for this place. I had called to place an order and Jessyca picked up the phone very rudely!! Seriously if u can't or don't want to take orders don't hang up the phone on customers!!!! So I called back and ask for a supervisor and to my surprise he wasn't there, the owner? Oh he never comes in she said!!! So the bit.... Is all by her self answering the phone like it is her house!!!!!! Please DO NOT hire white trash people that don't know how to be polite to your customers if u still have any. Just as I posted this review the "owner" called me, to see if he could help me order, not to see why I was upset. I tried to explain to him what had happen and he kept insisting that she wasn't rude by hanging up the phone or asking rude questions! Seriously??!!!? And of course he hang up too, very professional people!
