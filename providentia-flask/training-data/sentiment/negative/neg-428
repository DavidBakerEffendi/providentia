Lame. Lame. Lame. Seriously, for the love of all things pizza, stay away from this place. Service is bad in the restaurant, as it's young kids waiting on you. Delivery is incredibly slow and will come warm if you're lucky with evidence of being thrown in the car. Anything fried is WAY too greasy. Meatballs and sausage are tasty but overall Librettos is inconsistent. It's sad, The two real non chain options in Ballantyne are mediocre at best. Seems this small business is struggling and the minimal portion control overpricing tactics are in full swing.
