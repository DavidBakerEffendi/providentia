I do not think this restaurant deserves even one star. I ordered a chicken breast sandwich and fries. What I got was the smallest piece of chicken on a huge bun, and next to no mayo. The chicken breast was not seasoned, the char marks from the grill were actually burn marks, which made the sandwich taste awful. The fries were the skinny type and were actually burned dark brown. They tasted horrible. My husband ordered a beef dip with cesar salad. The beef dip was dry, and the cesar dressing was apparently homemade, with an incredibly fishy taste...way too much anchovy. The upside to this over priced $45.00 meal was the gravy. It disguised the taste of the burned fries and the charred chicken breast. Never again will order from here.
