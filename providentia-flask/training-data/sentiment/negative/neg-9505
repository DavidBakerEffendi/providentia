Don't judge a place by its looks... and let me tell you, I didn't!  I took my fellow yelper's advice and tried Wo Fat.

And the verdict is... It's no bueno.  Maybe I'm spoiled from growing up in Taiwan and lived in Southern California for 5 years... but this place just wasn't very special.

We ordered several dishes to go... 5 to be exact.  AND I have to say none of them were too good.  The waitress wasn't too friendly either...  Nothing special here.
