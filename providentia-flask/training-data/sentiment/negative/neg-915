So this is very tough for me as I have been coming here for nearly a year. My past two visits were extremely disappointing. Maybe they have a new cook or new management but it's borderline inedible. Two weeks ago I ordered the breakfast burrito with carne asada. I ended up with grizzled chewy meat which made my meal inedible. Today I ordered the always fantastic Fuego tacos which I have always liked. I asked for three tacos, one cabeza(cheek) and two carne. I ended up with 3 cabeza (already an issue getting the order incorrect) and it was mostly fat and grizzle again. I have never written a poor review for a restaurant but I just had to because it was just so bad. I've included a picture of what I dealt with today.  I wont be returning, nor will my co-workers.  I hope they figure it out as it is a local family business.

Note* It was brought to my attention that I should fix my review because cabeza meat is supposed to be greasy. Yes, i do know it is supposed to be greasy and not the most lean meat of the cow.  I only had chunks of fat with a few sparing pieces of meat in my tacos.  My coworker is of mexican heritage and said that it was very poor and she was unable to see any significant meat in the tacos as well.
