Whoever opened this place needs a reality check.  Although they've apparently redecorated, the food is crap, the server is crap, the vibe is crap.  

My boyfriend bought a Groupon here, which I still have no idea why.  We live close by, but nothing about it screams 'try me'.  We went for breakfast, and there was only one dude working behind the bar.  He clearly was serving his friends, and the banter and refills were much more important than the customers.  We walked in, and another older couple walked in right after.  We were the only people in the place, yet the server moved at the pace of a snail.  It took a solid 10 minutes for us to get waters, but his friends were having plenty of attention with mimosa refills.  We really enjoyed their awfully loud night out recap.  

I ordered the french toast and my boyfriend ordered the catfish & grits.  Both of our plates were just ok.  My boyfriend said the fish was good, but everything else pretty much sucked.  They were 'out of' many items and their credit card machine was not working.  Good thing our Groupon (that the server didn't even check) covered the bill.  

Do yourself a favor and don't try this place.
