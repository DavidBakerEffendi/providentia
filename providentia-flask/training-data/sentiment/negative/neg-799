I'm really disappointed with Honey Salt! I'm sitting  here waiting for my check! I had to ask for it as our waiter disappeared! We ordered the chicken ceasar salads and calamari! The one star is for the calamari! The calamari was a small serving but excellent! The lettuce and kale was bland on the salad!!! My friend and I came here to celebrate her birthday! what a disappointment ! When we sat down the waiter asked us if we wanted to order we didn't even have an opportunity to look at the menu! We asked to give us a minute! He came back but we weren't ready! Apparently if you don't order on your second time he's done with you because he was nowhere to be found after a long time we asked for him but the bustboy said he would talks our order. He wasn't familiar with the cocktails. I ordered a Moscow mule while my friend had a question regarding
 the vodka. The waiter took a long time to com over but he asked the bartender and that took a long time as well!  My salad was dry I asked for extra dressing and croutons and there was only 2 of them! I counted them! When he brought it... He forgot a spoon! There are plenty of restaurants to eat at and I will not be coming back! It's an expensive lunch and overrated! In paying for the food and service ! Not ambiance! The ambiance is nice but that's it!!! Paid and we are outta here!!
