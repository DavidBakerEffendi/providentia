Terrible Please Read

I work nearby this location for over a year, so I unfortunately have a lot of experience for this review.

1) they always rush you when taking your order at the drive thru, maybe if you let me finish speaking I'd tell you what I want next.
2) they usually mess up the orders anyway
3) the food here is always stale, either the buns , patty or fries are always hard or tasteless.

Sometimes the employees leave greasy finger prints on the bags/wrappers and the food itself. Like you can tell somebody's disgusting hands were all over the food you just paid for and you're about to eat.

I try to come here as less as possible but sometimes its unavoidable if I forget my lunch or I'm low on cash, we all know the feeling. 

This location is ghetto trash and all the managers and employees should be replaced with machines asap. If you need fast food go to taco bell in front of vons, at least their food isnt gross and they dont mess up the orders constantly.
