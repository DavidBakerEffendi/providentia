I did not eat here. Because the service was so poor. 
I went to the bar. Sat there for about 5 to 10 min. The persons behind the bar. Wakes back and fourth in front of me 4 times and never said a word. Than went back to the other end of the bar to grab a bill. Waked back across in front of me and went to check on a table and still no greeting or anything. I left and went to stone and vine where the food and service was fantastic. 
At 6ft 200lb it was the first time I felt invisible.
