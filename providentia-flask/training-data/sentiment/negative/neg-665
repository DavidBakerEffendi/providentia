I want to state right up front that this review is for the downtown Summerlin location and not the one in downtown Las Vegas. Yesterday I took my wife for lunch to the Summerlin location of Makers and Finders Coffee and had the most horrible experience I have ever had at a local restaurant! We arrived at 1:30 p.m. and was told that the wait would be about 20 minutes but we were not seated until after 2:30 p.m. The really strange part was people coming in after us were being seated right away and they were mostly parties of 2 also! I wanted to leave but my wife really wanted to try the Cuban food here so we waited. After being seated we waited at least 20 minutes before someone would take our order and after that we waited for almost 30 minutes before the waiter came back with only my food but not my wife's. He then tells us that they cannot make the dish my wife ordered because they ran out of mangoes! In almost every restaurant I have ever eaten in the waiter tells you right away if they cannot make a dish that either my wife or I order so that it gives us a chance to order something else and then bring both our orders at the same time. I have never had the experience of being served my dish and then being told that they cannot make the dish ordered by my wife! So we ended up sharing my dish because we did not want to wait for another hour for her dish. Really, terrible Mothers Day for my wife and very dissapointed at our experience here yesterday!
