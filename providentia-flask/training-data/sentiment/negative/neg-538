I went to La Taquizza with my mother one winter night because we wanted Mexican and that was the closest place to where she lives. The reviews on Urbanspoon and Yelp seemed favourable for the most part, so we figured we'd give it a shot.

The service was good, they actually moved tables just to get us a seat (there was very little seating available) and the waitresses and host/owner(?) seemed very welcoming. Food came quite fast as well.

Unfortunately, that is where the good ends. My mom got the enchiladas sauzas (in tomato cream sauce) with chicken filling. I got the mole poblano pork. I have to say, I've been to 4-5 Mexican restaurants in Toronto and this by far was the worst and most disappointing.

The pork was inedible. The sauce, which reeked and tasted strongly of some Asian flavouring I couldn't put my finger on, was oversalted to the point of me trying to wipe it off just to get through some of the actual meat. The meat... it was so chewy my jaw actually hurt after a few pieces. I've tasted good mole in Toronto, despite our sad lack of Mexican places, and this was not even close to what mole should be like. Terrible.

My mother's enchiladas were sadly no better. The sauce lacked all flavour, the chicken inside was scarce and the pieces she did find were dry and flavourless. The corn tortillas themselves were gummy and too thick and the ratio of filling to tortilla was completely off (very little filling).

I don't like complaining to the staff and/or managers about food but perhaps I should start because that meal was the worst one I've had in a long time. We got through some of the food and made our way out, politely declining to take the remainders of that disgrace to Mexican food with us.

Very disappointing. If you want proper Mexican food, please go to Dos Amigos on Bathurst (north of Dupont). Their food is amazing and their mole sauce is to die for, in my honest opinion. Save your stomach, if not money.
