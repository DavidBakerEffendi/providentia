I'm not from Las Vegas, I'm actually on vacation. This has to be the worst customer service I've received at any fast food restaurant. The female manager who was working tonight was being really rude over nuggets sauce that was supposedly put in my bag....why the hell am I going to fight over sauce, im not..that was so dumb. Never again.
