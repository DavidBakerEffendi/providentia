My wife and I have always enjoyed the food here, service has been a little hit or miss.  However, last visit there was a discrepancy on our check and we asked to speak to the manager.  He came over said there was nothing he could do and then asked "if it was because they were Mexican" and that "we would have complained at an Olive Garden" implying that we were racist for complaining.  Asked for the owners information only to find out the person calling us racist was the owner. We will not be returning.
