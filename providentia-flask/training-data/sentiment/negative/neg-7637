Worst experience in Vegas ever. Don't stay here if you want to have fun and be treated well. They have gone down hill since they first opened. Pools all closed for maintenance, check in service is miserable. Follow up doesn't happen. The sheets are itchy and scratchy. How does a high end hotel have bad sheets ? Gross
