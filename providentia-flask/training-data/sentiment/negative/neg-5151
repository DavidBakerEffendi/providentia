Nightmare on Camelback and 24th Street!  I have frequented this restaurant since I can remember and even have the phone number memorized since the 80s. What a disappointment.  When three other restaurants in the vicinity had a 40+ minute wait due to Father's Day, this store was empty. Maybe four tables were occupied. We found a nice spot and proceeded to order a glass of wine. After waiting 15 minutes and told the wine would arrive anytime on 4 different occasions, the waitress said they were looking for a wine glass. Really??? There were maybe 10 people in the restaurant over 21. So we proceeded to order our food not having the wine delivered.  After waiting an obnoxiously long time our food finally arrived as did the wine. We were told they had to wash the wine glass. The split pea and tortilla soups were coagulated beyond a stew and not edible! The wonton chicken and avocado wraps were horrible at best and tasted even worse than they appeared and my "go-to" half barbecue chicken chopped salad  was disgusting. What happened CPK?  What happened to the high energy vibe, shiny clean environment, efficient staff and consistent food?  I couldn't even find a manager after asking for one. After decades, I will never go back to the barn styled restaurant with disgusting food and underwhelming staff. Bye bye CPK!i
