So disappointed that we all came here with such high hopes.We came here as guests of some companies we do business with, good thing that our hosts were great company cause if we had solely been there for the food we'd be pissed.  We were a group of about 20.  They had the music so loud that we couldn't hear the waiter tell us the specials, yet he kept giving us dirty looks for talking! We ordered a few appetizers which came within a half hour.  Then some ordered soups & salads waited for those for another 45 minutes.. It was close to 11 p.m. and finally someone asked the waiter what was going on with our main course, all he could say its coming shortly.  WTH we had been there since 8:30.  Finally the steaks came out, at least for some.  They left the side dishes sitting to the side, while they went to check on the other orders.  Needless to say the manager was unapologetic as well as the wait staff.  The only one on top of his game was the water boy! 
I'd never recommend this place, not even to my worst enemy.  
Vegas has so many great dining options, stay away from this joint!
