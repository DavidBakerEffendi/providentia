I ordered some sandwiches and I told the person taking the order 3x NO freak'n mayo in my sammies.  Not once, not twice, but thrice.  WTF!!!  And yet again, I got sammies with mayo.  

The problem was not that I didn't repeat myself many times over, the problem was that she was on the phone talking to a family member.  Couldn't be bothered to excuse herself to take my order properly.  The one thing people cannot do is talk on the phone and take orders at the same time.  That's how you f#%$ up the orders!!!  Duh!!!!!

I was so pissed!!  Never again will I ever come back here!!!  They can get lost, better yet close down for all I care!!!
