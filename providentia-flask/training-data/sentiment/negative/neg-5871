I was really looking forward to going to Wahoos since it has opened. The parking lot is always full and it looks like a hip place. I was really disappointed.

I ordered a chicken tortilla soup which tasted like a can of Campbell's vegetable soup with tortillas added on top. It had large chunks of chicken that did not taste that great. We also ordered chips and salsa. Chips were stale! I ordered 2 taco plate with white rice and white beans. The rice and beans were not bad. I got a fish taco and a carnitas taco. I was expecting great fish tacos from Wahoos but that was not the case. The carnitas tacos was better but I would prefer Rubios, Chipotle, or Cafe Rio. The food at these places is 10 times better. My wife ordered black beans with her tacos she said they were not cooked all the way and were a bit hard.

We definitely will not be going back.
