PROS: They have an excellent beer selection and were located within walking distance of the movie theater where we were headed afterward.

CONS: Slow to be seated, slow to take our orders, slow getting us drinks, and finally slow getting us the food we ordered which came out wrong. The burgers overall were pretty basic. Nothing to write home about. Certainly didn't live up the the amount of hype the place poured into them while waiting. You can get a much better burger elsewhere at far less cost. I really can't believe Michael Symon attaches his name to this place. What a disappointment!
