Really disappointed with this place. Look at all the negative reviews in 2016 alone, that's a clear indication that something is awry here with quality control. Sometimes dishes come out perfect, other times cooking fundamentals are completely missed, like forgetting to season the food. I don't even want to say any further, because there isn't much to say, The Breakfast Joynt accomplishes so little yet charges so much.
