The service to grab a seat is slow like 20 minutes because they don't care. As soon as I sat down the waitress said you order now or leave. We ordered and 12 minutes later the food came out warm and cold and just to my luck I found a piece hair and told them and they said its not are fault. And... I said I don't want it because of this. Rude people. Dirty kitchen.
