Came for lunch and waited forever for the waiter to come take our order of drinks. Place wasn't busy at all so that was weird.  It took super long to get the drinks too. The margaritas were supposed to be blended, but came on the rocks and in plastic cups. One of the worse tasting margaritas I've ever had.
