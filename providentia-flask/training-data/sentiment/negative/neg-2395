Yuck Where do I start?? First the service was mediocre. I used to come here all the time for years and never had a problem until tonight. Everything was just bland. The fried avocado roll and the Japanese lasagne were terrible. This place used to be good. I was excited to come here after seeing they brought back the 50% happy hour on the weekends. We tried the green tea cheesecake and it was disgusting tasted old and hard. Don't come here
