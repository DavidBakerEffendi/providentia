Hate to do this because this is my favorite spot to eat... Ordered my food to go. It was somewhat busy, but not too bad. I knew there would be a wait so I waited patiently for my food. It took 40 min before I went up and asked if my food was ready. The girl who took my order said they called my name 3 times but I didn't hear anything. And mind you, I was sitting near the order desk and in clear sight. Very disappointed in the service today. Would've expected a little more from this place, especially when I go on my lunch break. The food is great, but I'm not so sure about the service anymore.
