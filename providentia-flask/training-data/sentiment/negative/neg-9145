Awful. Just plain awful. I was born and raised in Las Vegas, and am still a local and I was extremely disappointed. The service was not great, and for $16 I expected to have a MUCH better tasting carne asada burrito. The burrito was cold, the carne asada was dry, the beans tasted like they came from a can, and there was barely any cheese. Everyone in my group was local, and we all agreed that the food was terrible. The chips and salsa also taste store bought and stale. Don't waste your money. I would have thought that with an owner living in town, the quality control would have been better.
