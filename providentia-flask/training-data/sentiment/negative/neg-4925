Went for second time this evening. Service was sub par. The server made several mistakes and didn't clarify she understood the order. 
Food was awful. My burrito had no taste and was really dry. It was supposed to have cheese and sour cream but there was no way it had either. Normally burritos are saucy but thus was just bland and had no flavor. Even adding salsa from the salsa bar did nothing to help it out. 
Speaking of the salsa bar, they offer all you can eat salsa but you have to order the chips separate. $7.50 for the chips and mediocre guacamole is quite steep. Chip should be unlimited if the salsa is. 
Definitely won't be coming back. And to add insult to injury I am suffering severe indigestion from the 1/2 burrito I managed to eat.
