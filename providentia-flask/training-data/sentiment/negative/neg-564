We love supporting our local businesses but not when they strive to provide horrible customer service. 

My husband & I ordered take out on Sunday night & unfortunately they made my order wrong. I contacted Blue Agave and spoke with the same girl who took the order. The girl was highly unapologetic and seemed annoyed. A simple "I apologize" goes a long way. 

Luckily we live a few blocks away & my husband was able to take the food back. They gave my husband the new order, and half way home he realized they gave the wrong sides. He made a U turn & went back (third time). He asked for a manager & according to my husband the manager gave just as much of a cr*p that the waitress did. Clearly we know who these employees get their fantastic customer service from (sarcasm). The manager didn't even offer to refund the order until my husband demanded it. However, it's Wednesday and we have yet to see that refund. 

My husband & I come in here all the time. The food is great... but like I said customer service goes a long way. Clearly they don't want our business. Never coming back here.
