This place is awful. I live three minutes away and wait at least an hour for my order each time. When I get my pizza it looks like it has been sitting under a heat lamp all day. It's so disappointing because I've had great Happy's Pizza before. Someone needs to come in and take control of this place. There is no excuse for running a garbage business. It's time to stop making excuses and put this place out of business.  Stop allowing people the belief of entitlement.
