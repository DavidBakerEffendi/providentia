I placed a relatively simple take-out order:
2 Chicken Tikka Masala
2 Butter Chicken
2 Tandoori Chicken
2 Fish (yes, it's just called "Fish")
1 Naan, 4 pieces

When I got home I discovered that I received:
a) 2 Chicken Tikka Masala/Butter Chicken (they look exactly the same)
b) 1 Mystery dish (had pieces of chicken and vegetables, no sauce)
c) 2 Tandoori Chicken, STILL RAW on the inside.
d) 2 Fish
e75 Naan, 2 fresh pieces, 1 already cut piece

A few things:
a) They should post either photos or descriptions next to their menu items to educate their customers. I was thoroughly confused as whether I received 2 Tikka Masala's or 2 Butter chickens.
b) If someone could explain this to me, I would be very grateful. Are there different versions of Tikka Masala or Butter Chicken that do not contain sauce?
c) UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN IS INEXCUSABLE.
d) Fish is tasty but not fried fresh. Actually, nothing here is made-to-order. Everything is pre-made and just dished out.
e) I was told that a single order of naan had 4 pieces. I was given 3 and one was not fresh, very disappointed, don't give me old food. I'm paying just as much money as the next person.
- They should have an order tracking system. They have absolutely no way of matching an order to a customer. If all they do is take-out, you better make sure that the correct customer is leaving with the correct order. I very well may have been given an order that did not belong to me.

Based on a previous experience where I ordered Shrimp Biryani and Lamb Biryani each of which had less than an ounce of Shrimp or Lamb in it I will not be returning. I will be seeking out other establishments or be making my own to get my Indian food fix.
