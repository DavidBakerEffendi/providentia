Visited for the first time yesterday for Sunday dinner. I had been to the Mesa location and enjoyed it and this one is closer to my house.  My daughter and I got the half rack ribs. Mine was so burnt it tasted like a charcoal briquette smothered in bottled barbecue sauce.  The mashed potatoes were congealed Into the shape of a splat where the cook had slopped a spoonful into the dish. I took a bite and got a mouthful of half a raw potato.  My daughter was too mortified to complain about hers (she's 15). Her baked potato was good. We paid an extra dollar for it to be 'loaded' which meant a handful of shredded cheese and some bacon bits.  Even the famous bread tasted like stale reheated King's Hawaiian rolls.  
My husband liked his chicken fried steak, he got 'loaded' steak fries, which again was a hand full of shredded cheese all in one spot with some bacon bits. The side salads were the best thing there. Then they still charged me for my dinner until we asked to have it removed and only pay for the salad. (I had returned it after one bite) The manager never came by.
So if you like Texas Roadhouse, do yourself a favor and drive to Stapley. Although there is usually a wait, now I know why this location didn't have a wait.
