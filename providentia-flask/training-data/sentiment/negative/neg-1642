We took our daughter with us on this trip.  It was a Friday Night.  What a mistake.  The food was less than appetizing and the service was worse.  We will not eat here again
-------

Based on the existing reviews my husband and I dined here tonight.  The food rates 5 stars but the service tonight was 2 stars.  

I had the Dontino's Special Salad and the speg with meat sauce it was amazing.  David had the baked manicotti it was very good.

The server we had tonight was horrible, she was slow and almost rude.  The other servers in the area were bringing drinks and bread at a fast pace.  They chatted with the patrons and seemed to be good servers.

We will definitely go back and try it again.  If nothing else we will order it to go.
