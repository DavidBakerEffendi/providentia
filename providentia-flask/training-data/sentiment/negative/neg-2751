Oh my. Where does one start. SERVICE. S-E-R-V-I-C-E. Repeat after me, please: SERVICE.

The people who work at Marigold have not had a day's worth of training in good customer service it seems. It is very unfortunate, as I do know for a fact that their food is delicious. We had eaten there once prior and loved the food. Why a 1 then, you wonder?

A Tuesday night. 7pm. Reservation. We are in at 7:02pm. Get our orders in by 7:10 and get a bottle of wine while we wait. 10 minutes pass. 20 minutes pass. 30 minutes pass. No starters yet. It is 7:45 now and we have not seen a single piece of food. We ask the waiter what is going on and he apologises - some problem in the kitchen, brings us complimentary snack. Ok. Starters show up at 7:55. 5-6 people come and get pickup. UberEats drivers show up 3 times. It is 8:30 and we have not received our food. 
We call the waiter again - sorry, problems with the order system something-something. We thank them for the starters but request our receipt, pay and leave without eating.

Mind you, had they acknowledged the fact they were delayed, had someone come over and apologised 15 minutes in and not waited for 40 minutes until we complained, it'd be a different story. It is all about COMMUNICATION. And there was none. We sat there as at least 9 people got their food before we did, and they either ordered that food online or via delivery. And sure, if you want to cater to both in-house clientele and outside clientele (pickup / delivery), by all means do so. BUT, have the capacity to do it. Have enough staff in the kitchen so that everyone gets their food on time. And, of course, train your staff how to deal with these situations. 

Absolutely disappointed and will, sadly, not be going back. After over an hour and a half of waiting, I think that's the nicest I can do.
