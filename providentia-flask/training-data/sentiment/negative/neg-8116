NEVER AGAIN, will I step foot in this location. Management is rude and unprofessional. Manager Bert is a rude, egotistical, jerk! As we were in the process of following the hostess, a female manager walked threw her hands in our face to stop, and sent the hostess away to go dance. The manager turned her back to us, and we were left standing clueless as to what we needed to do. When we approached her to let her know how rude the service was, Bert, the unprofessional manager stepped in. Not once did he apologize, he made a ton of excuses, and started YELLING at us. How embarrassing!!!!!

By that time, we were furious, and walked out. I called back to get the manager's name. Once again, Bert stepped in (that's how we got his name), and started screaming at us. He said he would never apologize, because "that's not the Texas Roadhouse way." Not once did he offer a solution, and said there was no point in calling corporate, because he would get the complaint, and he "just didn't care". What kind of manager is this? I'm appalled at the stupidity of whoever put this animal in charge! He ought to be fired. I'm scared to think what would happen to customers who have a problem once having been seated! 

Service is big to me, and a shame that one jerk could ruin this entire company for our family.
