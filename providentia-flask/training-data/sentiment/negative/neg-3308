You'll get better sleep in a Motel 6. The ceiling creaks like the place was built in the 50s. People in the room above us walked around all night for two nights in a row. Called tonight to complain and was told there was nothing they could do and that the rooms were sold out so we couldn't be moved. This is a Thursday night, not a weekend so we have a hard time believing there are zero other rooms. The room is clean enough, but if you want to get any sleep while in Vegas chose a different hotel.
