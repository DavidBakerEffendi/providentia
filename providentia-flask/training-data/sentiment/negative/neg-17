Came here to meet a friend for lunch and I was very disappointed. We ordered biryani rice (not bad but not great either) coconut chicken, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan. After waiting 20 min we got our food, the chicken dishes were lukewarm at best and there was no flavor difference between the 2 dishes. I had asked for my masala to be spicy but there was no spice whatsoever! The garlic naan had so much garlic on it that it was like biting straight into raw garlic!!!! We waited another 20 min to get our check since our server was nowhere to be found. I finally had to go to the bar to get the check. Do not come here if you want authentic Indian cuisine!!!!!
