while the food is excellent, the management style leaves a lot to be desired. Every morsel arrived perfect delicious & tasty  however the Meyer lemon chicken arrived so salty it was in edible. Reluctantly we told the waiter about the situation. He apologized and offered another entr√©e. At that point, we had already had appetizers, and drinks and I just simply asked for another one of the short rib appetizers. The waiter offered to comp the chicken and replace it with that appetizer - all  free of charge. When the manager came by, he apologized and remarked that others too  said the chicken was too salty. when the bill came we were charged for the chicken and the appetizer! Then they only offered to comp one of the appetizers. After we asked about the confusing bill they then only offered to comp our least expensive appetizer and charge us for the chicken! so while they saved $10 for three empanadas, they served three people who would tell 15 others each that it was not a good experience. I ask you, was that a good management move? as good as the food is would not recommend.
