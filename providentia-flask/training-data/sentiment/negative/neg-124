I walked in with my family and we waited to be seated...for 10 min! Employees saw us there and just ignored us and kept going about their business. I fully understand if they're slammed and running around, but a "we'll be right with you" goes a long way and we didn't get any of that. We just got blown off. We were all hungry and this was totally unacceptable. We left and went down the street to Venezia's. They were friendly and wanted our business.
