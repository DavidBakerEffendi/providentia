If you don't mind dirty salt and pepper shakers, questionable tasting ketchup, syrup and filthy old refilled ketchup bottles this place is for you!

 The potatoes were cooked in way too much oil on top of being over seasoned. The waffles tasted plain and not quite right.  The bacon tasted weird too. Don't think I will be returning.
