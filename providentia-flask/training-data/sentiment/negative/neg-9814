Ordered their 'most popular dish' on the menu - fish and chips. It was mostly chips, the haddock was very small and the side coleslaw was tiny as well. I told the waitress that it was misleading from the menu description and she said that the new owners have changed everything so the menu isn't accurate - that specials are posted on social media that are not communicated to the staff. Please step up your game management!!! We'd love to be regulars but can't because of the decreasing quality of the menu items. Also - the American satellite radio station you use plays four advertisements to every TWO songs! This makes it challenging to enjoy yourself and the company you are with - making it really worth the effort to drive into Calgary or hey! Check out Browns Social house!!!
