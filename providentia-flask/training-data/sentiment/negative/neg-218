As other lifelong Dunkin fans know, you can tell when the coffee is not made exactly right.  At this location the past three weeks, the coffee has been too weak.  The staff seems nice but when you leave and the coffee isn't right...ya know?  The following is an update based on my latest visit: 1 of last 3 visits with coffee made correctly. Some of the staff is nice and trying hard but there are a few who need lessons in eyes contact and smiling 101.  With smiles or not, get the coffee right!
