I haven't had a horrible food experience in a while....Megas broke that cycle.

The food is mediocore at best.
The restaurant ambience isn't great. It's a little ghetto.
The bathrooms stink
The waitress we had was unbelievably rude
The service is so slow it will make you want to pull your hair out - everything from making an order, to asking for your bill 3 times
The food service is so slow you will eat the entire loaf of free COLD bread
