Stopped in tonight for take out and ordered soup for my Fiancee and fish tacos for myself.  Waited close to 40 minutes for the food to be ready.  When I got home there was no soup in the bag.  The container I thought was the soup was actually the bean/corn salsa for the tacos.   I was perfectly clear with Chad the bartender that I wanted soup and Tacos.  Won't be coming back here again.
