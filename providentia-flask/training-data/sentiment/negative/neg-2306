Gah! This place is always such a disaster late night. See also, #iamold. 

On my most recent visit, I had to elbow my way to the bar and wait forever to order drinks. Beer selection was meh so I went with a margarita. It was sickly sweet -- if I hadn't watched the bar tender pour in tequila, I would have sworn it didn't have any alcohol at all. 

After said drinks, I was ready for a visit to the little girls' room. Line for bathrooms stretched almost to the front door. One of the ladies in line with me said it was taking so long because girls were "doing blow" in there. If that doesn't capture what a classy place this is, I don't know what else will. Oh, wait! Maybe this'll help convince you... While there, we watched a man being carried out in a head lock by 3 bouncers. He was bleeding from no less than 5 different spots. Once booted to the sidewalk, he stood around literally gushing blood onto the street while the cops that seem to be permanently stationed out front tried to clean him up. 

Never again, folks. Never again.
