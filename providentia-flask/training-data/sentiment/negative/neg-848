We went for a Saturday 25th Birthday. It was easy to reserve a table online but prepare for the worse service if you ever get any. We waited an hour for one of our appetizer. When someone ordered a main dish it took over an hour to receive it and some gorgeous others quick or not at all. I would not recommend to go to this restaurant.
