This Mcdonalds sucks! For one there's drug addicts coming in and out of the place. To make things worst they let these folks just hang around inside and outside the McDonalds. The place is always dirty especially the bathroom. I went in there today and the damn cashier wanted me to pay .11 cents more for an extra sauce. Are you fuckin serious!?? With what you have to deal with by just visiting the place you would think they wouldn't mind. This place is a dump!!!
