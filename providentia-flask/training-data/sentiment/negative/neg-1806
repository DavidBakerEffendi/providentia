The only good thing about this restaurant is that you can order it electronically,the drinks, the food and the service are HORRIBLE. I've been to many all you can eatbplaces, and this place is probably the worst, the servers were extremely rude and the overall experience was rushed and unpleasant, made me wish I had eaten at home instead. I guess this place is so appealing due to the location and the electronic ordering, but the quality of it is horrible, if you're looking for decent sushi and a half decent experience DO NOT go here, it is loud and unpleasant the sushi tastes industrialized somehow? 

Bottom line I wouldn't recommend this place.
