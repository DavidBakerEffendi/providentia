I wanted to like it. I missed the friend who suggested we go. The company I went with was by far the best thing about the dining experience. This is just another tired bar trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of those of us too stupid to eat out at Westgate. We were not all that hungry so we ended up having one drink each, one appetizer, one salad and one sandwich.  Total cost $80. WTF? 80 bucks for three drinks and minimal food? Are you freaking kidding me? This place calls itself a chop house. I can get better food at Subway. I have had super crappy dining experiences at Westgate on a number of occasions so my thought was why order chicken when for $2 more you can get beef. Less likely make me sick, right?  Ugh...The French dip was about as appealing as a hot dog bun with some dollar store meat heated in a microwave.  The oh so wonderful spinach dip recommended by our waitress came with a heaping of stale gross chips. Large Stella? Plastic glass and all of 20 ounces at best. I was charged close to $11 for that crap...Ug....why do I ever go to Westgate? Every restaurant here is a shit show.
