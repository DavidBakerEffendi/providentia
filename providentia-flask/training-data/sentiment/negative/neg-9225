Raising Cain's has NOTHING to WORRY ABOUT!  PDQ is expensive for what it is and what you get.  I ordered the 5 piece "meal" with 3 sauces and a chocolate shake.  The person with me ordered the tender sandwich and a chocolate malt.  First, the "meal" here means chicken tenders with EITHER fries OR coleslaw. Since the slaw description states that they put blueberries in their coleslaw, I opted for the fries.  I was excited to see the fries were the shoestring variety since this usually means they will be cooked to medium or well done.  These were almost raw and some had the texture of raw apples!  There is no Texas toast included so a meal is tenders and fries.  The "hand spun" chocolate milk shake tasted like it came from a machine with that really whipped texture.  The dipping sauces tasted like salad dressing, straight from the bottle.  This cost me $12.73. My friend's sandwich was inedible and made her gag but the dogs did eat it.  Her chocolate malt, which we ordered 3 times since this order seemed too complex for them to get right the first time, arrived as a vanilla shake.  Her meal cost $10.36!  I wanted to like PDQ since it is fairly close to my home!  I will gladly drive by it to get to Cain's every time!
