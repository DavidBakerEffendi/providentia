only reason why we came here is because the 4 of us had our meals were comped thanks to mlife~

service is great - they're constantly refilling your drinks and taking your plates as soon as you are done eating.  

food is not so great - food was either stale, old, recooked, or just not so fresh.  the only thing memorable was their clam chowder.

dessert is a total fail - really dry and not so good. except, their mango sorbet (in the ice cream section) was actually okay.

unfortunately, i don't think we'll be back....unless they make some improvements.
