Absolutely awful. I had the #7 & #6 with black beans and pork fried rice. My wife had the Chicken Diablo & the Jerk Chicken with black beans and regular rice. Mom had the Vegetarian Queso with black beans. It started off by my Mother asking "Did anyone else get the black bean?" I said, "Why are they stone cold?" All of our meals were barley warm at all. I don't know what the big deal is about this place. The parking lot was empty, the lighting was atrocious, and they strip mall area disserted. That should have been a sign (turn around and go somewhere else). The only reason that I gave them 1 Star is because I could not select 0 Stars! The Chocolate Cookie that came with the meal was the "HIGHLIGHT" of the night. Super soft, moist, and yummy. Very good cookie. Obviously it was bought/made somewhere else. This is by far the worst meal that I have had in sometime; so long I can't even remember having a meal this bad. The staff was nice and polite. They were somewhat helpful in trying to order. That in itself is a joke if you don't know what to expect.
