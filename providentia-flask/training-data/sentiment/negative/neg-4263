We dined here back in the summer on the patio by the "pool" in back. The setup was nice although a bit strange. If anyone had actually been in the pool they could have soaked us but I digress.
To start I asked the waitress about some of the various bottles of wine they had. She had no idea how to answer my simple questions and seemed to have no way to find out. So I chose one I was unfamiliar with. It was a Red Zin and it was barely ok. I don't blame her for that though.
Moving on. 
We started with the Baked Brie app. It was simple. Nothing wrong with it just exactly what you expect.
For dinner I had the Short Ribs ($23) and my fianc√© had the Pork Tenderloin ($22). Immediately I knew why I found a Groupon for this place. The food was edible but at least, warm. It transported me to my worst nightmare, a retirement home. If bland, fatty, ill prepared food is what you're after, THEY'VE GOT IT!!!

The waitress had told us earlier that the death by chocolate dessert was out of this world and in my foolish mind I just kept thinking, it can't be as bad as this food. So we ordered it to go. Not worth the calories. We threw half of it out.

The front of house staff was very kind and accommodating which is why I've waited so long to write this review.
If you like good food that has qualities like flavor and texture, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
