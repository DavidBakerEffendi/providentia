Yay for cold burgers! Pretty sure my fries and burgers were the same temp as the beer. 

Southern hospitality also misses this establishment - some waitresses here seem to be bonused on how unfriendly they can be and still take their time to not give you food and your check. 

Saving grace for them is location- and their lonerider shotgun Betty hef (local beer), be sure to ask for two beers and two waters you may not be visited again by your waitress.
