Terrible experience!!!! READ ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS!

Go in for dinner and make a reservation and give my credit card to only hold the reservation. We show up to a completely empty teriyaki looking run of the mill place and are told it's a set chefs menu and it's not even Valentine's Day keep in mind they don't even offer to show what the tasting menu is! 

We decide to just have drinks. We're told we can't even do that! How absurd to not even let us pay for drinks!! We then say we are leaving and they tell us we owe for the two chefs tasting!!!! THAT WE DIDNT EVEN ORDER! I tell them we will pay for the reservation fee but not for two dinners we didn't even look at or order! 

The rude manager comes over and tells us its policy! No where did anything state if you don't want what's on the menu that they charge you!!!! That place is a total joke! I would have gladly paid a cancelation fee but not the whole dinner price! They were upset that the place was completely empty on a Saturday night and I can see why!!!!! HORRIBLE I WOULD STICK TO SUSHI ROKU
