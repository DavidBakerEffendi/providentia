Pho was excellent!
Service was TERRIBLE!!!!
Waiters looked unprofessional and uninterested in their customers.  Never greeted upon arrival and no one ever checked in once my food arrived. Never got asked if I wanted a drink?! I had to literally demand every service as they never initiated. With the many pho restaurants out there I will take my $$$$ elsewhere! Thank you, your loss!
