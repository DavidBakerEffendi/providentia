What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT !!! Went here for lunch and I have been excited to try this place very cute and quaint , the menu sounded delicious and the staff was friendly enough . My review is based solely off of portion size and quality of freshness . I ordered the lunch caprese salad and asked the guy if it was a big salad or should I order something else to go along with it he said no that salad was big enough . I got it to go and when I got home I was very surprised with what they call a salad ?  there were 4 slices of mozzarella which was an ok portion but there was 4 tiny shreds of lettuce on top that did not even cover the cheese not surround it oh And some rotting tomatoes ? It was not even edible besides the cheese I really wanted to like this place but don't think know that I will be returning :(
