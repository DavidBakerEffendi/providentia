My boyfriend and I just left this restaurant feeling very disrespected. The lady who sat us was very welcoming and right away asked us if we wanted anything to drink. I asked for a water. When she brought me my water I noticed there was something floating atop. My boyfriend fished it out and concluded that it was indeed an ANT. As I looked deeper into my cup of water I noticed there were two more ANTS at the bottom of my cup. We quickly and nicely informed our waitress who was apologetic and embarrassed. She brought me a new water and had said she had notified the manager Andrew (I think that was his name). My boyfriend and I decided to stay and eat there because we were really hungry. We ate our food and still waited for the manager to come talk to us. He NEVER did. My boyfriend and I never expected a free meal nor a discounted meal, just an apology would've been nice. We paid and left, with our minds made up to never return again.
