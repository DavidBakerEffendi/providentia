I have to agree with the comment on service. The staff does not know what service with a smile is. There was one waitress last night who obviously did not want to be there. We went as a group and did not feel appreciated. Food is alright, but nothing special. There are many better restaurants in Montreal that deliver on the promise of service and exceptional food. This restaurant misses the mark on both.
