I went here a few nights ago for the first time, and I must say it will be the last time. The restaurant reminded me of Sauce, but the quality of the pizza and ingredients left much to be desired. 

Pizza Me! offers unlimited toppings, which sounds good on the surface, but I found the ones I got to be lacking in taste. The pizza itself has an ultra thin crust that tasted more like cardboard than pizza. It had a bit of an aftertaste too, and I felt the need to have something else to get rid of it.

The dining area had issues too. The sun hits this place without anything to block it, so it is difficult to find a table where you are not somewhat bothered by it. The floor was dirty, and the tables didn't look that clean either.

If this is not enough to consider staying away, it is worth noting that the pizza comes in one size only, 11 inches, so no option for getting just slices and not really something that you would have enough left over to take home. We actually had a piece of pizza left and decided it was better to throw it out than bother to take it home.
