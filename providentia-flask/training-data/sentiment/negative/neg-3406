Draft beer tasted flat.  Lobster bisque was horrible.  BBQ tray was disgusting...lodge made pickles had no flavor...brisket was dry and rubbery...mac & cheese was cold...sausage tasted frozen...ribs were not fall off the bone.  Ceasar salad came out as a whoe head/stalk of romaine lettuce with a couple drops of ceasar dressing...by the time I fought the lettuce I didnt even want to eat.  Kids chicken tenders tasted of fish.  Grilled cheese was about the size of my palm.  For the extremely high price it was not worth it at all!  Love Great Wolf Lodge but this restaurant was a no!
