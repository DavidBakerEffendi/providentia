What happened to you Gaati!?! Every time we ordered from you it is usually  a hit. A few times it was not consistent. This time is the last straw... We ordered delivery of $50 of the chicken pad Thai, broccoli with fried pork, tofu paw see wheewwwwww and mango sticky rice. With a side order of the vinegar green chili. 

Once we got our order to the door, both noodle dishes lacked favor. We barely even see the meat/tofu. And they said the side order of chili was rotten so they didn't put that in. It's one of the best part to put in the noodles if you want a tangy hot kick to the dish. And to top it off... the mango dessert looks like they give us half of a rotten mango WITHOUT the coconut sauce. WTF. This order was not worth over $50 for shitty food. 

You guys lost a customer.
