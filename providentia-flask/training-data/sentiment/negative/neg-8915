I've been to a lot of different Keg Steakhouses around Canada, but I would not return to this one.  The food was good, but the service was horrible.  I've been to the Keg in Old Montreal many times, which is always a great experience.  Friendly staff and good food.  Here at Place Ville-Marie... it was a different story.

The staff was plentiful, young, attractive and bored.  They all stood around chatting and flirting with one another instead of attending to customers.  The worst part were the hosts/hostesses.  They were plain rude and upset that we were carrying large bags.  They wanted us to check them.  Ridiculous - there was lots of space at the tables, and the restaurant was half empty.  We received a lot of attitude.  

I will never be back at this location!  When in Montreal, go to the one located at the Old Port instead.  So much better.
