My friend wanted to come here for KBBQ during dinner time around 6pm. We had a party of 4 and were seated quickly but received no service. No menus or water were served to us. The restaurant wasn't busy either and most of the workers were just standing there. What was ridiculous was that a Korean party came in a little after us and were seated next to us and they were served menus, water and the servers also took their order while we sat there for 15 minutes being ignored before we decided to walk out. And before all of that, they switched us to a smaller table because they felt that the original table they chose for us was too big. Workers are rude also. NBD. 3 new KBBQ just opened in town. I'm never coming back.
