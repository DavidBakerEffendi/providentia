This place was the worst cafe rio I have ever been and I Am a big fan of the franchise. The staff was rude and to lazy to do the normal things like clean tables take out trash re-stock the napkins. The staff was also taking short cuts on how the meal was prepared. The staff was literally talking to each other about personal stuff while we were waiting to be severed. I would not recommend anyone come to this cafe rio across from UNLV.
