We heard about Fidelli Kitchen on a local radio ad and were very excited to try it out. We were less than impressed, to say the least.  The cashier did not know what anything on the menu was or how to input anything in the register.  It took extremely too long just to place the order.  After purchasing the reloadable wine card, we struggled with the machine just to get a glass of wine.  We requested that an empty bottle be replaced, and waited an obscene amount of time for that to happen, before reminding them to do so.  The food was lukewarm and mediocre.  The service was friendly but lacking in knowledge or urgency.  We will not be returning.
