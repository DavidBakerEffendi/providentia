Awful service, awful food.

Was here several weeks ago as part of a large group; I arrived partway through the meal and did not order anything, so can't speak for the food on that occasion (though it looked good), but the service was excellent. We had a male waiter who handled our giant group with ease and was very pleasant.

This time, we had a girl serving us. I did not catch her name, but she was short, kinda squat and had darker hair. She seemed to have a bit of an attitude, and was nowhere to be found when we needed refills, dressing, or the check. Another server also delivered all our beer from the bar, so she must have really been pulling a vanishing act.

As for the food... We had chicken alfredo and a pizza. The alfredo sauce was ridiculously salty and the noodles undercooked. The pizza was lukewarm when it arrived. The crust was insanely chewy to the point of making your jaw hurt. The only good thing about the meal was the ranch dressing.
