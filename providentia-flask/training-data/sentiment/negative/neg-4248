On so many levels, this casino and resort pales in comparison to its peers in customer service in many regards, whether its one bartender serving a hundred plus in the Venetian theater or absolutely horrible sports bar management, the sports books ridiculous policies or simply the poor floor plan design that is completely dysfunctional for hundreds of patrons, avoid them at all costs.
