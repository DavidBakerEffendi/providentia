Thanks, but no thanks.

Attended their brunch on a Sunday - service was slow on drinks, food from the kitchen came out on time and looked good, but plates were just put infant of anyone so we all ended up switching to who had what correctly on our own, we were rarely checked on and no water glasses refilled unless we asked (sometimes more than once), when it came time for the bill we waited what seemed like eternity for them to split the bill and return. 

Food presentation was good, taste was alright, but i've had better.

Best tip about this place: The drinks and mimosas are awfully small for the cost I thought. Also, the entire front has blacked out cover (I'm guess for when it is raining or bad weather - which it was not that day - it was actually quite sunny) making it challenging in finding the actual entrance point.
