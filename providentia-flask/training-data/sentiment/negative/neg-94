Went to lumberjacks for breakfast this morning. We've been there before and usually had a good experience. Today not only was the coffee cold the bacon was burnt. Their sausage gravy never has any sausage in it . And we were overcharged for the breakfast we ordered . My husband's English muffins were burnt as well . When I got home I got sick and had food poisoning from the food . We will not go back to this restaurant ever again .
