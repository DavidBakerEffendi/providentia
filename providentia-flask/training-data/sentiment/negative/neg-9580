I just don't get the draw of buffets.  The quality of food is generally worse than if you'd order an entree at a normal restaurant, most restaurants serve portions that are big enough to satisfy already, the novelty of eating fried rice, prime rib, and pasta at the same time does not appeal to me, and you end up paying more than usual for this sub-par dinner.  

Given my disinterest in buffets, this one still ranks towards the bottom of buffets I've tried.  Nothing I tried was horrible per se, but it wasn't very good either.  That alone would be enough to earn a 2 star rating, but at almost $30 per person, this place loses another star.
