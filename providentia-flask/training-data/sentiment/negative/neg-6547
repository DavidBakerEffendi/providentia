I'm disappointed to say I  didn't  have a good experience. I was very  excited to come here today,  also called to see if it was busy and if I needed to make reservations.  They informed me that I didn't need to reserve a table and that we'll be able to get in if we came right away.  

Surprisingly when we got there we were the only table there. I thought they'd be busier but good for us we didn't have to wait.  They sat us at a table right across from the kitchen that was reaping of sewer smell. The floors were wet leading to our table.  As I looked  into the kitchen was when I saw the whole kitchen drenched in some kind of murky water and everyone running around trying to mop the filthy water up.  No wonder the whole place smelled like sewer. At this point I wanted to stand up and leave but didn't want to ruin dinner for everyone else.  We asked to be moved to a table towards  the front door. Out of site out of mind...

We ordered fried calamari which was bland, the octopus appetizer was just ehh. The seafood pasta was flavorless and the noodles were hard.  The clam linguini was ok. The only thing that I can give this place a star for is the decorations. It's simple & cute but smelling like sewer... I'll can pass!
