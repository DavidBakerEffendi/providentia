I placed my order online at 12:41pm. The confirmation said 20-30 minutes. At exactly one hour, I called the store and spoke to Jose. I asked if he knew where my order was? He said he would call the driver and call me right back. I waited 10 more minutes and called back. I was put on hold. Once the call was answered, he said he had forgotten because they were so busy and he would have to call the driver and call me back. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told there wasn't one there that shift. He never called me back and I received my food 1 hour and 25 minutes after initial order. My food was cold and nobody ever said so much as sorry. I killed my entire lunch time and know have no time to replace it with something warm and fresh. Absolutely infuriating the way I was treated by this store.
