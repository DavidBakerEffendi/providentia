I know, I know....  it's a chain restaurant and their are soooo many Chili's around the Phoenix metro, why would I write a review on this one?  

Because it's the closest one to Anthem and I am hoping the Yelp "fairies and gods" will listen to my review and influence the mgmnt team!!

This place has all of the ingredients in becoming THE CHILI'S of all Chili's. 

Great location, customers and little to no competition!! 

So what's the problem?  The consistency of their service and food are deplorable.  Some visits they are well staffed with friendly and attentive servers and on other visits they little to no staff and they seem disgruntled and cantankerous. 

The grub~ We always have to send something back or they will forget something.  It's gotten so bad we have resorted to ordering just soup and salad at this location and they seem to find a way to mess that up too.  The soup is either over seasoned or under seasoned, and they don't look at their salads close enough when hey make them.  We found lettuce cores in both salads on our last visit...

I'm pleading to the Yelp gods to influence the mgmnt in this restaurant.  I've tried to listen to their excuses and apologies, give them advise, and even coaching but they keep making the same mistakes...   

At least the beer is cold, but you might have to wait to get it even if your the only person there.
