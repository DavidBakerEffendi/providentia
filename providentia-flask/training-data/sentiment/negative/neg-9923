Not sure what these positive reviews were paid for posting these 4 and 5 star reviews... 

I bought a groupon for this place and decided why not. I called ahead to see if a reservation was needed. I was told that it most definitely was or I couldn't eat there tonight. I get there and my car was the only one in the parking lot I almost left because I thought it was closed. So I called from the parking lot to see if it were open. The guy said yes we're jam packed come down! Lol.

So I go in no hostess went almost into the kitchen to get someone to seat me. Sat and went to the salad bar. Salad bar sucked. Old cheese veggies hams and heated canned soups to eat. The meat was reheated by microwave I could tell in the taste and how soggy the meat was. So I receive the check after a bad meal one refill and bad service and they wrote down how much tip they deserved per total of the check not including groupon deal which was about 33$ lol

I'm usually really optimistic I give restaurants a solid chance and hate giving bad reviews. But this place definitely deserves it. Someone needs to put this restaurant on a restaurant rescue reality show or something lol. Paid only 10$ less than I would have at Texas de Brazil or fogo. Pay the extra money and enjoy the service and better food. I promise you won't regret it.
