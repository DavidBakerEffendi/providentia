I have been a patron of Cantina 1511 for years. When the restaurant was at the former location on East Blvd, I even rented out the back room and held a birthday party for my fianc√©. We have always supported this local find, however we will not anymore. 
I recently took my grandmother for a birthday lunch, and not a single item ordered was enjoyed and/or to quality of a good restaurant. We started the lunch with house margaritas, and neither one of us could drink more than two sips. They weren't mixed well, and the flavor was pure liquor... But not in a good way. The next issue was the guacamole. I will give grace here to the fact that avocados can be persnickety, and not always in season, but, apparently the guacamole recipe used there now is purely lime based. It was so heavily lime concentrated that you didn't taste anything else. It screamed for cilantro, and half the lime juice that was used. We both had different entrees. She selected the salmon salad, and I had the steak quesadilla. She said that the salmon salad tasted like it had been washed in water, and placed on the plate - zero seasoning and nothing worth mentioning. My quesadilla was burnt - flat out burnt. Tasted burnt, smelt burnt. The steak inside was grisly, and had no seasoning. Within 30 minutes to an hour of leaving, we both were regretting the stop at the restaurant... As we were burping up the food that we did nibble on. A manager needs to overhaul.
