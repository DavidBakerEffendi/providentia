Tried to place a Togo order and waited over 12 minutes and no one picked up when I was transferred. Called back again to see if someone can take my order and she said she didn't know if someone was in the bakery. I asked to speak to a manager and she put me on hold and I waited for over 5 mins. I hung up. I emailed a complaint but their website and I was told I would be contacted soon. Three days later no one contacted me. I emailed them again and I was called within an hour. I missed their call but they never left a message. I called right back and told whoever answered that I'm returning a call to a manager but don't know which one but it was for a complaint. He put me on hold and guess what....I waited another 10 mins and no one picked up!! Pathetic that I'm complaining about waiting and then have the same thing happened to me again. I called again and another guy answers and I tell him my issues and he says oh well a manager is standing to me right now. Oh ok, well why didn't they pick up?? Manager who answered was female and I told her my whole issue, she seemed like she wasn't paying attention because she paused for a long time and said that she wasn't working that day and didn't know what happened. Really???? That's the response I get? I asked why it took so long for a manager to get on the phone (10 mins) and she said it takes about 2-3 mins to get to the office to answer it. Ok, doesn't make any sense. I asked for the general manager and she said he would call me. He never called me but she called me and left me a voice mail asking to call back ASAP because she talked to the general manager and they want to try to get this resolved. Guess what? I called back within an hour and she went home. I left a message for whoever answered and she never called me back!! Horrible management. The GM emailed me a generic email apologizing. Crappy management and service.
