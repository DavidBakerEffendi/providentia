It seems the city that was built tips customer service in this town has gone to shit and Palermo's is great example of this. I placed an order to be delivered around 2 PM on Sunday and was given and ETA of between 2:50 and 3:20 PM (which is rather large window in itself). At 3:30 PM when I contacted them to see where my order was I got nothing but excuses and bullshit, not once did they say sorry or is there anything they can do to make this better and that's why you're getting one star. Not to mention on top of everything else their idiot driver can't add or subtract and tried to rip me off for $20 and then said I was lucky that he even had the change for a $100 bill in the first place even though I expressed to make sure that they have change for a $100 bill when they came out. The fries that came with the are so soggy they're not even edible, the only saving grace is that the Wings are fairly good but if yelp had a negative star rating on here I would give them a -5 stars just based on the customer service alone. It's pathetic and to think that there are so many places that you can order from nowadays customer service would be number one on the business's list of things to get right. In this day and age of information and Instant gratification you'd think a business like Palermo's would try to compete but it seems like almost every business customer service is going by the wayside and I'm glad that I'm old enough that I won't live long enough to get to see how horrible shit is really gonna become.
