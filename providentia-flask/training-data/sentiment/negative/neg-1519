Horrible service. Go somewhere else it's not worth it. 

BARTENDER was super rude. As was the  doorman. Bartender was Milady, she told me I could not hold a seat for my friend who was coming from a different gate and plane. I had already ordered our food. I was only drinking water and happened to be the only female at the bar so it felt as if she was a stripper working a bar for tips and not for Customer satisfaction.

So if you want somewhere to eat good food listen to good music and relax between your flights go somewhere else. You will feel more warmth sitting next to the TSA AGENTS.

Food was good music was good, seriously don't sit at the bar. If it's the only place open and youve had all the customer service you can handle I suggest you sit at a table. 

If you've had all the good service and pleasant personalities you can take in your travels and want to feel abused, unwanted and like your in a mean gurl scene sit at the bar.
