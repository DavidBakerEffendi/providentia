My boyfriend and I were craving something sweet and small so we decided to come to this tiny shack place. We ordered Bayonne and Napoleon Dessert Crepes. 
Portion is good to share with one person. Personally I rather have ice cream Crepes than just fruit Crepes. I don't like savory Crepes because it tastes weird. It's like eating something hot fruits. Well the reason why I don't like the Bayonne is because the pork tasted funny and it was full of cheese. A little too much cheese for me. For $8.99, I'd rather just get something else like a slice of cheese pizza. 

The person who took our order was kinda rude. (not to us, but to the people in front of us) The family in front of us doesn't speak English, so they didn't know how to order. They had a difficult time pronouncing the name of the dish and the cashier was rolling his eyes and rushing them. How rude...

I wouldn't come back.
