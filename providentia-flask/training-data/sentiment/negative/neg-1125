Horrible place.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.

Upon entering you see few options.  But it's a trick.  At the very bottom they say each topping above what they list as a basic option is an extra $1.50.

Not seeing this I added toppings as I like just like at Blaze or Pieology.  But those places don't charge extra for each topping.  You can load as much as you want of each for free.  The same pizza at Blaze or Pieology is about $8 before tax but with more toppings. 

Anyone who knows me knows I'll pay ANY price for food.  I don't bat an eye at $200 pp dinner bills.  But i expect value for anything I pay.  This personal sized pizza came out to be $21.45.  And while the price is daunting I wouldn't mind it if it tasted great.  

Needless to say it didn't.   It came out very oily and sour.   Like spoiled.  And yes it did result in severe stomach pain and several rounds of discomfort in the bathroom.   I will not detail further. 

Now I did ask how it came to be so much while I was in line and before I paid.  They pointed out the fine print at the very bottom of one of their massive signs AFTER the pizza was made. And I'm not the kind of douchebag to complain and have a new pizza made because I didn't know how something worked.

But it's just not clear how it works and is incredibly deceptive, especially with the proliferation of Chipotle style pizza places everywhere else.

Yes Vegas Strip eateries are expensive.  This I am well versed in frequenting places like Delmonico Cut STK Mastros Ocean Club Picasso Aureole Kabuto Raku Carnevino Gordon Ramsay etc.  But at least their menus are clear and the food isn't rancid, especially for a quick bite place like 800 degrees.

Don't go.  You've been warned.  Get a cheap bite at the cafe or somewhere else if you have to.  Anywhere else for the sake of your own intestines.
