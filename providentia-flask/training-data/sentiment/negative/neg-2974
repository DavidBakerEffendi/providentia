Disappointing. Spend your money (and calories) elsewhere, caffe demetre is terrible and you shouldn't go there.

After hearing good things about cafe demetre for a while now, I can't believe how terrible this place is. Sugar and sweet things always taste good! But not here, and I have a sweet tooth too.. I feel like I just wasted a ton of calories - This place brings true meaning to 'empty calories'. The prices are on the higher side as well which is almost an insult. 

My experience here started on a high and ended at rock bottom, I felt like a kid when I first stepped into this place with the colours and the smell of desserts in the air. The menu looked great and their puns are cool. That's about it. 

Their ice cream is no better than any standard grocery store ice cream. I had the customize it ice cream sandwich with choco Chanel ice cream. It was supposed to be French chocolate or something. They really made everything sound much better than it is in their menu. The ice cream was flat, it wasn't chocolatey enough, and it was just sweet without adding anything. The ice cream was way too soft as well, it was dripping all over the place and it was a mess to eat. Simply put, their ice cream aren't good. The chocolate chip cookies were soggy and again, no better than what you can find in a grocery store. I ordered caramel sauce with this sandwich and it was terrible too. It was like they squeezed it from pre-made store bought caramel bottle. I haven't eaten such a bad ice cream sandwich before. 

I tried some of my friends other desserts and they were more or less than same. 

All in all, don't bother coming here.
