I went there today with a business partner. I ordered a build your own omelet with 3 choices, bacon, avacodo and cheddar. The omelet came to me without the avacado, scorched egg and tiny tiny bits of bacon- GROSS. My business partner ordered 3 item omelete
Egg white spinach cheese and avacodo, received without the avacodo and spinach . Chef sent it back without the actual order corrected. I do not recommend this restaurant . We should have went to Metro Grill
