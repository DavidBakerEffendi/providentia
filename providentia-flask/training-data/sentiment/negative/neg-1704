Today I went to the Pizza Pizza located at Queen and McCaul, Toronto, Ontario. I was VERY VERY displeased with the service. I went with my younger brother, and i instructed him to order, the worker walked back and forth several times within earshot while several other workers were making pizza on the near by table. She was free to access us, but instead chose to ignore my brother. He said "excuse me," several times, when she did not respond i finally asked her for assistant, she reluctantly came over and asked us what we wanted. I requested a pepperoni slice, she said they were all out and the wait would be 10 minutes, i pointed to the sqaure pepperoni sqaure slices and asked why i couldn't just have one of those. She then put my pizza into the oven to warm up, my brother asked her if he could have a side of fries, she again choose to ignore him, i instructed him to ask her again louder, he did, and again she ignored him. I then asked her, she said that "well, i would have to make them." I had enough, so i said no thanks i dont want to wait. She asked if i wanted anything else, i said "can i have a garlic dipping sauce," she nodded her head, but didn't give it to me. I asked her for it again, she said " you didn't ask for it." I said that i did, she AGAIN reluctantly gave it to me. When she took the pizza out of the oven she slid it across the counter and walked again, I had to bag it myself. I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH THE SERVICE AT THIS LOCATION. I AM ASTOUNDED AS THIS IS A VERY BUSY LOCATION AND WOULD EXPECT BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE!
