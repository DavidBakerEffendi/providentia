Best RIbs?  I don't think so...  these ribs are completely covered in sugar. If you don't like BBQ sauce and would rather your meat cooked with spice that enhances it's natural flavour,  stay away from this chain.  They wouldn't even serve me plain ribs as I'd rather have put a touch of salt on and ate them plain. Even Swiss Chalet will serve ribs without the sauce if you ask.

The best ribs are usually at little korean places. THey know how to enhance flavour rather than overpower it.
