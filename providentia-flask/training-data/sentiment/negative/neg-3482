My colleagues and I placed on-line orders between 11:20am and 11:30am for orders to be picked up at noon. We used the pay on-line option since not all of us were going to pick up the order. I even called to verify that this would not be a problem. When my coworker arrived at 12pm NONE of the food was ready. She had to wait over a half hour for our orders to be prepared. She was not given any explanation or apology from anyone in the restaurant. It was only suggested to her that we NOT use the online ordering option again. This is EXTREMELY poor customer service and I am so disappointed in this restaurant. I have ordered online before with no issues and would at the very least expect our orders to be made as soon as we arrive to pick them up if they aren't already ready. I am shocked that not even one part of anyone's meal was comped by the manager. I would love to discuss this with the manager but nobody is even answering the phone at this location. Incredibly disappointed with the service at this Chipotle... orders should not take over an hour to complete!
