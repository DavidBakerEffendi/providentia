DH & I have eaten at Marigold several times before and we normally order the same thing matter paneer and butter chicken. This time we ordered our usual and the butter chicken was yellow, whereas in the past it has been orange. The flavors were not the same as it has been in past, the chicken was also over cooked and very dry. We will not be eating at Marigold again.
