Grocery shopping at the supermarket next door so went there to eat with reluctant mood cuz I heard this place is not that good. Found out it even worse than I thought, zero service. Basically just drop the menu drop the tea take order, not even say more than five words. Food tastes like shit the pork rib was like the frozen meat sat in the fridge for ten years. Guess what's more ridiculous? Ten pieces of tiny bone in pork ribs charges $10. AVOID this place unless there is the only one restaurant in this planet earth.
