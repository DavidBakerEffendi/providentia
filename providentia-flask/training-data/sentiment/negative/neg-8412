I'm updating my review to a single star. I've enjoyed several Christmas Eve dinners every year as well as other meals at Bonfyre. On Christmas Eve 2017, though, the incredibly slow service at Bonfyre at our 4:30 reservation caused me to miss attending my 7pm Christmas Eve church service, and Bonfyre is no longer on my favorite restaurant list.

I intentionally made a reservation at 4:30 in order to have plenty of time to eat dinner and still attend the 7pm church service. The problem with our extremely slow dinner was two-fold: (1) the host sat us in the Bonfyre lounge room, and (2) our server was very lackadaisical. 

Problem 1: Any guest sitting in the lounge room at Bonfyre is going to receive slow service. I learned that pretty quickly when it took 15 minutes for our initial drinks to simply show up. Because the main bar and kitchen at Bonfyre are 12 miles down the hallway from the Bonfyre lounge, the wait time for any food and drinks is increased. If the restaurant insists on taking reservations beyond its main dining room capacity, it needs to also insist on dedicating a specific staff person as a runner to expedite the service for the guests who are forced to sit in the lounge room.

Problem 2: Our server was very friendly, cordial and pleasant. I'll give him that. But he appeared to have a hard time handling multiple tasks. We waited for 15-20 minutes for the server to retrieve the credit card from the table. We already had the discussion that we were ready for the check, and the delay in collecting the payment was almost 20 minutes long. Instead, he walked to other tables and took their orders, wandered up to the bar inside the lounge a few times to find that there were no drink orders ready, went to the main bar and came back a few minutes later with someone else's drink, etc. Really?

My ideas for next Christmas Eve include:
- Go to Bonfyre and specifically tell them in the reservation that my dinner cannot take 2.5 hours.
- Go to Bonfyre and specifically request to sit in the main dining room. 
- Go to Bonfyre at 9am or so to accommodate for being somewhere else at 7pm.
- Don't go to Bonfyre and grab some fast food instead.
