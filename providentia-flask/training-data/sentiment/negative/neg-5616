I must say this used to be my favourite AYCE for the past two years but after not visiting in a few months until last night I was MAJORLY disappointed. I used to crave this place...sad to say it's gone way downhill.  As other reviews suggested, service was awful- rude, slow, they plopped dishes on the table and hurried away, brought the wrong item twice, ignored our quantity requests and halved it (ie: my partner,a hungry man, asked for 25 pieces of tuna and white fish sashimi and was first served 10 pieces of salmon THEN when we told them again what we wanted they took it back and gave us 7 each of what we ordered???!! Math skills or money saving technique- disappointing). The sushi was mashed up and there were a lot of rolls that had 'filler' of tempura bits. 
Poor quality. Bad service. Not going back.
For $22 per person, not worth it. 
Save yourself the money and time, go elsewhere.
