I decided on Kretzlers for my family birthday celebration. We have been loyal patrons for many years and multiple family members have been employed here in the past. Apparently the times have changed. Tonight our party of 18 (yes a reservation was made) was subjected to some of the worst service and food I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. We waited patiently for an hour for our house salads, which were still subpar. When my New York Strip came another 30 minutes or so later, it was well done, no where close to the medium I ordered. The list of problems, including the fact that twice I went without a refill for over half an hour,  is too long to take even take the time to write here, but I will be emailing the owner with a detailed complaint. It saddens me to take this off of my list of one of my favorite places to eat in the North Hills, but after tonight's complete debacle, I have no choice.
