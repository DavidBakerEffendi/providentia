Needs a good cleaning.

I do quite like the look of a number of the food items at the purple perk, but I've had a difficult time allowing myself to order any of them. 

If you look at the pastry case glass and the space between the shelves and the glass there is enough food in there to feed an army...of ants, fruit flies, whatever other gross creatures likely want to get in and feast. You can see numerous times that cake icing or cheese or whatever has been scraped along the underside of the shelves and then not cleaned up. It is left there to mold and rot and be gross. Just waiting for another slice of cake to get scraped along it and take the old gross rotting food with it. YUUUUUUK. Please clean your pastry case and other parts of the restaurant that are getting gross with age. 

I love that this place is comfy and well worn, it's cozy. But you can be cozy and clean.
