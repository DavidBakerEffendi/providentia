Gigantic menu full of confusing words. 
NO CHICKEN BALLS? 
Took 3 hours to arrive, driver followed me inside after I forgot to tip. Very intrusive behaviour, if you ask me. 
Would not dine here again, my wife said she wouldn't dine there again either. The most interesting part of the meal was the bowl of tears I eventually collected during the long wait. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
