First time to this place. Made a proactive effort with the manager/owner to learn all about this place. More than 60 minutes after placing our order and no initiative by our server to assure us our meal was coming we asked for an update. The manager/owner came to the table to say, don't worry you will like it. Really? No "sorry for the delay or hey, coffee is on us". A minute later the meal arrived. Good food for sure. No complaints there. As we walked out, another server (not ours) offered an awkward "sorry". All starts with the owner/manager. Unfortunately we won't be back
