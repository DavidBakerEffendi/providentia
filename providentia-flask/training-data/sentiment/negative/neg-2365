I was excited to have a ramen place closer to home.  I looked up the menu before going and when I got there some of things they didn't have. The portions were small and there wasn't much variety in broth or topping choices.  The fried chicken appetizer was the only decent there. Maybe I am used to other ramen places but even the broth wasn't very tasty.
