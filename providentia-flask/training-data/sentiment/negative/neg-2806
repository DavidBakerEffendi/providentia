I don't know how people are giving this place any stars!!. I can honestly say this place is not good it's  Monday at 4pm currently here while I am writing this review and I can say it's not good. People say it's good I don't know if there reviewing the wrong place but it can't be here. There is no variety, I mean there is but you will get maybe 2 plates. In the Latin section all you have is beans plantains and taquitos. How is that Latin food there is literally no food just sides!!! For God sacks this place doesn't even have rice. They ran out at 4pm! SMH. Take it from me spend your money else were. Everything taste like it was microwaved.... dessert ehhh DQ soft serve is better then anything here
