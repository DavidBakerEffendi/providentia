Stack'd...your concept is brilliant but your dining room could use some extra side work.

The choices on the burger BYO was impressive.  But why be so specific about toppings and then not ask me what temperature I want my burger cooked to?

I like the decor and the music selection, but when there are six people in the restaurant, why is the bar music at a level that makes conversation near impossible...?

The food looks and smells fantastic.  I just got a glimpse and a whiff of the stuff the annoying hipsters next to us ordered.  My own food, however, has taken over twenty minutes at this point.  (We ordered two burgers and an order of ten wings.)

Your bartender texts a lot but at least she makes rounds frequently.

My burger was good.  So were my wings.  The fries were a little lackluster, but hey, they're fries.  And they're not bad, just not what I expected.  

Your napkins are too soft for wings.  And the bartender just took a plate out from under my girlfriend's face while she was eating.  Like elbows on the table chowing down on a wing.  Now, we both work  in the service industry - I'm a chef and she's a GM - and that just isn't done.

I have to say, until that, I would have given you two stars for food and thrown you on my take-out list.  Now, we won't be back.
