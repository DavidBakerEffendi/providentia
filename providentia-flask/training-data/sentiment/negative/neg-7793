I've never had bad experiences at this place until quite recently. My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast this week, ordered a sandwich, two lattes, and a muffin and we couldn't stop ranting about how bad the food was on the way home. The lattes had a terrible aftertaste and the muffin honestly tasted like something you'd get from 7-11. And it was a bizarre neon yellow color. Very unappetizing. We were mostly just frustrated because we've been coming to madhouse for years and have always enjoyed the food/drinks. I always recalled the lattes being excellent and made with the actual tea bags instead of syrup. And the pastries being delicious and homemade. We both decided not to frequent madhouse anymore, especially after dropping 20 bucks for food we ended up throwing away when we got home.
