This is one of the worse buffets that I have ever eaten at.  I went there with my customer and friends.  We ate mostly crab legs - gross and completely watered down with no flavor to the legs, prime rib was OK, salad was blah, and the fruits were not fresh.

However, shortly after eating at the restaurant, I experienced one of the worst stomach issues to the point that I had to go to the hospital.  I was completely dehydrated from the graphic ordeal that I won't share and had to be put on with IV fluids in order to feel mildly better the next day.

I tried complaining and informing them of my issue and they brushed it off like it was my fault and that this was a random occurrence and that I was the only one that experienced this issue.  If anything, I feel that no one complained.

Anyways, I guess I really needed to vent somewhere and I thought I share my frustration with my fellow yelpers.  Thanks for reading.
