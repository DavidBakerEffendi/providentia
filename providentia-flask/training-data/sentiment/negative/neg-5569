We have been wanting to try this restaurant for sometime and we finally made it out. We walked in(three of us) and a baby in a travel stroller who is a special needs child. The host was unwilling to seat us because she said the stroller would be in the way of other people. We attempted to explain that our daughter can't sit in a carrier and needs to be more horizontal but she didn't really seem to care. In the end we left. 

The restaurant's response to this review will be that they found a place for us to sit.  However, if you have ever been to this place, you know how spacious and large it is. To say that a stroller would be in the way is just ridiculous.
