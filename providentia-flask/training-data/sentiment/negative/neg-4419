This place is beautiful yet the food was mediocre. We left there and we were very unhappy! The food took forever to come out (being with two young kids was not fun with the long wait), our bill came out to $80 with tip ( 2 kids and 2 adults). The omlete was over cooked and didn't taste good at all (don't remember what the name was but it had a balsamic glaze on it). Never again coming her again!
