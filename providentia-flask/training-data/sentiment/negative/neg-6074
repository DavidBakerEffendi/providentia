Ordered pizza delivery super late the other night and not even being starving drunk could make this pizza taste decent! Gross! Only upside to this place is their hours and that the delivery didn't take forever like a lot of places in Vegas. But even if it showed up instantly: if it's disgusting, does it really matter? Even Sophia's is better than this!
