This was the worst chipotle I've ever been to. The line where the food is was filthy. The rice was so old that it was burnt into chunks. Rice shouldn't stay together like that. They were scraping the bottoms of pans to get through the last hour they were open. Then, either a friend of the workers or employee was in front of us ordering and when he got to checkout he grabbed the sharpie pen and wrote on my burrito bowl lid. The food was awful. Never going to this location again. Go to solon.
