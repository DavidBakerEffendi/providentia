I had lunch there today. Service was good. The waitress kept coming back to refill my glass. I ordered the Lucky rice. Or whatever that's called. It was good but I wish that you could ask for the spiciness to be a little cooler. We also ordered the steamed buns and they were really good. Although they were good the price was ludicrous. I mean like $10 something for 2 buns. Like really. If I ordered two of those that would be like a whole meal at Panda. The prices were what made me not wanna go back. The food was good but the prices suck.
