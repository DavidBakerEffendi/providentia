I was invited there for a family dinner.  We had teppanyaki scallops, shrimp, Kobe beef, Angus beef, fois gras and fried rice.  We also ordered their sushi rolls, assorted sashimi, tampura shrimp and grilled mackerel.

The teppanyaki was blend, no show was put on during the cooking.  Overall, the teppanyaki grilled food tasted all the same.  Their house roll was pretty good.  I would recommend it.  Their assorted sashimi was very fresh.  For people like eating raw fish, this is a must have.  The grilled mackerel we especially requested for it to be grilled a little longer so that it's a little charred.  It was very disappointing to see it still under cooked even if we asked before hand.

They have a variety of ice creams.  You will need to special order the sesame flavor as it's not on the menu.  They have mango, green tea, red bean and vanilla.

The service were not really up to my standard.  Often times you will need to ask for your drinks to be filled and even when you ask them to do something, they will tell you to wait until they finish what they're doing.  For instance, a waiter was already clearing up our table when we ask him to take our ice cream orders.  He could have stopped what he was doing, take our orders then continue to collect the remaining dishes.  But instead he demands us to wait, it took him two rounds to clear our table then took our order.  But when our host ordered second round of ice cream, it was OK for the waiter to take his order IMMEDIATELY! (Although the waiter was in the midst of waiting tables) Wow, what a difference in attitude.  Because if this, I will NEVER go back there again.  Mind you that the meal wasn't cheap either so I would expect premier service from them.  But the services we received was totally unexceptable.
