After spelling my address out MULTIPLE times the person taking orders still gave the delivery person the wrong address. So 40 minutes past the delivery time we finally got our pizza. Not that I was very hungry after an hour and half... And it's a good thing I wasn't because the pizza was terrible. Here's the breakdown:
Very little sauce with very little flavor. 
The "double bough" was just two crust literally laid on top of each other and was a cardboard texture
Oh ya, half our pizza was MISSING cheese. Like it looked like a dog just grabbed it and ran
The wings were undercooked and day glow orange that tasted straight from Chernobyl

And now I'm hunched over in the bathroom with the worst stomachache I've had in the better part of a decade. 

AVOID AT ALL COSTS...

Now for an update:

So after waiting on hold for a manager for over 10 mins, I told the manager I just wanted him to know about my exceptionally poor experience. After many excuses about a new person taking orders and blah blah he then proceeds to tell me that we couldn't "get sick" from the wings because they are "precooked and we just reheat them" WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F$&K?! Do you take a food handlers card? Do you know how bacteria grows?! I was blown away. Like are you really going to argue with me?! 

Now for the kicker; here's how they tried to resolve things. 
1. Offer me an $18 credit for a future purchase. - REALLY? You couldn't even offer me the full price I paid which was $22. Come on! 
2. Then he said instead he could send us over another order and "trade in the food". I mean my jaw dropped to the ground. Trade the food in?! Like what do you can re-sell it?? Oh and did you miss me telling you how sick I feel?! 

This totally solidified my firm stance of never EVER going there again.
