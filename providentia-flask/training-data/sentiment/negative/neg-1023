Very disappointed at their attitude. I redeemed a coupon from pocket point. When I showed it to the owner he just said: No you cannot use it, I never heard of that.  And I asked him if it is his restaurant on the app and he said yes, but still don't let me use it with a very rude attitude.Seriously??!! I guess this is a stupid owner who doesn't care about reputation.
