Referred by a friend, I thought it was going to be an amazing place. As matter of fact the Wynn is amazing but this place disappointed me a lot.
Went for breakfast.. Service was very slow and i felt they never paid attention to us (we had empty glasses of water through the entire meal.. At the Wynn? Please...) 
We order the blackberry tart, which was described as something delicious. Well, we waited 20 minutes for a lousy pastry with berry just added on top. What is that all about? Come to LA and I' ll show you what a berry tart looks like...
I am in the restaurant business too and I know how servers make $. I left 15% for the first time in my life!!! They didn t even deserve that.. Total disappointment!!!
