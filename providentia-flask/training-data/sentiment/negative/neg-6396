I was taken to this place as a "surprise" and we were both excited to try their sushi. We soon realized that their sushi is worse than single-dollar-sign sushi, and this is a 3-dollar-sign place. The salmon and tuna pieces on their Rainbow Roll were dry on the top and had a couple hard edges (from being dried up?). The tuna pieces also had a very stinky fish taste. I had to go to the restroom to spit it out. Huge regret for not ordering their cooked entres, which might have been better based on the buttered escargot appetizer we had.
