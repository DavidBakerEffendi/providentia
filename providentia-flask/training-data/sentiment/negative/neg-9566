I was there today with my daughter.  We had to wait quite awhile to even get service; because the one server that was running around was "too busy" from what she said when she finally came over.  She never came over and checked on us after we got our food.  I had to flag her down and ask for more water.  I heard her talking about tables when we needed something and she would run right over to the hostess and talk smack, so unprofessional. I even said something to her about it, but she played dumb.  The hostess said that she was "staying out of what she said."  Such a shame.  Food wasn't even good to put up with that crappy service.  Don't waste your time or money there....
