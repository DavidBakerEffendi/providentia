We went to Claim Jumpers in Avondale and had terrible service.  We had to wait over 30 minutes for our meal and also had to ask for our check because the waiter seemed to disappear for long stretches at a time. We also had to get up and find a manager twice to ask what the problem was. The manager never approached our table and no one ever apologized for the poor service. Our experience took over two hours and the restaurant was not very busy.
Not going back and I don't recommend this place either!
