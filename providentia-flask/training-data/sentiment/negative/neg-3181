This was the most horrible experience. I am an avid restaurant goer and haven't had a BAD experience in a very long time, until now. We finished our meal. Waiter never checked on us mid way.  At the end, I had to go up to the desk and ask for the check. Took us 1 hr to cash out. No Rhyme or reason - we were not a bothersome table. My family of four ate, didn't ask for anything. We told the waiter at the beginning of our order that we needed Spring Rolls at the end. We finished our meal for a good 15 minutes before I had to walk up there myself.  Why did it take us 1 hour to cash out?  Because they suck at telling us our additional to go order of an appetizer was too hard to fulfill because they are out of spring rolls.

That's just dumb. One hour to cash out. Very poor service. The food was good. Average good food. But I will never come back to Jenni Pho again. I don't care how "creative" that name sounds.
