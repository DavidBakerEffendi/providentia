Ordered delivery from here not long ago. The pizza was undercooked and soggy. The potato wedges were soggy and super oily. It tasted as though the oil hadn't been changed in quite some time. When we called to voice our concerns the manager working told us that he was "disappointed in us for not liking his food". I found the comment very strange and off putting. He didn't offer us new pizza/wedges or any compensation, we will not be ordering from here anymore!
