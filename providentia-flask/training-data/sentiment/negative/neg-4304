I'm from Boston originally & our Five Guys is just out of this world. Here? Not so much. Chopped white onion on my burger instead of sauteed like at home...forget it. I had purchased a double with bacon & mushroom & got neither. So I called the next day & spoke with the manager Christina. She was very nice & accomidating. However, the replacement burger still had no mushroom & the bun was barely grilled. This burger was almost $13 bucks. $3.45 for a small fry. Pffft.Definately not worth the price. Will not be returning.
