We didn't order the sushi because my wife is pregnant. I ordered the Nabe Udon which had all the ingredients and was served boiling hot, but it was too salty to eat. Even the noodles got brown from the amount of soy sause they put in it. The Don Kasu dinner was crispy but the batter didn't stick to the meat. The server said she would tell the manager who never came by, but we did get some dirty looks from the workers and nothing was said or done for us. Don't order udon or donkasu if you know what those dishes are suppose to taste like.
