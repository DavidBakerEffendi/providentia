We tried to make the best of it, so I can't say it was an entirely bad experience, but I can't really think of anything good to say except that our server was nice and she was trying. Buuuut, she wasn't a good server. Service was so incredibly slow and I don't feel she did her best to make up for the problems we had. I guess my one other compliment would be that the clam chowder was decent. Waited a while to be seated because kitchen was backed up (we overheard). For starters, the fried pickles were gross. That's a bad sign, considering the name of the restaurant and all. Couldn't finish them. Had that cheap-tasting, thick breading. Anyone from the South would be appalled by these monstrosities. Fried perch was cold. We complained (and we are not complainers). They threw it back in the fryer. To be fair, I'm thinking that I generally don't like fried fish anymore, however, I still think these things were flavorless and subpar. My margarita was all sour mix. I asked for another shot of tequila and it tasted like a normal margarita. Still was charged, though. Tasted my gf's crab legs. Not bad. Tasted the kiddo's french fries. Cold and soggy. Oh, and the hostess was like an exaggerated character from a movie, not giving a flying f and truly unfriendly. Wouldn't matter, but we had to sit there and watch her for 20 minutes. Lastly, we got the bill. We could've gone to a really good restaurant with those prices! Yes, you get a little view of the boats coming in, but will never come back here.
