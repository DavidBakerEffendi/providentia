The service at this place sucks. There was nobody there when we went and it took freaking forever to get our order in.

I ordered the tuna sandwich and it honestly wasn't that great at all. 

Their fries arent all that and this place isn't worth the money they charge!

I go to vegas ALOT and I'm never going back here.
