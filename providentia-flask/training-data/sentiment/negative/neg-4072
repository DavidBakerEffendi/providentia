Great service but the food is terrible.  The $24 sirloin steak was chewy and not seared.  The sauce was disgusting.   We were a group of 9 guys for a bachelor party and the only dish that was descent was the ribs which was drenched in BBQ sauce.  We should've known when the place was half empty on a sat nite.
