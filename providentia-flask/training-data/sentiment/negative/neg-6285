Well, we were greeted with this comment, "You don't have any drivers in that bag, do you?" Well, of course we did as it was advertised as a driving range! They confiscated the drivers and allowed us to use irons. We were absolutely astonished to see that the rates were $35.00 per hour , but figured it would be good to try it just once since we are from out of town. We tried to pay and then were asked if we would like a lifetime membership card. My husband said no because we knew we wouldn't be coming back there. The saleslady saId that it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. We asked what advantage the membership was and she said nothing, but it was HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. WE said that no we didn't want the lifetime membership card for $5 and so she said we could pay the $35.00 an hour for the range, but we could not hit our irons because one of us had to have the lifetime card. So, we asked if the card was required, she again said, no, that it was HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Are you seriously kidding me? You know, if the place was upfront and honest about telling us that it would cost $40.00 for the first time and $35.00 for any other times, we might have stayed...but when you lie and mislead the public, I will have no part of your establishment. So, no. I cannot give this place a good review because they lack integrity--pity, because it was a nice looking place.
