I have been to over 500 BBQ places in my life and never NEVER have I had such poor staff. Including the Manager! So here's my story and I am sticking with it.
1) Walk in to hostess stand  sign says " please wait to be seated so I waited 10 minutes no one came.
2) There was  3 people at one table  2 people outside. I sat in the middle of the dinning room bright yellow shirt everyone  behind the counter saw me
3 ) Employees walked by me no one said nothing I finally stopped a young man I asked ? Are you working?
This is when it gets interesting!
4) He turns around 4 Times like  I caught him doing something he was not supposed to do.
5) I told him I had been mowing all day  no one came and I am really tired. So I said forget it walked outside with a s8 with full coverage never dropped a call. Called city bbq. The first lady young will call her "I am doing my nails  she said 3 times can not hear you and hung up.
6) So I called back go some one else that connected me with a Mr ccccbbbvgc could not pronounce his name .Then a Manager came on with.( Do not bother me attitude)  I gave up.
