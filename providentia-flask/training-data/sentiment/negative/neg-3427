The staff isn't every pleasant. My pancakes came out cold, and my glass of milk came out warm. The waitress didn't want to pass out the food or drinks, so she just put all of the food and drinks at the end of the table and told us to pass them out ourselves. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food. The waitress took forever to get us anything that we requested. She had extremely long fake nails that were getting in our plates. When we asked for water, she brought one single cup of water with no ice when 4 people asked for ice water. Btw, this waitress was named "Amy".
