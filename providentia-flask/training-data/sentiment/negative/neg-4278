Food was okay but I'm really disgusted by their service. Their service is horrible. I was there today at around 7pm and around half of the restaurant was occupied. We asked for a table for 5 and they seated us at a 4-person table. We asked for a bigger table because it's going to be impossible to eat comfortably and there are so many tables available at the other side of the restaurant. They replied saying that a party event booked the other half of the tables, which we understood. But really, we saw no party at all even when we finished eating and left the restaurant. There was absolutely no smile or welcome from any of the waitresses, it almost seemed like they don't want to work there. We saw a table leaving so we asked again to be seated at a table with larger occupancy. After we placed our orders, the waitress came with our utensils and she was so lazy she doesn't even want walk around the table to place our chopsticks and spoons nicely. She basically just stood at one end of the table and handed out our eatery in mid-air while we have to reach out and put it down for her. 

We had to ask 3 times for them to bring us water. When it was time to pay, I wanted to put it through my Visa card so I put my credit card on top of the bill then asked for the machine. She came with the machine, punched in the dollar amount and put the machine at the far end of the table then walked away. She did not even insert my credit card into the machine or hand the machine to anyone seated at my table. 

This is unacceptable. I am never going there again.
