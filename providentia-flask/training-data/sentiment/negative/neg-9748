Went drive thru & it was moving quickly, I was offered a sample which I never received! The food was just like any other Panda Express "good".
My Pet peeve about this location is every single time I order & get served they are so greedy to fill my plate they skimp it out every single time & have witnessed a couple times they even take some food off the plate when serving, that is so annoying! Especially when I pay extra for a premium item like walnut shrimp.
