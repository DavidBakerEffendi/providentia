the veggies are NOT fresh. They are just as bad as subway. The rice noodles in the soup are not cooked enough. The spicy lemon grass is nothing but water with lemon. If there are expensive topping like avocado,  they "forget" it. Then they'll say they will add it for "free" next time you order food. If you order rice noodle soup, they will fill most of the soup with cheap Chinese rice-noodles and put very little toppings. This really sucks.
