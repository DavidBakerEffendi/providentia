I agree with Dani. This Einsteins Bagels is slow! I went here this morning just to pick up a Hate to Wait Basket and I had to wait for the Hate to Wait Basket. First,  I had to wait in a long line until the Bagel Man decided to take the guy's order 3 people ahead of me. Before than he was dilly dallying around throwing bagels in the slicer. Second, it seemed that they were preparing a big order, because I had to wait again until the manager was free to pick the bagels to throw in the basket. Does it really take 3 people out of 5 to prepare one order. 

To top it off, the cashier was making small talk to the police officer in front of me. He was telling him his woes of ringing up the order and how sometimes how he needs to be creative in typing in the order. PLEASE, shut up and let the man pay for his grub!! Don't get me wrong. I like small talk, but not when folks are trying to get their day started.
