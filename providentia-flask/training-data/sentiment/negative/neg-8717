Just received food through uber eats! So disappointed! Terrible food not as ordered. Who makes an Italian sandwich hot? If this is what you do say so on your menu. My burger came dry no dressing, and one bite of burger and done. Meat does not taste good, fries ate old and cold. I'm not a picky eater but none of this is good. $27 later and I'm hungry.
