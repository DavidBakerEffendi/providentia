I went here months ago with my family and since it was new we decided to give it a try. The food looked nice. But as soon as we finished eating here 2 of us within a few hours got a little sick. The next morning I thought I had a simple cold. And a few days later after that I started getting progressively worse and worse. In the end it turns out I had pneumonia. It took me a month to recover. I will never ever go here again. I don't know if it was whether the cold food or the hot food since we had both. But I feel terrible for other people who went there the same night as me and could've gotten sick as well. So eat here at your own risk. No restaurant in this day and age and especially in this country should act like this.
