I cannot believe that they charge these outrageous prices for food that is so subpar. When I hear "inasal", the expectation is that it will taste just as good as it does back in the Philippines or maybe even better. This doesn't even come close. I feel terrible for giving this place just one star, but even good service doesn't make up for food that doesn't taste good. The chicken had no flavor whatsoever. 

My husband (not Filipino) said it wasn't good and my family (all Filipino) said it wasn't good. I would be willing to try again, but for them to charge $10 for this food is highway robbery and I'm not getting robbed twice! You can get way more food and way better tasting food at Island Flavor for $10. 

The customer service was great, but I would not go back.
