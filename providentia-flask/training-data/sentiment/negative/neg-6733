Wow.......cannot begin to say how bad our dinner was.  Great location.   Nice little place with lovely outdoor seating. Lacking in table covers & we had to request dusty top be wiped clean. Server was very personable & we really wanted to have a fun, casual, authentic evening. Server mostly Italian speaking & we had fun with our limited Italian. 
Food was overwhelmingly terrible. No bread served although we asked 3 times. Finally brought - w/o oil & vinegar that other tables had. Specials on blackboard looked great...only to be told AFTER ordering they were out. (?) All would have been fine if our simple salad & pizzas had some taste.  Completely lacking. Our salad arrived & our pizzas one second later. Simple field greens with balsamic was bitter in taste.  How is it possible to ruin pizza like they did??  Lukewarm topping with black burnt crust.  And I did not know it was possible to have an almost completely tasteless pizza.  Very sad.
