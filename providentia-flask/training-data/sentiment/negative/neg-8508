Worst pasta I have ever had that I did not make myself.  Based on the 2 minutes it took to bring it from the kitchen, it was precooked and warmed up.   $45 for $2 worth of pasta.  I had to get up and ask for a little bread.  No salad... no nothing. After he dropped off pasta never came back to table.  If you are after pizza it looked okay - but I would walked to doors down to Craft 64 if I wanted pizza.   To Grazie - I say no thanks.  I felt like I was ripped off and was still hungry.
