Google gave good reviews of this place but I don't see the appeal. The food is okay. I have had better hakka style food near airport road. We had the Tom Yum chicken soup which was more sour than it needed to be. The pad thai tasted like the noodles were dipped in the Tom yum soup for flavoring! And the beef schezwan was very syrupy. I guess I got what I paid for since it's cheap, but still, should've been much better.
