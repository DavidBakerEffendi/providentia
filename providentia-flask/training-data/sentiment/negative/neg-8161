Went to the Cravings Buffet at the Mirage last night and all I can say it was the worse buffet
ever.  We got our table and the server told us way in the back you can get your drinks. I will bring your silverware. Really???  Servers don't even serve you drinks.  So I went and got our drinks.  They had about 6 soda fountain machines that only thing was available was lemonade and no ice on any of the machines.  two were completely out of order.  Stood in line where you can get beer and wine for about 10 minutes just to get a soda.  I sat down and my husband's plate looked horrible.  Well done prime rib and crab legs that you couldn't even crack open.  After that I went and got my food..  Mashed potatoes a piece of well done prime rib and dry Rigatoni.  The best thing they had was the bread pudding.  Needless to say after seeing Terry Fator's show which was awesome we went to Del Taco.  All this was 65.00 for the buffet plus tip.  We were so disgusted, wish we would of just asked for our money back before we ate and left.
