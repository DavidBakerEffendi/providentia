While I cannot complain about the wait staff , this is possibly the worst restaurant in Las Vegas. I ordered the Chicken Rio.  Included was a salad and good garlic bread. The Chicken Rio, not seasoned at all; tasteless, and the vegetables were not warm. Robert Irvine would send it back!  The FREE red wine that is offered is a cheap burgundy, that no one in their right mind would drink.  A regular glass of Pinot Noir was ordered and sent back since it was about 2 shots of horrible wine.  The included cappuccino was not even coffee.  It was obviously the powdered International Coffees from Kraft, with added whipped cream to mask the falseness of the drink. A very unpleasant experience. With the hundreds of restaurants in Las Vegas, this is a major failure.
