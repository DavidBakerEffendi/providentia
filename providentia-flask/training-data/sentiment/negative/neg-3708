SOOOOO disappointing & it had so much promise!!! 

I ordered a Greek salad with dressing on the side for takeout on my lunch break.

I go the salad it had BEETS on it, but they were covered up with the feta cheese...like really beets??? I double checked the 'take out menu' I got to see if beets were there. 

nope no beets. I"m not a beet fan.

and my cucumbers were mushy and old

F-

booo
