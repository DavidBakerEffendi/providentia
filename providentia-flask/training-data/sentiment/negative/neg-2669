Avoid this place at any cost. It doesn't even matter what time of day you come or whether you go through drive thru or walk inside, customer service does NOT exist here. But incompetency DOES. And it begins with the managers , who I'm not sure if they can even spell or read incompetent. And the staff, they play around , don't take their jobs serious at all, are always joking around and never doing their job...the correct way! I only go here because it's the only one in Steele creek. So 1 lousy star.
