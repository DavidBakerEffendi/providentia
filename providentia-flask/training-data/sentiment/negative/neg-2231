Tiny burger might as well have paid $1 at McDonald's for what I got, Las Vegas has the poorest customer service and quality unless you are on the strip. So sad wish I could get in touch with corporate this is sad AF. So close to California and I'm from Texas and it's way better there. Real ice cream shakes my ass, soft serve and tastes artificial, lying to your customers for sure,tasted like trash just threw it away. Negative 5 is more like it, couldn't pay me to eat here.
