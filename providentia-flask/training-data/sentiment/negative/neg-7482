I was looking forward to a wonderful meal and unfortunately it turned out to be very disappointing. The ambience is beautiful and the service very attentive but the food was mediocre at best. Ordered Filet mignon that came with a vegetable medley and skinny fries. We both sent the veggies and fries back as they were both served to us cold!  The filet was good not great especially for the price and a bit too highly seasoned.
