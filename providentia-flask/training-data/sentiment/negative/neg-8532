Overpriced. Bland food. I was so disappointed. I grew up eating Panera in California and was so excited for this to open but we won't go back. There were no condiments on my husband sandwich, dry bread and it was nothing better than what I would make at home. It was a basic sac lunch. I had the broc soup and bread bowl. What a fail. Tasted like frozen soup, the bowl was hard as a rock. My salad had wilted and brown lettuce. I couldn't even eat it. My kids MAC and cheese was disgusting. I can say it enough if how over priced and disappointing our experience was. If the food was better, we'd be ok with the price  plus we'd eat there all the time and take full advantage of the drive thru.
