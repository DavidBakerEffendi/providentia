So disappointing. Went to pick up my order only to find out upon arrival that they do not do one of my ordered items as carry-out. The lady said they called but I had no missed calls. Right after the lady gave me my total, she walked away. I spent the next few minutes waiting for her to return (I didn't know why she left in the first place??), being ignored by the hostess until I finally went up to the hostess and asked to pay. Ridiculous. I noticed when I got home that i was also charged for a side of rice I ordered but did not receive. Won't be returning any time soon.
