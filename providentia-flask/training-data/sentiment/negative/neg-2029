The Crepe Club is located right in the middle of the Biltmore shopping center, the decorations were Valentine's Day theme.  The decorations were actually very pleasant to look at..  

Food; ordered a Crepe with Nutella and Strawberries, which was mighty tasty.  The crepe was a hair bit thicker than usual but still delicious.  Standard price included Nutella, each additional toping was $1.00 extra..

Service;  The Young lady working behind the counter was super friendly, and really was trying hard to satisfy all customers entering.

Upon entering it was a bit dirty, my first assumption was that the lunch rush just left but not sure that was the reason after our visit.  When we went to order, the lovely Young Lady and a Gentlemen was working the counter, ordered our crepes and soft drinks.  We never were handed our cups for our drinks, so we walked to the drink bar assuming that maybe the cups were located there.  Their was a cups located, so assumed these were our drink cups after going around the drink station looking for lids, another employee who appeared to be doing the bookkeeping finally asked me what I was looking for,  learned that we were never given our drink cups and the cups we were using were water cups.  While sitting eating I noticed that the Lovely Lady was the only one working, it appears the gentlemen and additional Lady were not assisting her, nor trying to clean the place or restock the drink station. After we were done eating, I asked for a lid for our drink cups, sadly I was given a lip that does not fit my cup.  At this point the Young Lady was getting busy, all the while the two other employees were not helping her out.  Upon leaving, I asked this poor Girl if she was the only one working, and if everyone else is on break.  Her reply was hilarious and wont repeat, but basically from what I gather she just came on her shift to a dirty store.
