This is the first horrible review I have ever done. But this place deserves it. After reading other reviews, I'm wondering how this place is still in business.

We decided to stop in for dinner, as we had never been here before and we were starving. I love Brazilian steakhouses and have been wanting to check this one out for a while. I checked their website and it said open till 10pm. We walked in at 8:30pm, only to be told their closing.

The hostess told us we needed to make a reservation before dining. I would understand if the place was packed but it was dead. There were only two other tables. She told us those tables were leaving and we couldn't eat.

Wow. We came here because they're in the entertainment book and sounded good. Nowhere does it say in their ad/coupon that we need to make a reservation. If it was packed and they couldn't seat us I would understand, but if you say your open till 10pm then be open. I waisted gas driving here for nothing. The hostess also was not professional and treated us like we were in the wrong for not having a reservation. I have never once been to a restaurant that closes before their posted closing time because no one made reservations. Whoever runs this place should be ashamed. It's pretty much false advertising and your losing customers.

No wonder this place is averaged so low on Yelp. Any good steakhouse should be at least four stars. Go to Pampas or Texas De Brazil instead. Or, if something similar happens to you, go to Jaliscos Mexican up the street at Sunset and Pecos. The bartender Omar is great and their food is awesome. We went there after this and their carne asada was fantastic. Plus, Omar assured us that if they say they will close at 11pm, they won't turn us away at 10:55pm.

So in conclusion, do not go here!
