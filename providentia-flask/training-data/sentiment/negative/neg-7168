We booked a 7 day vacation to the Venetian. We were so excited to get there and we had a great room with a great view. So on the Tuesday of that week we woke up and I was brushing my teeth and I hear my wife scream. I go into the room to see what's wrong and we saw a bed bug walking across the bed. So I killed the bug and put it on a card and called the front desk. They sent someone to file a claim. He told us that the risk management team would reach out to us(which they didn't) so they moved us to a better room. I reached out to risk management a few months after the holidays we had personal stuff going on and they accused us of bringing the bug. They said eco labs tested the hotel it came back negative however they admitted what we found was a bed bug . In the big scheme of things I spent 3000+ on the vacation and I did not appreciate that they suggested I brought a bug which is illegal to transport animals/insects
And it has never happened at any of the other 6 hotels I stayed at in Vegas 

So just know they want to charge like a premium hotel but do not have the customer service like a motel.
