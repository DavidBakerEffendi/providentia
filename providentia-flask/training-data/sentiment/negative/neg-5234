I had to spend a lot of time in this area during the summer months, so I grabbed food here pretty often despite having another location a lot closer to home that I prefer.
 
This location had a persistent and on-going ROACH problem!!! 

I've seen multiple roaches in the bathroom... eek!! I was told by a member of management they were "water bugs" and nothing to worry about. Riiiight. I don't know about you, but when I see a pile of roaches writhing around in the corner of a bathroom I don't exactly feel particularly enthused about what's going on in the kitchen.

Then the owner dude who wears a baseball cap was extremely condescending and hostile towards his own employees, which didn't exactly encourage me to spend my money at his business, either, which is too bad as the employees themselves were always pleasant enough.... unfortunately, on top of everything else, my boyfriend has found a bone in almost each and every single one of his Bobbies that we'd ordered. Being REAL turkey it's understandable to find a bone every once in awhile, but he found full on VERTEBREA. How do you miss that?! 

I like the food at Capriotti's a lot more than most sub shops, and the employees at this location were always pleasant enough, but the owner and the cleanliness of this place made me take my money elsewhere.
