I'm chubby... so when I ask for extra Oreo's and I pay for extra Oreo's I WANT MY EXTRA OREOS!! You guys do this at least half of the time!! Are you guys Socialist.. I work all day and pay for extra Oreo's.. and you guys take half of my extra Oreo's and give them to someone that didn't pay for extra Oreo's?? Is that how this works?? Down with socialism!! I hear Sonic is a supporter of Capitalism.. I guess I'm gonna have to get my extra Oreo's from them from now on!! You probably have Ernesto Che Guevara stickers all over your delicious ice cream making machines
