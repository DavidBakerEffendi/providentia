Wow! This place was horrible.

Went with my son, I ordered the grand slam and he had the apple cinnamon waffle and tropical smoothie.
Where do I start. I asked for half tomatoes and half home fries well done. I received all home fries that weren't seasoned and had the texture of mush. Eggs I ordered over medium, they came out overdone with no yolk at all to dip my burnt challah bread into. Coffee was ok but at $2.25, meh. Sausage and bacon was passable. The hot cake was like a hockey puck, no fluff whatsoever and not tasty at all.
My son's waffle was big and mushy with no flavour at all. Even worse his "tropical" smoothie at $6.95 was watered down with only a bit of banana flavour. $6 frikin .95???!!!!! For a watered down ice and banana mixture...brutal..
Bill came to $33.79 , I put down a fifty and back came $15.25 change. Well there goes my servers tip too. I hate when that happens,  for $40 f'n dollars for a terrible breakfast, at least give me my bloody change!!!!!
Needless to say I will never, ever step foot in this "restaurant" again.

Pissed,
