Ok. So this is where the old Myiako Sushi (Sp?) used to be. Which had excellent food but rude service. None the less it's under new ownership. First thing I noticed was the place wasnt very clean looking. There were no menus or place settings. The cost for adults is $21.99 and kids 10 and under $14.99. They had one server working the restaurant which shouldn't have been an issue because there were three tables of couples when we came in. The new ayce menu was very limited to start. The server was nice but slow as hell. It was 15 minutes before he took our order card and we had to find him to ask to order drinks. 

Then comes the food. He brought one order at a time and we timed it in between dishes, we waited anywhere from 10-16 mins. Sitting there Hungry. It took two minutes to eat each dish. The last dish came 40 minutes after the first and we only put in one order. 

Now the food. We ordered dragon rolls and they were small, cold, hard and the avocado was turning brown. The shrimp dim some was absolutely flavour less. We had to dip them in soy sauce to get them down. Same with the wings. The tempura was average but the sauce tasted like water mixed with sweetener. In fact all the dipping sauces were odd.  We sent two dishes back. The beef teriyaki was pretty much inedible.  The teriyaki sauce was orange and goopy.  The beef looked like hamburger. The fried dumplings tasted like they were stuffed with bread onions and sugar. Everything had a deep sweetener like taste. 

Bottom line, huge waste of time and money. It's close to home so I was really hoping they would at least be decent. I won't be back there again.
