I met my boy friend and his friends next door for a drink after work. After realizing valet was closed we were told that their keys  were relocated at
joe's . We've always enjoyed coming to Joe's for cocktails and food. Upon arrival we were given drinks and talking  amongst ourselves. After a bit, a woman and her friends arrived and  harassed us regarding our conversation which was quietly kept between the 4 of us. We were questioned about our experience at other restaurants and also harassed about our stance on hunting which we were speaking about quietly. Once bothered, we were very respectful and conscience about our surroundings and beliefs on the subject. We were harassed to the point of cashing out our tab and leaving not only by fellow guests but by the bar tender. We will no longer visit or recommend this establishment to any one we know. We feel disrespected and unwelcome at Joe's.
