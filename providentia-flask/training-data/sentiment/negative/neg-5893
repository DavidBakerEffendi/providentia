This is seriously the most disgusting fried chicken I have ever eaten.  The only thing I could taste was grease. You want to take off that horrid crust or wring it out, but even that would not help the taste...it just looks and smells like old grease.  

My entire group of 6 concurred that the outer layer was inedible...if you order chicken wings, the entire thing is like a mouth full of crunchy grease, you can feel the grease squirt in your mouth with every bite.   

The barbecue chicken sandwiches are slightly better, but there is no spice to the sauce and  it's too sweet.  

The atmosphere is nice enough for this type of place. They offer self serve drinks, but the root beer was not working.

They could have had dancing clowns and french waiters and my review would not change because: The bottom line is that every restaurant is about the quality of the food and we all left here wishing we could go back in time and choose somewhere else. We threw away some of it, it was just that bad and it has to be an assault on your health.
