Ordered an appetizer and burger from my waitress and after she disappeared someone else brought me my burger. I asked her if my app was coming and she informed me that my original waitress didn't put it in. Not sure why a waitress would disappear for 15 minutes while serving a table and not putting their entire order in. All around terrible service and their biscuits taste like Summit County jail cake!
