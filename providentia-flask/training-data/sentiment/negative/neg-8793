I was here with my family for a buffet lunch on Sat. The food was ok. The desserts were a bit stale. The jamuns were verybland.

The highlight was the cashier charged the full cost for my 8 year old daughter. This seems to be a technique that Indian restaurants use these days. He wanted to charge for my toddler son, but then the better and waived the cost. Please call ahead to confirm about cost of buffet for kids. If you have a below average eater, it's $14.00 down the drain..
