If you like slow service, being ignored, bad karaoke, and even worse food this is the place for you. We left 15 minutes ago and went through the drive through at Arby's. The decor is cute that's what the one star is for.

The steak ($22.00) was maybe 1/4 inch thick and had a kind of fish taste to it like they are cooking fish and beef in the same area or the same pan - we call this cross contamination. 

The Not yo momma's pot pie was definitely NOT my momma's. For the $11.00 we could have gone to the store and bought 4 frozen pot pies and it would have tasted better. 

I asked 4 times for more sour cream for my potato - the last time the server actually chuckled because she forgot again.

All this for just under $60.00 for 2 adults and I child.

RUN in the opposite direction! Save yourselves!
