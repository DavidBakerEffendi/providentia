Where should I begin with how unimpressed I am with this place? I've been twice now - the first time, lackluster service and an overpriced, overbaked cookie. The second time, horrible service where I stood at the counter for five minutes before anyone paid attention to me, then got kicked out literally 5 minutes later as they closed. Was this not something you can inform people of before they order your unimpressive, overpriced food? 

Ps, don't order the tiny $4 lava cake - what a waste. And don't waste ANY money on the service - this place is staffed by people who look like they can't wait to get out of there and would rather do anything but speak to or look at you. 

I'm obviously still angry about this!
