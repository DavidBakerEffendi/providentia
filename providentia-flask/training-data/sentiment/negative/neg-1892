LET ME START BY SAYING I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE THIS PLACE 1 STAR

Wow....I'm from Hawaii...born and raised until I was 18....I always like to support any business from there simply because I feel like most people from Hawaii know quality is way better than quantity....but my husband and I had our third strike today with them....

STRIKE ONE: their hours say 10-6....my husband and I rolled up at around 5:35 and they were closed

STRIKE TWO: my husband decides to try again...shows up at 10am...waits until a little after 10:30am and they still don't show (no post on facebook to let anyone know how late they would be)...I post on Facebook to find out what's going on and they don't even bother to respond to me....

STRIKE THREE: my husband visited them today (7/27) after seeing their post yesterday about having malasadas, manapuas, and etc...he shows up (first they post they're gonna be late so thank goodness he saw that before he left the house) and NO MANAPUAS....I'd love to say that was the worst part of the visit...but NO...my husband buys their pork hash, hot plate, and malasadas...he eats the pork hash and it's COLD...then he meets me with the malasadas...they are hard as a rock, way too dry, AND WITH A LONG STRAND OF HAIR FRIED IN IT!!!!!!! 

I don't understand (and I really think the others to write their reviews of 5 stars were paid or friends of the business) how other people have had amazing experiences and absolutely no complaints.... I do know though that I'm absolutely done with this place and WILL NEVER recommend it....way to give the people of Hawaii a horrible image!!!!
