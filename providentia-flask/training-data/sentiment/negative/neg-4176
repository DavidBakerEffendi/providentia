Terrible customer service. The hostess checked the 4 of us in and following the app we were 17th in line. As the night progressed, our wait went from 17 to 11, then back to 13 eventually to the hostess completely forgetting about us. We approached the hostess and she decided to give the spot of 4 to another group because she decided for us it wasn't good for us. When approached about why this happened, she just shrugged her shoulders and said "sorry."  After we were finally sat, we noticed another family of 3 had patiently waiting for a very long time and they were ignored too while tables of 3 were given to more recent guests. 

This experience has left a bad taste and would not recommend this spot till they have better organized hostess.
