We took our grandmother here for a going away dinner before she moved to a different city, sadly it was not what we came to expect from red lobster. 
The air conditioner was cranked to the max and it was a chilly day to begin with , so when our food finally arrived it was cold before we got to taste it. We had ordered endless shrimp and after our first round of shrimp we waited for our waiter to return for over 15 minutes , and after we ordered the second shrimp selection they didn't make it to our table for another 20 minutes and after the rest of us had finished our entire meals . 
We then asked for the bill and when we finally got it the waiter didn't return to cash us out. We actually had to walk to the front to pay . 
We asked the manager to speak about our service and he told us to wait a moment and he would be right back , but never returned . 
Service at its finest .... lol
