They open at 7am but baguettes at not ready but after 8am? Not very French of them. Too bad for one of the only few places where one is able to get decent bread in Phoenix. 
In addition, the attitude of the woman making the bread.. Hilariously ridiculous. She thinks she is running the top bakery of Paris or something.
