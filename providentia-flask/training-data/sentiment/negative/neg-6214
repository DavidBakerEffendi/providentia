I give this place a 1 because zero is not an option. 

Inconsiderate customer service. I asked when the restaurant closed the worker told me 9. I return at 8:30 and they tell me they are no long doing saut√© (basically no grill). I explained that the worker I asked didn't tell me that when I was in the restaurant 1 hour and a half prior. They both basically said "oh" and looked at me. I told them that they should let customers know that the grill closes 30 min earlier. And again,  blank stares and maybe a head nod.  According to previous reviews the food is not good so I wouldn't waste your.
