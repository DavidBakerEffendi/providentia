i was excited to bring  my family in for dinner as this was a new restraunt in the neighborhood.when i walked in, it did not seem family oriented for one.
number two, we were greeted by two hosts that did not appear very enthused.
We decided to stay to give the porch a fair shot. We were seated in a round comfortable booth, not much to choose from the menu but we all made do.
When our food came out it was all cold, except the kids meals.The waitress never came back however i was able to track down the manager she asked to repack the meal but we declined so she refunded part of the bill. When our waitress finally made it back to our table to give us our bill, we quickly put the cash down wanting to leave but we had to wait for our change. She took at least ten minutes to show face, so we had to ask another associate to have her bring back our change. when she finally made it back, she threw our change on the table and walked away. this was unacceptable behavior nor is this a restraunt i will ever return to.
Terrible review from the host to the waiters. 
by far the worst service i ever had.
The talk around arcadia we are not the only unhappy customers
