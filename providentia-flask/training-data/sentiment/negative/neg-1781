So I went here with my boyfriend mainly cause he had heard it's good, but after our experience I have no idea how that could even be true. We ordered the crabettes combo which was just huge sticks of imitation crab sticks deep fried and the #2 combo which had two pieces of fish, 7 shrimp and fries. The shrimp was mainly all bread and was very bland. My boyfriend was completely grossed out by how dense and unappetizing the crabettes were. The fries were okay and the fish was probably the only thing I found edible. I will say a lot of my friends from the valley told me the one in Mesa is very good so I'll just give this place the benefit of the doubt that it's due to the location.

The good? The food didn't take long when we ordered from the window.
