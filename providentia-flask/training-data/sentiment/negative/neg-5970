Why do I keep giving them a chance????? I'm still in line 30 min later for 4 burgers. Really??  Only one car in front of me the entire time. I will never be back. Not to mention they got rid of the kids burger and changed it to mini burgers. Another way to cheap out. This place is beyond horrible.

We finally received our food. Everything was wrong. Now our fries are freezing and waiting on remakes. Worst place ever.
