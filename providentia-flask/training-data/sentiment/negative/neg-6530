Came in at 8:15 on a Saturday evening. The hostess, who was leaning over her stand slurping on a drink informed us that they were closed. The sign outsides reads 9 pm as the closing time. She didn't even have the courtesy to fully stand up to greet us.How rude and sloppy of a presentation. The place must make a killing if they can close 45 minutes early on a Saturday. I understand seating the last table at 8:45 but 8:15? Why not close at 8 then. Horrible customer service and at that point I would rather throw my money at a chain fast food place then try to support a small business.
