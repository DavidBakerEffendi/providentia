Don't understand how this place gets 5 stars.... I had so much expectation because I do enjoy watching Micheal Simon..... Unfortunately the food was to be desired.   The menu is small and food is expensive for what you get.   The burgers aren't seasoned so they taste like nondescript places.   The bar of pickles was kind of cool and they were decent.   The best thing we had was the pulled pork on the pork rinds....     I just am disappointed the burgers were that bad.....

The atmosphere was fun though.   I liked the decor and it was a Browns Sunday... So that is always entertaining.....
