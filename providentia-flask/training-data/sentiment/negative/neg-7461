I'm sorry, I hate to do this but, I'm 95%sure DJ's gave me food poisoning last Sat.  The reason I know... cause I'm the only one who ate the squid... everything else through-out the day was shared family-style with my friends.  I was sick, sick, sick... you don't want details.

Also, they've raised their prices... a lot.  I was bragging to all my friends about how great DJ's was and how it'd only run us 5-6$ per person... almost everyone spent @ 10$.  :*(   Plus they were 'out' of our favorite orange soda.  Nobody else really complained but, what a wreck of a group lunch outing!  DJ's let me down in several ways.

Won't see ya there anymore!
