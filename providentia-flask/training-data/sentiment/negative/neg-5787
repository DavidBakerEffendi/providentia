The manager is rude , the room stunk , no refrigerator, no microwave, the ice machine was broken ,no cold water came out the faucet and frogs hoping around the little graSs area ( they were cute thou, lol I would never go back there again.

On a good note, the bed was comfy, AC works great, and the pool was nice & clean   :)
