Awful. Food comes super quick but each item was a disappointment. Ever wondered how to mess up edimame? Make it limp and grey and don't bother to salt it. Asparagus with grilled pork?make that asparagus wrapped in a circle of gelatinous almost uncooked bacon. Awful! 
I could go on but there were 5 awful items that followed. 
And terrible value, at $28 plus tip for
Dinner including a Sprite. 

I will never ever ever return.
