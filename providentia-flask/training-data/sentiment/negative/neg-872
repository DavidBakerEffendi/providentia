Will never be back. Went to try a new pet friendly restaurant. We sat on the patio with our well behaved cat who has no problem with dogs. Dallan was in his stroller and nothing happened while we were there. We were rudely kicked out just because he wasn't a dog. We went across town square to Brio and they welcomed him and us with no issues. This place sucks.

In response to Chris: I call BS. Dallan since Friday has gone with me to Grape Street Cafe, Brio Tuscan Grille, and Egg Works. All on patios with other dogs in his stroller no issues at any other place. Your own rules state dogs are not to be in laps or chairs yet that was happening at the table next to us and we were the ones kicked out, and Dallan was in a stroller no bugging anyone, not causing a scene, etc. Again, BS!
