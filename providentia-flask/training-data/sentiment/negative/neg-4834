Honestly one of the worst buffets I have been to recently
I went for the weekend lunch
The price for the quality is WAY too high! 
Regret waiting 30 minutes to eat here 

I tried a bit of most of their food
I tried one bite of most of their food and left it
The food was either too salty, too bland, too dry... too much
They had the WORST french toast, pancakes & waffles I have ever had 
Even the microwaveable foods taste better

There were a few foods I did like thankfully
The omelet, eggs benedict and ONE of the chocolate mousse, salad... 

But I wouldn't go again
I don't want to pay $30+ to go eat eggs and salad
Even the fruits seemed like they took a beating before making it out 

Me and my friends went to go eat somewhere else after because the food was so bad we didn't want to eat any more
