First off, let me begin with the fact that nobody in my party wanted to go to outback because of their previous shi**y experienced & me being the optimist pushed and pleaded and we ended up at outback. The service was subpar- the hostess didn't greet us with a smile or any friendliness at all. She never made eye contact with us and grew our menus on table In a jumbled pile. the waiter approached us the second we sat down asking for our orders and drinks (we didn't even get a chance to open the menu). We got steaks & neither of them were cooked the way we wanted them, but the waiter never came back to check that everything was alright, or if our steaks were cooked right- which most servers in steak joints do....Then at the end of the meal, the promo we ordered was supposed to come with dessert. He dropped off the check without even asking what dessert we wanted & when we asked for the desert to go, we got a dinky piece of crappy cheesecake. Now I know why people don't go to outback. Clean up your act, Outback.
