Very rude and nasty little cashier/hostess named "Brit"; also subpar pizza

OK, so I'm a fan of the Ellis Island location. so I figured why not try out this location as well.  I love the buy one get one large pizza deal they have at Ellis (Sundays) so I confirmed with the person taking the order on the phone that yes, they have the same deal as Ellis Island buy one get one.

So, I arrive and go into the takeout entrance to pick up the pizza.  When I go to pay, "Brit" tells me the total is $31 and some change.  I said, "hold on, you told me it was buy one get one when I ordered on the phone so total should be around $21".   She starts to argue with me and says, "I never told you that, our deal is buy 1 get one half-off".  So I said, "I would have never ordered if that was the case because you said it was the same deal as Ellis buy one get one".   We go back and forth a few times.  Obviously, she doesn't know what buy one get one means.

Then, I couldn't believe this, Brit, snatches the pizza boxes off the counter and acts like she is gonna put them away back in the kitchen.  With major attitude, she snaps, "Well do you want them or not"!?  I should have asked for a manager by now, but instead pay the $31 cause I'm starving and figure I'll speak with manager from home.

The 2 large pizzas were not up to normal standards for Metro. Just soggy, salty, and just plain sad. Nasty!! 

So I call back 2x and am put on hold for almost 10 minutes, then she says our manager will call you back in a little while. Ok fine.

Receive call back from manager Jen who was actually helpful and apologetic. I explained the situation and told her that if an employee of mine acted like Brit, she should be fired on the spot.  So I got a $10 credit for my next trip.  But don't think I'll ever return.  Best off that I stick with Ellis Island Metro Pizza.
