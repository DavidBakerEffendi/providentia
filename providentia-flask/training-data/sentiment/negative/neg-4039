I was really put off over one silly thing but that's just the way I am. I have enjoyed breakfasts at two of their locations Yonge Street and  Mt. Pleasant just this last Wednesday when upon asking for an ice water with lemon was told by the server that they charge for the lemon. They charge 1 buck fifty or 1 buck twenty - five as since I saw RED at the word 'charge', I wasn't focused on the exact amount since no matter what the charge would be, I already knew that I would not be prepared to pay anything. However, the amount of this surcharge was so outrageous that I was more interested to hear an explanation and here it is as feeble as it was. Firstly, some customers would order lemon with ice water and proceed to make their own lemonade using the sugar at the table and when I said that they must get some very nasty customers, she was quick to defend their customer base as mostly being nice. So then she tried this one on me, a lemon can cost over a dollar and if they serve only one customer lemon that day then the rest of the lemon is tossed and they need to recover the cost by charging for a whole lemon. Enough prattle! Would have left then if I had been on my own but did not want to subject my friend that I was with, to any unnecessary inconvenience so we enjoyed a breakfast special which was very good value but with just plain tap water. But since there are other diners around that can provide a decent breakfast at a fair price and still put a slice of lemon in my iced water, Hazel's is off my list as it hard for me to imagine any diner that could not figure out a way to be able to include lemon in the ice water when requested without sounding so ridiculous when they try to justify such an exorbitant surcharge. Management should work on a better story for their servers to use on their customers rather than these excuses that are an insult to the customer's intelligence.
