Very disappointed...we spent $40 and it was the worst $40... the burgers had no flavor and super plain..and the chili cheese fries tasted like the ones you buy off the store....the fries were super salty and old...and the chicken nuggets tasted store bought...the only ok thing was the wings...
I dont see this place staying opened for long...
I only give it a 1 star because of the wings..
