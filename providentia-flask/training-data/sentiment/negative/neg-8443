I went here w friends 10/27 I was late so I had my food cooked in the back. My Friends had complained that the cook cooked their food super fast but I just laughed it off. My food finally came and my broccoli was clearly uncooked u could tell, when I touched it it was cold. I complained to the waiter he bought me more vegetables but I was so over it. I barely touched my food It was not good at all. I complained to the manager he only gave me 30% discount for poor service & undercooked food. Wouldn't recommend it
