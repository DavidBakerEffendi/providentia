Kristie & Jenny were helping us out tonight, worst bartenders we have experienced at this place. We had a comp for our anniversary and they couldn't figure out what to do with it. Jenny was new and didnt know what to do with our comp but Kristie argued with us when we got our bill about the comp. we had been gambling all night, she finally informed us that 'everywhere in Vegas is the same and you need to out 20 in the machine to get comped'  we weren't looking for our tab to be comped but we were playing at the bar and an extra drink would be nice here and there considering we ARE Locals. I also have to complain about the food. We ordered the queso fundido and it can out cold. I stuck my finger to the boton if the bowl and it was not hot! I was yoo aftaid to send it back for fear they would spit in my food. Too bad this place is so close to the house. I finally remember why I only visit once a year.
