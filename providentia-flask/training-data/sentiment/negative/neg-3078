If I could put zero I would. I spent $30 dollars on tacos. RIP OFF!!! I might as well should have somewhere else and got my money's worth. The tortillas were cold and stale, like if they had been sitting out all day and they just reheated them. The meat was burnt, dry and cold. To top things off, I went to the restroom and the guy asked my girlfriend what I had ordered. As if he wasn't standing there when I ordered and when he punched it in to the machine.
