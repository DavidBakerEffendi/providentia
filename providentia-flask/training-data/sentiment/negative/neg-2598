Now I know it's Taco Bell, but this was ridiculous. Went through the drive thru and ordered 12 pack of tacos. First, while ordering someone had a headset and kept saying "no" through the entercom while the girl was taking out order. Then it took 10 minutes to get 12 regular tacos. Not acceptable. There was a lot of goofing off in the store and great that kids are working, but they need a manager that can keep them being respectful to their customers.
