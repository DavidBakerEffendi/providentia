I was vising my friend from out of town this past weekend and we dined at this establishment. Three of us came in after the rest of the party who already got their drinks. We ordered our drinks and about 15 minutes later we were wondering where they were. We looked at the bar and there they were. We stared at them for another 25 minutes and during this time, our server was still nowhere in sight. When he finally came over, someone in our party mentioned that the drinks have been sitting there for quite some time and his repose was, "Sorry I forgot". I ordered the filet mignon medium and someone else in our party ordered it rare. I was handled my steak and told it was medium. By the time I cut into the steak and discovered that it was rare, the other person had already eaten half of theirs. If you're paying $36 for a steak, you should have to check to make sure it's cooked right. Our server never came back to ask how our food was and I'm not one to complain. While cleaning up our table, the server also dropped a knife down my back. His response was, "Oops, sorry". Most people I know would be absolutely appalled by the server's lack of concern and overall behavior. I can easily say that this was the worst service I've ever had in my life. Typically, if the service is average, I tip 20% and if the service is great, I tip 25%. There was an automatic 20% gratuity that was applied to my check. However, that wasn't the amount that I signed off on. I wrote on the check why I was leaving less than 20% and expressed my concerns. Most people I know would have requested their drink, which was sitting for over 30 minutes, to be comped, request that their steak be remade and would have asked to speak to a manager if a knife was dropped on them. I didn't make a fuss and the merchant still wound up charging my card for the 20% tip. You would expect a lot more from this type of establishment. This was the absolute worst dining experience that I've ever had.
