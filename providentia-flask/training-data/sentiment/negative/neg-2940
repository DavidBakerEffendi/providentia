Thought that coming here would be a great choice but I was wrong !!!! :( wait  for a table was 15-20 minutes , food and drink quality is very poor, food either too bland or it was too spicy , the waitress did not check on us ( I mean I understand that there busy, but they need more staff !!! ) only good thing about this place unfortunately is that it's in a beautiful hotel, but needless to say that they need to redo the buffet menu
