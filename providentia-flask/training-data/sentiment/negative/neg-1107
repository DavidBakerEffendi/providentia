We have wanted to try this since moving here in 2013 sorry we did the wanting was better than the actually tasting.   

S&S Pork sauce tasted like out of a can.  The chow mein was tastless, it should have a flavor to stand on its own, the orange chicken was just ok.  Anyone know where we can find good Chinese here without going broke or having to eat at a casino.  Times like this I miss Fresno's Chinese restaurants.
