I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.

We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.  

It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.  

We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.  What a terrible, awful experience.
