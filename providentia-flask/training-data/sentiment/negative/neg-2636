I thought this was going to be my favorite location after issue with the other one off Fort Apache.  We came here about 5-6 times the last few months.  I'm starting to think all the Chipotles in Las Vegas just sucks.  

We walked up to the counter to order.  No one greeted us.  There were 5 employees standing in front of us.  One was making two burritos for himself it seems like.  They were just chatting to each other.  The guy who made our food had his hands all over counters and on his apron and pockets.  Didn't wash his hands by the way before making our food. 
 The food....brown rice was served raw, not cooked al dente... not even close.  Meat were dried and lack of seasoning.  Same goes to their expensive guacamole.  Everything was super bland the last time we came here.  

FYI, they're charging the 3 tacos differently now.  We always order 3 tacos, 2 carnitas and 1 steak with guacamole.  They charged use individually for the tacos with individual guacamole charges of .75 cents... $1.95 is the regular charge with your meal, now it's $2.25 because they charged me like this.  We eat Chipotle often, I remember guacamole around $1.25 or so.  This is ridiculous.  They should tell people to get it in the container, it's $1.95.  They should have only charged us for the $1.95 as a one time courtesy since I said something.  They're too cheap to make a regular customer happy. 

We still came here after the e. coli breakout.  That must say something, but after seeing how dirty it is here.  I don't know anymore.  I don't want to get sick.  The condiment bar is dirty and empty napkin holders and lids.  Trash cans are overflowing.  

Customer service at Chipotle in Las Vegas is non existence.
