The place was a bit hard to find, it's hidden behind other industrial buildings. The decor inside is nice. We came for AYCE lunch on a Saturday. The AYCE lunch menu is the same as the dinner and same price. The ordering system is super outdated they don't use iPads with pictures... They have a paper menu with lots of words and no pictures (and doesn't even describe what is in each roll) and then you have to flag a waiter over and try to remember all the things you want to order.... 
The food on the menu was limited, plain and simple and nothing special, nothing high end, all the cheap stuff. Nothing on the menu was exceptional or good, there are many AYCE places much better than here, our entire group of 6 people for sure will not return.
