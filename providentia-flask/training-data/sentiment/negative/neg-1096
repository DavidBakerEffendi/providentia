Very loud, many drunk people and long wait times (don't know why as it seemed somewhat empty inside). The food is horrible, how can you mess up pasta. I can see why the wine is "all you can drink" as being drunk helps with masking the horrible food.

I have no idea on how people can describe this place as a "hidden gem" or "[you] won't be disappointed". I'm sad for them as they may not have had better Italian food or are comparing this place to Olive Garden (BTW... also horrible). 

Like anything else YMMV and their claim of being the "finest Italian Food & Atmosphere 
in all of Las Vegas!"... LOL, I think not! 

Yes I know I have "2 check-ins" for here but I was forced to come a second time because of a friend who "had to check it out". Fortunately, they also had the same verdict as I did. Rest assured, we won't be here again.
