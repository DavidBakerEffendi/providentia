This review is not based on the quality of the food, more the quality of the service. It is asinine that at peak lunch hours, it takes at a minimum 40 minutes to receive food. There are 2 people on the line, one cashier. This is absolutely insane and no way to run a chipotle. At a chipotle in Philadelphia or New York there would be at a minimum of 6 people on the line. Just because this is madison, Wisconsin does not make an excuse for the absurdly slow service. This has clearly been addressed in other reviews before, so why has management done nothing? It's a shame that this horrible service encourages customers to walk out when seeing a long line rather than waiting. Terrible!
