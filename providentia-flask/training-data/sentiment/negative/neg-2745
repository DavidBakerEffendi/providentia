Worst customer service, I am a regular PTs player and James at Sierra Golds on 215/Jones had the nerve to say I was complaining about a $40 check when I told him he charged me for my drinks. Not only did I lose a bet because of their filthy machines, when the machine didn't hold and I lost, I asked him to call a tech and he complained saying it would take two hours for them to come out. HORRIBLE!!! you never know who will walk in to your bar!! I would hate to know my servers or bartenders left such a bad impression of our brand in a customers memory. I will never step foot inside Sierra Golds!! GO TO PTS GOLD ON BUFFALO/215 instead SAME HAPPY HOUR AND BETTER SERVICE!
