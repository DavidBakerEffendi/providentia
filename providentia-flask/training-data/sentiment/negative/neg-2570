I will not stay here ever again!!! Aside from how much you spend on the rooms, when you book and confirm the total they give you will not be the total you have to pay upon checkout! Don't even think about using the fridge in your room as its full of mini bar items that if you even touch you will be charged for. They still tried to charge me for items that I wasn't even close to touching! The room had the most terrible view, the cleaning service was atrocious and on top of that they still over charged me for my room after I kept repeatedly calling to have them fix my bill! For all you pay for a suite here you could save your money and stay anywhere else and actually have a pleasant stay! Usually I stay at the Paris but wanted something special for my boyfriend's birthday...I will never abandon Paris again!
