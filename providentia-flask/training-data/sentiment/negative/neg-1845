Second time I have gone with my 2 lady friends and the second time they never said hello or I will be with you in a min.  Absolutely nothing.  This time we were smart we up and left.   Manager wanted to know why we were walking out.  We voiced our reasoning.  Unfortunately we have learned at this location if you are only women you will wait at the table for someone to approach you till your next birthday so don't go in hungry
