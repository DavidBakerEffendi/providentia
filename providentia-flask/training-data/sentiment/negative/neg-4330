Food and drinks are horrible and the service doesn't make up for it. I came in around 9 and just got dessert and a drink. The Blueberry Rum Cooler was really just watered down fake lemon juice with 4 blueberries in it. I got the flan for dessert which claimed to come with "light caramel and seasonal berries" which apparently translates to swimming in caramel sauce with a single strawberry on the side. Also, my water glass was super dirty and I sat without being greeted for almost 10 min before being asked if anyone had been by. I'll be finding somewhere else outside of the hotel for breakfast tomorrow.
