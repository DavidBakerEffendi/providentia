Love Cafe Rio but this location is too dirty for me to go back. One of their staff "cleaned" up the counter by mixing the dirty pico de gallo stuck along the trim BACK into the container with the fresh one. Also there's black wilted lettuce mixed with the rest then put into my Pork salad along with the dirty pico. I had to cancel my order. Too gross! Hope that their manager would fix this :(
