This place is probably the worst bakery in the Valley! The customer service are awful, unfriendly, terrible attitude and non helpful in anyway. All they do is sit around trying to impress each other and look good as you buy dried out cake. I have no idea how the owners can even think of going retail. I wanted to buy a cake and they said we must email them first and someone may get back to you regarding there cake but they need a week out to make it! Lmao! I have to take a chance with an email hoping someone gets back to me!? Can you say inconvenient!! Lol! Don't bother wasting your time or theirs apparently, with this fake place. You walk in feeling good and you walk out angry and insulted. Plenty of places ROCK in be Valley and his place will close soon. Location sucks as well and the macaroons are dry like sandpaper. FAIL!!
