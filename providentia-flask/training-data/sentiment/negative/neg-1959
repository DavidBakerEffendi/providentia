Pain in the butt. Without knowing in advance, the bills come for parties of 6 or more with each individual oz. from the tasting menu entered separately and no separate bill option. They won't separate cheques. Oh, and they add 18% gratuity  automatically, so no matter how annoying and poorly organized, they make money on it. And you spend ten minutes trying to figure out the price differences between a bunch of randomly priced samples. 'Well, it's written in the menu' our server says. Yes, the one menu per table... And it's at the bottom of page two. So annoying.
