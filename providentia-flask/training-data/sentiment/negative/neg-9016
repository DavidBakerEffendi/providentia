I didn't like the food. The beans taste like they came from a refried beans can, the enchiladas beef taste like Taco Bell taco meat. I told the waitress I wanted to replace the Spanish rice with a side of extra beans, before I order. The amount of money I pay for my dish I got a small plate of food instead. When me and my friends pay the waitress was on the side counting the money in front of us and how much of a tip she got from us. On the refill on the drinks if you drink more than 3 times they won't offer no more refill. INSIDE TIP!!!!!!!! for all you customers if you and friends decide to go eat there be ready to split your bill since they won't separate bill individually. I won't be back there the amount of money I spend. I would rather spend my money at Roberto Taco Shop.
