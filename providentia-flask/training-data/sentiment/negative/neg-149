Not really impressed with the food...went at dinner time had 3 rolls...Alaska, spider, and crunch...wasn't pleased with any...this isn't really a place for sushi...didnt eat anything Chinese except for the vegetable and that too was salty...want to give it a half star if I can...overall experience was not good
