Nasty says it all!  Our wings were gross, and had the texture of jello! How can you mess up wings when it's your signature item? We also were shocked to find out you charge for ranch dressing, when of course people want ranch, it may be petty that I'm bringing it up, but it shows how greedy this company is.  When a place does something like this, it makes me not want to support them, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to notice how silly this feels. It's the principal, and it's just wrong.  Maybe they'll start charging  for toilet paper in the restroom, and ice in their sodas...

The floor was sticky, tables were dirty, both wet and had crumbs on it, and the place was near empty. Obviously looking at the other reviews here, we know why. 

Rather than just let this review stack up with a bunch of other bad ones, why don't you guys actually take the feedback and use it to your advantage, and improve this restaurant?  Kind regards, a wing lover, who didn't even like your wings.
