They do not accept credit cards. There is no place to sit. I'm not sure the seriously dry and soggy sesame chicken is in fact  chicken... the fried rice was subpar was that white stuff supposed to be shrimp? The service there also sucked. This place is literally a shack, dead smack in the middle of the hood... which is cool and all but at least have some decent Chinese food.. sheesh.. usually hole in the Wall places that only accept cash have the best food.. this place does not.  Sorry. I don't get the hype...
