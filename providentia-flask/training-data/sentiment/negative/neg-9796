If you are handicapped, DO NOT GO HERE!!! I'm a paraplegic and made a reservation here for my birthday. No where on their website does it say they don't have an elevator, and are NOT ADA COMPLIANT!!! Not only that, the hostess told my husband "I'm sure we can get some guys to help carry her down". How ignorant can you be. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!
