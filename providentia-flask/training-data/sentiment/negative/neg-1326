Used to love this place!! Why not great food super service! From NY so it's like wow they have Boylan's Real Cane Soda on Tap. In the past few months to many bad ideas.... Horrible Menu Changes no more Boneless Dark Thighs OMG so good. No more party packs on the wings! What's going on over there!! I was in a few weeks ago 2 families got up after waiting 40 minutes plus for there food and demanded a refund and left! My wife went tonight to get me party wings and yup another change I'm unfortunately done w Blue Ribbon Chicken I'm from the old school if it's not broke don't fix it! It's not just me quite a few people have mentioned to me that it's just going down hill quick!
