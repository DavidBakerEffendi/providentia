The waitress openly admitted that the managers/owner tell her to ask every single table if they would like a side of guacamole with their free chips. What they fail to mention is that the side of guacamole with your FREE chips is $6.50(she is TRAINED to deceive the customers in to thinking it comes with the chips & openly admitted it). I was eating there by myself and ordered an $8 burrito along with the free chips. The salsa is WAY to hot, and forces you to get the guac they ASK if you want. 

I was very satisfied until I got my bill...$8 pollo asado burrito + $6.50 guac. Total= $14.50 + TAX!!! What the heck!!! I kindly asked the waitress to remove it. The manager walked over and reduced it to $3.50. Really? Great management, not! This place is deceiving(openly admitted by server) and is not worth my time. 

Who wants to eat at a restaurant that openly admits to cheating its customers in to paying $6.50 for sides they are asked if they want?

Please avoid this place. The food is pretty good(a little to spicy, almost nothing there is MILD) but not worth supporting owners who practice bad business. Shame on them!
