Decided to stop by after a movie at AMC for a bite to eat. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waitress. We ordered 2 Red Oak beers that came out luke warm, two southern fried chicken sandwiches with fries that were also luke warm:(. My kids had requested Red Robin earlier, I wish I would have listened to them. One of my kids ordered the kids sliders and they didn't even melt the cheese. Honestly, I could have had a better dinner at Chick-fil-a. Fool me once, shame on me! You will not fool me twice!!
