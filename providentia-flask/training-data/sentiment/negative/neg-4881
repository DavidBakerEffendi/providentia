Me and my son went there because i have been hearing so many good things about it, well we both ordered country fried steak, neither one of us liked it, tasted horrible so we left 2 full plates of food, waiter didnt even ask if there was a problem, any other business would have, so we just wont go back If he would have haf any concern i might, just might give it another try but no thanks
