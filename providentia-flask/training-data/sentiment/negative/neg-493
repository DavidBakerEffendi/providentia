Went here for Sunday brunch before we headed home.  We were seated and my friends coffee spilled coffee allover the table and her phone , pursue and myself were wet could not find the waitress so I stop the manager Joshua he said he will be right back.....20 minutes later we see him from a distance doing other things. Finally the waitress came over to help clean up when Joshua walk by I told thanks for nothing he got mad and so did I he embraced us. I ask for his manager but I was told they we off and he stated I'm union. I was thinking what does that mean. He said sir I'm offering you and your guest a refund and you can leave or I will call security......really he had to stoop that low and make use look bad. This is the 2nd time we ate here and its the last time I waste any of my money at this place. This so called manager has no class.
