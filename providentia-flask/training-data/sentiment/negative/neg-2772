What a freakin' dump this restaurant has become.  There was trash littered all over the floor (mostly used napkins), tables were sticky, and plates were dirty.  Make sure you do it asian style and wipe all the surfaces and plates with hot tea.  Even though the food was decent tasting , it gave me the runs (I'm chinese and should be immune to MSG and dirtiness).  This will be the last time I eat here....who wants to be in Vegas and have stomach issues? That should be reserved to alcohol and Fat Tuesday.  
I bet the kitchen is abundant with rats and roaches, as there were roaches in the restroom.  Could it hurt for you to hire another busboy to keep the floors trashless?
