I would like to rate zero stars but there was no zero option. We spent well over $50.00 dollars for a single pizza and order of wings that was easily the most horrible dining experience of my life. The pizza was so grotesque that nobody even attempted to eat it. The oil/lard had congealed to a solid state and smelled absolutely disgusting.

The wings were so raw they were rubbery to the touch and nobody attempted to eat those either. We asked for the wings to be well done as this the only way we have ever eaten wings. Suffice to say I will never ever eat this crap hole again and suggest you dont either if you value your health. I spoke to someone who claimed to be the owner and was not offered my money back on completely uneaten and satisfactory food. Needless to say I will be calling the department of health as soon as they open.
