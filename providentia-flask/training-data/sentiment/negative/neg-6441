My family recently decided to try out this new Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were only ok, not fantastic. 

Sadly, the food was very poor. Nothing special about the dishes we ordered. Our server disappeared for quite some time and we were left thirsty while we waited. We wanted some more chips and my son finally went to get them for us.

I faced some challenges since I was a vegan/vegetarian and asked for the vegetable burrito without the tortilla. The quantity of vegetables was tiny and I left hungry. One son ordered a combination platter of a variety of offerings. He did not enjoy any of them. The best part was that this place was close to home so there wasn't a long drive and the drink special was a margarita. I think the drink price was good.

We do NOT want to ever return. My older son said that his friends are not picky and love the quantity of food at cheap prices. We are more inclined to eat less and prefer tasty food.

Oh, I almost forgot, they have very creative ceiling details and strange paintings of dogs everywhere too.
