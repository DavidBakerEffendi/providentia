DAO Kitchen on Deer Valley and 83rd ave-Horrible horrible food, not even like chinese food to me. Nasty looking noodles (low main)  are like thick spaggetti pasta  dark in color soaked in soy sauce, egg roll greasy, fried rice was just plain rice and dry (food old and sitting I think) don't waste your money, much better food at Panda and cost less. Ordered delivery told 40 min (OK) arrived in 20 min ???  only honey sesame chic seemed freshly cooked and OK total 24.00 plus tip in the trash!   I am suspect family or friends are infusing positive reviews to over run negative reviews because of the extreme differences.  I know this is a gimmick by companies to thwart the negative reviews. Go ahead and waste your money and then you will know they do not take pride in their food and doubt they would even eat it...must think stupid non asians (also lady taking orders is gruff to talk to) !
