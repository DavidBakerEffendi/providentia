Came here for dinner with my family on a Friday night.

The food was way too salty and each order took really long.  
We ordered three dishes.  The second dish did not arrive until we were done our first dish.  After finishing our second dish, the third dish was still M.I.A.  We waited for 15 minutes and then asked a waitress to follow up on it.  She came back and told us it was being made.  We waited another 10 minutes and the dish still did not arrive.  We asked another waitress for a follow up and she also told us that it was being made.  We waited 5 more minutes and just asked for the dish to be cancelled because it was taking way too long to make a dish of stir fried vegetables.  The hostess was very apologetic and offered us a small discount when we paid our bill.

The waiters and waitresses provided relatively good service however for the cost of the dishes and the time it took to make them, I would have expected more than an over salted dish.  My family and I will not be returning to this restaurant.
