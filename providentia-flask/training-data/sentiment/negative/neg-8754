This was by far the most expensive personal pizza we've ever had. I understand if they want to up charge for toppings but $1.50 for each topping on top of the base fee of $10 is ridiculous! We spent almost $50 for 2 pizzas with 3-4 toppings each with a salad and 1 drink! Rip off for sure! To top it off the middle of our pizzas were soggy and doughy and my crust was burnt black on half the edges. This same pizza back home with as many toppings as we want is $9 total! Don't go here!!
