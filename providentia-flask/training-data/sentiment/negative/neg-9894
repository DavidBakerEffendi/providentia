Came in and got some bagels, which are actually not good the second day, unless you freeze them. So, if you want more than a few, you need a big freezer, but they will get freezer burn after a few days anyway.So, it is not worth my time. If you don't eat  it right there and then, it is a rock. The owner's attitude is tangible and avoid it at all costs, if you want to be able to eat. I have been a restaurant manager for well over 20 years, and I know when something is wrong. This place gives me the creeps, now.
