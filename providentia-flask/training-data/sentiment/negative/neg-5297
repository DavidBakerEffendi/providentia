Sad Day. Apparently there's a new owner. We knew something was different (not in a good way). We both had our favorite fish burrito, it was more of a pico and cabbage burrito! These things used to be loaded with fish and now I was happy to get a tidbit. The service was still wonderful, but unfortunately we will not be returning unless the new owner has an epiphany and serving quality food that meet our expectations.
