We visited this cute-enough little bagel/pastries shop (located in a 'blah' strip mall) for a late breakfast. My wife and I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwich. It came with a free soda/coffee, which was a nice touch - except they were out of decaf (which my wife only drinks). Both our bagels were cold and rather tough. The sandwich also lacked any detectable seasoning, making it very boring. 

I noticed in other reviews about how friendly the owners are; and we definitely were able to witness that for ourselves. Both "Mom" and "Pop" came out from the kitchen to ask how everything was and thank everyone for their business - even bringing out a bag of free bagels to go! 

Unfortunately, this attention was only directed at the table NEXT to us, who seemed to be personal friends of the owners. As for the other  three tables of guests in the restaurant..nothing. Not a "Hello", "How is your food?", or even a "Thank you" when we left! "Pop" even bumped into me when I was putting my tray in the garbage and didn't say "excuse me" - it was bizarre. 

So, if below average bagels are your thing and you love to be unappreciated when giving a small business your money; you just found your perfect restaurant!! Sorry "Mom & Pop", I don't think you're going to make it unless you start to make EVERY guest feel like a table of your friends.
