We sat down for dinner and it took 30 minutes to get our edamame... and while we were eating another server came by and was surprised that we already had our edamame as she had another on her tray. When our server got back finally to take our order, we were done eating our appetizer so we just asked for our dinner to go. We got our check and waited another 45 minutes to get our take out. Also, the take out order after waiting 30 minutes for edamame was just fried rice and salad... why does fried rice and salad take 45 minutes to prepare? Worst service I've ever had.
