I get confused when the name of the place changed from Native New Yorker to Native Grill & Wings....  yet the reviews are still under NNY.  We have eaten here since 1979 where it all started in Tempe.  We have noticed the wings seem to get smaller and smaller as time goes by.  Maybe they are Cornish Game Hen wings or pigeon wings but hey, we have NEVER seen wings that small!  They taste good but you need at least twice the number to fill up.  My previous review was 5 stars but that was many years ago, how sad.  Goodbye NNY/NGW, sad to see you change like that.
