***HORRIBLE SERVICE*** ***DO NOT EAT HERE***
we got a call from the pizza place at 8:15pm, when I answered no one said anything. I said hello 3 times and no one said anything. I hung up & then someone rings my door bell 4 times while my kids are in their rooms. I could understand maybe 2, but 4 times?? My husband answers the door & the guys says, "What? Are you sleeping? You must not want your food." I then told him I answered the call but no one said anything so I hung up. He began to ARGUE with me saying he wasn't going to give us our food. When he finally did give our food, he kept his rude attitude & gave me a "thumbs up" like he could care less what I had to say. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! WISH I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO!!! Don't worry dude, we wont order from you guys again.
