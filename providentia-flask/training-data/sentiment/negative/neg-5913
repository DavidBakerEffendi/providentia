Keen for low-quality imitation Thai food delivered with poor service? If so, here's your place.

With so many places in the city offering excellent Thai and SE Asian cuisine at reasonable prices accompanied by proper customer service, I can't imagine why one would want to waste their money at a place with shabby decor, at turns indifferent and dishonest service and food that's sole redeeming quality is the sheer quantity given.
