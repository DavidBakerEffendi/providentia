Friday night after football is not a good time to be here. Take way too long when all we ordered was milkshakes!! Then it was more like 2 tall glasses of milk (very little shake).
I would send it back but the servers don't appear to be happy tonight. 
My Carmel Apple Shake was missimg the carmel! Where they do that at? I was gonna give this place 2 stars but then that would be some credit, so 1 will do the trick.
