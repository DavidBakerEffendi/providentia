Food was good, I ordered the 4 piece fish, and half went home for tomorrow, wife got breakfast, tasted good, and she helped with my fries, son got the kids meal with grilled cheese... was decent until we found a black shirt and curly hair in it!!?!? I gave it to the employee  then told him the employees should wear hair nets and he did nothing but take the apple with the hair on it.. shame on them.
