The bad: 
Wings were bad. 
Burgers were frozen
Washrooms were absolutely filthy (think club)
We asked for Wendell sized beer and were told because the glasses weren't cleaned we couldnt get it
...dude clean your glasses
Food overall was very mediocre
Visa machine didn't work p roperlly
Ugh.
Overall this was the worst pub bar we've been too. For crying out loud clean your washroom
