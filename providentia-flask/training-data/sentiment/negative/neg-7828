Rude! Rude! Rude!  Stay away from this place before any ASU Sporting events!  Waiting time is extreme and there are empty tables all around!  We had to wait 45 minutes for a table in the bar, when people were just walking in and sitting at empty tables!  The manager, Matt B, was no help!  Ordered appetizers and dinner, and only were able to eat the appetizers, quickly because our meals were not ready - after 45 minutes!!  Loved this place last season, not sure why they cannot handle crowds this year!  There are many 
choices in Tempe!  This is no longer one of ours!
