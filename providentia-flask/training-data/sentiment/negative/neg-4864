Great patio, atmosphere is nice, music was ok, service was non-existent.  On a Sunday night  the place was quiet, but service was completely non-existent.  Ordered drinks at the bar.  Had to wait several minutes for the staff to remove themselves from the bar stools to get drinks.  And that was the best service of the night.  Our food was served one order at a time, with over an hour between the time the first and the last order were served, even though all 5 of us order at the same time.  To top it off the point of sale payment system allows a minimum tip of 20%.
