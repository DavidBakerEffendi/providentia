Worst.... Ever food was ok service was the absolute worse the clean plates are dirty when this was brought to the management attention they shrugged it off. The restaurant is dirty and unsanitary trash in the food prep area. We went to the breakfast brunch. Not only did the charge us 15$ each when its advertised 10.99. they then explain its 10.99 with players card they did not give us the option to sign up or look up our card. # which can be done its been done at every other station casino. We where here with a small group the wait staff tells us there is a 2$ per person charge to sit together. We said not no but Hell No so the staff sat our part in 3 different parts of the restaurant separating our 75 year old and 93 year old disabled members from the family. They didnt charge us this fee the previous day. We find it interesting half the employees are wearing pro union badges and the other half anti union. Hopefully real managers see this. Our group who stays at this hotel every other month and eats here every month will not forget this we will go where we are better treated
