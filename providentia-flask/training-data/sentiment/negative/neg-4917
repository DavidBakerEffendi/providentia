Horrible service, drove from chandler because we heard this was the best. Picked up our to go order and NO noodles in the chow mein. We called and the said they would deliver the noodle after we told them were we lived they said its too far they are too busy to deal with it and we get a 3 dollar credit. The dish was around 8 dollars and the reason to get chow mein is the noodles. After spending time on the phone the lady said the noodles aren't even that good and "customer don't like" why are they on your menu then?  The way they deal with customers is horrible save your coin.
