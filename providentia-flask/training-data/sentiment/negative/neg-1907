This is place has gone from barely tolerable to downright sucks. Been meaning to write about our last visit there. A friend and i decided to go for lunch. The bar waitress suggested the meat loaf with cheddar sandwich special so we went for it.  The sandwich came out (with the wrong fries) and it was about an inch thick and the cheese looked like it was spread on not a nice slide of fresh cheddar.

The meat loaf was so so with no flavor and we ask about if they had meat loaf on the menu. She said this was from last night's meat loaf special dinner. OK.. now we know that our meat loaf is a day old and then when the bill came THE REAL SURPRISE. $13 for a thin poorly made meat loaf sandwich.  Our bill was over $28 for a couple of bad sandwiches and ice tea. 

I hate not having good food when i go out but when you go somewhere other than fast food and you pay through the nose, you expect some sort of quality. This can NOT be a place we'll ever go back.

We just heard this week that the place is going to go German and start selling that food. Maybe Germans have less taste requirements than we do but if they don't do it any better than the meat loaf... watch for the new VACANCY sign that'll be out when the owners run out of savings.

We're running out of places to eat here in Cave Creek but better to not eat at all than to come here.

PS - There is a Dairy Queen down the street just in case.
