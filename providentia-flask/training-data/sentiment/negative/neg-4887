Ohhh my god, This place is horrible.  If you eat here, you will smell like grease and smoke.  The food is all packaged and they microwave eggs for the love of god!!! 

The owners are very cheap and the portions are very small.  I hope this place is replaced by a Subway.. It will still be horrible but at least it wont cost as much.

So this place was I think changed hands in 08 and that is the reason why its bad.  The old owners were so much better.
