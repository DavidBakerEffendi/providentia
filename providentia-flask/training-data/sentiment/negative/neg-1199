I hate to say it, but this was the worst Pho I have ever had. The broth was horrible and the meat was in ridiculously tiny pieces. We actually had to ask them if they forgot to put it in! I would not recommend it if you want Pho. We didn't try anything else on the menu so I can't comment on their other food options.
