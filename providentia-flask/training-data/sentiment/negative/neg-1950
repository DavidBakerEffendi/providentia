I had some hope for this place. Their menu online looked decent, and there have been some decent reviews.

My friends and I scoured the menu before coming, since people have mentioned it takes up to 30 minutes to cook the darned things. Upon arriving, we learned that they had changed their menu, and jacked the prices up by $1-2 per burger. We had to spend more time looking at the menu since they removed 12 burgers from the menu they have on their website, and added 12 new ones. Ugh..

I also read they had a lot of beers on tap. When we got there, I found they only had 6. A lot of their other taps were emptied. 

Menu changes, reduced beers on tap, jacked up prices.. are all signs that point to a struggling restaurant to me. And I can see why..

I tried the Gringo burger, and it was nothing fancy at all. A regular patty with a dollop of sour cream and store bought guac on it... the patty was a bit dry. 

They had a coin operated pool table and dart board upstairs. Great right? Well, it would be if the pool table wasn't missing a ball (which we found out AFTER we paid $1.50 for it) and if the cues actually had tips on them. And if the place actually owned some darts!!! We asked the bartender for darts and he told us they didn't have any. What, did you have to hock off the darts to keep this place afloat?

Save your time and money.
