Really disappointed with this location and customer service. 
The skinny 
After a long day at work my gf decided they were going to have sushi for an early dinner and as a non sushi eater they asked what I would like to eat I naturally I selected one of my fav go to spots and finding out they had a closer location was a plus. The hot dogs were ok beans tasted old and was not very warm the cheese tasted like they may use a cheaper cheese than 83rd ave location. The chips they use to top hot dogs tasted stale. 
The bad 
As soon as you walk in to location u get a foul smell as if they use dirty smelly rags to clean table my gf and daughter couldn't take the smell and waited outside. When I walked in I also was not acknowledged I take it as they thought I was looking at menu but really they should have asked or greeted me and I could have ordered quicker but she decided to take 2 drive through orders before coming to me. The hot dogs were not good and I didn't have my usually great experience I will not come back to this location and travel further out to 83rd ave to get better service and better food.
