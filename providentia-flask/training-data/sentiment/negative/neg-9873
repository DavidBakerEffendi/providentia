I went here because of all the good reviews I seen on here, not sure what all the hype is about. The owner should be ashamed for having a "barbecue dish" named after my hometown of Austin. It is NO WHERE like Austin, not even a little bit. I would recommend taking a trip out there to Terry Black's Barbeque for the real taste of smoked barbecue. If you're "known" for smokin meats, you will surely smell it miles away! The brisket was definitely not fresh, it was warmed back up and not even luke warm, no smokiness, no signs of a smoke ring, it was like eating a extremely bland roast. Don't even get me started on the ribs, they were warmed up as well. They should also drug test their servers or find people that aren't higher than a kite! Our server was extremely high(not that I have a thing against weed smokers) but him acting like an idiot out of space saying the most off the wall things, starring at the wall behind us for a while, with his bloodshot red eyes is a bit much. Really tall white slim guy. For the price I paid of $50, I seriously would have rather gone to Chick-fil-A and had a better meal and service for 1/5th of the price. Obviously, stick with the seafood here. Don't call your self a Texan, if you can't even get a brisket right!
