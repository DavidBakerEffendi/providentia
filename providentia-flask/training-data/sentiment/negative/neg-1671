Went there on a Friday night at around 7h30pm. The man told us that we would've been better if we had a reservation.but then told us it would be about 5 to 10 min.?! So why would we need a reservation? 
First thing I noticed is that this place is lit up as bright as a grocery store,  terrible for lovers.
Then they sit us in between 2 tables (first 3 tables on the right) where there is no way of getting out of without bothering a person to get up and out of their chair!? 
Wow, what is this place?
They have nice booths all along the left side of the restaurant, but you probably need a reservation or luck to get one.
The place is badly lit, bad seating arrangements,  absolutely no ambiance, packed with people and quite loud...but hey, what about the food?

Well ok. Here is my humble opinion.

We came here because there were very good reviews on TripAdvisor and Yelp, so we thought hey, let's try it!
We are not familiar with the specific regional cooking specialties, so we went with what we know and love.

So we ordered rice and cheese with peas in a sauce which was brought to our table at least 7 minutes before they finally brought the rest, butter chicken and a fresh out of the plastic bag STORE BOUGHT NAAN BREAD!!

Why the wait?

The butter chicken (that tasted like no other butter chicken I've ever tasted (spicy)) had a thin crust on top meaning that it was ready and (probably) waiting at the station for 7 minutes for the STORE BOUGHT NAAN BREAD to be taken out of it's plastic bag and put in a basket.

All in all a VERY BAD FIRST EXPERIENCE. 
The kind that makes me think of Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares tv show.

P.s. If you guys can't make your own naan bread, than    get it off the menu and don't try and sell us store bought crap. You are not a depaneur.
