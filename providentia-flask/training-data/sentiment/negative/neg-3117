My boyfriend and I came here for dinner, $36.95/person, a TOTAL RIPOFF. 

Most of the meat in the carving stations were incredibly dry. The ostrich meat had a great taste to it but all the other meats we tried (kobe top sirloin, pork short ribs) were just dry. 

Asian food here should not be touched, the sushi rolls and nigris were incredibly gross, they resembled the sushi you'd get in supermarket packages. Fried rice tasted very americanized. 

Waitress was very nice and service was overall excelllent. Everytime I came back to the table, my plates were cleared and my drink refilled. 

Dessert: So many choices! Tiramisu, chocolate covered strawberries, key lime pie, ice cream, chocolate cake. It was definitely the biggest selection I've seen at a buffet. 

I think they should stick to american items because dishes like pasta were great but when it came to say paella (it was mushy = BAD). 

I've heard this buffet was better for breakfast/lunch so I"ll probably come back to give the breakfast and lunch buffet a shot. Till then this place deserves a one star for the excellent service and the dessert selection.
