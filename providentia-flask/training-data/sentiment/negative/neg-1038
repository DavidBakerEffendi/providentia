How is this joint still in business? I don't get it. Out of the whole, "I'm going to try something new" I ventured in here some weeks ago and am now dead-set against setting my foot in any place ending in "Bowl."

I asked for the spicy teriyaki chicken special. What I got was dark meat chicken in catfood-sized bits smothered in lazy overly sweet goop on top of a gelatinous heap of rice. Spicy? Maybe for Grandma Ethel.

The place was depressing to eat at. I looked across 20th Street, and there was Trader Joe's laughing at me. Hell, even Arby's was laughing at me.

Not a good sign and a sad day for Japanese food.
