Terrible food and service. I wished I had read the reviews before walking in here but we were desperate. They got our order wrong and the female manager charged us 15% tip on the bill. To charge us 15% on one order is unethical. Plus I saw a customer waiting to get seated for a long time and finally left when he received no service. I should've followed his lead.
