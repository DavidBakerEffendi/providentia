If we could give this joint a ZERO, we would!

The line to place your order was not busy.
It was our group behind 2 customers.
The girl who was taking their order was slow.
They're so busy socialising with 2 customers... we had to wait 10 minutes.
It turned out they were friends.

We like the food.
Too bad customers who aren't the employee's friends are not important enough to provide prompt service.
