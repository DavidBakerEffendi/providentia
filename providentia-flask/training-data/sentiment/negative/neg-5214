This place is a mess! When I checked in I noticed the manager of the hotel sitting on her phone down as if she was on break, as soon as I walked in she jumped up and ran behind the counter to assist me mind you I arrived 10 minutes after check-in time which was 4 p.m. Once I checked in the first thing I did was to check out the rooms. Knowing that I have read so many bad Yelp reviews I couldn't wait to see what people were talking about. 

My first thoughts upon walking into the room was that it was one step up from a nasty roach motel. It smelled like smoke there was dust on every counter in the room, they needed new paint on the walls, the carpet needed to be steam cleaned, and the tub was dirty. I had to ask the manager to have someone come up and clean the tub and wipe off all the counters before I even sat down. After checking in I started noticing even more things. The room was so dirty I didn't even want my three-year-old son to even sit on the floor that's how gross it was. After being in the room for about 10 minutes I decided that I could not have my little one sleep in this room. There were a few safety issues, the room smell like smoke, it was dirty, the pool and jacuzzi were close, and the bar  was closed as well . This did not feel like Vegas.

 I tried to get a refund and they told me that I couldn't. Yes, at this point I was willing to lose my hundred and $150 payment because it was that nasty. I would always see this hotel across from the Hard Rock, it looked really nice from the outside. Kind of reminded you of hotel that you would see in Beverly Hills, but after seeing what I saw I would never stay here again. They should honestly shut this hotel down until they have enough staff to run it and focus on renovating the building instead of trying to make money. Save your money and stay somewhere else.
