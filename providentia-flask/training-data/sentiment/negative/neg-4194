Tonight was a really uncomfortable evening.  We only go out to eat a few times a month with our family of 8.  When we walked up to the Texas Roadhouse there was a lot of people outside, then when we went inside we realized why.  It had to have been south of 65 degrees in the front.  Both of the hostesses where wheeling jackets and the waiting area was completely empty.  We complained that it was an icebox, but nothing was done.  By the time we left my daughters lips were blue and her nose was running(so was mine).  I spent the entire dinner switch from kid to kid trying to keep them warm.  I asked about it several times, but again nothing was done.  When the waitress ask if we wanted desert, I just handed her my card and said we would like to leave ASAP!  The rare steak (when we ordered medium well) and the order being incorrect where tolerable,  but the temperature of frosty the steakhouse was incredibly unbearable.  What a ridiculous and miserable experience!  We won't be going back.
