This might be one of the worst food experiences I have had in a long time. I was with 2 other friends and we all ordered something different. I got the wings, a friend got a burger and the other guy got the chicken sandwich. The wings were cold, tasted horrible and had very little meat on them. My friends burger was over done, and the chicken sandwich was raw. When we spoke with a manager, they were no help. They asked if we wanted new food, but since we had to catch a movie we didn't want to wait. I will never want to go back after that food experience, and neither will my friends...
