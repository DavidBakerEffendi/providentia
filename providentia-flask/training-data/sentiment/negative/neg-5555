I went there again had the Margarita pizza. 

It was soggy, and tasted like a wet foot. The sauce wasn't good and the grated Parmesan tasted like cheap kraft in the green can. 

They say the house make the mozzarella, that confuses me because it is super oily?

If you use quality mozzarella its not like that. You use whole milk.

So this is one of the worst pizzas ever. I'm sticking to Grimaldis, better pizza, better salad.
