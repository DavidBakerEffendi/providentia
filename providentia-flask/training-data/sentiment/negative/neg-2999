1st try we sat in parking lot with lights on for 15 minutes.  No service, no one even looked our way.  The only people waited on were the ones under the canopy.  No signs anywhere that they only have service under awning.  Swenson's services their whole lot!

2nd visit I got a spot under the canopy.  Waitress came to car and wanted me to order.  No menu boards, no menu, I ordered 2 dogs and Onion Rings.  Ordered 1 all beef and 1 natural with the same topping and an order of onion rings to go.  Both dogs barely warm and 1 had the correct toppings, the other one had I don't know what on it, some sort of hot relish maybe?  Onions rings were the greasiest I've ever had!  Great concept that failed to deliver!!
