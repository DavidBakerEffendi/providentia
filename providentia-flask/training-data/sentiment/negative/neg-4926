Order anything but the shaved ice. Mango and strawberry flavours are the worst. 

We ordered the matcha shaved ice. But only it didn't come with condensed milk as it was supposed to so I tasted only ice - I was paying $10 for ice, and the ice was quite chunky as well. We asked for more milk and flavour but was asked it would be charged extra :( 

Another customer sitting beside us ordered the mango shaved ice and was faced with the same problem, and the manager never showed up to resolve the complaint.
