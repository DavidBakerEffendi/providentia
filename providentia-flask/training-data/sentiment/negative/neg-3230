Our family members attended this restaurant last night to celebrate several birthdays.  Haven't concluded yet the next morning what was worst, the food or the service.  Evening started out with an approximate wait of 30 minutes to receive my ordered cocktail.  Also of note, out of several of the featured on tap draft beers.  Waitress seemed to not have a clue.  Several times, some in our party came close to getting up to talk with a manager.  Entrees finally arrived with a mixed bag of results.  Walleye was noted as being very good while the Faroe Island Salmon entree was bland and tasteless.  Don't they have spices in the kitchen?  Granted this is a newer restaurant but it has been open now for almost 3 months.  Bottom line, save your self some $$$ and frustration and have dinner elsewhere until this place gets their collective act together and determines if they want to be a place for the bar crowd or a fine dining establishment.  Right now they succeed at neither.
