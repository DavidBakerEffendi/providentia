So we decided to try somewhere new and lets just say I just have stuck with the bad reviews... it was disgusting the chicken was barely chewable even my lkids didnt like what they ate.. the crab puffs had like a pinch of stuff in the middle there was hardly anything in there we ordered the seseme chicken which may have been the best of the 3 things, then we ordered  the sweet and sour which was horrible and my poor husbands teryaki chicken was a runny disgusting mess.. we will not order from here again..
