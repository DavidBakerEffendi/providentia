Worst experience of my life. The girl working was SO SLOW. I don't mean like she was busy, so that caused her to be slow, it was like she didn't know what she was doing. She made my coffee with the wrong milk so I had to point that out and then she didn't know what milk I had asked for, seriously?! I was the only person who ordered a coffee to go. And WORST OF ALL she made my wrap with NO GLOVES AFTER SHE TOOK SOMEONE ELSES PAYMENT. I am literally disgusted and will never go back!
