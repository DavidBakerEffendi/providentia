Since my last review - Fast forward 7 years - again, I'm sitting at Cravings with the crew. We were tired and didn't want to walk more than a few steps and so this is where we ended up. Learn from mistakes much? No, eh. 

This place is even worse than before. Now they have coffee machines and soda machines like a cafeteria. We went during breakfast so it was just the breakfast spread. Like the cardboard thick dense waffle, typical bacon, blah.

The good thing was the omelette station - but EVERY buffet pretty much has an omelette station. Also they had a pan of egg whites. I had a very egg-heavy breakfast. My friend said there was free alcohol. I didn't think so, but even if there were, I didn't want it in the morning.

The server gave us napkins and took away our dishes like she was doing us a favor. 

Like catching a 2nd movie in a theatre, we could have theoretically stayed into the lunch service since they started to bring out the other foods while we still sat there. But no-thank-you. I would rather not eat than eat more at this buffet.
