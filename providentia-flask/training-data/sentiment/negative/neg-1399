Pretty average at best.  I'm a HUGE fan of Italian beef and this is probably the worst I've had.  It wasn't spoiled, or rotten or anything to be disgusted about but it just wasn't good.  The fries were great, the Chicago dogs were average, no better than gas station food.  For the price, drive to Portillo's, you WON'T regret it.
