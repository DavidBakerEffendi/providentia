I LOVED the Patron location in Wexford, however it's a haul from the city, so I haven't been there in a long while. I was super excited when I saw they were opening up in East Liberty. 

However, I was super disappointed when I visited this time. This place used to have the best homemade margarita's & guacamole around Pittsburgh. Not the case anymore! The margarita I got tasted like it came from a grocery store bottle. The guacamole was definitely not the chunky, homemade stuff that I have had before at this restaurant. It was smooth and blended up, like the stuff you get out of the grocery store premade packages. It didn't even have any cilantro in it. I think I'VE MADE BETTER guacamole than this! The chips seemed like they came from a bag too. I was so disappointed.

I got my usual menu item, the shrimp chimichanga, it was not as much of a disaster as the rest of the food and drinks where, however I could take it or leave it. My friends & I will unfortunately will not be back! What happened to this place????
