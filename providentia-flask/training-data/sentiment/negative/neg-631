here's an update... I went in again October 7, 2017 with a coupon from the webpage for this particular store and they refused to honor it. The manager said that they do not honor the coupons on their website. I have called the corporate offices to try to see why they won't honor their own coupons and no calls back. They just don't care about customer service I guess. I wouldn't bother going to popeyes as they put out coupons, but don't allow you to use them. So strange. Subway is right next door, Pizza hut, Roberto's and china wan wan are all in the same parking lot along with Omelet House and they at least have Louisiana catfish on the menu. But what good is it to go to popeyes  with a coupon for them to say they won't honor it and too bad for those that have printed it out. Just not good business.
