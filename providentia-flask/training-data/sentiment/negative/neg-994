This place is EXTREMELY overpriced. I got Sierra Mist and it came in this tiny short cup which I thought was cute until I saw they charged me 4 dollars for it!! 
For food I ordered the spicy shrimp. The price was $21.00 which I thought was a lot but I imagined the plate would be huge and it would be delicious. Even if something is expensive, if its delicious then it's okay. When they brought out my plate I almost thought it was a joke. Or that it was a sample of something try we're giving out. The portion of food I got was so tiny. There was also nothing spicy about the dish at all. That's the reason I ordered it. I love spicy food. When I got close to the bottom of the plate there was like a pool of water and everything tasted super watery then. 
This was a giant waste of money. 
My friend got a hamburger and she said it was good but a normal looking hamburger for 18 dollars?! I rather go to McDonald's. 
we also went to the candy shop they have and my friend ordered some ice cream in a small cup. 
I honestly thought their "large" cup was the "small" because it was small. When I saw my friend get her ice cream I thought it was a sample but that was her ice cream! It was super tiny. Oh and it was 5 bucks. 
Never coming here again.
