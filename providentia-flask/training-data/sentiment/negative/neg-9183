How could I have forgotten my forgettable experience at Fresh Attractions the last time I was stressing through CLT? And thus, confirmation: the food here sucks.

Sure, the Jalapeño Chicken panino sounds appealing. One bite in, and I called shenanigans on the "grilled" poultry (brown lines looked drawn on), nearly raw bacon fat with the titillating essence of fake jalapeño spice, and a puddle of gross honey mustard on bread pressed in a lukewarm griddle. Great, now it just feels stale. How much does instant regret cost? $9.50? Sounds about right.

Did I mention the lettuce felt like paper in my mouth? I'm sorry; that sounds insensitive - I actually know a few people who eat paper, and they're fine folks. They'd never touch this sandwich.

Never again.
