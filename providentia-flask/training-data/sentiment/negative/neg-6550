Food poisoning!! We were a big group of people and my best friend's husband and I both ordered Bally's! The following day at 6 am, I woke up with severe stomach cramps, and vomiting, fever and diarrhea that lasted for 2 days! The same happened to my best friend's husband...we were the only ones who had Bally's at this place and that was the only thing that both of us ate alone without the group. Please make sure you store your alcohol correctly! My vacation got absolutely ruined! I am visiting from California for 5 days only and I lost several days because of this incident...I am writing this review while in bed.
