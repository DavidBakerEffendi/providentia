This is a review of the time we didn't get in. 

We wanted to check it out a couple of weeks ago but were saddened to learn that the whole bar was closed for a private event.  They even had a little sign drawn that said 'closed for Jay-Z'.  The bouncer was friendly enough but I couldn't sweet talk my way in.  

Nevertheless, I'm posting this review to find out if JAY-Z was really there (this was during NXNE).  I'm guessing no but then who was there?!
