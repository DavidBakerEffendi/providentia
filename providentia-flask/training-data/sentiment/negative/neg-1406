Does anybody know what fries taste like?!  This place sucked ASS!!!  Before I go on, I like Weinershnietzel, Hot dog on a Stick and damn Costco dogs...I'm not a picky eater.  But this hot dog place SUCKED ASS!!! I can't express this enough.

I ordered a chili cheese dog, w/ cheese fries and bacon.  I got a plain hot dog, a bacon hot dog, w/ cheese fries... ?? okay.  That's fine, it was probably a long night for them; the lady in front of us sweared she handed them a $20, and the cashier gave her  $1 in change, who knows the customer seemed shady herself...ANYWAYS....they corrected my order and now we're good again...

It tasted like they cooked the fries in a month old oil for 14 hours; the fries we're horrible!!  Let me remind you I'm not picky, it was just that bad!  The hot dog, the runny cheese even the bacon!  I thought I could just pick off the bacon but that too was apparently fried in the same vat. So much for a quick bite to eat.  I've never been able to make myself throw up, and that day I WISHED I was bulimic. Gross.
