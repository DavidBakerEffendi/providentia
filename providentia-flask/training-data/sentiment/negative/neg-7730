Absolutely the worst place for a "kid to be a kid." Half the machines didn't work. I mean literally every other machine was out of order. The ticket-munching machines also either stopped counting tickets and jipped you of entire strings of tickets or said "print" but never released a ticket receipt. The pizza was fine; same nostalgic, garbage pizza they've had since I was little. The ticket payouts per $.25 play of a game is about $.02 worth. The prizes? Let's just say one of the higher-ticket in-case items was a plastic ant. Absolutely will never return. So focused on turning a profit that all the games have been replaced with garbage low-payouts for prizes of equal garbage value. Screw you Chuck.
