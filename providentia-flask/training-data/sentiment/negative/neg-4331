I'm done with this place! If you're going here for happy hour, pay VERY close attention to how many drinks you have vs how many they charge you for. This is the THIRD and last time I will ever step foot in here! My co workers go here quite often and I have met them now three times. The first time, my friend and I combined out tabs and were charged for 13 vodkas when we knew damn well we didn't have that many, but we paid and went on our way. Second time, same thing. Friday, we went again and counted our drinks. We each had 3! Hold many were we charged for???? 10!!! Of course we said something and the waitress knew she was busted! I won't be back! Not a good look at all Sierra Gold! You lost a crowd of business from us! None of us will ever be back. The only reason I gave you one star was because I had to! Keep ripping people off!
