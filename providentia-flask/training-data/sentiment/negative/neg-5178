Don't waste your time: Try Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Hannys, Z Pizza or even Oreganos. All gourmet pizza with local fare and local products and I've never had an experience like:

I had lunch CPK this afternoon and had a less than desirable experience and I wanted to share it with you. Long-story-short, we ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza without cilantro. The pizza arrived with cilantro. I had one bite after my partner had one piece. After the bite, I notified the server that there was cilantro. He was very accommodating, said that he requested it without cilantro and then hastily rectified the situation by ordering a different pizza. 

While we were awaiting the second pizza, the manager arrived at our table to address the situation. He did not offer his name, but immediately apologized for the inconvenience which we appreciated. He, however, continued with informing us that there was no cilantro on the pizza. Then asked us, "Did you not want scallions on there, because it was scallions on the pizza, not cilantro." I informed him that I tasted and saw cilantro, which I had pointed out to the server. He replied with, "No, they did not put any cilantro on the pizza!" To which I replied, "Well I don't know...I didn't put cilantro on the pizza." To which he replied, "Well, the new pizza will be here shortly," as he walked away.

I have a few serious issues with this managerial approach. First, it is unprofessional to insinuate that any guest is lying. Second, I find it insulting that he would go on to insinuate that we don't know the difference between scallions and an herb we specifically requested be omitted. Finally, I believe arguing with the guest should be strictly avoided. 

Man, what a twat!
