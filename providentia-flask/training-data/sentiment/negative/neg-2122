Today, I had seriously the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. I have a feeling that the manager was not in.

All five of the employees that I saw were under 18 (which, as a 21 year old, is not entirely an ageist comment). Even though there were only five customers in the store, it took nearly 20 minutes to prepare all five orders, after they were already taken. The cashier also had a lot of trouble counting money--her goal was to give me back $7.02 in change, but took the $5 out, said "Oh shit," out loud, thought for a second, and then I reminded her that I need $2.02 more.

All five orders had exactly one item missing from their trays, and all of them were things that the cashier was responsible for. She forgot my chips for my taco salad, the cheese for two other customers, an incorrect drink for another. My drink wound up having zero carbonation.

I finally made my way to the condiment counter, which had ketchup smeared all over it, including on the stack of ketchup cups. There were literally zero napkins, so I had to go ask for some from behind the counter.

Many of the tables had a stray napkin or straw wrapper. While eating at one of them, one of the employees was in the dining room, yelling towards the counter (from about 20 feet away), "Can you please tell Gary to fucking change these garbage cans?" about five times. The cashier responded that she doesn't want to "yell" at Gary again.

As I cleaned my tray, I discovered the reason the garbage cans so desperately needed changed--I tried all three in the restaurant, but all of them were so full that I could barely open up the swing door on them, let alone put anything inside. I finally settled for putting my full tray on top of the entire garbage receptacle, for I had no other option.

None of this is exaggeration. I was seriously appalled.
