So, this is probably my fifth time trying this location (I've been hoping that it was poor because it was new and there were growing pains). Let's face it...tropical smoothie is a chain and should easily be a 5-star. This one gets 3 (if I'd reviewed it after my first couple experiences it would have got a 1-star...so there's improvement, but not a whole lot). 
Service was fast and the lady working was polite and professional. (Last time they left me in the restaurant while they both went in front of the store for a smoke break)
Smoothie was decent! Not quite right though...these should all taste the same from location to location...it's not a mystery drink.
Sandwich...meh. Ratio of chicken was decent (not just lettuce), but the lettuce was very brown and the apples were a little off too.
If I'm over here again I might come back...but I usually go to the location on Eastern because I know it'll be good there. There's still room for improvement here!

**update**
I almost didn't make it home before I was sick...
I will NOT be going back...5th time was not a charm
