I always liked this place, but this time, the pick-up experience was TERRIBLE. I was made to wait for another 20 mins when I arrived 25 mins after I placed the order on phone. 

If you do to-go orders, you should place my order in the list as soon as I made the order on phone, but not make it look like the order was never placed until I am already there for it.

Plus, NO dressing for salad, and NO utensils were given. How amazing:)
