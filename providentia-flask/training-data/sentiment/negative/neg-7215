Went to this Chilis on Saturday at 8. Only had to wait 5 minutes. Which was the only good part of the time there. I ordered the queso dip with a side of ranch. 10 minutes later the chips arrived but no queso or ranch. Instead there was salsa. The sever said the queso would be out shortly. I reminded her of the ranch. She so oops I forgot it, let me go grab it for you. Another 15 minutes goes by and finally the queso comes out. Again I ask for some ranch.... 5 minutes later it finally comes. During this whole time I am with out a drink. I ended up having a different server get me a drink. Now when the entrees come out mine is literally dropped right infront of me hard enough that it CRACKED THE PLATE!!! The plate itself was greasy and you could see it was wiped with a dirty towel. After this I was not happy. I asked to speak with a manager... No manager ever came. "They were busy in the kitchen" we were told. After this experience I will not go back to this Chilis... horrible service and sub par food.
