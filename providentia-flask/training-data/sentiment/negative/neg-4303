After doing my research and planning out our vacation Peppermill was on our list. We were excited to try the restaurant whom stood the rest of time with the assumption the food was excellent. We were severely disappointed with the food, service and drinks. The Mai Tai tasted like rotten juice. The steak salad was mediocre at best. The brotato appetizer was so bland if I put anymore salt and pepper on it I was certainly headed to the ER. They were willing to replace the brotatoes buy served me a dish equally disgusting. Canned refried beans with what a assume was cheese whiz on top. SMH!! Then refused to take it off the bill stating they were not "Texas Style Nachos" (we are from Austin). Horrible Experience. The only positive was a homeless man ate FOOD, not tasty Food but it's a meal. Don't waste your time or money.. Super disappointed at the quality of food and lack of customer service with management!!!!
