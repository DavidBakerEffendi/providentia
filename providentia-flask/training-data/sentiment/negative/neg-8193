I didn't even look for reviews of Wendy's.  I mean who would need to review a fast food joint.   Well next time I will.  One star is way too much for this place.  And it is averaging one star.  My visit happened on June 27,2018 at 6 pm at night. And I went in for my food. I did not use the drive through. 
All I wanted was a salad. But I ended up leaving with a refund and no food.  I went in to this place and it seemed clean and no problems.  Well as I was waiting I happen to notice the lady with short red hair being very unclean.  She had gloves on. Which was awesome except for the following. She touched the headset she had on multiple times to readjust it.  She scratched her side.  She rubbed her nose. She touched the trash can. All while not changing her gloves afterwards.  She took the spoon that was in ketchup and banged the spoon against the trash to get rid of whatever was on the spoon. And put it back in the ketchup.  WTF!!!!  Who does that.  It touched the trash.  Change your gloves.  Toss spoon in sink.  Wash it.  I am completely disgusted by this place. 
The manager on duty had very bad dandruff.  As he was giving me my money back. He bent over to get the money. And the dandruff in his hair was nasty. Wash your hair with head and shoulders dude. 
I'm not happy.  I'm waiting on a response from the gm of the store.  Highly doubtful I'll receive the phone call. But go figure. 
I want everyone on Yelp to stay away from this place.  It is not worthy of your money.   
I don't like to leave reviews like this.  But I'm so upset right now.
