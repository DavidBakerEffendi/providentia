Unfortunately, I cannot review the food.  My review is based on calling to get a reservation.
I called to make a reservation and Brianna answered the phone.  She was extremely rude from the get-go.  She said that she couldn't help me then, but she would be calling me back BEFORE 9 PM.  9 came and went.  I called at 9:15 and she answered the phone again.  Why I didn't just forget about it with the first call is beyond me.  Anyway. if you think she was rude the first time, the second time made the first call look like an angel had answered the first time.  She was even ruder.  I wanted a reservation for 5 PM on the 19th.  Well, her response was that there was no room for us even at that early time.  Thanks to her, this review reflects that call.  I know that no one in our group will never attempt to go again.
