Lets talk about HORRIBLE! 
First time here, recommended by a few clients.

Server: Leona or something like that. The WORST!

In my 20 something years, I have never had such a bad experience. One thing about any type of work, leave your bad attitude at the door. If you don't like your job, find something else to do, don't ruin my day just because yours isn't going well.

-came in, host was nice
-sat down
-L came and poured us water, walked away
-once again, never been here. Would of been nice to explain a bit of the menu
-L two tables away, starts yelling to us asking if we wanted anything to drink. Really? You couldn't wait until you actually approached our table? 
Ordered two bloody Mary's 
-for all the fuss about the bloody Mary's, they actually had no taste, very disappointing 
-L come by again asking if we are ready to order, before I could even say anything, she turns her head and walks away
-about 2/3 minutes later, she comes back and asks what we want
-my friend had a few questions, of course, and L seemed irritated to answer
-I asked about the eggs Benedict. Got two options, later to find out they have about 6 different ones to choose from. And yes, she looked annoyed about that as well
-about 30 minutes into it, our food has yet to come
-I look around and notice 3 tables, who came after us, are already half way through there meals
-I look up trying to find our waitress and see her by the kitchen, she starts walking to her section and notices that we still don't have our food
-runs to the computer and puts our order in
-comes to the table and blames the kitchen for not getting the "prosciutto" right.
- don't ever LIE to your quests, if you were honest, I would of understood, shit happens. But don't tell me 3 orders went in, but ours simply didn't go through the system. Are you fucking kidding me? 
-on top of that, don't blame the kitchen, take fault for your mistakes
-I got up, stopped the order, called for a manager
-took off our drinks, obviously. 
-asked if we wanted the food to go on the house. After the worst service ever, no thanks.
Offered coupons or whatever for next time, no thanks. I didn't complain to get free stuff. Your servers need to be taught better. 

I'm not one to complain, people have their off days. But this one, I can't even put in to words, of how I felt. So un welcomed. 

It's unfortunate, your food has been talked up by many. We didn't get to taste it, and I refuse to ever go back.
