Everything here is fine except there's a major ventilation issue with the fryer.  If they're using it you will smell like it the rest of the day.  I used to go here all the time before they did the refurb.  Since then the ventilation issue has always been there so avoid the place.  If you do go be sure to have some fabreeze handy for after. It's nasty.
