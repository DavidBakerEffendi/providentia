This place is horrible, I do not know why I keep giving them chance after chance. Ordered a gyro wedgie tonight to fulfill my gyro craving because I was too lazy to head out to Olympos Gyros and rather stay in watching football. BIG MISTAKE. 

Their frozen shredded gyro meat actually didn't taste too bad. The amount was minimal though. You couldn't of filled a $4-5 gyro with the amount of meat in this huge $11.99 wedgie. The lettuce on it looked outdated, a lot of brown, and slimy.  

All I picked off and ate was the gyro meat & feta. A good $2.00 worth. Not sure where my other $9.99 went to. I made a New Years Resolution, never to order from this garbage overpriced place again. Come on they put Marzetti ranch dressing in containers so you think they made it. LOL. More classy than the packets they used to give out though.
