I was here for Memorial Day weekend when the buffet prices are higher. First of all, I have paid $50 per person for 6 people and never had such an awful buffet for this price. There wasn't selection for variety of food. The sushi was awful, the steak was awful. Just about everything was bad. I have been to Bellagio buffet many years and I remember it was pretty good. It has become shockingly bad and I am so very unhappy. This place has gone downhill big time.
