10 years ago the food was awesome, tender meats and tasty. Service was great and friendly! Last night steaks were tough and had to chew chew chew, tough as wood!! Service sucked.. and they never even refilled our drinks or water. I told them we had a birthday n they didn't even acknowledge it... poor poor Bob's - nasty food never returning...
