ordered sushi to this Mexican lady from a counter since I didn't get a paper to order. 15 mins later I still didnt get my order. so I ordered to the Korean waitress then she told the same lady, 20 mins later still didn't get my order. This never happened before and I am very disappointed. Sushi is good but I would not recommend to eat in if you don't wanna waste your time.
