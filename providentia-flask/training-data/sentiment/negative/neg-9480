I paid $80 dollars for me and my lady to enjoy one last buffet on the strip. Over all the food was great, presentation was on par. 

The only problem, which is a deal breaker for who ever you are, is that we were sat next to these loud cholas and cholo who were cussing and yelling, that could be heard from across the buffet... Which is reasonably large. Their topic of discussion was wanting to have MORE children with their significant others while they were dealing with cheating spouses and other terribly inappropriate topics. 

Our waiter, Alex, had asked them to keep it down once, but then they started speaking Spanish with Alex and they started joking around. Soon enough, the waiter ignored their rowdiness and my lady and I ended up listening to grotesque details of the unfortunate souls we were sitting next to. 

All in all, the food and price for a place can be the best in town. If the staff has the lack of respect for the consideration of the customer as a whole, then the business shouldn't be rated anything better than a brothel where STD's run a muck. Because quite honestly, that's how I felt after enduring these people's loud, annoying conversation.
