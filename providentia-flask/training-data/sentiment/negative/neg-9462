Food was great but the owner was very rude to her staff and that was off putting from the start.  They forgot my daughters bagel so I had to wait in line, order was screwd up again so I had to wait in line again to have it fixed.  I then waited in line for five minutes just for a refill of water so I don't think we will be coming back.
