Let's be honest, I was probably asking for it when I didn't bother to check Yelp before eating at this place. I got a Garlic Lime Steak Burrito Bowl and it was one of the worst things that I've had in my life. It SEVERELY lacked flavor to the point where everything kind of just tasted like a pile of mush with beans drowning all the odd flavors out. For something that's "gourmet" and more expensive than chipotle I expected it to at least match it... Nope, the portions were small and the food was borderline disgusting. Garlic lime is just a sauce that they drizzle on the food...contrary to what their menu advertises. Do yourself a favor and just go eat at Einstein bros like I should have.
