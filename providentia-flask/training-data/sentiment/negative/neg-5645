Came in at 1pm on Monday  (today). Waited forever to be served. The patio heaters were not on and it was freezing so we asked to be moved inside, took 3 times to ask them and finally they moved us. Waited 45 mins for cold stale fries, gross soup and tater tots. And they were slow! Also had attitude coming off of staff. Disappointed I wasted time here. Also I am watching a lady try to find someone so she can pay. Plenty of slacking staff and not busy...
