Waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes without getting to place my order. Went inside to see wtf was going on. Apparently they were short staffed with 3 people. I can't blame the girls for it although they could have put a sign up or something, they seemed overworked. I completely 100% blame the STORE MANAGER!!! Awful!!  awful!!!  management!!!! FU for wasting my time del taco management, I'm also letting corporate know about my complaint.
