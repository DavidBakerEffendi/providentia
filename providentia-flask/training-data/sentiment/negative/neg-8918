Ok I want to start by saying the food here is excellent! That is not the issue. Also the hostess Michel that sits you is amazing! She is extremely welcoming and friendly! My issue was our server "Travis" I believe....correct me if wrong. Honey Salt please do not advertise "bottomless mimosas" if your servers are going to give you attitude about it! My gf and my self ordered bottomless mimosas for $40 and when we requested our 3rd order of drinks our server which I believe was Travis.....excuse me if wrong....looked at the bartender and rolled his eyes right in front of us as we ordered our drinks! I can not tell you how offended and upset I am! I was beyond disrespected by those actions! Do not advertise "BOTTOMLESS" if your servers show absolute disrespect serving it!!! I hesitate going back based on those actions alone! Food is great, attitude very poor! Change your menu if your servers roll their eyes because I want to drink your bottomless menu! I expect to hear feedback too....thank you and good bye
