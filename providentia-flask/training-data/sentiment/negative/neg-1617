This dive is supposed to be fast food, perfect when you're borderline hangry and need something quick. Not with the staff today. Ordered teriyaki chicken, sweet fire chicken, brown rice and veggies. The veggies and sweet fire chicken were ready and they said it would be a minute. So I got rung up and waited. 15-20 minutes passed as I am watching everyone get served. The veggies had been ready for a while. And I couldn't see the chicken refilled due to the constant line so I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that it wasn't ready yet. Well, li and behold, they're serving up other customers the same items I ordered and took the teriyaki sauce from my container and gave it to another guy. I walked up and asked for a refund. Without saying a word and simply a deer in the headlights look, they tried to scramble to finish my order and I told them making it now doesn't help anything, I need a refund. Then the woman (40-50s, Brunette, hair slicked back in a bun, no hat, wearing all black) who dropped the ball with my order to begin with says she can't do a refund, that it'll take a long time. So the gist is they can't serve ready-to-go food, can't communicate, don't know how to process transactions, and after all of that, still no food. And now I have to waste more of my day to dispute the charge since the staff couldn't be bothered with refunding the transaction. This location is terrible and I hope management helps in getting their act together. This experience was awful and I would not recommend to anyone based on the lack of competence and problem solving.
