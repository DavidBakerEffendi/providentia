My wife booked a reservation for Valentine's Day on the Yelp app, we had a reservation for 7:00 pm. When we arrived the place was half empty. They said we didn't have a reservation, even after we showed them our confirmation they still didn't apologized they just looked at their iPad. I asked them to seat us because the place was half empty they just stared at their iPad. 

I left because they were so bad at showing any remorse or customer service. I wasn't going to spend 100 dollars there. Think twice about reservations especially on a busy night, I doubt they will be honored.

Also my wife posted a review and the owner harassed her. Horrible management.
