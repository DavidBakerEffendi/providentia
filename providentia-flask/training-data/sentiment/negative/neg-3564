Wow waited 18 minutes for them to make decaf coffee. Then they bring out the farmers scramble and it is ice cold!!!! Alondra at the counter doesn't offer to remake it or offer another item. She processes the refund (I think) back to the card no attempts to make it right. Zilch!!!! Few times I was here before the manager seemed engaged and helpful. What happened!!! Wow will never come back and I will be keeping an out on my CC bill to see if this woman at least got that right.
