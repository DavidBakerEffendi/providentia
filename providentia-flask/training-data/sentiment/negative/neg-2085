Wow, what a disappointment Bertha's turned out to be.

First off, they need to take the sign down from their old location, which I went to, and drove around like a chicken with its head cut off looking for the place.

Second, their online menu is not current. I went here because of the tasty-sounding Buffalo Chicken wrap which they no longer have. (The menu picture that someone posted on Yelp is way too tiny to read)

Third, they forgot my fruit salad ($3) which I didn't realize until I had drive all the way home. I called to inform them of their mishap and the woman on the phone was confused as to what they forgot. She kept asking me what I ordered and didn't understand that THEY FORGOT MY FRUIT SALAD. Ugh. Annoyed.

Fourth, my salami was served on a stale ciabatta, It was overloaded with goat cheese on one half and skimped on the other.  The amount of salami was skimpy as well.

Fifth, the sandwiches don't come with chips.  I am a firm believer that all sandwiches should come with a side, and I am grateful to places that include them in the price.

Sixth, the red velvet cupcakes were dry and the frosting was mediocre.  Not cream cheesy at all.

6 mishaps and Bertha's gets one star. 

On a good note, their cookie that came with the sandwich was delicious, as was their passion tea.

Don't waste your time.
