One star because I couldn't even eat there. Walked in alone & there were a half a dozen empty tables. Hostess grabbed menus & said how many ? When I replied one, she said oh I'm sorry we don't have any tables because of reservations. Well you had a table if it was more than one person, didn't you ?  I probably would have eaten & been out without any issue of taking a table needed for another party. But the hostess chose to lose a very probable regular customer. Who would have generally been a party of 2 or 4.  The owner may have super business now, but as is well known in the restaurant industry, repeat clientele will dictate your survival. Declining business is usually a very bad business concept. I ate next door at your competitor, spending $50 plus tip. When I was done you still had 3 empty tables. Good luck with that business model.
