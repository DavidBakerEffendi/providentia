I was at Cibo the other night and to be quite honest it was different from when I went  a few months ago .
The food was wanna be Italain but tastes more I don't know.not italian....italian is easy ingredients and not a lot of them.
The place was empty something must be going on.
What is this number thing on the menu.....oh by the way what style of Pizza was it???I can get this type of dought at italian supermarket..oh and the dessert where to say to least pathetic...
