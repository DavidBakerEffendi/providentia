Just opened and they still need to improve.   Came here on a Sat. late morning and they did not have clam chowder nor garden veggie soup ready.  Decided to get the chicken noodle and came out luke warm.  I'll probably give it another try in a a year or so when they can figure out how do do it right like Paradise.
