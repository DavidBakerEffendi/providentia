So our regular Mexican restaurant is closed for renovation right now this place was just a few miles away so we thought we'd give them a chance. The waiter had no personality, salsa was pretty much ketchup, chimichanga was as good as a chimi from the walmart freezer section, taco shells as good as taco bells shells and michilada was served in a margarita glass not a mug that should have been. Boring food, boring staff.
