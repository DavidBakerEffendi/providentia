Came for restaurant week as we were a fan of this place. Service was bad. Had a full on conversation about Carmel, she forgot I didn't like it, all over dessert. Getting and running the check took forever. We had credit card on table bc we wanted to go. She left it to go get check, then said she'd be back again. Seriously. Not to mention, she avoided us ordering restaurant week, had to ask for menu, and didn't get the said "bonus" for ordering. We just moved back to area and this was in rotation, not sure I'll be back.
