We wanted to bring our family from out of town to this restaurant this afternoon at 3 o'clock.  We were denied the option to dine in because we had a 1 year old and a 4 year old.  I was in shock that they would turn away business in the afternoon!  We were always a fan of the restaurant and wanted to share the experience with our family.  We were turned away without a thought and no apology was given.  We will never be bringing anyone to this restaurant again nor will be dining here.  Absolutely ridiculous.  We  went across the street where we were greeted no problem.
