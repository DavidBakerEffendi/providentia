Upscale Italian ... I don't think so. First off the waiters and kitchen were not very receptive to food allergies.  The flavors were muddled, not too vibrant, and masked with salt and garlic.  The best part of the meal was the fresh mozzarella in the caprese salad, albeit the tomatoes were over ripe.  Because of an allergy I could only eat one entree on the menu, the ripatelli.  For being toted as the best homemade parpadelle pasta, I have to disagree as it was mush, swimming in a pool of evoo, accompanied by average sausage and chopped rabe.  As for the others in my party, they each had the lasagne. Again a good sales pitch. The only reason we didn't send it back for something different was the 60 minute wait and we had a show to see ... yes, 60 minutes from the time of the order until the entree was delivered. Oh, yes the ripatelli was talking back all night long.    Diner beware. This is not worth it!
