Let me be as constructive as possible. 

First the good: I think that they did a great job with their renovations. When Crepes Parisiennes had the spot it was sort of... dingy. The restaurant looks great, with nice stonework and a kind of owl theme going on.

Another nice feature of this restaurant is that it is excellent at not being Pamela's. I've never really gotten the fuss over Pamela's and the lines seem to rival those at the Apple store. I was seated promptly.

Other things done right: service was prompt and friendly, and the coffee was good.

Now to the heart of the review: the food. Between myself and my dining companion we tried three dishes, the "Black and Rose" waffle, "the Ottawa", and the spinach, feta and goat cheese crepe. The spinach crepe was acceptable, but the waffle was bad, and the Ottawa was an affront to my Canadian heritage.

The waffle was topped with chocolate, blackberries, and raspberries. The waffle itself was either stale or had a really dry dough--in my opinion vastly inferior to the waffles at either Waffallonia or either of the Brug(g)e(s).

The Ottawa was a leathery crepe wrapped around unseasoned eggs. It was accompanied by a fruit salad that looked suspiciously canned, and cold bacon that I would have been disappointed to see emerge from my microwave on a paper towel. I left most of my meal which is, frankly, surprising because I am a long time member in the illustrious "Clean Plate Club".

In summary, the food was bad enough that I will not return unless major changes are made.
