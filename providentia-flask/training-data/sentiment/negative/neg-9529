This place doesn't care for it's customers.  We visited for lunch today Aug 24, 2012.  It was a disaster.  Our orders came incorrectly. We didn't get refills until we went to the bar and demanded service. When the orders were corrected (5 min later) they were cold.  The one order (poutine) was corrected by just adding cold gravy and cheese. They didn't make fresh fries so it was cold.  They charged me for the food even though I didn't eat it.  I asked to speak with the owner and he didn't want to speak with me. When I told them I wasn't paying for cold food they said I should have said something.  I did I asked for the owner who can't make time for his customers.  I paid for the bill so that I could leave.  I will never return and I hope I save people from the aggravation we had.  The manager told me every excuse in the book. We are too busy, customers need to be more patient. IT's not her fault they are understaffed.  All true it's the owners fault. He should learn to take responsibility and at least make every effort to make things right.  Poor service and poor food.  Our team will not be returning.  It's too bad, it's there loss as we go out every Friday.
