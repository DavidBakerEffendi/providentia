I'm not writing this review because of one bad experience.  I live less than a mile away.  I have been coming here since they opened and in the past I felt this place was a well deserved 3+ stars.  My how times have changed.  The past 4-5 times I have been here the service has just been awful.  We came with a friend 2 weeks ago and she was appalled at how she was consistently ignored  only because she asked for water to start and then she wasn't followed up on the rest of the night.  The food is decent, the beer prices are high but the service is 0 stars.  On our last and final trip here we came in and sat down waiting 10-15 minutes with no acknowledgement.  I finally got ready to order from the bar when a waitress that had passed us several times comes by and says, this table is taken you will have to move they are outside smoking.  No apology, no nothing....just get up.  The table was empty and there was no indication anyone had been sitting there. I told her we had been sitting there 10-15 minutes waiting to order and she just walked away not caring.  Had this been a one time thing u could understand, but the service is so bad that I will not return.  Too bad this place isn't close to what it used to be.
