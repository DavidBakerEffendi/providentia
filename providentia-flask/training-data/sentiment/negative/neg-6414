I gave this place two chances for lunch and both times they failed.  The first time I went, they had just opened so I tried to give it a bit of a curve.  The pulled pork bbq sandwich was decent at best but my friend had another dish and was not happy at all with it.  When the waitress came by to collect our plates, a good waitress would have noticed that she barely touched her food and would have asked her about it and found a way to make things right especially since they just opened and would want repeat customers.  Our waitress picked up the plates and sashayed away.  When she returned and my friend mentioned that she was not happy with the meal, she all but shrugged her shoulders and handed us the check.

My second time there for lunch I went with three other people.  Since one person in the group was treating for two other people for lunch, my lunch tab was set up separately from them.  I say this because apparently this is what caused the "confusion" about my food arriving long after everyone else's food arrived.   My food literally arrived as everyone else was finishing up their meals and I had to shove mine down my throat so we could all leave at the same time and return to the office.  And again, no offer to rectify the situation (they could have at least offered to pay for my lemonade), handed me the bill and skipped away.

And not to be catty but whoever is doing the hiring for this place clearly is not concerned about having a quality waitress but only about how they look with a low cut top on and abnormal unnatural looking breasts.  Keep your fetish at home and hire some women who know what they're doing and know what true customer service entails.  

At best I could only see myself going there for a drink after work since I work right across the road but if they suddenly disappeared, I don't think too many people would miss that place.
