If it wasn't $13 or whatever then perhaps I'd be more accommodating. But charging an extra $1 on top of that for some squares of seaweed? I think that you will find more authentic ramen restaurants laughing at you. The flavor is okay but it's not very fatty. Trying very hard to be a good fatty broth, but not pulling it off. Noodles are okay. Not inspiring chewiness or texture. My wife's noodles were undercooked. Pork belly was reasonable. Egg was done very well. But still, why do you charge so much damn money? Ramen is not supposed to be artisanal. It's supposed to be cheap, fast and tasty. At least Sujeo has good noodles. But don't even get me started on Umami's watery broth garbage.
