Cashier was helping another individual with his order, then came my turn. As I stepped up to the register, he asked, "what can I get for you?" 

Two seconds into my sentence, he interrupts me and exclaims "CAN I GET A NAME FOR THE ORDER?" He was very loud and even the other customers looked over. 

Gave him my name, but I wasn't so please so I asked him "why are you talking like that" to which he said "a lot of times, people can't hear me!" 

Cashier had a lot of attitude, so I ended up not ordering food in fear of him spitting on or doing something to it.
