Kind of upset. My steak tacos was cold. It came out twice and then I decided to settle for fish tacos (which was something I didn't want). Mind you the waitress told the cooks to not put the pico on the tacos but they still did it the 2nd time. I got full off of bread and my two tequila sunrises because it took them forever to bring out my food all 3 times and then I decided not to get any food. I am extremely upset at this place. The waitress kept apologizing but the manager didn't care. He took the food and took it off my check. I didn't want fish anyways, i wanted hot fish. I came to eat, not sit and wait for cold food. They didn't even come sing happy Birthday to my friend after we said it was her birthday in the beginning. Disappointed! And the floors are slippery. We skated out the exit.
