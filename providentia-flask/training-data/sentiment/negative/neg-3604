theoretically, this place should be amazing.

Wrong. Caveat emptor.

this place serves you coffee while you can play board games. you pay a $5 cover charge and stay for however long you want.

thats the problem. no one ever leaves and whats worse is people are allowed to call in for a table.
if you happen to go there, they will put other people in front of you on the list and it's just annoying.

i went there, told i was first on the list and so should chill out in the basement for a bit. 
i did. an hour and half later, my table was still not called. oh and i recieved my drink half an hour later.

i left.

a total of 3.5 hours later, i was called on the phone to say my table was ready. really....for being first on the list?

my friends have all had similar experiences. The shitty part is the staff are fully aware of whats about to happen to you, but they don't tell you this upfront.

this place would be amazing if only it were bigger....clearly the concept is cool and fun. for now, they just need to work out the kink of managing wait lists and customer service.
