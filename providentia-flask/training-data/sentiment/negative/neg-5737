Absolutely terrible,  especially as a driver bringing in 3 car loads of church youth.  Go to exit 49 instead, not this exit 41.  Ladies bathroom had no functional toilets.  Men's room was wrecked and sticky, with used toilet tissue on the floor and sink. Son said there was a used condom on the one toilet.  Gas station bathroom nearby was locked/secured and also had no toilet paper.  Entire area looked scary, transients wandering in, and hardly a nice word from the staff.  Everyone needs food and a pleasant place to rest, but this entire facility just had a menace about it.

As a grown man who has been on lots of road trips, I can handle some crazy, but I would not take anyone else here, plus I would prefer to spend my money elsewhere.  JHC, that was piss poor.  Skip it, you will be glad you did.  If you are heading I-85 Northbound, continue past to Exit 49 and the Wendy's there.
