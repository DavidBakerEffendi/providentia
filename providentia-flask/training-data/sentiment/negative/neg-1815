This place was so weird!  I had heard good things from friends (and other Yelpers) but I was so disappointed!

My fella and I went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers there (!?).  We were shown to a table by a unfriendly gentleman who did not smile or greet us in any way. 

He returned to take our order, gave us a cold glare to tell us that he disapproved of our choices, and then wandered off to the kitchen.  We could hear him yelling at the cook to "make sure to make my vegetarian lasagna WITHOUT meat in it"... yeah, thanks, I would appreciate that.  Eventually he brought us our food, scowled, and left us alone for the rest of our meal.  What was up with this old man?  Who ran over his puppy?

Also, someone was fiddling with the music in the place, eventually deciding we should all listen to hip-hop.  :|

The food was tasty, but the experience ruined it.  I won't be coming back anytime soon.
