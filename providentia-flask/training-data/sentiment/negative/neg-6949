I went to the original Maple Tree on Spring mountain 2x and had bad experiences both times. Yes they comped the meals (my denver omelette had 2 pieces of steak placed on top of scrambled eggs) but I vowed never to go back. 

But then they opened one down the street inside Lucky's Lounge and I figured with the whole Restaurant Impossible intervention - the 3rd time would be the charm.

It wasn't. It was awful..Food -worse. Service- so so bad. 
And now I'm never going back.
Sorry.
