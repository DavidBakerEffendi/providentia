Before I considered Bellagio Buffet the best buffet in the strip , only last weekend I was so excited standing in line
to experience the best buffet on the strip until I came face to face to reality. I paid $40.00 per person for the worst buffet in Las Vegas. I was so disappointed and I'm 
mad although its a weekday dinner still for $40.00 errr!
I don't recommend Bellagio Buffet guaranteed you will be disappointed!
