So bad! 

Oh man, I came here with a friend on a Thursday night and I am definitely not coming back. 

I'll be the first to admit that sushi in Arizona doesn't really impress me (I'm from California) and this place is added to my list of places to not eat at again. 

The sushi going around on the conveyor belt is warm. I got one plate off the belt, didn't like it, and then ordered directly from one of the chefs hoping that it would be better. 

I got some maguro nigiri (tuna over some rice) and it was really badly cut and did not taste fresh at all. 

I also got some other rolls and pieces of nigiri, and the quality and taste did not impress me. Their Haru Sushi did not taste good and had way too much of the fake crab mix. Almost all of their rolls use that fake crab mix and I hate eating it. I don't know how it first was called a California Roll, but I do my best to never order rolls with it. Give me quality nigiri or sashimi anyday. Sadly, you won't get it. 

Save your money and go across the street to In-n-Out.
