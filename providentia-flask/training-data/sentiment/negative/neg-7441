I ordered online.  I go to pick up my order, the place is empty except the 3 employees.  One is working and the other 2 are standing around.  I tell them I placed an online order.  They look stumped.  The start looking around for an order and find it on the printer.  One of them hop to it and start making my sandwich.  I placed the order online so I could just walk in pick up my order and go. Freaky fast my behind!
