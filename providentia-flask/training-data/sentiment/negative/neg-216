Warning!  Be advised that this once upon a time popular restaurant has seen better days.  Now it's a shabby shadow of its former self. 
The food is NOT good or even OK.  The tortillas are greasy and so thin and tasteless that I was amazed to see my fingers through them.  How can you ruin a tortilla??
My taco crumbled into an oily mess after one bite. 

The beans taste old and starchy. The chicken is boiled to death in water without seasoning.  The cheese enchiladas were cold inside.  And the rice was overlooked. And bland. 
However the salsa was tasty but for some reason served in small wine carafes.  We were told to " pour the salsa on the chips as we ate them". A new idea I guess. 
The server was sweet and friendly yet oblivious to the atrocious quality of the food.  The owner was busy flirting with the help and although willing to exchange our plates for something else we were just anxious to leave as quickly as possible and locate some Tums. 

Additionally parking next to the restaurant was a mistake because the horrific smell of old and putrid grease nearly destroyed our nasal passages. 
It is a shamble of a place - both the structure and the food.  Be aware.   
Just around the corner is a better choice-  the Mission Restaurant!!!  This is a quality establishment-
