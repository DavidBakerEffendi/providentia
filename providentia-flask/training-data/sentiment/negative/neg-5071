The waitress was nice, but we waited forever for mediocre food. There were maybe 12 people in the place, by no means busy, and it took 45 minutes to get our food. After half an hour, our waitress offered us fries and apologized saying the food was "taking longer than normal". Once we got our burgers, we were underwhelmed. My burger was served on a cheap bun and my gal's patty was falling apart. We took our food to go and left. Maybe 10 minutes after we finished our food at home, my girlfriend was sick. Probably caught them on a bad day, but we probably won't be back.
