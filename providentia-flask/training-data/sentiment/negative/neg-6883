Just had food delivered from this location.   Pizza had a little too much of everything on it and toppings slid all to one side which is not the end of the world, accidents happen.   The main problem with the pizza being overloaded was the fact that it didn't really taste too great.   I think it would've been better had it not been drowned with ingredients.  So, we ate a bit and tossed in the trash, no saving this one for lunch the next day.

The only other thing we ordered was a $7.99 cookie.  The damn thing was burned (included picture) which just topped off this annoying restaurant encounter.  I don't trust a restaurant that sends its food to customers looking totally burned.   I mean come on,  have some pride in your work.    

Won't be back.
