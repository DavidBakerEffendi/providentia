I can't begin to tell Yelp how disappointed I am in Fu.  I am staying at the Hard Rock Hotel on business.  My colleague and myself are sitting in our room watching the BCS National Championship game.  We decided we did not want to go far for dinner, so we chose the closest restaurant to our elevator.  We placed our order at the hostess counter, so far so good.  When it is time to pick up our food, I ask the hostess for a couple of plates so that we may enjoy our dinner in the room.  SHE REFUSED TO GIVE US PLATES.  Are you kidding me???  I explained that we are staying at the hotel (we charged dinner to our room).  I even told her that I would bring the plates back when we finished.  She was not having any of it.  I had to call room service to bring me plates.  RIDICULOUS.  We finally got the plates.  I wish they had never come.  The food was bland.  The rice was under cooked.  The Pad Thai had no flavor whatsoever.  It tasted like Panda Express on a BAD Night.  FAIIL.
