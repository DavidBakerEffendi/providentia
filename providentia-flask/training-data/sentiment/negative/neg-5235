Rolled through drive-thru about 4:30am on Sept 1st. Believe guy working window was Mike G. Heavier set middle aged man. Also working the grill was a younger guy believe his name was Josh or Justin on the name tag but cannot recall 100%. I'm sure they are good hard working guys but noticed the younger guy working the grill was wearing gloves and prepping my taquito. Next I watched him reach to his left and pull raw hamburger patties out of a freezer/fridge...BUT he never changed gloves then still handled my food. Pretty sure this is not aligned with best practices according to Health Dept rules and food handling. The older guy seemed incredulous that I ordered coffee. I guess he was mad because he had to brew some? No idea but he just seemed a bit grumpy. I'm sure it sucks working 430am but it's part of the job?? At least try to be clean and handle food properly. You could make someone sick! Also take care of customers and be courteous. I guess it's a lot to ask these days but this is the kind of stuff that gives fast food places a bad reputation.
