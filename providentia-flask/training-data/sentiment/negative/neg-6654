This used to be a good pizza joint.  I am sad to say used to.  Going in we passed what looked like a meth head lady smoking out front.  We seated ourselves.  I mentioned that the Panthers game was not on any of the TV's and the response was "well it was, that's weird."  I ordered a house calzone.  I see they are skimping with plastic silverware but also filling the calzone with about long strips ofa whole yellow onion.  It said there was ricotta but if there was I didn't see any.  So I had a onion calzone.  The calzone was messy, and was served on paper.  Essentially, if you cut your calzone you had to sift through the soggy paper.  The kids had a pizza brought to them by the lady who was smoking in the doorway out front.  We asked specifically if they could change the channel to the Panthers game.  The response was the manager said you have to sit at the bar to watch the game.  No one else was in the dining area but us.  Also, when it was brought to the attention that the paper the calzones were served on was less than ideal the staff finally recognized maybe a plate would be a good idea.  We were almost done and we said forget it.  I can see what effect management can have on a restaurant.  Any issues such as games on TV's were not remedied but answered by essentially that's too bad.  It was Sunday football and I was afraid it would be too crowded.  I see why it was not and I will not go back.  By the way, we have been going here for many years and I would have given t 4 stars then.
