This was one of the worst gourmet Italian restaurants I have ever gone to in Las Vegas! The service was inadequate from the start and got worse as the meal went on. I asked for more bread, but it never came, but the oil and vinegar arrived and I had to ask again for bread and I was at the end of my meal when it finally arrived!  I would absolutely not recommend this restaurant to my family or friends. They were overpriced and the quality of food I received was lacking. STAY AWAY! I would rate it ZERO STARS if Yelp would allow me.
