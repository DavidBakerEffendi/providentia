First I had Chipotle at other places before and I do like them. However, this place had the poster saying they used traditional raise beef (with hormone and other craps). The fact is the steak tasted much worse. 

Secondly I got there at 8 pm. They were out of everything. At other places, if they let you wait because they were short of ingredients, they will give you free drinks. Not here! I notice when they make the white rice, they didn't use the measuring cup. For franchise restaurant, I do expect my food to come out the same every time. How can they not use a measuring cup???!! The ice tea is way more concentrated than the one I had elsewhere.  They also screwed up my burrito and it exploded. 

Very unhappy. I would give this place zero stars if I can.
