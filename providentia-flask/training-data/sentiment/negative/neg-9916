Again I want to reiterate how horrible the TV sound is - both inside and outside the bar. Even when all TVs are on the same thing (i.e., UFC), it's unhearable. They should be doing SO much better with their TVs, service, wings and prices.

A month later and one of the main TVs behind the bar is STILL all green (color is sooooo off/broken). 

A name/logo change (Native New Yorker to Native) will not fix this sorry franchise...
