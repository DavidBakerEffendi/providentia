My first time in this place and I definitely will not be returning. I walked in at 4:35 and sat at the bar. Was never greeted and after 5 minutes I addressed the bartender whose been in front of me the whole time. She responded with, yeah. I ordered and waited 20 and I noticed no one was cooking. I asked about my order, and it was only started after I complained. She responded with; I just put the order in ( as if to say it's not my job) I waited 40 more minutes. I saw my order was done and waited 5 minutes after she rang the bell. I had to request to have my order from the cook directly. The bartender was rude, un applogetic, and pushy. As a first time customer I would not return.

It was apparent the employees were unhappy and overworked. I should not have to take attitude from the whole staff.
