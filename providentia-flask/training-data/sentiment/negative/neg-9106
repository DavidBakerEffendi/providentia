I'm pretty tolerant to bad experiences but Eggsmart took the cake on this one. Service was okay, they were peeling potatoes on the side...okay whatever...I guess I'll yell when I need service...ugh.

I got the eggs Benedict, probably one of the most unappealing eggs Benedict I have ever had. The sauce was lumpy, it had a weird discolouration, and my plate had a pool of water because of the poached eggs, which I didn't think the cook bothered to strain out...I make way better food than this.  

Overall, huge disappointment...and will be avoiding this place.
