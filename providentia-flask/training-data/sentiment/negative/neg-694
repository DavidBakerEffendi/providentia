One of the worst dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas. There are few good food choices at the Rio, it's just not a good place to stay. And Buzios fits right in. 

I ordered the mussels for an appetizer. On top of being smaller than I ever thought a mussel could be, it was prepared in some odd way that just made them tasteless. 

The salmon wasn't bad, but everything else was near inedible. 

On top of this, they hounded me repeatedly about having a "rewards card". I agree that I deserve some sort of reward for enduring the meal, but I had t finally tell them I had no intention of returning again. The waiter then actually agreed with me that the food kinda sucked. 

Overall quite the experience. One I could have done without, and hopefully you won't have to endure.
