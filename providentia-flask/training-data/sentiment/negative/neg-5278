To start with the one star is given only because I couldn't give anything less. I have been to this place twice (second was only out of desperation). The food is not bad I agree, but when it comes to customer service/ courtesy it couldn't get worse. The person who took the order was not interested nor patient. The moment we sat down he was hurrying us for the order, after asking for some time he returned within ten seconds flat and 20 seconds when requesting again for some more time. After all that he started pestering us to pay the bill even before we were half way through our meal. We said we would pay once we are done but he returned saying that he had to close some register. My comment seems harsh but the experience we had, the place deserves every bit.
