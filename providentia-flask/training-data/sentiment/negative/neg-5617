The food is good, but the beer. A bottle of coors light is $6 bucks and although they have cheaper options for domestic beers, but they only have coors light and charge it as a premium beer which is $6 per bottle. Me and my friends went in and ordered 6 bottles of coors light assuming it as a domestic beer, but ended up getting charged for premium beers and paid $40 bucks just for the drinks.
