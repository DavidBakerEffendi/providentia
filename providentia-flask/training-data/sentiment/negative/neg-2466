Ordered country fried steak w over medium eggs and hash browns.   The hash browns are not even cooked they are mostly white not crispy at all.  My eggs are over easy ..gross..the white part is runny. The steak is over cooked and the breading is almost burnt. 

Not good and for almost 10 dollars if rather go to filbertos and get a chorizo burrito.
