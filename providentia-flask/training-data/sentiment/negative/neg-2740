I suggest skipping this place and go to the food court. Restaurant: walked past many dirty tables. Washroom was filthy.
Waited for 20 minutes for the server to arrive. Food took a long time to arrive. 
Food: I had their all day breakfast. Ordered poached eggs and they were cooked properly, but the plate was dirty, toast was cold and the potatoes were soaked in oil. The coffee was fresh and hot, which was the highlight of the meal! 
Had to get up and find someone to get the bill and when it arrived, it was wrong! 
This place has significantly declined over the years. There are much better options.
