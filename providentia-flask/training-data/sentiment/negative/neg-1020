What do you want me to say. It's McDonald's in the hood.  It's dirty outside,  inside,  in the bathrooms and even the tables were gross.  We had to move a few times as almost all of the tables had some sort of food stuck on it.  The cashier had our order wrong and when asked to correct as we received our order, my husband was told "well you should have specified what you wanted sir". Yeah um no!
