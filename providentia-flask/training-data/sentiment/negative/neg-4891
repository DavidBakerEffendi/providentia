Walked in with a group of friends who refused to venture to the neighborhood of the half-decent Korean restaurants. I finally persuaded them to at least check out the menu and pricing before we got seated. 

"SIDE-DISHES (ban-chan) AND RICE ARE AVAILABLE AT AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE" 

I've never walked out of a place so fast.

The nerve.
