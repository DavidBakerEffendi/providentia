Probably one of the more frustrating experiences I've with a restaurant. Long story short: I wanted crab puffs, didn't get crap puffs in delivery, called restaurant, they told me to call grubhub, called grubhub, and the grubhub guy couldn't find my order and failed; so no refund... maybe the staff was off its game, or what not, but all I wanted was crab puffs. So if you try to deliver from this place with your priority being crab puffs - be wary. Aaaaand to top it off, there was a hair in my food. Teaches me one lesson though, don't tip before you get your food.
