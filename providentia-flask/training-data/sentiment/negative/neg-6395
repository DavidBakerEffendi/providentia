Tonight was by far the worst experience I've ever had at Texas Roadhouse. We were sat at a table rather quickly, but it all went downhill from there. It took 20 minutes to get our appetizer and then our meal, well that's a different story. We literally sat for over an hour until our food finally showed up. Then, to top it off, I ordered my ribeye medium and it showed up like it was cut off the cow and seared and thrown on a plate. Now mind you, I usually get my steak medium-rare, but this steak was ice cold in the middle and still bleeding. I actually wondered if it was going to get up and walk off my plate. The ribs however were way overdone, the only reason they fell off the bone is because they were so charred and dry. The service from our server was also way subpar as well. Sadly people that came in after us were seated, ate their food and were out the door before we received our meals. Definitely will not be returning there anytime soon. If I could give them 0 stars I definitely would.
