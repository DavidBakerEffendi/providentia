2nd time trying this location. The first time pizza was cafeteria quality. Now this time two orders of fries were dark brown and chewy. The mushroom burger was charred completely black with chewy cheese and uncharred part of burger again reminded me of cafeteria food. Other burger tasted the same. Salad was warm with melted cheese, tasted gross. Also the chicken was rubbery. Wouldn't pay $3 for this food let alone $7-$8 each. 
After a long hot work day. Very disappointing to spend hard earned money on crappy food. Can't imagine, even if it was cooked properly, tasting like quality food.
