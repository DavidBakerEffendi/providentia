I've been here twice and I won't be returning. The chefs clearly don't know how to properly cut sushi. We received a plate that tasted fishy. I ordered the same dish 3 times and it didn't come until we had already paid for our check and were ready to leave, not to mention the order was incorrect. Had anyone ever came to check on us or ask how we were doing I would have been able to address these issues but the staff was virtually nonexistent for our entire time there.
