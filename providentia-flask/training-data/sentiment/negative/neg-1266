I went for lunch today.  Place wasn't very busy.  Sat at the bar.  Waited for 10 minutes for a server.  Finally somebody came and refilled the water glass of a guy a few seats away.  Then he got into a long conversation with the hostess.  After another 5 minutes I left.  I don't think they cared.  Not going back.  From the lack of people at noon, I think others have come to the same conclusion.
