Messed up order... had to ask for draft beer multiple times before the only person of age remembered to pour rather than ring... fries were limp and greasy... 

hubby's veggie burger ended up being beef... did not check receipt after paying... patties are thin, overcooked, tasteless... smothered in rubbery American cheese... 

the beer was cold... bad when that is the highlight...

nothing like any five guy's I have ever been to... Will not be back... as others suggest... Rail or five guys... or swenson's if you want a veggie burger... Retro Dog if you want a staff that ignores you but more comfortable surroundings.
