Last Saturday evening, me and a friend went here and sat at the bar. It took 10 minutes for the bartender to notice us and there was only three people at the bar. He finally came over to ask us what we wanted then he when back over to the other side and started talking to some girls and washing glasses. We order the beer sample which didn't require those types of glasses. After about another 15 mins (I was timing it) he kept talking to the girls by the wash area. We finally left and as we walked by he said "oh sorry"
