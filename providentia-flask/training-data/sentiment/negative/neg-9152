One word: YUCK. Nasty. Don't do it! My husband and I visit Vegas quite regularly. We have been to numerous buffets and this was by far the WORST we've ever been to. Ever seen National Lampoons Vegas vacation where Uncle Eddie takes Clark to the buffet? Well, this must be the place he took him. All joking aside, the food was old, crusty and unappetizing. Very minimal choices for the price. Don't let the BOGO offer tempt you. Any other option on the strip would be better than this place (McDonalds comes to mind).
