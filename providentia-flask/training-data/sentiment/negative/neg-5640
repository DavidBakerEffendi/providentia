Sadly, reviewers have no clue what good ice cream and gelato is.

I tasted several flavors and the cookie butter was alright (it seems to be the first sample, the gentleman at the counter offers), everything else lacked flavor.

The "chef" and gentlemen at the counter are so super nice, I felt bad and bought a pint of the birthday cake to go (in hopes it would be good as I had yet to taste it). It wasn't one of the flavors they had out that day, so they had to grab some from the back for me, which is why I had to get a pint of it.

Regrettably, it also lacks flavor and believe me... I do not leave ice cream uneaten - I tried to jazz it up with Trader Joe's Fleur de Sel Caramel and some pistachios but lo and behold, it doesn't make up for the gelato not being worth a damn. If I were Steve Jobs, I would say, "this is sh*te!" 

If you really want to know what good is, try Neveaux Artisan Creamery on Melrose in LA or Bonavantura Gelato Lounge in Manhattan Beach on Manhattan Beach Boulevard. These two places alone will change your life. You will have never had it so good.

The cake batter at cold Stone creamery blows this place away, so does Baskin Robbins. I am ALL FOR mom-and-pop shops and much rather would support small business owners, but the product needs to be good.

I don't know who sold their soul to the devil or how they got all these five star reviews, but I just got to keep it real when I waste my time, energy, and money on something less than mediocre, and when reviewers are so off-base.

Again, the people working here are just beautiful humans.

Make a better product and I will come back and update my review.

I promise you, foodies... I will never, ever, ever, steer you wrong.
