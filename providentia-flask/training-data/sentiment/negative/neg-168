Went here on Monday January 2nd.  The food was very good.  The problem is that the person who served our food - an older woman named Adrienne - did so and then promptly went and talked to some friends/family type folks in the waiting area telling them all how she hasnt got over being sick and she still fighting it.

Here we are 3 days after being served by a sick employee and my family is sick.  Thanks - we're all really enjoying this cold.  Thanks Adrienne...how about next time you dont serve people food when you are sick...that has to be a health code violation.
