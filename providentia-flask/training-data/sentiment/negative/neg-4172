Horrible service.   Took 10 mins to even get a host to acknowledge our family.  The once seated the service was very slow. What made it worse was after a mistake was made on one food order it took over 20 mins and it still wasn't corrected.  My entire family ate their dinner and I still didn't have mine.  We eventually decided to leave without getting the meal, without any discount or apology.  Had to even request to have the side I didn't eat removed from the bill

On a positive side - they do have game stations for the kids which really kept them entertained. 

That said we won't be back
