My husband and I stopped here for dinner. We couldn't believe how cheap the prices were, well we ordered two rolls, one for each, chicken fried rice for my husband and spicy teriyaki noodles for me. Needless to say YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, the rolls are tasteless, the chicken fried rice should be call peas fried rice, but the worse part of it all was my teriyaki noodles never came. We asked and all we got was "sorry, it should be coming soon" 25 minutes after the rice come out we decided to leave. No apologies were given. All we got was "you don't have to pay for the noodles" which I thought it was needless to say. I mean they thought they were doing us a favor for not charging us for food we didn't get. Never going back here again. Awful.
