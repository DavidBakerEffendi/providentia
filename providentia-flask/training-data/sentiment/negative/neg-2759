We ordered two appetizers and two side salads on a Sunday when the place was basically empty and we had to pull aside someone (not our server) to ask where our salads were after about 25 minutes. Then received our food, wings were gross dried out little turds and although my friend liked her hummus I thought it was weird and chunky. I was so annoyed by the indifference of the staff here that I would never go back. Drive a few more exits and go to Duckworths, I mean it
