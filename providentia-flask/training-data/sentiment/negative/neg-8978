Walking away VERY UNHAPPY!  We called ahead for lunch, and were told "yes vegetables, rice, fried plantanes and all meat included in lunch price of $17". So we thought great! Showed up, they looked closed. Extremely dark.  Service was nice, but hard to understand their accent. I guess that's where we went wrong. Asked to see a menu, and went with the lunch price rodizio style lunch. 

Went pretty slow, took over hour and a half.  Food was OKAY. Most all the meat was dried out, but had okay flavor. 

Bill came and it was $87!!!!! 
We asked why so much and he said "price is $43 per person". We argued, asked to speak to the lady who told us $17 price and they said "sorry" but wouldn't budge on price.  

We feel super scammed, and ended up spending over double what we were told, for just an "okay" meal.    We wouldn't have paid that price for dinner.  Let alone lunch!!
