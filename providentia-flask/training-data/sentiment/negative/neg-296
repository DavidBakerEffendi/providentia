After ordering a few rolls, and trying to make the best of a bad situation, I finally had enough. The tuna was dark colored smelled/tasted very fishy, the avocado was browning, the sushi rice was too wet, the salmon was mushy, and the cream cheese was curdling. The tuna alone is enough to quite literally make someone sick. This establishment should not be selling food that is obviously expired. This is the fault of the sushi chef for not taking mind to the food. 

I will not be returning here. Even after letting the chef and our waitress know they still charged us. I can feel my stomach rumbling from the disgusting tuna.
