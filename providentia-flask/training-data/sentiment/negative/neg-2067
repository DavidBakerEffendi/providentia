I understand that this is not fast food. So when the clerk says it will be 10-12 minutes when we pay, I'd expect for it to be something comparable. There were two orders in front of me, after all. 30 minutes later... No apology, just hand us our food like that's what to expect the next time. This is acceptable to them? Horrible. 

The burger itself was so good. Perfectly cooked. Onion rings were great!
