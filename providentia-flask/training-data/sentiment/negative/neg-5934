NEVER EVER book an event at Massimo da Milano.  We held my brother's rehearsal dinner there and it was awful.  The food was COLD, not warm, COLD.  The green beans looks days old, the chicken was disgusting and the pasta sauce came out of a can.  I let the planner know ahead of time about previous stories I heard about the food being cold.  She ensured me that would never happen and IT DID.  The other thing that was very upsetting were the sloppy tables.  I asked for the tablecloths to be ironed and they weren't.  It looked like they were in a ball and then thrown on the table. The most alarming part is that the owner didn't seem apologetic about what happened.  He kept calling me "babe" and said "people have been bragging about my food for years."  Those people obviously don't have taste buds.  He offered me a cake to make up for everything.  I have no desire to go back.  Please don't be enticed by the restaurants prices because you get what you pay for.  NEVER AGAIN.
