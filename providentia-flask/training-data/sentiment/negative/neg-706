THIS IS THE GM JAKE LAYTON RIPPING ON HIS OWN FOOD
Yeah I wouldn't recommend chicken at a fast casual establishment if you want prime chicken breast meat. We offer the best turkey I have ever eaten and the chicken is not the quality of the turkey

UPDATE: Jake is not nice. He likes engaging customers via email and trying to defend his chain's crappy food rather than accepting that the customer is right. Jake won't last in that industry long in the age of social media. 

Will start with the good. They hired a new manager (Jake from Utah) and he reached out to me to offer a free meal from a bad meal that I had way back in February. Jake was very nice and anybody who leaves three stars or less on a review will likely get the free meal offer. I ordered the chicken chopped salad and he threw in a free pastry, which is the only reason this place didn't get one star. 

The pecan tart - half covered with chocolate - was excellent, but the salad had major issues. A good portion of the chicken was inedible due to fatty pieces of meat. Some of the chicken was in strips, but there were alot of odd chicken pieces also tossed in there as well. Finally, a salad needs good lettuce, but I couldn't eat 75% of the lettuce served. Most of the lettuce was brown, wet and had a dark, dark green color. Well Jake, you might be the GM, but he needs to improve the food quality, not just offer disgruntled guests another bad meal.
