Really, just not good. Just left The Farm kitchen and was able to sample 4 different kinds of sandwiches. The nice girls at the counter informed us when we were looking at the menu that we could order half and half to try different kinds. I ordered the BBQ pork and the pecan chicken salad- my husband ordered the Italian and the Tuscan. 20 minutes later... Our order still hasn't come up but they were serving the majority of the people that came in after us. I finally went up and asked as I didn't think 2 sandwiches would take that long. The guy calling out the numbers gave me some attitude and said he'd check. Moral of the story- we waited way too long for the sandwiches and when we got them it seemed as though maybe they were sitting for a bit as the bread on the BBQ pork sandwich was completely soaked and Inedible... The pecan chicken salad was a few chunks of chicken sandwiched between a big baguette... And funny enough, sans pecans. Italian was prob the best out of the 4, if I could even say that. I should also mention- 30$ for two sandwiches and two drinks... Overpriced and underwhelming. 

I was also intending to use the groupon I had purchased on this trip but they weren't accepting because a wine festival was going on nearby... So unfortunately I still have that groupon... But won't be running back anytime soon to use it.
