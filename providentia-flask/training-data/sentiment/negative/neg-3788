DO NOT COME TO CANTERS. STAY AWAY!!

this is probably the whackest sandwich i've ever had. look at my reviews, I feel terrible giving out single star ratings and usually add-on a few in a desperate attempt to salvage the review.. but in this case. i'd give it zero if I could.

-$12.75 FOR TURKEY ON RYE TO-GO.
-TWO PIECES OF HARD, STALE BREAD AND A FEW SLICES OF TURKEY. HOME GIRL GOT THE ROAST BEEF AND THERE WASN'T ANY LETTUCE OR TOMATO SLICES, NADA!
-NO MAYONNAISE, MUSTARD, KETCHUP, ANYTHING?

sheeeesh, huge rip off, terrible tasting dry sandwich, long wait, terrible location.. i will never be back.
