I decided to give this place a try during Christmas shopping 2 days before Christmas. While the service and food were decent, the actions of the owner ruined our whole experience. We saw him actually screaming across the restaurant at a patron in front of her baby and small child. Apparently he was kicking her out for a suggestion of all things, a changing table, which any restaurant has.  He had the nerve to ask why she brought kids to a bar. A bar? Far from it! Seeing the way he treated this woman was despicable and abusive to the point of driving her to tears. Warning to every family with small kids/babies, stay away. Not only will you not have anywhere to change your child, but you're subject to yelling as well. Disgusting. Not only will I never step foot near this place, I'm warning everyone in every group on every social media outlet to beware of this ass that clearly is in the wrong line of business.
