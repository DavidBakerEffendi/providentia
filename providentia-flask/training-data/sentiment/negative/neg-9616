Absolutely terrible service, which is a shame because it completely outshines their delicious food. We made a lunch time order and picked it up, but we were disappointed to find 2 employees were missing their lunch. Unfortunately with them being so far away, we were unable to go all the way back inside our lunch hour.  We called later to let them know what had happened. The owner was extremely confrontational, and went as far as calling me back to argue and accuse more. We will never do business with this business again. Not how you treat good customers.
