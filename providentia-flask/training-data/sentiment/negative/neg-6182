Tried this place based on the yelp reviews. Probably the worst sushi I have ever eaten. Just got take away for dinner and ate it despite it not looking too great. Got the spicy California rolls and asparagus tempura rolls. The tempura asparagus was definitely not fresh. Then I noticed there was no crab in the California roll! What the!! Also the rolls were not wrapped tight and were difficult to eat.

My boyfriend picked it up so he called the place up and they told him they ran out of crab and "forgot" to mention it. No discount, no warning even. They said they'd give us a discount on our next order. With this being our first time ordering here, we definitely won't be back. Get your sushi elsewhere!
