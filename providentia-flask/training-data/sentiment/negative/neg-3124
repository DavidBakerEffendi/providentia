Worst restaurant ever!!!!  Made it to the restaurant on time for our reservation and was told they don't allow kids in the restaurant.  They gave some lame excuse about the liquor license but we all know that is BS.  Restaurant  was only 30% full.  Our kid is 7 and was very well behaved so it's not like they were not taking screaming kids or something.  Can't say anything about the food since we never sat down but if you are going to have some silly adults only policy, at least own up to it and make it known on your website or open table so families don't bother wasting their time.
