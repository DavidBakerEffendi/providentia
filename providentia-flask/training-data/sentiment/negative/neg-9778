This is the third time I've reviewed Teharu, and each time I go I feel this place has progressively gotten worse. I imagine that bugs taste better than this place.  The service here is absolutely horrible. My husband and I came in around 2/2:30 today (Sunday) and waited 15-20 minutes while a waiter spoke on the phone before we were seated. Not to mention, no one acknowledged us upon entering, or sitting for a few minutes. The sushi here tastes too sweet, and very rubbery.  I don't like grocery store sushi, but I've had WAY better sushi across the street at AJ's.  

I refuse to dine here.  I'd rather spend $4-6 on a California roll elsewhere.
