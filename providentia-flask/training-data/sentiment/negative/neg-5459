So I have been coming into this coffee shop for a few months.. enjoyed the atmosphere and everyone is nice.  Went in today ordered my coffee and I enjoy just a touch of cream.. I was told the place went all Vegan.  Really,  Almond milk with my coffee.. not sure if they changed their beams also but this was the WORST cup of coffee I have had since I stopped buying coffee at Starbucks..  Sad as I really enjoyed the place butI will NEVER. One back  and will also make sure my friends are updated with the new Vegan change.
