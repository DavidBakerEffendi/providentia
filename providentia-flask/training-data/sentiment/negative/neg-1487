If I could give less then one star I would. Terrible experience at this location yesterday.  Don't ever try to order more then 5 sandwiches at a time they will refuse you and tell you they need a 2 hr notice!  They r SANDWICHES!!! Not gourmet meals
So had to play their stupid little game.  Order 5 and then get back in line for the last 2.  Mind you they weren't busy.   But that's "their policies that went into effect 2 weeks ago".  Wouldn't want to violate that!!! Piss off your customers but keep corporate happy  no common sense of customers service.
So a couple days after I sent an email to corporate office complaining. I get a call from a store manager (I think) apologizing for the experience.  She said they were wrong to refuse me my order AND said there was no such policy---SMACK throw your employees under the bus, and she wanted to know WHO waited on me so she could talk to them..."so sorry, and I assure you it won't happen again".  You darn right it won't because I will Not be returning to your store ever!  No mention of any compensation of any kind, throw me a cookie or bag of chips, make it look like you somewhat care.  I can buy my own cookies and chips but at least the gesture would have been appreciated
