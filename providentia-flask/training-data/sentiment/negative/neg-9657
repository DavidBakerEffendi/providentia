I was simply looking for a tasty wood fired pizza. After looking all over Vegas, this one came highly recommended. The people who eat here have NO IDEA what good pizza is. After walking in, my first thought was, "this does not look good!!" I should have gone with my initial reaction. The service was mediocre but the pizza was bland, to be kind. When you walk into a wood fired pizza place you should be greeted with the fresh aroma of burning wood, baking pizza dough and melting cheese. Not here. It looked like a Pizza Hut and had no aromas of fresh cooking food, let alone wood fired pizza. I ordered the margarita pizza, one I order nearly every time I visit a real pizza joint. What came out was not at all tasty. The tomatoes were cut too thick, making the crust soggy from all the "moisture" not steamed off. The crust, while a meager attempt at a Chicago style deep dish, was very flat. It had very little taste, had no hand tossed texture and zero crispness. The cheese was in sufficient quantity but looked like it was microwaved and tasted as such. The signature melted spots on top of a true "fired oven" pizza were nowhere to be seen. To give fair marks, it did have ample fresh basil, but much of it was older looking leaves with a wilt that should never be served on a true pizza. The second pie, a pepperoni, was just as sad. When we asked for a to-go-box for the last three slices, they were brought out in a clear plastic pastry box, stacked on each other. We figured this was their pizza box, but the table next to us got a traditional box. Apparently when you have only three slices left, you don't get a box. Do yourself a favor and skip this pie shoppe. You'll find better pizza at Dominoes.
