Went on Sunday early afternoon for my mother's birthday since my dad was in the hospital down the street.  Service was ridiculously slow and there weren't more than 20 people in the place. We were a party of three and we saw the waitress a total of four times in the hour it took us to eat and get out.  Asked twice for drink refills and never did get them.  Had to flag a busboy down with a water pitcher just to get that.  Seemed like plenty of staff on hand, they just didn't seem to be paying attention to the diners. Food was blah and pretty tasteless.  Prices seemed high for the quality of food.  The place looks really run down, light fixtures were filthy and half the light bulbs were burned out.  Overall the whole place looked very worn and dirty.  We've gone there for years, but won't be back again any time soon. Not a great experience at all.
