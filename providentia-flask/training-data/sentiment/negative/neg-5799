I like their fresh and clean menu but their restaurant is one of the dirtiest I have ever seen. The bathroom was really dirty, dusty, and it didn't even have soap. You toil wonder how their employees wash their hands after going to the restroom. We ordered one meal and a burger and it came out to $23 dollars. It was very pricy but my burger was not good. The meat tasted dry and weird. The fries were mushy and oily, they were not crispy or seemed fresh at all. I was very disappointed since I was told that this place was good. I hate paying for overpriced bad food with unsanitary practice.
