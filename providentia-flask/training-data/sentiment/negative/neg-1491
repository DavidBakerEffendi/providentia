Horrible!! Should have trusted the other reviews, but this was not my choice to check out this place. A friend's friend said it was a great little place for margaritas & that is the only reason why I went. Little to no parking, you have to park down the street. Arrived around 5ish, it was a bit busy from the Spring Training crowd. Our server was nice, but the food was tasteless. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas. The shrimp was over cooked & the size of a quarter. The black beans needed salt & the carne con queso dip was a bit soupy. The margaritas were too sweet w/a splash of alcohol.  Definitely will not be going back!!!
