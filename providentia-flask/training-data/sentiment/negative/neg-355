Just ordered through the drive thru about 20 minutes ago. I ordered two burgers and 1 clam chowder. (Last time I came here the clam chowder came in a bigger bowl) Today they gave me the clam chowder in a small bowl, with only celery and broccoli. Yeah broccoli, it had no "clam" so why do they call it clam chowder. They threw some cheddar cheese on top but I never asked for that. Last but not least, long line for them to get my order wrong. Last time I come here.
