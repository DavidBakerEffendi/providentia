This pizza was so salty and gross. We ordered a thin pepperoni and sausage and a pan broccoli and spinach.  Both pizzas were so salty and uneatable. The pan pizza was burnt on bottom. Sadly it was carryout, so could not easily return. Ended up throwing away and ordering from hotel diner. So disappointed.
