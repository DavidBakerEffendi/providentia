This review is simply from a customer service point of view. They have certain drinks that come in custom Genghis glasses for customers to bring home. As I was leaving with my glass I was rudely approached by a employee that asked for my glass. I handed to him assuming I was in the wrong and I explained the menu said I could take the glass. He said it costs money and my waitress should have told me that. I leave and begin to realize I could have paid for that glass and he should have asked. Also why was he so rude? I called the restaurant shortly after I left and was told they would let their employees know. No apology or explanation. Simply rude.
