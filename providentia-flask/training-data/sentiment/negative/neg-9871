I come to Xawaash ALL the time and everyone is usually so friendly. Sometimes it takes a while to get something if you ask but their tables and cool tvs make up for it. I always get their Beef & Chicken with fries and a Shawarma poutine which is AMAZING! 

Last time I went the chicken was severely under cooked, usually if its beef I'm okay with it but raw chicken can make you sick. I thought I would approach the owner cause he is usually so nice and welcoming. Unfortunately this is one of the worst restaurant experiences, he said:
-they would never serve raw chicken here, it's impossible and he showed me a temperature tool they use
-he said he would re-make it and bring it back to us, so no big deal I like the food here so that was okay and that's how a situation like this would normally be handled
-he then aggressively approached our table 3-4 times after while we were still eating other dishes to explain that the chicken is "juicy" here not raw, you can't overcook chicken or it'll be tough, we must generally eat our chicken dry so we don't know what we are talking about, then the last time he came out of no where (15 min after we complained) with just one piece of chicken in a saucer, with a temperature tool sticking out, he held it up to my face (didn't even put it on the table) and said "EAT IT AND TELL ME IF ITS RAW" and im like ahhh.... it's pipping hot and that's kind of rude for you to hold a plate in front of me and yell "eat it", he raised his voice while talking to us and was trying to start some sort of argument (with 4 girls), he was definitely causing a scene and our table was very embarrassed
-Basically this guy was super offended we didn't like the way he cooked our chicken and harassed us every 5 min after so we couldn't even enjoy the other dishes we had, we asked him for a refund for the raw chicken since 15 min had past and it wasn't re-cooked, we were kind of scared to stay anyways, we walked out and grabbed something else to eat nearby.

I eat at Halal restaurants and I love supporting them but this type of customer service is embarrassing to our community. A normal restaurant would just say sorry about that, have it re-cooked and brought back to the table, a even better restaurant would offer a discount for the inconvenience, and Xawaash wanted to harass and confront 4 girls multiple times to prove that the chicken was raw. I told my family about this experience so we all stopped coming here which sucks cause their food is actually really tasty.
