Sashimi wasn't cut correctly and all fish had a funny flavor. The tuna was pink instead of red. We ordered through door dash and if we'd been in the restaurant I would have sent it back and requested that we not pay for the meal. The wasabi is an odd color and I'm not sure what it was made from. I'm honestly a little worried about food poisoning. There are so many better places to eat sushi. Seriously. Pick somewhere else. The price is too high for such low quality.
