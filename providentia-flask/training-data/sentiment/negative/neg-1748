Stopped by here randomly to grab a quick bite, ended up splitting a $19 chicken and crispy noodle dish (a bit expensive if you ask me for the type of food).

The dish was very bland and tasted like almost everything was boiled down.  The "crispy" noodled ended up being soggy in the veggie broth that resulted from everything on the dish.

My date and I ended up adding salt and pepper to the chicken and veggies just to give it some taste.
