2nd visit. first visit, I said never again. second visit worthy of a Yelp review.

ordered a 12.99 roast beef with swiss.

the ordering menu says slow roasted homemade roast beef, pulled.
it was boiled, and boiled to death! it was so dry I added mustard otherwise I would have choked it was stringy, dry, and tasteless.
as for the swiss cheese, sliced so thin I couldnt even hardly find it.

2 visits, NEVER AGAIN.
