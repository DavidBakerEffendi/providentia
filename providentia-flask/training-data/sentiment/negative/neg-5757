In keeping with transparency, here is the majority of an email I sent directly the the Manager of Il Tetto. As I mention in my email, I believe this issue to be fundamental and consistent and doesn't appear to be getting better. 

After some deliberation, I've decided that I must write to you regarding my - and my group's - awful experience on Thursday night. If this were the first time I'd had a negative experience at your business, you wouldn't hear from me. However, I believe this to be a fundamental and recurring flaw, one that has occurred just about every time that I've visited Il Tetto. Simply put, the combative and disrespectful nature of your staff is a travesty. As a small business owner, as well as a full time bartender, it's also an embarrassment. Only on the most rare occasions have I been treated in such a confrontational and dismissive manner. As I mentioned, Thursday night was one of these occasions. I'd be happy top share details with you, if you care, but I'll leave it as your Door/Elevator Operator/Security Staff need serious training when it comes to customer service and interaction. This was not the first time and I've come to the conclusion it will not be the last. My friends and I WILL NOT be coming back. There are too many other fine establishments in the neighborhood that appreciate our business and show RESPECT to their customers. I understand the nature of these people's jobs: Dealing with people who have been drinking, generally in high volumes, etc. But the idea that being combative and disrespectful right from the start of an interaction will only ever end with an extremely negative experience. I've had enough. My friends have had enough. And from what I'm seeing on social media - and just in the several issues I've had at your place of business - this is not uncommon.
