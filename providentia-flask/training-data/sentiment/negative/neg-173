If you are a human being and thus may at some point after midnight need to pee or poop, don't eat here. The restaurant is open until 3 or 4 a.m. and is quite willing to take your money and serve you food and biiiiiiiiig giant sodas, but beware...their restroom closes at midnight. 

I couldn't believe that as a customer, eating in, I was not allowed to use the restroom. Is that even legal?? 

I asked where customers were expected to use the restroom after eating and drinking at their establishment. The girl informed me that customers can go "next door to Fat Tuesday". 
There are 2 MAJOR issues with that:
1 - you can't get into Fat Tuesday (a bar) if you aren't 21, so late night 20 year old sandwich eaters better have big ass bladders.
2 - the line to get into Fat Tuesday is sometimes about 20 people long, then once you get carded, get inside, and navigate through the crowd, the bathroom line for the ladies room is another 10-15 long. This means if you leave Jimmy Johns in the middle of eating to pee, you must be 21+ and you will be gone for 20 minutes to an hour to take a leak next door. You can then come back to your crusty sandwich and your annoyed friends who have been babysitting your food while you went pee pee partying over at Tuesdays. Screw that.

I'll tell you right now, if I were a guy, I seriously would've pissed on their floor under my table. But...as a girl, that could be messy for me. So...lucky for you Jimmy Johns...I was born without a penis. You win the prize of no pee on your floor, but you will never win my business EVER again.
