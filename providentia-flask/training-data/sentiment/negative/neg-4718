I will NEVER come back to eat here. This place should just be a bar and not serve food. Which the food was bad. The service was just as bad. I sat at the bar. I watch One bartender sit at the register and text on her phone which was sitting at the register then another bartender dance and singing really loud and calling customers that she was friendly with all types of different nicknames.  The Bartender who took my order basically pointed at me and said what do you want gave and I gave her my order never check if it was good I think I ate 2 pieces out of the whole entire order and she looks at me say so you're done your bill is such such amount never even gave me a receipt or check to show that amount until after I paid. Super unprofessional....
