I am 62 and have eaten all over the world.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever seen.  The outdoor patio, which welcomes dogs, smells like fresh dog feces.  The blaring TV's make any conversation impossible.  The wait staff is poorly trained, unfriendly, and useless.  The food is horrible and ridiculously overpriced.  $15.95 for a steak salad that had at most 2 ounces of tough steak and wouldn't qualify as a side salad quantity at any other restaurant.  It was overdressed by a factor of 5 at least and was a soggy mess.  Do not waste your time or money at this place.
