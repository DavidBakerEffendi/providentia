We went here to celebrate the win... But it was terrible.  This should be renamed DJT-Cafeteria.  This place isn't even worthy of being called a Cafe.  The location is terrible.  The setup is terrible.  I took my family here to celebrate the win on my anniversary with my wife.  There were 5 of us and we hoped for a great evening.  After sitting down, within 1 minute I knew the place sucked.  After 8 minutes of no service whatsoever, not even a greeting from the waiter, I promptly called Capital Grille across the street.  Capital Grille not only seated us immediately, but also decorated the table for my anniversary.  I so wanted this restaurant to be awesome... And after 15 minutes (the time it took for me to call Capital Grille, get the table setup, and then tell my family we were leaving) we still had not been spoken to by our waiter.  We were seated in the middle of the room, so it's not like anyone could miss us or not know that we were there.  President-Elect Trump needs to take his name off of this restaurant because this CAFETERIA is absolutely garbage.  Ohh, and I'm sure the food will match.  So sad...
