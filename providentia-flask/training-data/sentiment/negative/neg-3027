We have been here 3 times this year. Like other reviewers we really want to make this restaurant a regular stop as we live around the corner. We were in last Sunday morning for brunch with neighborhood friends. Its always amazing that they are out of things that they should have ample stock. This trip it was chorizo and diet coke?  As usual the service is super friendly by the same waitress we have everytime. Brunch menu was expensive and some of the items we ordered were not very good. The waffles are served with whipped cream and whatever fruit topping you order. They were extremely dry and should be served with some type of syrup. Instead they make a point of telling you there is no syrup. Some of the other items were very small portions and they couldn't have $ 2.00 in food cost but charge between 10-14.00.  As everyone in the restaurant is within 10' of the owner/chef you would expect some conversation from him. Nothing. The one thing he did do was to argue with a man and his family over an on line coupon. Everytime we go there someone is questioning the charges or the discount entitled them from the coupon.  Nice touch as we don't have one and are paying full price for poor food.  

One, two, three strikes your out!
