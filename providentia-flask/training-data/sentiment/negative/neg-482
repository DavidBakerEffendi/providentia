Pizza is like sex.  Even bad pizza isn't half bad.

Well my first girlfriend and this place have proven that old age adage NOT to be true.

Zero, and I mean ZERO flavor in this pizza.  I'm all about the sauce and this sauce has the distinct flavor of water.  And where in the heck do you find flavorless Pepperoni?  Where ever you do, that's where these guys shop!

Yikes!
