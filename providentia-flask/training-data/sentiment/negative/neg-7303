Food was okay. But the server was horrible. Leticia (sp?)  had brown thin hair. She was rude, rolled her eyes and disregarded anything that we had to. Favorite part of the visit was the cannoli. But, I will never go back due to her service. She seemed to have personal friends at another table and spent all her time chatting with them.
