Had an awful experience at Mezzo (Meatball Joint) so awful in fact that I walked out!  I wanted to grab a relatively quick lunch there so when I got there and asked if I wanted a table or take a seat at the bar, I opted for the bar thinking it would be quicker.  

WRONG!  I sat at the bar and waited a few minutes until anyone approached me and they asked if I would be drinking or eating and I said I was just going to eat.  Ok...they left, ignore, ignore, ignore...brought me water 5 minutes later.  Asked for a menu, did a whole bunch of other stuff for a bit and then grabbed a menu which was 2 feet from me and handed it over.  Ignore, ignore, ignore...someone just sat one seat away and was promptly given a drink and menu.  Ignore, ignore, ignore...I had made my decision on food about 10 minutes go.  

Wondering what the hell was going on because there were at least 2 people working the bar area and it wasn't very crowded.  Ignore, ignore, ignore, person sitting one seat away has order taken and that was where I couldn't take it anymore.  The bartender didn't even look at me after taking the other person's order and he was literally an arm length away. 

Walked out.  Not planning on going back any time soon.
