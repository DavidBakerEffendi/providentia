Went to this Taco Bell around 10:50pm and there was two teenagers running the drive thru. The girl did not seem like she was an employee as she was wearing regular clothes and her hair was down and she kept flirting with the male employee. This is a health code violation. I will be reporting this to the health district and to Taco Bell.
