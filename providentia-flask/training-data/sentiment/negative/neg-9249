Disgusting with a capital D!  The prime rib was as tough as shoe leather, the mashed potatoes came from a box.  30 minutes before closing they had already removed all of the place cards at the stations so you had no idea what you were scooping onto your plate. Paid $30.00 for the privilege of eating here only to spend the entire night sitting on the loo with a garbage can at the ready because my tummy was revolting from both ends. I could eat Hubby's cooking and be sick at home for free. Never again!
