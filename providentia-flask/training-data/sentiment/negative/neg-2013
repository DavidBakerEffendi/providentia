We had the eggs, bt potatoes and sausage breakfast.  The potatoes might have cost them 20 cents, they are the lowest grade of tater tots.  The sausage is okay but high in fat.  Eggs are okay but not many of them.  Customer service is worse than you could imagine.  When your food comes someone randomly screams out your order.  Not a lot of competition in this wing of the airport.

Avoid this place.
