I would give 0 stars if I could.  I came here later in the evening in a Taco Tuesday after the rush had already died down and you could count the patrons on 2 hands.  I ordered 5 tacos- a bigger order but nothing crazy,  no additional toppings, just standard.  After 20 minutes and trouble just getting a glass of water from the bartender, the barkeep told me she would check on my order.  She came back with no tacos, and no update, even.  Keep in mind she only went to check on my order after I brought up how a man got nachos sent out who sat down well after I did and clearly ordered after I did, as well.  That same man then got his fajitas before there was any food of mine up in the window(the place was so empty I could see the action, or lack thereof in the kitchen from the bar).
Now, I've operated many a hospitality establishment and am very easy going and understanding but 30 minutes after I ordered I cancelled it, and at this time usually a manager would stop by because they'd have to be alerted that a ticket for 20 or so dollars was being cancelled.  There was no manager interaction, no real apology, even.  I was beyond appalled and pissed.  I love the location in old town Scottsdale and would expect more of the same here but everyone that was working seemed totally disinterested in treating the customer, or even themselves with any sort of care(the food runner looked beyond disheveled and I'm not sure if want my food delivered by them even if it did come out in time!)
Overall, just a sorry excuse for an establishment.
