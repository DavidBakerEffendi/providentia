First time I visited oven doesn't work so no pizza. Second time get the wrong pizza, wait 25 min for my beverage, and this is with only two other groups in there. Also if you're thinking this is a Chicago type sports bar it is not. Bad service overall, too bad I really wanted to like this place.

Ordered deliver yesterday. Pizza was dripping out of the box. When I opened it I saw that the sauce had slide to one side which created a soggy wet half and left me cheese bread on the other half. Also super salty. I want to like this place but three for three in bad experiences means I'm giving up on them.
