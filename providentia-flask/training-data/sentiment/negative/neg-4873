Ate here this am. Family of 4 with 2 kids. We were hardly greeted when we came in. Not one person working there had a smile. We felt like we were bothering them by being there. We ordered our food and it arrived in good timing however the kids meals were below par for portion. Both of my kids were still hungry after finishing their own food. Portion size was comparable to what you would give a 2 year old.  Also our eggs were under cooked and if the server bothered to come around we would have had the chance to tell her. She saw we were done and brought the bill. 
All in all it was decent food but the customer service was garbage.
