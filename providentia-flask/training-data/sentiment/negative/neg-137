There was a group of around 35 Browns fans that came in to watch the game week one. Some of these Browns Backers members have been coming here for a long time and we decided to join them. 

Pros: Bloody Mary Bar

Cons: Everything else. Right before kick off the owner/manager decided he wasn't going to have the sound on for the Browns game as promised. He stated that despite the fact there are far more Browns fans in the bar than anyone else we are consistently cheap! Seriously? We're Browns fans...WE EAT AND DRINK A LOT!! 
So he decided to appease a small amount of fans in the corner that wanted to hear their game. 
Since we had already ordered a bunch of drinks and food for the 4 in our little group we decided to stay until the half. Slowly most started leaving to head to another bar. By the time we ate our pizza that tasted too much like flour and downed our drinks we also left. Our close to $100 tab would have been double that if we had stayed for the whole game. 

The unbelievably rude manager lost out on a lot of money and a lot of future business. 

We will NEVER be back!
