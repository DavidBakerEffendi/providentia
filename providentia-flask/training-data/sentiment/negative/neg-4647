So it was late at night and I was hungry for a snack. I called them up and ordered a large sausage pizza.my first clue should've been when the person on the phone asked if they still had sausage. So I went over to pick up the pizza and have a drink or two while I waited. I wasn't there for five minutes and the waitress spilled three drinks all over me. I move to the other end of the bar as they didn't clean it up very good. After waiting an hour for the pizza I started to become irritated. When the pizza was finally brought out it wasn't a sausage pizza and looked like a small pepperoni pizza. He offered to put some sausage on it for me... no thanks, I think I have waited long enough...  I would've been better off grabbing a tombstone pizza and cooking it I won't be back.
