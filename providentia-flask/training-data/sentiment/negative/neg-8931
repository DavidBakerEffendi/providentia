Worst experience ive ever had at a resturant. 1st the boy who was cutting the meat was cutting us slithers of meat. I had to ask him 3 times "can you please give me more meat?" Then the other cook was drunk as hell, can smell it on his breath. And they actually served rotten chicken but didnt notice till i took a bite and wondered what that bad smell was. I almost threw up. Anyway if you want a good brazilian spot avoid this place at all cost.
