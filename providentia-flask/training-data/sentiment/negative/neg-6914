I'm soooooo disappointed to review this place as 1 star as Ive had this place book marked since its opened..

Basically my girlfriend and I were seated pretty quickly as it was slow and we order our beverages . next we ordered wings I ordered 5 boneless thai and my girlfriend ordered 5 bone in Buffalo. We told the waiter we needed another minute to look over the menu for our main course as he left and we came back and ordered our main course.

Shortly after that he came back and said they were out of boneless wings but said he would make mine bone in free of charge, I declined as it wasn't a big deal and I didn't really care.

After that a girl brought out our wings as I guess they found 5 boneless , this was the part that pissed me off the boneless they brought were the bottom of the barrel almost all breading wings AND THEY WERE THE WRONG SAUCE!!! Also my girlfriends wings were plain and she ordered buffalo . how do you mess up wings its beyond me

If you mess up wings you really think I'm gonna eat a main course there?! No god this place blew and it wasn't even busy. Never coming back
