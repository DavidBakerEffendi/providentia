There is absolutely nothing Vietnamese about this place!
I had the fook kien noodle and it taste nothing like what is suppose to be...soup base was terrible a few PCs of BBQ pork over the soup.
My son had the lemon grass chicken on rice and they use regular white rice not broken rice
The wife had spring roll vermicelli and she said it was the worst spring-roll ever, and no mint leaves or basil 
Who da hell serve this dish without mint leave or basil! 
Never come back again that's for sure!
