I love burrito boyz but this location has very poor customer service.  I was excited to have a location in north Brampton,  but I'd rather drive to the queen st or Steele ave locations. Customer service over the phone is very poor. Employees don't know how to take phone orders, never ask for your name or clarify your order.  If you can't hear the persons name, ask them to spell it out!

If I order bean and cheese nachos, how did you not add cheese?

Retrain your employees in better customer service.

Personally, I'll only order through apps. At least I'll have proof on how you screwed up.
