The service was awful. Waited over ten minutes to be greeted at our table. This was after the manager confronted the hostess about an issue in front of us before seating us. We weren't asked how our meL was until we were almost done. Oh and I wasn't informed of a charge for extra sour cream. I enjoy Boston Pizza but I won't be returning to this location.
