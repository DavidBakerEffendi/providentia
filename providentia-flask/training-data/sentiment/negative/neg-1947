Worst service in Ohio. 20 min in, still waiting on chips and salsa. I don't think the salad and wings will ever make it to the table.

Update: 40 min, we still can't get the wait staff to bring the fucking chips and salsa. 

Update: We left. They are retarded.

Update: Called the manager, we now understand. He too is retarded.

I don't use the term lightly.
