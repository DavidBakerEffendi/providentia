Live with in walking distance. Suggested it to my daughter who was looking for a Mexican restaurant. Their server Nick was drunk.  Asked to talk to the manager or general manager.  The GM was in no rush to get to their table.  They will never eat there again.  Sorry suggested it! Should have told them to go to Blue Agave .
