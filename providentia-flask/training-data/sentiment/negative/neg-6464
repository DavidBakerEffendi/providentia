We enjoyed multiple stays at the hotel, but sadly; not all of the staff is honest. On more than one occasion, we've accidentally left something behind and in every occasion; it never gets turned in. (Yes, I realize it's my fault for leaving it behind, but that's not an excuse for the maids to steal it)
We were told there would be an investigation, but it concluded quickly with no fruit to bare. One of the first people we spoke to told us that they would then discuss compensation but today I spoke with someone from risk management was already trying to prep me to take the loss but mentioned no consequence to the maid who cleaned the room after. Mind you, this isn't a we might have left it situation. This is a we know for sure we left it and where it was left, but this isn't going to stop here. We spend far more in their casinos, restaurants & shops in a year and we come every couple of months. They would be taking a bigger loss by loosing us as patrons than they would by reimbursing us.
