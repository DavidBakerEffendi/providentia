I was really disappointed because the service here was rhorrible. The short Hispanic girl has a nasty attitude and no customer service skills. But the tall women was very nice. The gucamole was disgusting because it was made with too much bad onions. I've been sick ever since. The owners are really nice and wish the taco truck was still open at Las Vegas Blvd and Bonanza because the service there was amazing. Also disappointed because you guys no longer serve mulitas and the salsa bar hardly had anything in it.
