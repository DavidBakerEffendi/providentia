I used to like the food and service at Nextdoor. They have amazing fries, wings and chilli but tonight was a disappointment. We ordered a poutine and chilli to curb our winter cravings. Both were extremely salty. I had 3 spoons of chilli and could not finish the rest so it was returned to the kitchen. If food is returned because a customer can not eat it because it was drowning in salt, the customer should not be charged. No body likes to spend their money poorly or on poor quality food. Not going back.
