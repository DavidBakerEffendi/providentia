Had lunch there. Service was great. Good atmosphere. Like the overall design. The food on the other hand was absolutely horrible. 
The pretzel fondue to start was okay. Nothing exciting. We had a cheese burger that was thin, dry and really something you should get at McDonalds for a dollar (NOT $9!) Tabbouleh salad was just not good.
Over all I would not recommend. Bad food.
