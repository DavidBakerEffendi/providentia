This place was okay. I feel the experience would've been more positive if the service was better. The hostess and the busser were nice and friendly. Our server Heidi clearly didn't care about providing any kind of service - we were a party of 6 and she never refilled drinks, never checked to see if everything was okay after we got our food, and really wasn't even present except to take our order and drop off the check. She tacked on auto-gratuity which kind of explained why her service sucked so bad. So it was hard to really enjoy our food or even remember if it even tastes good because of horrible service - or lack of service. If anyone decides to dine here and you see that your server is Heidi and/or if you're a party of at least 6, don't expect her to go the extra mile or even show her face more than once or twice, since in her mind, she's already earned her tips.
