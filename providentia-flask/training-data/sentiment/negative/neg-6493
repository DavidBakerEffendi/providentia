I'm not a big fan. However, I do want to flag my review as a PICKUP review. It's expensive and difficult to order but had alright flavor. 

In my case, I would not recommend this place if you're picking up lunch for a team. The ordering process was sooo painful. So we placed our order, then 5 minutes later they called back telling us they're out of the Pad Thai (comm between hosts and the kitchen would be good here). Then we replace our order with wraps and go to pick it up. 

First off, they almost forgot to give me my lemonade. Then we take it to the office only to find that FORGOT AN ENTREE. I felt so bad for my colleague that ended up with the side salad for her missing entree. Additionally, my entree was just not there, they just gave us an extra order of another entree. Le sigh. 

I will say that the flavors were pretty good for vegan food. I usually don't go for vegan/vegetarian food because of a lack of flavor but this had some nice flavor profiles. I had the Living Burrito and the Kale Green Lemonade. The lemonade was very tasty but over-priced.

I would NEVER order lunch from this place again but I am willing to come in for a dine-in experience. This price rating for this place definitely needs to be upgraded to $$$.
