Not worth one star! Terrible, horrible, left without our order! WILL NEVER be back to this location!! Staff is SO rude! We placed our order at the window and the guy taking it repeated it back wrong 3 times! Finally, we got to the window 15 minutes later, and the guy says "what can I get for you?" What???!!!! 15 min and he hadn't even taken the order? Why did he ask at the window?? So we ordered our 3 smoothies and decided to scrap the salads since we knew they couldn't handle it! Another 15 min later, waiting at the window, my husband had to knock on the window because we didn't see a sole person! My husband says "It's been 20 minutes, where is my order?" The employee replies "It's only been 10 min!" in a very rude tone! SO UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!! We pull to the front, my husband goes in and asks for a refund! No "sorry sir" no nothing! Just RUDE, teenage employees! And by the way, there was ONE customer inside and NO ONE in front of us in the drive-thru!! The owners of this place need to FIRE all of the employees and hire new ones and LEARN HOW TO TRAIN THEM!!!
