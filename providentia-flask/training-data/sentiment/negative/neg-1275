Just to put things in perspective, I came here to the pickle barrel and ordered off their "all day breakfast" menu... It can't be bad right??  I mean I love breakfast, and brunch.  You can't screw up right?  WRONG.

I ordered a eggs benedict (because I figured I'd add to my eggs benedict list: http://www.yelp.com/list/the-best-eggs-benedicts-ever-gatineau-2).  They did have other stuff on the menu, but I figured that the pickle barrel wouldn't do that bad of a job.

It came out and the eggs looked like they were "poached" with a egg mcmuffin tool (it was perfectly round, not the good way).  It sat on a slice of canadian ham (cause it looked like Schneiders ham) that was as dry as the desert.  Served next to that was a bunch of potatoes.

So... biting in I don't think i've ever had a worse eggs Benedict.  Dry, bland and entirely too runny.  So bland I don't even think salt would have fixed it.  It tasted like I was eating liquified paper on a crunchy (and stale) english muffin.

Wow... maybe it's cause it wasn't breakfast.  Then again, don't call your menu "all day breakfast" when you can't deliver "all day".
