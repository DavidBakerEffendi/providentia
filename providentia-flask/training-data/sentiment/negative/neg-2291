I'm writing this based on the service and not the food... since i didn't stick around to taste anything. My partner and I wandered into this restaurant and were seated almost immediately. The restaurant was 1/4 full and that may be an exaggeration. I noticed right away that the wait staff looked disorganized. Eye contact with several of them was made in hopes to get a greeting and drink order in. Ten minutes later, new guests walked in and were greeted/served, while I sat around waving my hand to get attention. Nope didn't get any. Walked right out of there.
