A friend from work and I had the displeasure of dining here for lunch today. We're only given an hour for lunch, but we thought that would give us plenty of time since we came right at 11am. We ordered the large Caesar salad to share. We asked for ADDITIONAL dressing on the side. What we got was the salad with NO dressing on it and one tiny container on the side. Clearly not what we asked for, but we improvised and just asked for additional containers so we could eat. And then we waited....waited....nothing. Finally had to flag down a bus boy to get our original server to explain what happened and why we needed more. He seemed dazed and confused, but got us some additional dressing cups. Salad out of the way, we waited on the pizza we ordered. And we waited.....and waited....finally it arrives. We asked for a thin crust pepperoni with mushrooms on half of the pizza. What came to us was a PAN pizza, and to top it off, the mushrooms were hidden so we had no idea which half of the pizza they were on. Again, dazed and confused server was told about the pizza mix up. He argued with my friend that this was what we ordered and then took the pizza back to the kitchen to discern which side the mushrooms were on. Rather than reject it and send it back for what we originally ordered, we decided to eat it because it had taken so long we were now late getting back to work. The pizza was WAY over salted, much too much oregano on it to the point it was hideous tasting. I choked half my slice down and was done. Server never apologized for anything that went wrong, nor any offers to take the wrong pizza off the bill. Terrible service and terrible pizza. Does this place even have a manager? We won't be back.
