I went here last night for my friend's birthday, the staff made us all feel uncomfortable, they acted like they were better than us and almost seemed annoyed that we were there. We were the only people in the lounge and the music was uncomfortably loud. When I asked them to turn it down to a more comfortable level, the two people working there again seemed annoyed and almost appalled that I would ask such a thing. 

In short, I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed that I was the one who suggested we should go to red sea.
