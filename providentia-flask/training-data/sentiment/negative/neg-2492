The customer service at this bakery is horrendous. I ordered a plain white cake for a party noting when I ordered it that I would be storing it over night and serving it the next day. When I went to pick up my cake, it was not plain white as requested but instead covered in chocolate drizzle and lumps. I was told by the ladies working that I could "just scrape it off with a knife." They didn't even offer to help fix it. The box they wanted me to take the cake home in also didn't fit the size of cake I ordered, and wouldn't come close to closing shut. I was told it costs extra for a box that will actually close... What?!?!? Buyer beware.
