I bought a Groupon for this place & decided to make the trek out to Ground Control. Checking out the website the menu looks great & extensive. The one page you actually receive is far less impressive. The day time stuff looks great. The night time Ground Control needs some serious help. 
Things I would suggest...
1) Remove the term gastropub from all advertising. Because you may be a public house but are NOT by definition a gastropub. A gastropub normally serves high end foodie inspired dishes with premium ingredients. 
2) Actually make the artichoke dip onsite & if you do already you need to jazz it up BIG time. At the very very least serve more for $8.95 & broil some yummy cheese on top to add some texture & depth of flavor.
3) If you advertise a Kobe Beef served medium on your menu then by all means ensure its prepared in the appropriately way. If it's actually Kobe beef being served then serving it well done is a crime. 
4) Last but not least advertise! If you do maybe you'll get more than the older bored looking locals. The liveliest in the crowd no group of customers were the Saturday entertainments friends that were there for support & the bartender's friends seated at the bar.
