Came here with a friend!  

Was not sure what to order. Ask the lady at the front counter about options. My friend had these coupons he wanted to use, so she got her shift lead, Nancy for assistance. Nancy had a mini meeting in front of us, LITERALLY turned their backs to us at the counter just to say the coupon couldn't be used. (It was a corporate coupon that wasn't expired, Nancy told us that it didn't have the location on it!  Cool, fine, whatever!)

Nancy, the shift lead, first  is very professional, however I felt that she lack personality and the subtle ways of interacting with customers. Which I think is the reason why I'm giving this review a 1 Star!

I will NEVER come back to this establishment again because of the borderline rudeness I got from Nancy. She made me felt slightly less welcome as if I was an annoyance or rowdy customer. I was in a great mood, having a great time with a friend that I hadn't seen in a while. At one point I almost wanted to just canceled my order due to the coldness I got from Nancy!  

As far as the food, it was standard. I ordered the mango habanero and garlic parmesan boneless wings with veggies sticks. Same standard fried bones less wings that you'd get anywhere. They came out in a timely manner. Taste was as expected. 

The restaurant was clean and appropriate. The atmosphere was ok, they have chairs and huge TVs for viewing in the dining room. Nothing special. 

Parking was convenient, free out in a sharing shopping strip. 

Overall, the restaurant is decent, I would have given it a 3.5, but due to the total coldness I got from the shift lead, Nancy from the beginning, I will never come to a wing stop restaurant again!
