We shared an order of Orange Chicken that had not a hint of orange flavor, though it did include some razor-thin slices of orange and a syrupy sauce on a bed of wilted lettuce. The chicken was tough, tasted as though it had been cooked a week earlier, and appeared to be dark meat. Yuck!  We also shared the pot stickers, filled with pork and cabbage, but not any of the latter was present. Tasteless and bland. The "green onion pancakes" were greasy and had no trace of onion. Next time, there won't be a next time.
