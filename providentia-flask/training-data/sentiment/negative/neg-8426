I've been here on three different occasions. I usually enjoy in-house, micro-brew so that was the draw for me. However, I'd rate their beer better then an average tap bar but for a micro-brewery, it has pretty low points. In fact I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for the beer again. 

This place is kinda a bar/restaurant, trying to appeal to beer drinkers and family diners at the same time.It's a large, high ceiling dining area that does not distinguish restaurant from bar.  The result is a large, noisy, brightly lit cavern that I found too busy and over-stimulating. 

While there, my friend and I ordered drinks but we were coerced into a meal, mostly because the staff was constantly on us to order some food. On our last visit, the waiter asked us every 5 minutes if we wanted something to eat, no joke. When we finally ordered, he let up just until we finished our food. Then it was a constant interruption from him asking if we want anything else, sort of making us feel like we should not take up a table any longer if we're done eating. This was not one time, this is every time I've been there. Even sitting at the bar we got continually pestered into getting something more. The staff seems to be very high strung, sort of  like they drank 5 cups of coffee. 

As for the food, I found it highly forgettable, in fact, I don't even remember what I ate. It's just as all well because I won't be going back again.
