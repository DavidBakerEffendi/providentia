The buffet price has gone from $10.99 to $17.99 with players card in less than two years. The price is the reason we drive so far and accept the limited buffet and smokey gross casino. I cannot recommend and will not be back.

Went back today to try the lobster buffet and it was a big disappointment. The lobster was over cooked and rubbery. None of the other entrees were edible but the chocolate cream pie was a winner.
