What has happened to McDonalds.  The service with a smile is definite out the window.  Here, we passed by drive-thru and ordered 2 number one meals (2 egg mcmuffin  meals) with ice coffees.   The lady who is entering the order entered 2 egg mcmuffins, 2 hash browns and 2 coffees and charged about $14.46.  I explained over the intercom that I ordered the meals and she began to argue that it was the meals. I again explained that she entered the items individually which results in a higher price than if entered as a meal.  She said it's the same as the meal and then told me to "just drive to the first window!"  At the window a nice guy said, "you ordered the 2 mcmuffins, 2 hash browns, and 2 ice coffees."   I explained I ordered the meals.  He corrected it and charged $13.37.   Now $1 is not much but if they are doing this to everyone it adds up.  Then I realized that the food is not that great or healthy, the service is terrible (having seen a smile at a drive thru in a year and need to argue for $1) and I have no need for happy meals or to entertain kids, so what is the point of going there?  It seems like I have accepted it.  Well it's time to stop.   Good bye McD.   Hello pollo loco.
