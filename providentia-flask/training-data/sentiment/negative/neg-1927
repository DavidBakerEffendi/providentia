I had heard a lot of bad things about this place from several friends who had stopped in to check out the new place that opened in the former Lakewood Panini's/Riviera location.  I wished I had listened to them as my experience there was also less then stellar.

While I can see the light at the end of the tunnel this bar as a long way to go before it can get there.  The menu looked pretty good, but it seems as though the cooks (not worth calling them chefs) seem to be in over their heads.  Sadly, when most of your menu is gussied up bar food like deep fried pickles, hamburgers, and various other pub grub it's not a good sign at all.

I ordered a hamburger thinking that with the locally sourced options available as toppings I would get a really good meal.  What I got was a small little hockey puck of a hamburger on an oversized bun.  My first two bites were nothing but bun.  I immediately thought back to that commercial from the 80's where the little old lady asks, "Where's the beef?"  Once I got to the beef patty it was dense, dry, and overcooked.  Since I had ordered it to be cooked to medium this was very disappointing.

I had mentioned this to the bartender, and I got a look of indifference with the only solution offered being a free drink.  Really?

The other problem, as it has always been with this location, is parking.  While there is a parking lot nearby it is for the Autozone, and from what I've heard they have Baker's Towing on speed dial so you're left with street parking with is virtually like winning the lottery if you can find a spot within decent walking distance.

I do wish the new owners all the best of luck, and hope that they can get things ironed out as Lakewood needs all the tax generating business revenue that it can get, but if the quality standards continue to be this poor I fear that it will turn into nothing more then the karaoke bar that the Lakewood Riviera had turned into before it's ultimate demise.
