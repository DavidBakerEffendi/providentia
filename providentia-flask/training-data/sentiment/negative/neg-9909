The food isn't terrible, but the service is. I ordered the same basic margherita pizza as the girl in front of me. Her pizza was topped with a normal amount of toppings as it moved down the line with her server. Mine was topped with less than half the amount of topping by my server, right behind the other pizza. I finally said, hey, let's put a little product on the bread as I pointed to the nice looking pizza sitting right beside mine. The server looked confused and the server that was properly preparing the other pizza backed up and added the correct amount of toppings to mine. These little personal pizzas aren't cheap. Mine was 12 bucks and the proper amount of toppings is still skimpy. And the dude pouring my beer was pathetic. I was going to mention the 1/3 glass of head, but he'd already tried a half dozen times and I was hungry. I'm not cheap, I just don't like working harder at preparing my food than my server does.
