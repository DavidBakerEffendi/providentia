Recently, the owner accused me of being ratchet and that classy ladies don't get gas at night. (Las Vegas is a 24hr city.. is it classier to push my car at night into a gas station?)

Well, with that being said.. I came in to give them a try. Rolled up to the "ratchet" gas station that I've patroned for probably the last 13 years. Walk in, wow surprisingly this fine afternoon no one is using vulgar foul mouth language during business hours. (I surely was not aware that after hours means you are no longer a reflection of your business). Anywho, proceeded to look over the menu and ordered. 

Food was ok, wasn't life changing. Seeing as how I frequent Baja it wasn't very comparable as I didn't see a spit for the Adobada. Oh well, thanks for lunch and letting me know I'm Ratchet.. how does one become a car tool?

I guess we'll never know!?
