My friend and I stopped by for a Drink and to social during the lunch hour. There was no Host waiter or anyone to seat us so we sat our self. So we waited and wait still no waiter or anyone so we got up and left and took are business some where else. 

     Went their for mothers day one Time for Brunch it was so a complete Joke the staff took their sweet little time with the food by the time the food came out I had to send it back because I had to leave at work and plus I never got to enjoy it. What a waist of money to spend on a mothers day brunch. Thanks main street caf√© I believe you can do better.
