After a couple more visits I'm finally going to pass judgement on this shawarma place. My first visit was at peak lunch hours & it was busy so I was a little more forgiving. My next 2 visits were not during peak operating times. The chicken shawarma was ok nothing really to say, maybe a little dry.  You can get the same quality at any other shawarma vendor in the city. 

How they treat each customer is an issue for me. When one group of people receives preferential service over another it's discrimination in my eyes. I don't want to use the "R" word but if it walks & talks like a duck then this place is definitely quacking. So if you are Caucasian, Middle Eastern or African, count yourselves the lucky ones.

And just today I helped the owner lift the cash register table up so an elderly employee could put a wedge underneath. Did I get a thank you or any acknowledgement? Well I'm not one of the "lucky ones" so what do you think!
