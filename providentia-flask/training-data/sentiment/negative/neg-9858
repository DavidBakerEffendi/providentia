I honestly really like Walnut Grill. We just had a pretty terrible experience.

Five of us co workers came for lunch. My colleague and I picked the restaurant because we have never had a bad experience and the food is pretty good.

However, this day was pretty terrible. We were seated fairly quickly so that was good. We had a table in the large eating area. It was not crowded at all. 

We sit down and our server comes over and takes our drinks. She comes back with our drink orders then we order food. We waited for about an hour to get our food. No one came to check on us until about 5 minutes before the food came out. It appeared there might have been a problem in the kitchen but no one came out to let us know.

Our food came finally came out and it was just alright. We were not offered an explanation as to what happen or an apology. Honestly I will not be coming back to this location any time soon.
