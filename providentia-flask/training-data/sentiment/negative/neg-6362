Haven't been to Anthony's for several months. The reason is the quality of the food.  This visit we decided to check it out again to see if anything changed. Ordered the Lobster Special which was good but not excellent as it was dry!  The worse was the steak served with a lot of fat attached to that thick inedible layer of hard fat.  Only ate 1/3 of meat.  It looked like a untrimmed steak.    The scalloped potatoes were under cooked.  Did not eat any after unable to put my fork in it.  Servers were invisible, poor service!  I would like to call this my favorite steak house but it lets me down every time.  With so many great steak houses in Vegas, you would expect exceptional food and service. Very disappointed!  Needs a new chef!
