I've tried this place several times and each time I'm very disappointed. Overpriced food that is under cooked and overdressed. When you order a dish with salmon and quinoa and vegetables they bring you your salmon in a cup which I think is ridiculous. Staff is careless doesn't pay attention. This place needs a lot of help!!! If I were you I wouldn't even bother going.
