This was how it went.  Walked up to the hostess to give her my name and number. She said a text message will be sent to me once a table is ready for us. Received the text and informed the hostess. She told us to have a seat at the couch. While waiting, we saw couples after couples check in with their text and they were brought in immediately. 15 minutes later, I went up to the hostess and she rudely said, "in the future, you need to inform us when you receive the text message." I said I already did, and have been waiting here for 15 minutes.  She clearly forgot about us and wasn't even apologetic about it.  

Food was mediocre. Despite the decor, our experience was ruined by their unprofessionalism, poor hospitality and lack of organization.
