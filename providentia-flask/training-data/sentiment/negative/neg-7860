God damn their burgers are dry. Their hot dogs and fries were just bland. There are way better burgers and fries elsewhere in Montreal. Hell.. walk to Five Guys on the same street.

The only positive thing about this place is that it's open late and right next to a strip club.

It belongs on Crescent street with the rest of the tourist trap places.
