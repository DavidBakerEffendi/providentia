Disgusted by the customer service experience. This is a place my husband and I went to when we lived in Las Vegas. We were back for our anniversary and thought we'd head here for breakfast. The food was fine, but the service was really upsetting. The waitress delivered our food and asked my husband if he wanted more coffee and then didn't return until it was time to deliver the check. I observed a young man bringing coffee to all the other tables. He never came to ours. After paying the bill and leaving a tip I wish I hadn't, my husband and I went to the bakery to buy some cookies. I went to the counter and one cashier served another woman ahead of me. I went to the other cashier who was serving someone and once she was done, she literally turned her back on me and started rolling silverware. 
I have never received such horrible customer service here. Awful and so disappointing.
