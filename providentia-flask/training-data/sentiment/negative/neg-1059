I came here a couple times had a bad experience I let some time go by so I thought I'd try it again just to pick up a couple sandwiches. They close at 9pm,  I walked in at 8:45. They told me they've cleaned everything up and they weren't taking orders unless I wanted a pizza. I don't know,.. I run a business and either I'm open or I'm closed...kinda first rule of a successful business, no?. Meanwhile those guys were kicking butt trying to get out of there at exactly 9 . I hope the owner reads this. Actually,  I sure hope that wasn't the owner! The bottom line, not only is the food often questionable, now they don't offer basic customer service. The third time was not a charm I am done for good until the new owners take over.
