Generally I quite like Royale. Great food, pretty attentive service and a good cocktail menu. In the summer a nice patio. 

However, this evening's service was well below expectations. We had three drinks in total, and the first round took about 15 minutes to receive (it was a beer and a glass of wine).  The second was a cocktail that took another 15 minutes. When we asked for the bill, that was another 15 minutes to which the server said she didn't grab a machine and suggested we pay at the bar. 

My friend paid first and in between, the bartender (long hair and beard) who was programming the machine left to go and talk to the three women sitting at the bar. I stood their for about two minutes, waiting for him to come back and program the credit card machine for me to pay my portion. 

All in all, a very bad night for a restaurant I like to rely on for good food, drinks and service.
