Perhaps I would have a more positive review for Dolce if I had had the other server, Izzy, who was charming the tables around me. My server was SHOCKED and APPALLED that I was eating lunch alone, and he sat me in a narrow doorway (I banged my elbow into the wall twice because it was such a tight fit), even though there were a dozen other open tables. The mussels were overcooked. The panini had literally one see-through shaving of prosciutto (I had to pick up the bread to make sure it was there since I couldn't taste it) and it had limp lettuce pressed into the hot sandwich. Store-bought bread was brought cold to the table and was used in the panini. A huge disappointment considering all the other positive reviews.
