Had lunch at one of my favorite local burger shops in town... at least they used to be. Not anymore. I will not go back. You may ask, "Why? You had such positive reviews! You love Lenny's!" I do... at least the old Lenny's. 

Not sure if they had a management change or if it was just a fluke but my burger was terrible. Want to know the reason? Here it is. 

As I was leaving, I took a peek into the kitchen and saw one of the cooks pull out burger patties out of a steel container. The burger patties were soaked and looked cooked already. So basically they reheated these old cooked patties and served them to the guests. 

If I want reheated yesterdays burger patties, then I will go to McDonald's. Sorry Lenny.
