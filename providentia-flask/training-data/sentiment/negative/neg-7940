So I was just in today to meet my brother for a coffee. Started out fine, we got a couple of teas and sat down by the glass wall to the right of the counter. We were chatting and about half an hour later someone came in and began vacuuming the floor around near us and the door, and while a little loud, it was fine. The problem came when he started to vacuum under my brothers chair. Then under the table where we were still sitting. When he started to hit my foot with the vacuum wand I stood up to get out of his way, but come on. This is appalling that the choice was made to vacuum under an occupied table at 11:30 in the morning in a crowded cafe. The barista actually said have a nice day when we were leaving, but he wasn't aware of anything wrong because he was on his phone the whole time. I will be having a nice day, but I won't be coming back to your place.
