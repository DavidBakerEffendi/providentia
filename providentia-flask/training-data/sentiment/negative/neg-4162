Remember that kid in middle school whose parents bought them all the coolest things to try and fit in? And they still sucked??  That's The Porch. We've given this place 4 solid tries and have been vehemently underwhelmed each visit. If you've ever wondered where ex-bottom-tier frat brothers and desperate social sorority sisters hang out... look no further. It's as if they got lost somewhere between Mill Ave and Old Town, without a full-time job to show them the way. Service is perpetually substandard and the food is bland as can be. It is truly disappointing   as it's a complete waste of a great location.
