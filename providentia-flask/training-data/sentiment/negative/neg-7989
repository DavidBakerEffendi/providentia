My boyfriend and our out of town guest decided to go here this past Saturday for a late lunch.  Now mind you I've gone to this place a hand full of times and only live in Phoenix for a year.  I love Greek food and was so excited to find a Greek place that my boyfriend could enjoy and eat at.  All I could picture was the Chicken Souvalki pita with a side Greek Salad.  The salad would be so cool, crisp and amazingly hot day.  In my dream it did not include extra protein of a dirty live black bug!!!  Our hostess brought us our plates in the bar and I began eating my salad so excited.  After about six bites a piece of lettuce started to moved and then a black bug crawled out of my salad.  I screamed with fear and disgust.  My boyfriend brought the plate right over to the hostess and all she said was sorry.  Then she came over to me and said that they wash the lettuce everyday and the only reason they would have a bug infestation was because it was hot outside and people coming in.  Then she said she would make me another plate.  Ummm hello if the lettuce is only washed once a day and people have to come in and out because it's a restaurant then why would the next salad be any different?  She didn't offer to reimburse us for our food or give us a voucher to come back.  I was so disgusted by the bug and the various excuses that we won't be going back.  I'm sad to say good-bye to such a great place but I won't be sad saying good-bye to bug infested salads!
