I rarely give one star, but after eating here (and I had a tea, and a biscuit for breakfast), I was not feeling well. The Tuna I think was off, not impressed with this place. The sushi rice, was just sticky rice without any seasoning. The Poke itself wasn't anything special. With raw fish it has to be as fresh as possible. Also the person taking cash wasn't the friendliest.
