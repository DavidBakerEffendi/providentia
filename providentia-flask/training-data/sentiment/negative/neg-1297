I just don't understand.  Even with the coupons offered, Sweet Tomatoes had to make money!  It was by far one of the most popular restaurants in my family and with several friends.  The new concept just falls flat on my expectations.  The food quality was good, but the menu was a mess!  I walked away feeling as if I over paid too under the a la cart system.  I know the place is new, and they want their customers to walk in with an open mind.  However the bottom line is I was let down and am happy to make the longer drive to the few remaining original Sweet Tomatoes.
