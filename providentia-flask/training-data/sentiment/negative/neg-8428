Burger King is fortunate that their food is so good because it's their only redeeming quality. This particular location is always SO SLOW on their drive thru times. We had 4 orders and had to repeat (and correct) each of them at least once. When we finally got to the second window (because, of course, the first one was not open), they staggered our order to us and the combos weren't even in the same bags. The drinks were mixed up and luckily, we checked before we pulled off and realized we were short an order of French fries. No napkins or straws were given to us, either. Will not go back. Oh, and got hit up by two homeless people for cigarettes. Bah!! But when we asked for salt, they did kindly give us about 20 packets.
