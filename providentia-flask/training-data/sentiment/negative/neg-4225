Omg I'm so f*ckn pissed at this place! I paid for $25 of meatless pizza and 2 bottles of water! All I can taste in my pizza was anchovies and a few pieces of prosciutto/sopresatta that I paid extra for! They should've given me more meat!!! The crust was soggy, too much sauce and barely had any basil. I wish I could've taken a pic but I forgot. I was so annoyed at how stingy these toppings were, I don't understand because some of the pics actually looked good and more generous...argh I'm so fckn angry!!!
