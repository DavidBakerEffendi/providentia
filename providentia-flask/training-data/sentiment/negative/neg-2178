We loved this place when  it first opened.  That was until one day I brought a pie home and as soon as I opened the box it had a big clump of dark hair on it (my hair is buzzed and not the same color).  It wasn't one hair, but a large clump.  I have since gone to other places in the same strip mall, and noticed "C" sanitation grades on the door of Carmella's on numerous occasions.  I would be careful about eating here.  At least check their grade before going:
