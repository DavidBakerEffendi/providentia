I'm baffled how this place is still in business. My first time I came here with a groupon, the entire place was empty except for my friend & I. We ordered a couple things, all were decent, nothing mind blowing, so when the groupon came up again, I was reluctant to get it, but since my friend is vegan, this was a close lunch spot for us. This time around however, things are different. Again, the place is empty. The ambiance/atmosphere is really strange, a large room with old lady furniture & couches, and outdoor patio furniture for their tables. I ordered the hummus platter, the cucumbers were soggy & watery in the middle, the celery was old looking as well, they were hard at the ends. The hummus wasn't that great, I didn't know it was flavored (I prefer plain old hummus) the only thing good was the pita bread. I ordered the turkey burger, I was expecting ground turkey, but what came out was an actual piece of turkey that had been on a panini machine, it was dry, gross and inedible. I still had some money left to the groupon so since I didn't eat my burger I ordered a mango lassi (which tasted like crap, NOTHING like a mango lassi, like ice and greek yogurt) she then informed me that the groupon was for dine in only and I wouldn't be able to take the smoothie I would have to drink it here. Are you kidding me? Uh okay. I watched several people come in after me, and what a long time to be served. I don't foresee this place lasting. I know I won't be returning.
