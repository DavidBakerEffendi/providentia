This is your regular North Side run down divey sports bar, except It smells weird and I always get severely congested in there.(I wonder if they have a mold problem.) It's a  really big place, there is a wall of TVs and it's usually pretty full. Also, they serve free hot wings during happy hour, so if you're into that...

I don't like it, because I don't like sports and I like background music when I'm drinking. Plus I've seen some obnoxious drunks in there and never anyone slightly hip, which is fine, but... well, it is what it is.

I would give 2 or 3 stars, but often the bartenders have attitude. No matter how friendly I am or how much I try to get on their good side with good tips, asking them how they are doing, etc. they still kind of act rude. There's one girl in particular, but I can't remember her name. She wears glasses, has dark hair and is pale. She will purposely ignore me and help all the men at the bar instead. 

It may be a silly gripe, but that's  the reason I haven't gone back. I like friendly neighborhood places.
