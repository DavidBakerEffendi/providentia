WTF.

So, I was in The Root a short while ago, minding my own business, working on my laptop and drinking one of their lattes, along with many other patrons doing the exact same thing. I did this same thing this past Saturday night and multiple times previously. After about less than an hour of sitting, a waitress approached me and very warmly asked me to go share a table with someone else so that a group could dine at my table.

WTF.

Seriously? You just asked me to relinquish my table in a coffee shop? Who does that?? I have nothing against germs or table-sharing, but everyone in the place was drinking coffee and working on their comps...1) why did they choose ME to displace, and 2) why am I any less valuable of a patron than the people who want to eat?? I have never in my life been asked to move somewhere else in any restaurant, bakery, bar, or COFFEE SHOP. You're a coffee shop, you make most of your dollars on people like me, who work on their computers and chug coffee! 

Um, I don't feel like relocating, I don't feel like being displaced, and I don't feel like being treated like a second-class customer. So, I left. And came to MoCa, who kindly invited my patronage. 

The Root will never see my business again.
