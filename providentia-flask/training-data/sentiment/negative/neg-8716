I came here for lunch with my family today. Food was bad and service was terrible. There might as well be no server at all. We waited for 15 minutes before we get our drinks then an other 20 minutes before they take our orders. We ordered their specialty pho. It took 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Not only the pho came with noodles still sticking together. I called the server over and ask for an exchange and they said their noodles are serve like that. I like pho but I never had a pho with noodles sticking together. I used to think this place was good but not any more. Their service has definitely gone down the slop. I had a $35 lunch with my family. I gave them $1 tip for their uncook noodes and their poor services and the 1hour and 5minutes wait. The server came back to me with the cash tray wanting to ask for more tip. I told her I would not tip them any more for my poor experience today. Then the server gave me a look. Overall, I had a very poor experience at this resturant. I don't think I woukd return to this resturant again. Very disappointing not to their food but the long wait and the services.
