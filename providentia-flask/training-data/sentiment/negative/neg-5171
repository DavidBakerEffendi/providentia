I have changed my initial review from 5 stars to one star based off of our weekly takeout experience. The quality and quantity has gone out the window. Nothing is consistent anymore, and I am very disappointed with the amount of money we spend for what we now get. No salad dressing for our salads on many occasions, and the veggie burger wraps have turned into hourderves , instead of a meal, lacking ingredients , and sauce as well!! We really wanted to support this raw food establishment seeing as how there so few in the area, but we just can't get behind the incredible shrinking portion size and lack of consistency! Booo!!
