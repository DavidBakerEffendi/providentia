I live in Las Vegas and I travel for a living so it's quite surprising that I've never been here before but I never have been. The menu has never looked appealing to me so I've never stopped here but I did today. I waited 9 minutes for my glass of water. After that I ordered a hamburger well-done. Took one bite of my almost raw hamburger and sent it back. The waitress didn't look thrilled with me sending my food back but she had to agree that they hamburger was raw.. I'm still waiting on my hamburger
