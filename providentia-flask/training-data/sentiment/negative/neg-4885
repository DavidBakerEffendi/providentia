NEVER AGAIN.

Oh, wait.  The term, "never again" commonly refers to the holocaust, not this restaurant.  But seriously...

One night, I thought, what the hell, pizza from the best, right?  Pizza Margarita, $10-$15.  So I go, and I ask, "...can you add sausage and mushroom?", and the guy says sure.  I'm not kidding you: $5 DOLLARS FOR SAUSAGE, $3 FOR MUSHROOMS...ON A $10 PIZZA.

I checked two pizza parlors, at random, who have owners without Chrissy Bianco's ego, and for an 18" pizza, to add sausage, they charge $1.75.  A dollar seventy five!  But not Bianco!  FIVE DOLLARS!  

Listen, I've made money, had money, lost money; it's my opinion that $5 for sausage on a 10-12" pizza is pure narcissism.  It's just silly.  And I'll never, EVER come back. 
$5 for sausage, you jagwod!  Take your sopressata and leave me alone!

Pretentious, expensive, really pretentious.  Nope.  Never again.
