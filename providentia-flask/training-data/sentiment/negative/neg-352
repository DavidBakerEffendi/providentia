Meh. Ordered two coffees. Their regular roast was horrible. It tasted like it was made with chlorinated pool water. Also ordered a flavored "flat white" which is a light foam cappuccino. Again, had an unusual metallic taste. Both left quite the aftertaste, as if I just took a dose of Robitussin. 

The service was good, it just doesn't make up for lousy coffee. This location seemed very clean and they had a large variety of flavored syrups and food. 

There wasn't a paper menu to read the descriptions of coffee, so unless you have stellar vision and can read the board above the cashier that's in the smallest font... You're screwed. 

Bleh. Oh well. Off to Starbucks!
