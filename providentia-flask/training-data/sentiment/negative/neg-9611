Unbelievably disappointing. I got the brisket and received 4 slices that had obviously been sitting in some type of warmer for more than a little while and 2 tiny sides. Having lived in Texas the claim that this is Texas BBQ is ridiculous. I am sorry to say that this was the worst brisket I have ever had. Dry, tough and tasted liked dried out roast.

My son had the pulled park which was not much better, dry and tough; much more like jerky than pulled pork. The only highlight of the meal, if you could call it that were his French fries.

Seeing some of the other reviews, they may have just had a really, really bad night but this would certainly be the last place in Madison I would go for BBQ.
