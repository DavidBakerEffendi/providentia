Seriously you do not need to wait 1 hour after being seated to have breakfast delivered. 

While this place is very charming, it is understaffed and the wait is outrageous for service and food. 

After arriving at almost noon on a Saturday 11/9/13, we waiting 20 mins for a table, which in itself is more than reasonable for a table. The service took a while to greet us and eventually we were given menus and ordered breakfast. 

Now we waited another 20 mins after ordering and the server who was friendly asked if we needed anything. Yes, food! She went to check on our order and came back and said it would be another 40, yes FORTY MINS for our simple breakfast order to arrive. 

Shame on you for making customers wait over an hour to eat. This was not shared before sitting down! I overheard other customers also discussing long waits. 

Do not go to this restaurant if you're looking for a quick or even timely meal and do not expect much from the service either.
