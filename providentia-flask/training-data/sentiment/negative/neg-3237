The Egg and I on North Power use to be our favorite breakfast place in the east valley.  But no more.  Not sure what has changed but the service now is HORRIBLE.  And the food quality is equally as poor.

I'm not sure how a restaurant can go downhill so quickly?  We have given them three chances since getting back for the winter & all three had the same results.  One of those times we actually had to walk in to the kitchen to ask somebody to seat us.   WOW!
