Warning!!! this place recycles rice and food. To my dismay, I observed the waiters pick out some rice parts from the rice bowls and then top it off. Later I saw one table had a leftover, they took it to the back, while they bussed the table and threw everything else away...hmm I wonder who they will serve that to!
Avoid pork and clams, their meat is half rotted!!!
Roast pork and duck taste ok.
Also they do not take credit cards. Just avoid this place.
