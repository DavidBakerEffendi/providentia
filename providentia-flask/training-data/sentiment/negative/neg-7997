Just had a horrible experience at this place. Took us 2&1/2 hours to have lunch for 8. Plus they messed up on our order. Got us a well done steak instead of medium well. The waitress was pleasant and apologetic and said manger will be right over when asked it to be redone. The manager there did not even come up to the table. Instead walked half way and turned around. I guess we scared him. Took them over 40 minutes (yes I was timing them) took get the food made to order. The waitress apologized and said that we won't be charged. But instead was charged for it and said the manager decided not to charge us for the "second steak"!! Wow!! How sweet of him not to charge us for what was a piece of jerky!!  If you charge $20 for breakfast food, it's your responsibility to make sure it's cooked correctly!! 

When we do come to vegas we always make sure we eat here. But never again are we coming back here especially after this horrible experience. Very very slow service. Turned our good day into a horrible one. I recommended this place to a few friends but I'm sure they will read this and stay away from here.
