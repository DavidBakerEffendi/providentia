The first time I ordered, it was great. I ordered a second time, they forgot one of the toppings and gave us garlic balls instead of the breadsticks... no biggie...

So we ordered a third time (all within a 1-week time frame, Fri- Fri)... I informed the woman about the previous mistakes, she said we should have called them that day. Okay, fair enough...

The delivery took over an hour. Not to mention,  the delivery guy in the black Lexus wasn't friendly and had an attitude like WE were the ones who were late.

The pizza was wrong and the breadsticks were burnt.
I called the restaurant,  explained what was wrong with the order. Mind you,  the children had been waiting over an hour to eat, so they had already taken a couple of slices from the pizza... the woman said the chef said the bread was fine. Really?  Because I offered to text them photos of the black bread we received!! She then said she would replace the pizza ONLY IF NONE OF THE SLICES WERE TOUCHED & IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER HOUR (putting us past 7 pm, when we ordered before 5 pm) After explaining our situation, she spoke with the manager and came back to say she could offer a $2 credit off our next order. 

I said that was unacceptable. I spent over $120 with their business in the past week. She said the manager would call me back... I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL.

NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY NO LONGER RECEIVE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN $500/MO EASILY.
