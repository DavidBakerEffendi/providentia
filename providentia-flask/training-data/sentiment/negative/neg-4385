Today we was sitting outside the parking lot of Denny s before leaving we heard a dog barking in a car. I got out to look around there was a grey car with nevada license plates parked in front of dennys that had a pet carrier inside. The car was shut off It was 95 degrees outside nobody was in the car. Temps get up to 120 in the car at this degree.  I waited 10 minutes finally the owners came out and left. I spoke to the Dennys manager he was wearing a dark shirt with blue grey stripes and black glasses. I was expressing my concern sayings its too hot to leave animals in the car in this heat. The manager said the lady visits Denny s often and she leaves her dog in the car all the time people always complain. It seemed like he didn't want to hear my complaint and wanted me to go away. Maybe someone should investigate the lady. My question is why hasn't the manager done anything about peoples complaints has he ever called the cops?? They shouldn't be sitting in the Denny s eating with their dog locked in the car. Any animal or human can die in the heat of a car.
