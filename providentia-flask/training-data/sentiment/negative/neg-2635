This place used to be the spot for a cheap breakfast. Good service, good food, place was one of Cleveland's best kept secrets. Moving back into the area I was so excited to be able to start having breakfast here again. So you're probably wondering why the one star. It breaks my heart this place has went so far down hill. This place it worse than a dive. I mean, food wise it's still amazing and the staff is still amazing and pleasant. However, I can't knowingly bring my kids into a restaurant that is falling apart. While my kids were playing on snap chat a friend of mine messaged me and inquired why my kitchen had caught fire. As I looked at the ceiling while eating I immediately felt disgusted. Alarms started going off in my head, my sons asthma and my daughters allergies. I had this great urge to grab my babies and run screaming from the building. I kept my composure took some pictures and we paid the bill and got up to leave. Going out the back entrance my 6 year old needed to use the restroom, going into the ladies room I let her do her business when she screamed she was falling. Going into the stall thinking she's being dramatic, the floor around the toilet was caving in. Even her sitting on the toilet caused it to push into the floor which scared her. If you can handle the pictures that I'm providing then this place has amazing food, But I won't be returning until renovations are made to this place. I get Cleveland has historic buildings but I think this is a little far fetched to accept.
