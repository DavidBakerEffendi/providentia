If I can give. Them a negative star I would...I for one will not be going back to this place ever again...they did not get my order right not once not twice I had to return it 2x and they had to make it the 3rd time...I asked for something simple...Jenni pho with no mint or cilantro...they brought it with both I ask them to take it out and they literally picked it out of the same bowl in the back...and still had some cilantro in it...I asked them for extra fish sauce for my wife's vermecelli they brought it to us like 10 mins after I asked for it...OK this little things I can deal with...I just deal with people trying to scam other people though...we had a party of 5...they automatically charged us 15% gratuity...when that girl brought over our check I gave her my card and she asked if I would like to put my tip on the card and I said sure...they gave me a choice on how much percent I would like to give...I put in 12 cuz I was not happy with how they handled my food and my experience...she gave me receipt and I took a look it didn't seem right so I asked her for a detail receipt of our order...she said well I already closed it and gave me an attitude...rolling her eyes and trying to get my receipt...when she printed it out...I noticed that they charge me for everything..milk tea no ice 50 cent extra on both our milk teas...she didn't mention what size we wanted and she didn't tell us that having no ice was 50 cent extra? When the hell did have less of something cost more...OK on that portion it said in small as print that no ice is 50 cent extra so OK our mistake...but still that is really terrible how she didn't give us that kind of courtesy to let us know...another thing was that they charged us 15 % gratuity on our meal and she asked his if I wanted to put my tip on the card...they already charged me and she did not mention that smit was already on the bill she just wanted me to tip her more lol for what bringing my order wrong and coming by what never to check to see if we needed anything? So I asked her u guys already charged us for 15 % gratuity and she was like yea I asked if u would like to put additional tip on ur card like it was suppose to be normal....us she serious? After we got charge 15% for a party of 5 and being waited on with such poor service she expects more tip? I did the math and total we tipped almost 27 %...she was like well I can't do anything about returning the money on ur card but I can give it to u cash...I was like do u really think I'm worried about the extra 12 dollars I tipped u? I wanted was her give us some sort of heads up with the bill and tip...didn't apologize or nothing till she was hesitant about giving us our money back...I said u keep it but u know what I will never be returning ever again...y I'm writing this review and y I am being so upset and pissed off at this is because I was there with some visitors from a different country...and they had a hard time understanding y they were charged so much when we didn't order much...imagine how many ppl that they have took advantage of with methods like this...what is very disappointing i can only imagine for those that live here and visit places like this they get taken advantage of especially those that speak a little broken English and have a difficult time with English as well...it's just so damn terrible...this place is definitely and will forever be on my crap list for sure...I will not be going back will make sure all my friends know of this...just so dang terrible
