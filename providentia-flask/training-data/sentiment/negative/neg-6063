There was 6 different customers  in the building and it LITERALLY took 30mins for the food to be ready ... but get this ... EVERYONES food was incorrectly prepared !! Items were missing , or not the right order .. OMG What a Circus !  And it's all thanks to the cooks not paying attention to the orders and more focused on there personal conversation !  This was my first time here .. and what an experience  NEVER AGAIN !!
