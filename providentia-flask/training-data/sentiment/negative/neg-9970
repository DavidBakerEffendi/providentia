Hate to give a bad review but I also hate to spend money on food that immediately goes into the garbage can. I ordered the food for delivery. When I asked the man on the other line taking my order what the difference between the regular fries and the Greek fries was he replied "The Greek fries have greek stuff on them".   I wasn't sure if he meant gyro meat or cucumber yogurt. It was neither. When the food arrived it was an hour and a half later ( I was told 45 min max ).   The chicken on the sandwich was fried although the menu said it was grilled and the bun was burned so badly! The fries were cold and soggy and topped with what looked like a white cheese and oregano. I honestly have to say that it was the worst. There is not one good thing I could say about my experience with any of it.
