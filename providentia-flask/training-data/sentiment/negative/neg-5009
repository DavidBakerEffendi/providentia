The atmosphere is great and is likely the thing saving this place. The server was nice and did well, but definitely over worked as it was packed. The food was terrible... chicken wings split in half and our entrees were cold when we got them with no flavor. When talking with a manager we just received excuses... no the food was not worth $15 ea. Oh, and they ran out of silverware so it was tricky to cut with plastic silverware. They do serve a mean corona light, though. Hoping this is just early opening issues, may try again in half a year if they are still open. On a positive note, Santa showed up!
