This place is a scam. There is a deal on Wednesday which is 59 cents wings minimum order is 9wings. However, they made up a rule that 2 people 2 drinks are mandatory which is bullcrap! and the customer service is really bad. the waitress gave us our wings and left us there with no fork and plate. how the hell do you expect us to eat wings with no fork and plate? It took her at least 5 minutes to see us waiving our hands and there is very little customers in the restaurant. WILL NEVER GO AGAIN!!!
