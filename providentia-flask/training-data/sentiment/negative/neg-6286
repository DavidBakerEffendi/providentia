If there was only a 0 star out of 5... The food was mediocre. The service was scary bad. They were rude to us and they were rude to other customers, except with their regular customers. We witnessed the servers arguing with a customer while waiting for our food, as they in the end, refused to serve them. Last thing, they are dirty: The cook grabbed dishes from under the counter and saw crusty things on the plate. Guess what he did... scraped that off with his finger (at least with a glove on!) and plated my sandwich on it. WOW. My friends and I are never returning to Rifca again.
