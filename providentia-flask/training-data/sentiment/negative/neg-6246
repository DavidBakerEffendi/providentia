Insanely slow service. 45 minutes and counting for one burrito. That's all I ordered, just a burrito. Doesn't matter how tasty it is, there's no excuse for waiting this long. With how many good Mexican places there are nearby, I'll never come back here.

Edit: got the burrito after 50 minutes. It was ok. Not worth a 15 minute wait, much less 50.
