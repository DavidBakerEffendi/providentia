I'm torn...what to say about Shitbay..well guess I'm not too torn..okay my wife and I went here 6 month back and the need to review my experience has been haunting me since then. I'll make this short and sweet..The food was wonderful but..big but..my wife is not a sushi eater, she went with me for me..we ordered the large course dinner..at one point, we received some sushi and my wife asked the waitress for some soy and wasabi..now granted this is a gourmet restaurant...but still when one is paying hundreds of dollars for food they should get what they want?? So the server,bless her heart, went to ask the chef( and looked worried I might add) for these items..we were sitting at the bar..The chef looks at her and said "no way"..then looks at my wife and yells "NO WAY!" Then turns away..glad there were no samurai swords on the wall!!! My wife started crying (more from embarrassmentI immediately got up had a word with the manager and he replied "sorry that's just the way he is!" Worst dining experience of my life!
