This will be the first and last time I order pizza from Papa Johns... We just moved to our new home and this is the location that is closest to us... Ordered pizza at 8:21 pm online, and even called location for delivery confirmation... Said our pizza would be delivered in 45 mins or less... An hour and a half later, I called and spoke to their manager (Malcom) Answered the phone very rudely... Rudely told me that my pizza has been sitting there for over an hour, Rudely told me that he could make us another pizza, Then rudely told me that they only have one driver... VERY UNACCEPTABLE!!! No customer service WHATSOEVER!!! If I could give them no stars I would... Corporate office notified... WILL NEVER ORDER HERE AGAIN!!!
