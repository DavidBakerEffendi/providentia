Service is extremely poor. Waited over 10 minutes and never was asked what we wanted to drink. There were four other tables waiting ahead of us without drink orders. We left and nobody stopped to ask why. The cashiers just stood there and watched people leave. If you have no place to be this is the place for you.  I won't be going back to this particular restaurant.
