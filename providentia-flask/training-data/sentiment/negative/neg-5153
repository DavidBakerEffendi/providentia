This place was horrible just for myself was $23.12! You would think our drinks would be included with the buffet but they charge that separate! I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant/buffet ever. The food wasn't as good and our waitress barely came over to refill our drinks. They put their own gratuities in the receipt we don't get to decide how much of a gratuity we want to give them.
