The experience I've had here was one of the worst. I ordered an extra large mocha and after about ten minutes of sitting down, I realized no one was even preparing my drink. I went up and waited until an employee asked if I was waiting on something, and was appalled when I found out they forgot my order. It was prepared much faster than how long I waited and when I finally received the drink, it was a large, not an extra large! I was very disappointed and  although the restaurant itself offers decent food and drinks, I wouldn't recommend it because the service has been cut short. Who forgets their customers orders- especially as something as simple as a drink!?
