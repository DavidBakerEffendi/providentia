We were desperate to find a place to eat at 10:30 at night...  

Location - Off Mills Avenue near all the bars.
Price - A bit pricey for being in college town.
Clientele - Mainly college kids, young.
Service - Shitty and rude.  
Decor - Three or four bar tables and seating against the wall. One tv on ESPN.  Menu on chalkboard and tons of pizza that were already baked and ready to serve.
Food - Awful.  Thin slices weren't crispy, thick crust was on foccacia bread.  Cheese didn't string out. Decent amount of toppings on each slice. Pizza just sat in my stomach although I generally eat this late and don't have this problem.
