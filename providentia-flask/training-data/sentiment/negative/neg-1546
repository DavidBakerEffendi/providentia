Update: So apparently now this restaurant is in the business of gaslighting it's customers if they're unhappy - it's obviously very convenient to cite CCTV footage when all that footage provides you with is two people having a conversation, not the contents of the conversation. We now have a "he said she said" situation. 

More than anything, I'm outraged that the manager claimed that I was trying to get a free meal and refused to pay. I will gladly show anyone my bank statement with this restaurant's name and the amount that I paid if they ask. Do not call me a thief. I was never offered a replacement meal, and I only asked to take the meal home after I had given up arguing with the manager about being unhappy with my food because I still had to pay for it. The dish was untouched because again, I didn't enjoy it. 

Lastly, don't think you are fooling someone by saying you are merely some new establishment. I do not appreciate false allegations charged against me. I vividly remember the chain of events as I hadn't experienced anything like it at a restaurant. And yes, my friend did enjoy her green curry! Kudos to you for making a customer happy. That's your job. I will remind you that if she was so inclined to send it back due to moral outrage, you would probably have started arguing with her too.
