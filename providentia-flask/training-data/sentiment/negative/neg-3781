Not worth it at all! Bellagio is one of the nicer hotels/casinos on the strip so we expected much more, especially with the price they charge. Food was mediocre. Many selections flavorless and the display was very confusing. But before we could even get into the buffet, there was a situation we witnessed that completely ruined our mood. The line for non members was very long, normal considering it was Labor Day weekend. We had a member in our group but his status wasn't high enough so we waited in the non members line with all the other honest people. When we finally reached the front, these two women in the members line next to us were told that their status was not high enough for that line. The ladies did not seem shocked at all, which tells me they do this often. They asked the worker to be let in just this once, and our surprise, the worker agreed! Completely unfair for the rest of the good people waiting. They should've been told to get in the back of the non members line, along with everyone else who waited. Children, families, older adults, all hungry and patiently waiting. Yet they allowed these two women to be let in and cut everyone else. We decided not to say anything since we didn't want to cause a scene and they were behind us anyway. But then we were smacked with another annoying surprise. They were actually called in and seated before us, all because we had a stroller and they didn't. Unfair system, flavorless food, high price. We want our hard earned money back!
