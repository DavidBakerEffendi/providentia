Oh Bellagio what has become of the once great buffet in your heyday? I miss you,  so very much. I bragged about you for years to my man only to be sorely disappointed when we finally made it. I had the cocktail shrimp that had some nasty mush consistency that were almost as water logged as Atlantis. It was obviously due to the presentation in melted crushed ice but why sacrifice the shrimp? Why? Don't even get me started on the mini dry burgers, pathetic sushi or "pizza"ish. The lamb was ok or maybe I just was beaten down by my previous mentioned choices. The antipasto bar with olive bread & brie while good just wasn't enough to sustain me for the cost. Very disappointed & won't be back. Can you say Hello Wicked Spoon? I can & wasn't disappointed or sorry for visiting you my new friend. Good bye Bellagio Buffet you'll always be my first buffet love.
