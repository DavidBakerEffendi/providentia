It doesn't matter when you come (I've been at all times) or if a game is on or not (I've seen every sport here) the service is awful. Management and ownership should be ashamed of the service they are putting out. Every server bar or table had other issues, lots of attitude and seam to want to be anywhere else other than serving you. I've never written a review like this and I am a hospitality GM but this place needs a complete house cleaning and attitude check. If this wasn't right by work and conscientious to catch the beginning of games I would never come here again. But if by chance you know an employee rest assured you will be taken care of but your the only ones. In short drive somewhere else!
