This restaurant is terrible. My boyfriend and I LOVE sushi; we're both from LA so we've had extensive experience with it. We had the Boston Roll and the spicy sushi on top looked like mushed hamburger meat. I am not exaggerating in the least. It was by far the WORST sushi roll I have ever tried. We also had the Crunchy Eel Roll, which seemed like it was a reheated roll since it was tough to chew. I honestly cannot believe it has four stars. I know it's Arizona, but there are actually decent sushi restaurants out here. This is NOT one of them.
