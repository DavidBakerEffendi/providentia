I will not be coming back to this establishment until MGM Resorts revises their parking fiasco.  While the buffet was worth the drive to the strip, there are similar if not better buffets on the strip that do not charge for parking.   If you're going to pay those prices, you might as well get the premium buffet experience.

For the former price, this buffet was great, but add on parking fees, and it is NOT worth it!  I will not be back, I will not be bringing visitors, I will not be recommending this place to anyone.
