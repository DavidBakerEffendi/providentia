AVOID AVOID AVOID

Seriously.... hate the downtown location too. Thought maybe a different location would mean different quality. NOPE
Ordered takeout from skip the dishes and 17th ave location.
They didn't even send soy sauce, Wasabi, or ginger...even tho I paid for extra ginger.
Both special requests were ignored (no seaweed in soup, no fish eggs on roll)
All food soggy and slimy (even tho it was delivered in a timely manner)

Then when I called to have the things missed sent along, I was dealt with in a very unhelpful and dismissive manner.

WILL NEVER ORDER FROM ANY LOCATION EVER. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DISAPPOINTMENT. 

GROSS
