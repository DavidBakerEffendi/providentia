I've been here enough times to know two things: the food is good and the service is borderline terrible.  

I was here most recently with my boyfriend for a late lunch (3pm).  The problem?  Nobody ever came to offer us anything to eat.  The "server", who was clearly checked out and just waiting until 4pm until he could really "check out", gave us our order of drinks and then never, ever, ever returned.  

My boyfriend and I are both in the service industry, we both understand there is a "down time" (from 2:30ish till 4:00ish) where it's quiet and the kitchen is switching to dinner service and there aren't many (if any) customers in the place.  That's all the MORE reason to pay extra attention to the people that ARE in your place.  In this case, it was just us.  Our server came, told us there were no apps available because the kitchen was changing over (no problem), took our drink orders, and then just ceased to exist until he could check out at 4.  Leaving us, two VERY hungry people, waiting at a table for an hour.  Honestly, it's this kind of experience that will turn someone off a place forever and that's while we will never go back to Vintage 95, despite what we know to be a good menu.  

Go only if you've got loads of time to waste and when you're barely starting to get hungry.  If you go when you're hungry, it's already too late.
