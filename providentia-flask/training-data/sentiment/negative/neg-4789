I eat there rarely but many people from my office frequent there. A few months ago a coworker had a bug, alive, in her salad! While it is gross, I assumed, things happen, it's fresh ingredients and it was months ago... I just got my salad, BUG! It was dead but still disgusting!! I'm sick to my stomach. Yuk! 
The people who work there are polite and the front always looks clean but I'm never going back.
