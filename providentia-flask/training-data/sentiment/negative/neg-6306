Very disappointed. Walked in 9:06 pm, they are supposed to close 10 pm. Hostess informed us that since it was a slow evening, they decided to close earlier. I had read the reviews here, and I was excited to try this restaurant out. I have never ever been to a restaurant that decides to close almost an hour before the time they are supposed to close. Very disrespectful. I will never be back!!
