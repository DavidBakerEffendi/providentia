I was at a slot machine.  I got the service button to use freeplay.  The slot attendant refused to do it and told me to go to the desk.  I just had knee surgery! The slot attendant came to 2 slot machines right next to me and ignored me for 20 minutes before he came over and decided to be lazy.  Ive been waiting 35 minutes for a drink as well.  As a gold member i would expect better service.  This is ridiculous.  Definitely will think twice before coming to the Venetian!
