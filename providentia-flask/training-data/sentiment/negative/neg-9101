I ordered a super burrito with carne asada and chips and guacamole. I paid almost $15 for the meal which seemed very high after seeing what I got. The chips weren't anything to write home about and the guacamole was in a small cup. It was no where near worth paying the $5.25 for the side order. As for the burrito. I thought it tasted ok, that is until I discovered a HAIR in the burrito. It was actually wrapped up in within the burrito itself so I knew it could not be mine. That ruined the meal for me and I couldn't finish either the burrito or chips and guacamole. 

Being new to Las Vegas, my first experience with Mexican food was a complete disaster. I will NOT be returning to pepe's and if you would like to finish your meal without regrets like this I would suggest you go somewhere else. Taco is reasonable and you at least expect to eat crap there.
