I wish I could highly reccomend but this restaurant did not give me the chance!!! What a piece of shit ppl. They called we had reservations at 9pm they close at 10 lo and behold they called me at 9 and we told them we were running late be there soon they still had the audacity to say once we spent money on a cab to get there that they were closed to my face... i had all intentions of going all out because it is my birthday and lastnight in vegas. So terribly upset. I had garbage salad 7 years ago on the strip and never had it since so disappointed!!!
