Sorry Chino Bandido or should I say Chino Bad-Dido....I appreciate the concept - Chinese & Mexican food - I get haha - ha ... er well maybe I don't.  Maybe I'm being too harsh, don't get me wrong, I enjoy fusion dishes, but when you put my fried rice next to my refried beans and call it good; we have problems.  The decor? Well it's a warehouse that has fold-up tables and chairs all around.  What were they manufacturing?  Something they call Chinese-Mexican food, and you just happen to have your mouth open so enjoy!  I give it one star cause I like their mascot Mexican Panda!
