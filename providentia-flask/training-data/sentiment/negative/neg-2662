Went to watch game 7 we had a party of 7 and the rules about how long we could stay continued to change first it was as long as we kept ordering we could stay. That was fine then it changed to everyone must order 2 things every hour !!! How our server only came by every 2 hours lol anyway the food is extremely over priced. $14 for 6 wings smh! Food was ok drinks were not strong. And our server was not educated on the menu.
