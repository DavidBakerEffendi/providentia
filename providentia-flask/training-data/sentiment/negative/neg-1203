I have given this restaurant FOUR tries and they have failed every time.  Today was the last time I even attempt to patronize their restaurant.  Their food is not that good, and their service is ABYSMAL.

We arrived shortly after they opened for lunch.  There was a single party of five in the restaurant.  While we waited for even a drink order to be taken, the other party was served by all three people working (couldn't spare one for us?), AND another party came in and got their order taken.

Repeatedly they walked by us, and ignored us.  We waited 10 minutes then left.  Each of my four experiences there have been like this.  I will never return.  I really hope the owners read this.  They were there today and completely ignored us.
