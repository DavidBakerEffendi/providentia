I got food poisoning here 4 days ago from a Frisco Melt combo. I was in my own personal hell for 2 full days. Missed work = lost money but worse than that I puked so much I think I may have lost a few vital organs in the process. Don't know if I will ever go to another Steak n Shake in my life but if I do it certainly won't be this one. Note to staff: Wash your effing hands!
