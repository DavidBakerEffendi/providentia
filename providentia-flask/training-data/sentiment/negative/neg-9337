So we loved this place by haven't been there In awhile specifically because they are high dollar and little portions. However once in awhile we just go forming cause there lemongrass chicken was the bomb. But that is not the case now. We went there tonight and the bowl they put the chicken in had half the portion size from before and was cooked not so good. Ended up having to send it back and get something else. Was not the quality it once was that deemed it worthy of its high dollar low portion status. Sorry. Won't be going back.
