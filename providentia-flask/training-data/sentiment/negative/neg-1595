I've been wanting to try this for almost a year, since I first heard of it. It good good ratings and reviews. So instead of Cheesecake factory I convinced my wife to go here instead. Wish I hadn't! Only thing good was chips and salsa served before the meal. If you like bland, tasteless, flavor deficient, Americanized Mexican food you'll probably like this food. I however can count at least 5 maybe 6 Mexican food restaurants around Charlotte better than this place. (Verde, Vida, El Paraiso, Que Onda, Pio Pio, On The Border) Besides the flavor deficient food, the furnishings were old and dirty, whole place needs a good cleaning. Waitress didn't listen to my order very well, and brought me something I didn't order. So that was a wasted $50. Never again will they get my money. I was sadly disappointed!
