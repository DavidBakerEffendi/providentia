The food was mediocre at best. I was really expecting to be wow'd by everything since we've been to other restaurants that are a part of this chain. I paid $12 for two small wedges of cheese. We got the butcher board as well. I almost chipped my tooth on an olive seed that got mixed in with the pistachios. No bueno. Definitely not going back.
