This place is disgusting!!! We've been here twice. The first time I found a hair in my kale salad today we decided to give it another try and found a long brown hair today in my chicken Cobb salad? When we told the waitress she said she would take off the salad off the bill and didn't seem at all phased by it. They must get this complaint a lot. Done with this place. They need to invest in hairnets!!! Even if they did we're never going back!!!
