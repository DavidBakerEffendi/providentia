Can't comment on the food because we never even came close to getting seated properly. Advice for others seeking weekend brunch here- make a reservation or else be prepared to wait an eternity. Friend and I came at 12 noon today (Saturday) and tbh it wasn't super busy inside, but I guess they were short staff since we were left to wait by the door for almost 30 mins before we became too hungry and made an executive decision to leave. Two people who came in after us left after being told the wait was going to be at least 40 mins. Funny thing is that for the longest time my friend and I were the only two people waiting "in line". 

Better luck next time, hopefully they're faster.
