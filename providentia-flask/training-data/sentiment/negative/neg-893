It all started as a childhood memory of going with my dad at a very young age to his landscaping customers, and the day ending mid afternoon and going to lunch here. Perhaps as a child...burger, hot dog, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese are the four main food groups and my expectations were ketchup and more ketchup on whatever it was. Took my girlfriend their after reminiscing old memories, talk about a bombshell.  Don't look up the ceiling is 30 years old and you know it....so gross. Ordered a classic burger. One word....terrible. For God's sake give the cook a salt and pepper shaker at a bare minimum. I'm not sure who said it was okay to flat top cook frozen meat --- no marinade no seasoning no mix in to the meat....just plain boring meat....and label it 'world's greatest'....they should be taken in the street and beaten.  Save your hard earned dolla dolla bills and go to Lenny's a few miles down the road where the won't serve you a basket of disappointment and a side of boring. So lame I couldn't bring myself to waste the effort on a pic.
