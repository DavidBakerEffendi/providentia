Love the name! We have tried this place several times because we love the name. Unfortunately, the name is not enough. The service is terrible. If you like more then one glass of tea or a second cup of coffee do not eat here. Each visit has been the same no refills unless you chase them down and beg for another cup. The food is adequate not worth the bad service. The hostess walks around with her cell phone in hand and decides to help expedite food with her long red hair hanging in the food. My advice is there are too many good breakfast places don't waste your time here.
