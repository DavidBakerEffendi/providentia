Update. Tonight the owner of this place saw my hubby and I at a Thai place and remembered us apparently. Thought it was funny after 8 months she recalled my bad review even called it entertaining. And paid our bill for dinner and added 10 straws. Guess she misses us!!!!!   Thanks for the dinner Rebecca. 


until today I would of given this place 3 to 4 stars, I liked that it was a local business. My husband and I went to this spot once a week for almost a year now, even made this the place to go to start my 40th birthday. despite having to send my food back once and getting the wrong drink once or twice I came back and chalked that up to basic mistakes.

Today the owner came out of left field on me using 2 straws and that it was costing her a lot of money and as a business owner I should respect her and only use 1 straw. my hubby even joked ok we will go to Dunkin Donuts then and she said you should. At first I thought she was kidding, but she wasnt. 

Really you would rather loose 2 loyal customers who come to you and have recommended you to others over 2 extra straws per week? if that hits your bottom line.. 

I am totally schocked at this and will NEVER go back now. 

Too bad Iove supporting local companies and such but apparently you would rather have the 2 cents than the 20 to 40 we spend there a week plus tipping your staff.
