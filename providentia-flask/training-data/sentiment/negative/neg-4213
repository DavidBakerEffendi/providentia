I am so disappointed in my experience with madhouse. The owner reached out to me after I made a past complaint about a bad employee who gave herself a tip on my debit card without my authorization (the employee asked me if I wanted to tip, I said no because she'd already been rude, then she gave herself a tip anyways). The owner asked for my address because she wanted to send a gift card as apology, but I never received anything. I never cared about the gift card itself.. What I cared about was that she offered something with no intent of following through. I contacted her about it and my contact was completely ignored. Once a very regular customer who highly recommended this spot to all my friends... I now have refused to give them my business or anyone I knows business for several months now due to sloppy management and customer service.
