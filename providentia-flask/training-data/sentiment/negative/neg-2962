2 & 1/2 stars? It's no wonder! I was so excited that this Panera was opening up on our sis eod town, with a drive thru!! But I won't go here again. This is NOT what you expect your typical Paneras to be like. I went through the drive thru and the guy was SUPER friendly and prompt. However when I got home, I found my order was completely wrong. The ticket was right, but the only thing I actually got was my drink. I ordered a Soba bowl, a quinoa bowl, a kids grilled cheese and kids chicken noodle soup. I got French onion soup, some kind of salad, a pathetic panini and mac n cheese. Not. Even. Close. I was very specific on my order too because my son has food allergies and I spent time before I came to make sure what he had was ok for him. I called as soon as I got home and realized their error. The manager offered delivery but by the time they would get there I asked just to refund. I gave her the EXACT card number I used not more than 5 minutes earlier. She kept running it and said it was declined that it wouldnt take the refund........seriously?!?!? She ended up refunding it to another card of mine. Seems a very odd way to do it. I couldn't believe the manager I was talking to WAS THE MANAGER??? Her attitude was awful, especially when she kept saying "yup" with an attitude. She supposedly finally got the refund to go on my other card, we'll see if it actually comes in. Never again! Don't bother going to this Panera, you will be greatly disappointed!!
