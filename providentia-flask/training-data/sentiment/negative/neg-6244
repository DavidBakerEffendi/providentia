They made a lot of mistakes with our food order and they put music super loud that you practically have to scream to talk with your group on the table. Ordered 4 catfish and they only give 3. Ordered steak with shrimps and they give the steak without the shrimps. Ordered side of corn and no corn. Ordered plain steak without any topping and the steak comw out with mushrooms topping. Ordered sweet tea and I end up have to put sugars myself. The service super suck and they make a lot of mistakes on all of our orders. Maybe the servers are high on weed or something.
