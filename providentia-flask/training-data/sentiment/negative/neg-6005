THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!!

You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food. 

What I tried...

Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.  

Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?

Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.

Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown. 

If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.  

This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.
