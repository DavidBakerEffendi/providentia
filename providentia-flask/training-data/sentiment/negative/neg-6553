I was looking for ideas for my husband for his birthday. He had mentioned before that he was interested in a cruise ship dinner. I looked online at their menu and didn't see anything really vegetarian friendly. I called to ask and they said "Yes, we do have vegetarian dishes online, we have salad, pasta, potatoes and vegetables". So I said "So, the sides?". They said yes and they have fish. Okay, I'm not going to pay $50 each so that my husband can go eat side dishes for his birthday. 1. Fish does not equal vegetarian and 2. Vegetarians eat more than lettuce and and veggies...
