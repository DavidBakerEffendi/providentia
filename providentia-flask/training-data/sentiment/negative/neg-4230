Its location refused to honor a two-for-one coupon I have from the Entertainment Book. They said they have never subscribed to this program even though I have used one in the past without any trouble. I have a coupon in my hand which I showed a picture of and even showed on the mobile site that they do under it. This location will not get any business turn away customers especially after I had them cook it already before they ask for payment. Very disappointed as I thought I was even lied to from the employee who told me they did not honor the coupon as I know for sure I have used it before. Customer service does go a long way. This location really doesn't care
