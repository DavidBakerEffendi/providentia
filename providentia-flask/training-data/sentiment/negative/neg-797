One star? Yes. 

The last time I was at this Black Bear location (3/16/10) with my boyfriend and my mom was one time I wish we'd just turned around and walked out. 

Let me back up a bit, a week or so before this last Black Bear visit of our's, my boyfriend and I had stopped in for lunch and were waited on by a heavy set guy with glasses. He took our order and dropped of our food when it was done. That was the last we saw of him. He never refilled our glasses even when we'd asked once for a refill of tea and just generally seemed moody that day. We left a less than spectacular tip for the less than spectacular service. Well, this must have really pissed him off or something because he took one look at us when we stopped in with my mom and I could tell he remembered us. 

I heard one of the waitresses ask if he "wanted" us and he looked us up and down before giving a huffy, "Uhm. No." We were now waited on by a young lady who didn't smile once. This may have had something to do with the previous waiter who kept giving us stares the whole time we were seated in her section, but whatever. It was lousy service that night and we won't be back for a long time. Its a shame too because when we've had some of the other waitresses (one or two of the older ladies) the experience has been nothing but pleasant. 

Maybe next time we'll just try a different location.
