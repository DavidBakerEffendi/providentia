I hate Demetres with a fiery passion usually reserved for things that actually matter, not opinions on restaurants. Unfortunately, I have friends that inexplicably love this place and so I am back time and time again...

Here's a list of terrible things about Demetres:
- The place is way too small and always packed. There is often a line-up outside the door and they have NO system to manage this. None. No hostess, no hostess desk, no pagers, no pen and paper, they rarely acknowledge you, it is incredibly confusing to know who's next, the wait time, etc. And all staff always seem flustered that they are this busy as if it's never happened before. How can a place so consistently busy not invest in ONE hostess to manage this?
- The service in general is just bad. Tables are rarely served their desserts at the same time and there is often a long gap between the first and last person at your table getting their plate. When you're dealing so often in ice cream, this can be a problem
- The pricing is absurd. Their portions may be big but they're uneccessarily big for the average person and it's not exactly something you can get a doggy bag for. Also, I don't even fully understand the concept. These desserts are so big that it would be impossible to have any sort of dinner and visit Demetres at some point in the same evening. But back to the price. I've worked in restaurants with incredible dessert chefs who worked at Buckingham Palace. Their desserts were roughly the same price as these. Except those were expertly crafted and designed and these consist of various boring staples (waffles, crepes, sundaes, etc.) loaded with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.

In conclusion, Demetres is everything that is wrong with Brampton cuisine as a whole wrapped into a crepe and then drowned with caramel brownie fudge.
