It's not common for me to dole out one star, since most places have something that redeems itself.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case for this location.  This was my third visit and the second one for my husband since we moved out to Mesa, and each time was abysmal for several reasons.

First, the food quality is terrible.  The first time, their fries were so cold that they were hard and inedible, and the burger wasn't made properly.  They left off a condiment.  I thought perhaps it was a fluke, since Rally's foods is usually good, but the second and third time was more of the same.

Second, they are the slowest fast-food joint I've been too in a long time.  They ask you to hold while you're at the speaker -- even though no one's in drive-thru.  They take forever to come to the window when you finally pull up after having ordered.  And they take forever to bring your food.  

Third, their service is shoddy.  The guys here just don't care.  Every time I felt like I was talking to robots.  Considering minimum wage in Arizona is damn near $11 per hour, they can't claim that it's because they're underpaid.  These guys just don't care.  Period.

Foiurth, their parking lot and surrounding area are just dirty and unkempt, with visible litter and debris.

Checker's, what they're called in the South, was my go-to place because of their stone-groove-winner fries and fresh food.  The Mesa location has ensured that Chick-Fil-A will be my soul fast-food discretion.
