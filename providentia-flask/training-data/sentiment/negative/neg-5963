Our hotel recommended this place. We wanted somewhere nice with atmosphere to celebrate my birthday.  We made reservations.  This restaraunt has great open windows and an outdoor seating area overlooking the river. However, reservations are worthless and they will seat you in the worst seats of the place. Making reservations is pointless and so Im giving 2 stars since it was a main reason I chose this place. I had no intention of sitting and making my child wait at a restaraunt, so we made reservations. Waits are one thing. Waits with reservations shouldn't be more then 10 minutes in my world. We haven't tried the food yet, but may have to give up sooner than later on the restaraunt. I'll update to a 3 star if the food makes up for the 2 stars.

When we finally sat down they are out of items on the menu. They don't have small child size options except cheese pizza.  Why would I go to a nice restaurant for pizza? Let me add that this isn't a pizza restaraunt. They have a shrimp appetizer but it's served only partially cooked. And I waitress was rude, unaccomadating with bad attidue. A restarauny of this scale should be able to provide a dish where they cook the shrimp done by request. And an attitude at any price is never necessary .
