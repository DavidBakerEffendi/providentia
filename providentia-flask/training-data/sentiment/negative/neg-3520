Disappointed, we took a chance and went with pork on a fork for dinner, nearly an hour before closing, and we called ahead for our order. The order ended up being cold, we didn't even end up with the meats we selected (our surprise not knowing this until we had already been home) and on top of that all the food was pretty much the leftovers of the day, I know it's an hour before closing but it's no excuse for poor food and service, the Mac and cheese is what held me on with my bad experience last time but even that was awful this go round I'm truly disappointed :(
