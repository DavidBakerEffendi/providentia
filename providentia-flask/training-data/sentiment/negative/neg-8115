Drive through experience was a nightmare!  Order a big Mac meal. I ordered a meal and was asked if I wanted medium or large. I told them I wanted medium fries and large drink. I was told I couldn't do that. Even though I was told that the cost of the medium and large drinks were the same price, I couldn't do it. Thought I was being "punked". In order to get a large drink I had to order my meal large and get large fries. The attendant was rude and sarcastic. I backed out of the drive through to leave, but not before he tells me "see you tomorrow morning". I don't know where that came from?

I have placed this type of request at three other McDonald's before, along with this restaurant too. Each one has given me the order the way I wanted it.  I called to speak to the manager - he was useless. He said that was policy.
