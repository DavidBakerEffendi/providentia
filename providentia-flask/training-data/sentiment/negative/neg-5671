Awful experience here tonight.  Long wait for mediocre food at best.  The tea tasted like dishwater.  I've been to other Chili's locations and had excellent service and food.  My husband ordered ribs which are an up charge and was given 4 ribs.  My fajitas were burnt and bland.  The manager couldn't even be bothered to come over to our table when we asked multiple times for him to do so.  Save your money and eat elsewhere!
