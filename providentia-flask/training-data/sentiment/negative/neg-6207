I have gone here a few times before and the food was OK I mean it's chipotle. But I went yesterday and I seem to have food poisoning a few short hours after eating a steak burrito with dairy (cheese sour cream). This is the first time of the 5-6 times I have been here, but wouldn't return after this unpleasant ordeal. My friends who had chicken/steak bowls also felt unwell after eating here for dinner.
