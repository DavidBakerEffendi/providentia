I was pretty stoked that a Wahoo's restaurant opened up near me. Some friends really hyped it up. Unfortunately, my order of cajun fish tacos came super late and the fish was very dry and bland. It was not an anomaly because both of my friends' fish dishes were dry as well. Did I expect too much out of this place? Not too excited about coming back and trying their other dishes. I mean, they're called Wahoo's FISH tacos. If they can't do fish right, why bother?

UPDATE: Went back and tried the carne asada beef. It was gray in color and bland. Seriously, not grilled - gray. After the meal, I had a stomach ache. Coincidence? I think not.
