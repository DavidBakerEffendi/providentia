The taste of the food overall is comparable to most other Chinese restaurants in the area. However, I can only give one star because of the poor experience I had with their food and service. When you expect to be chewing on veggies, but instead end up chewing on a wad of paper, I think most people would be put off by that. When we told the server that there was paper in the food, they were extremely accusatory, but eventually gave us a fresh plate of the veggie dish. 

I will note that the decor is nicer than some Chinese restaurants, but that nor the food would encourage me to return after the experience that I had.
