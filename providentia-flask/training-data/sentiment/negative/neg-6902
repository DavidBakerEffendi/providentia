When you place an order online you do it with the intention of not having to wait for it. That's the point of online ordering, to skip the line. Yet when my boyfriend arrived to pick up our order today they had not even begun to make it. This was irritating but what's even worse is they forgot our guacamole, which as we all know is by no means inexpensive. Next time, if there even is one, we will have to remember to babysit our order and check it since the employees here are clearly incapable of doing so. 

This is not the first time this has happened to us. We have been faced with the same problems numerous times at the Macedonia location but have yet again been failed by this location as well. 

Extremely disappointing.
