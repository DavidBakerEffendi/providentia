Can I give negative stars?? The shittiest food I have ever had!! All dishes has bitter after taste and it could be because they used old oil. I don't care what they used or not, but I am NEVER EVER going here even if there is a famine in Canada. I actually fried everything again at home to make it taste better...but didn't help much. Don't go ever!  Go to McDonald's or some other cheap food place instead...it will be better than this
