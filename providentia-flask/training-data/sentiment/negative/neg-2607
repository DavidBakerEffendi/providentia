Stopped in for bagels, never again. I will not be returning. Why? Over priced, bagels had zero taste, and the cream cheese was so bland. And, the employees were eating while getting my food!Very disappointed! Panera has better bagels and cream cheese. In fact if you want awesome bagels and yummy cream cheese go to Barry's Bagels in Avon! Well worth the trip.
