i literally made a yelp account specifically because i needed to write about this buffet.

i went saturday night for dinner around 8. the line wound around and it took about an hour to finally make it in. it seems to move fast- but it's deceivingly long. 

for 3 of us, i think it was about $125. 

i have only 3 criteria you need to meet when i go to a buffet:
awesome seafood (i'm allergic, but it's important for everyone else around me to enjoy it)
good mac & cheese
bomb desserts

according to my cousins, the gigantic crab legs were pretty good. and there wasn't some crazy line for it. BUT i am allergic to it, and i thought it was VERY inconsiderate for them to put it RIGHT next to strawberries. 

the mac & cheese looked so old that it formed this hard layer on top, and people tried to break through it to desperately get the softer, creamier part within. 

the meat stations had meat that was SUPER red and undercooked. i do have to say, i got these ribs. i took one bite and it literally took 2 minutes to try and chew to make it swallowable. i had to just spit it out. 

their desserts are NOTHING compared to wicked spoon. there were things like carrot cake, brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. NO chocolate covered strawberries, nothing special or original at all.

i felt for this amount of money, the hype, the length of time, the mediocre service, and the quality of food, and lack of options- they deserve only one star.
