Very disappointing. You would think that other than Paris - the place you can expect to have a good crepe would be Montreal. No such thing here. 

The sugar/butter crepe was more sugar than any other ingredient. I ate half in the hopes that it would get better - but that didn't happen. 

There were 4 people manning the shop. As 1 girl made the crepes, her friend stood next to her chomping on a sandwich right there in plain sight. Not the most appealing sight to watch her chomp, chew and chat. 

After deciding that the crepe was a lost cause altogether, I went to throw it out and mentioned to the cashier that it had way too much sugar. She looked surprised and responded with "oh really."  No offers for them to remake it. Not that I would've accepted it but still - that's the bare minimum they should've done. 

If you are looking for a"Paris Crepe" this isn't the place for you.
