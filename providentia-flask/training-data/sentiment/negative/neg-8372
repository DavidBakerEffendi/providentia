Los Gemelos was our first stop on our first visit to Madison. It was a pretty bad welcome, and is among the strangest experiences I've had in a restaurant. Here's how it went:

Drinks were ordered and brought, then the food ordering commenced.  A basket of chips hadn't been delivered, so I thought I'd double check that they were complimentary, since we ordered the guacamole that was on special.
"We don't have chips."
"Pardon?"
(Bored stare) "we don't have chips."
"You don't ever have chips or you don't have them today?"
"We just don't have chips.The guy hasn't come in to make them."
"Do you have salsa?"
"No."
"Ok, I think we might come back another time."
"You still have to pay for the sodas."

Yikes. No thanks.
