Disappointing, and the quality has droppen off.
There have been at least 3 different ownerships that I've ate at this location under. Previously, things had been great, and then quite decent. The recent is now at a point where things have fallen off, and is either at a point of not being able to survive, or simply not caring.
There was once a sign up that used to say 'we apologize for the wait, as we make everything made to order.. that sign is now gone.
Instead, you get gyros meat re-heated from a warmer/slow cooker.
However, today I was charged a different price than what was on the menu. I questioned it to the girl working there, who I realized was just a regular employee -- she seemed embarassed for her having to respond that the owner had changed the prices, but had not yet got the updated sign.
In this case, should I not be charged what is on the board until it is updated? Knowing that she wasn't the reason for it, I just asked she relay the concern to their owner.
Meat was ok. You could taste it being dried out, but I guess at this point, that shouldn't be a surprise going forward.

Edit: 4 months later. Some prices have been adjusted. Decided to get something that wasn't one of the most popular orders. Price? $1 more expensive on the till, vs what is on the menu. Is this even legal? Walked out, after seeing that. No reason to give business to an owner that doesn't care about his own store.
