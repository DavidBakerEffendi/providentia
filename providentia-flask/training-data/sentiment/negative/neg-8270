First and foremost I have been to Cantina 1511 before and the food and service has always been fantastic but today I went and had a horrible experience. I decided to stop in by myself to order some food, once I was seated and placed my order I went to the restroom to wash my hands why is it that a waitress that wasn't mine cleared my appetizer and drink from my table? She brought me out another one and said she was sorry so I let it go, but when my food came out I found debris in it, the waiter stated that he would have another plate remade for me so when the next plate came out there was a long piece of hair wedged in the meal, needless to say my appetite was destroyed and I left the restaurant, Cantina 1511 is definitely off my eating list.
