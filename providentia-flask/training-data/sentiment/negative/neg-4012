Had such high hopes when I walked in but was let down by the staff!!!! No one came to introduce themself or take my drink order until 15 minutes after I was seated and that was ONLY because I had to get up and ask the cashier why the people that were previously standing in the line behind me got taken care of first. The cashier immediately felt guilty and took my order that second. She waived my drink charge.. Of unsweetened tea when I specifically asked for sweetened tea. That was the only time I saw my waiter.. when she took my order. I sat there for about 20 minutes AFTER I was done with my food hoping that someone would come with my check but nope.. I had to get up AGAIN to ask the cashier.. I left what I owed and left a tip for the hard working sushi chefs. 

P.S: the sushi presentation was nice. Ive had better nigiri. The sex in the city was 40% cream cheese. It tasted like it was rushed out. Very disappointed. 

Don't know if I'll ever visit again
