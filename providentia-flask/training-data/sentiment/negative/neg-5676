Stumbled upon this place while starving & roaming around Montreal. When we entered we were asked if we had a reservation, which we did not, but the place was empty & they still contemplated on finding us a table. They sat us & took drink orders the food next. After waiting nearly an hour with no one coming back over to check on us or ask if we wanted more drinks I approached the gentlemen behind the bar and asked if it would be much longer. He arrogantly told me we ordered food that requires longer time to cook. We ordered 2 steaks at medium & medium rare, bison burger (which they never asked how we wanted it cooked) vegetable risotto 6 oysters & poutine. Absurd response with an attitude. Still no drink refills.... Another 10 mins go by & we get our food with a casual "sorry for the wait" only to find the steaks over cooked to medium well and a charred burger. Guessing that's why it took so long, they forgot about the food. We made the arrogant bartender/manager know & his response was "the ticket said medium not medium rare" to which I responded that it was much more then medium too. Not even an apology or anything. We ate what we could considering we'd waited so long & let them know we were less then satisfied. The bill came & the waitress said they'd take one steak off the bill but didn't make up for the poor overall experience & the arrogant douche of a manager. 

Do yourself a favor and AVOID this trap with its overpriced food & awful service. Definitely our worst experience while visiting beautiful Montreal. I think they got our point when they saw the tip but with the complete non caring attitude there I doubt they will change. Many other reviews comment about long waits, bad service & over cooked meals. This trend is a constant not a one off!! Steer clear of this overpriced, underwhelming joint, you'll be happy you did!!!
