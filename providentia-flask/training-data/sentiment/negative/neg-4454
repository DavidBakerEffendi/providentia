Not great service. I reserved a party 7 days in advance for 16. We got there 15 minutes early, but they had us mixed up with a party of 12. We got put into another room as a result, and it was hot there. Took our orders, but mostly forgot about us. No refills, and food was not tasty. Then auto 15% in checks. The guy up front tells me I can add extra. Really!? This Paiute reunion pretty much sucked.
