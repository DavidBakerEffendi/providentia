i would deter anyone reading this from going. Onda is probably the worst Italian restaurant in las vegas that i've ever eaten. we started with the Crab & Cipollini Dip Formaggio for $18. it was an awful concoction of smelly and "fishy" tasting crab and cheese. simply unfit for human consumption. then we had the clams in garlic white wine sauce for $14. the clams were really good quality but the broth that it came in was way too salty. i felt my face getting bigger from all the water i was retaining because of the salt. Then we had eggplant parmesan. this was the worst of all as it tasted like really bad left over food. I swear i've had better food from the cafeteria in my grade school for $1.50. I paid a total of $120 for 2 people. The saving grace of the evening was the complementary eggplant caponata that came with the bread. the bread was delicious and the service was superb. DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. IT IS THE BIGGEST RIP OFF IN VEGAS. Try Raos in the Ceasars Palace, Scarpettas at the Cosmopolitan, La Scala or Ferraros but DO NOT DO NOT GO here. I'm so Disappointed with Mirage.
