Was very disappointed in this place. The service was so bad.. our waitress only checked on us every 20 minutes or so and the place is SMALL. Not sure how she managed to avoid us for such long intervals. Anyway, my girlfriend ordered a beer, and when it arrived it tasted extremely sour. Passed it around for all 4 of us to try it and everyone said the same thing. Bad beer. So when we voiced that she would like another, they ended up charging us for both. Never heard of a restaurant that charges you for something you do not consume and are disatisfied with.. especially a beer! Do not recommend this place under any circumstances.. even when all the good bars are too packed to get into. Better off staying at home.
