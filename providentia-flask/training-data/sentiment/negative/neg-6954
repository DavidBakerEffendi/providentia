I was drawn in by the reviews. Unfortunately, I wont be coming back. The service was poor. I had to waive down the waitress to order my food and also to get my check. My food took a while and it was not what i expected. The miso soup had an interesting after taste and the location uses purple rice to make sushi. This was my first time trying and I was not impressed. The highlight of the night was watching the sushi chef/floor manager yell at a waitress in front of GUEST . She was  handling  some  aluminum foil that was on fire. I believe this is a dish, I am not sure if SHE was doing the procedure wrong but he was just yelling at her. REGARDLESS  that should not be Something  the guest have to see.Besides not having good food they have to Invest  in some customer service Courses.
