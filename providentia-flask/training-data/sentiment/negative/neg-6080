NEVER AGAIN!!! OK, I place a to go order of two ribeyes was told to pick up at 6:15pm..... Once getting to the place, noticed the take out parking spots were all taken. I drove around the parking lot, trying to find a plkace to park. 15 minutes later I find one. I go to the "TO GO" entrance, where I am met by a young lady. She informs me my food is right here on the counter in front of me. Then the phone rings,and she decides to take another order instead of finishing mine. After 5 minutes she returns to me. I told her  about the parking situtation, and make the coment of being the only person in take out. She told me busy night.
While leaving, I see a family come out get in their car, parked in take out, and drive away.As I am leaving I see another family pull in and go in.
I called the store, and asked to speak with the manager. I explained what had happened, and how I felt. The young lady said hold on I will get the boss you need to tell him!!!!! I was then on the phone with a man name BURT, who is not only the boss, BUT THE OWNER!!!!! I told him about what I had just went through tring do take out from his store,how I was made to wait to even get my food.......WELL, GUESS WHAT THE OWNER BURT SAID?????? STEVE, thats the price you pay for a busy store, he isnt the police,so parking wasnt his problem.... The girl, well she is the only one over there and if the phone rings???????? It took me 45 minutes to get take out!!!!  THERE IS NO EXCUSE!!!!!!!! busy stores with bad customer service CLOSE!!!!!!!
