avoid! avoid! avoid!
constantly screwing up and sending   incomplete orders of mine 2 days in a row. i've never seen such a large group of millymouthed managers that ignore the business and push the blame on others right in front of customers! steven (a women) and sad excuse for an expediter/manager and edgar a sad sack, soft spoken whimp baby of " a manager " both should be fired! whoever owns this franchise is stupid as f#@k for keeping any manager currently employed at that location. i say hit up the burger king, dairy queen or taco bell up before ever going to this mcdonalds! boooo to all you so called " managers " this location is a pile of hot, smelly !
