Most overly priced burger place I've experienced, My total came to $17 due to me ordering a double cheeseburger, fries, and a drink. When I received my Burger the meat was falling apart, plus extremely bland and greasy (poor quality meat, something you'd receive from save-a-lot) the best thing about this place are their multicolored straw selection. Definitely not recommending.
