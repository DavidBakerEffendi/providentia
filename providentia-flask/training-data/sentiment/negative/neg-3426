This manager is rude AF and should be fired. Clearly by my notes I didn't want glazed donuts. It was a 7am half asleep oversight. YOU SHOULD have CALLED ME (the customer). You had my phone number and clearly had instructions which indicated what I wanted. You could have made a 30 second phone call (uber eats confined you had my number). YOUR PHOTO ATTACHED TO THE "GLAZED DONUT" ORDER IS MISLEADING. I saw the photo of stuff I actually wanted (see photo attached).
"Hey customer I noticed you wanted X but you selected X, do you want to cancel your order and re-submit or would you like to pay the $1.50 difference for what you wanted?" 

^30 second convo. I would have been more than happy to do either. I was however, NOT HAPPY and extremely disappointed to find to get what I DID NOT WANT! And to top it off a note with RUDE ATTITUDE FROM THE MANAGER.
