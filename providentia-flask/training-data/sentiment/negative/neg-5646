This review is solely for a member of the casino staff, not the hotel accommodations or anything else. My friends and I were walking around the casino at around 5 in the morning looking for food after a very hectic night. We were a group of 3 Asian American guys, 1 Indian American guy, and me (Asian American girl). We approached a manager (his name was Jeff), to ask (in perfect American accents) if there were any food places around that were open at that time. He seemed willing to help, and looked over our group for a few seconds, then told us that he wasn't sure what kind of Asian food was around, but that there might be some "Vietnamese or Thai places off the strip" if we wanted to go that far. My friends and I were so surprised by this blatantly racist statement, and gently told him that we were looking for any kind of food, not just Asian food. He seemed a bit flustered, as if he realized that what he said was a bit of a faux pas, and directed us towards a couple open restaurants within the Venetian. We thanked him and left, somewhat in a state of shock. 

Admittedly, it was very early in the morning, and I understand that Jeff was most likely trying to be nice and giving us selections that he thought we would be familiar with. However, I would think that out of all the different people visiting Vegas every day, the staff should be a little more wary of statements that could be construed as offensive. I'm not saying this guy should be fired, since it was clear that he was trying to be helpful, but I hope he learns that when dealing with customers, it's very important to be aware of political and social correctness.
