***HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND*** Would give negative if possible.

Went here to try their shaved ice. They had this policy of 1 meal per person, so we tried their rice and noodles as well and asked for the shaved ice to be served after. The food was very poor quality food for a high price. We ask for the shaved ice to be served and the waitress said it would be a longer wait. 30 mins later, we ask again, and still nothing comes. 1 hr later, we ask AGAIN and the waiter said there are lots of takeout orders and we would have to wait till those are finished. We cancel the order. If the waiters have said there would be a very long wait, we would have left. Why waste 1 hr of our time? Meanwhile, we see another table get their shaved ice like 10 mins after they sat down. Like wtf??? We came here just for the shaved ice and u have us wait over an hr for a small cup???
