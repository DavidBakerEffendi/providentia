I should give 4 stars based upon whomever answered the phone on Tuesday July 25th around 8pm. I called to see if pastas were homemade she wasn't sure and asked does anyone make pasta fresh? Why yes dear they really do. I asked since she wasn't sure if maybe a server or someone would know, she said it's all about the sauces in her mind and suggested we go elsewhere! This convo went on for 3 minutes and  I was seriously appalled and flustered. Thank you thank you for the encouragement to go elsewhere.. because we did.. Craft 64 right next door as fate would have it. If this person worked at our restaurant (yes Im in the industry) she would be so out of there so fast her head would spin. Crazy how a place can loose business before you even get to try their food. Maybe your food is ahhhmazing but I will never know and all I wanted was a good pizza and a pasta dish. I got it too per your recommendation so for that I appreciate your unkindness
