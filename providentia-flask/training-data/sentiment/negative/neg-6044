Apparently this pizza shop that I've been ordering from never had a problem in 10yrs, thinks it's OK to insult my parents,my household, and myself. I let them slide on a 66$ order about 2weeks ago(was told next time I'd get a discount instead of sending the food back), then 3nights ago they messed up my food for the second time i√± a row. I called back all the lady wanted to do was argue and insult, instead of handling business. I'm sitting here with they're food untouched still, I talked with the owner just now, he just wanted to argue. So now we're waiting till tomorrow,the owner says he's coming to get the food and give me a refund tomorrow. I know better than to mess with the people that prepare your food, but 2times in a row is unreal. What a shame, that this place treats anyone like this, especially a 10yr customer. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE IS MY QUOTE. I ORDERED FROM SICILY'S PIZZA THE SAME NIGHT, WAS GIVEN MORE THAT RESPECT. SAY NO TO SOPHIA'S PIZZA, THEY MIGHT INSULT YOUR WHOLE LIFE. 

THANKS A BUNCH!
