My sister, me, and my fiance went here tonight, and it was my sister's second visit, and mine and my fiance' s third visit, and we've never been so put out and disgusted in our lives. First the so called bartende took forever to come over and take our drink order, then she had an attitude,  then we told her that we wanted to place a food order, and she didn't let the kitchen know jack about us. She took my sister's driver's license and was supposed to get her a Mr. G's card like I had, but she took forever on a slow ass night to return my sister's driver's license and then proceeded to give her the bullshit excuse that she had problems with her license,  and they were out of cards, so it took almost an hour, on a slow night to tell anyone that? Bullshit! She then supposedly had the manager's wife hand my fiance his soda, and that was bull, because she was getting sloshed at the bar with the other customers,  some manager's wife. The later we were told that there was no water in the restrooms ( major health code violation) which nothing was posted about, and then my sister was told that she had to have a certain drink limit before they could charge her card, and nowhere was this posted, so yet another violation. The only pleasant experience was our server and the food, which both were great, but the so call bar and bartender on Monday-Wednesday nights needs a overhaul. I recommend people come on Thursday-Sunday nights when the bartender Stevie is working. This night was a total let down, and we were so excited about going here again.
