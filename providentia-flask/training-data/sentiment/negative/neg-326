This place has to be one of the worst del tacos I've ever been to. Shift manager Josue doesn't say a word just stares at you until you order or say something. Took 30 min without exaggerating, because the employees were arguing. Poor poor management. When my food did come it was cold because they forgot my food had been sitting there. Crappy service.
