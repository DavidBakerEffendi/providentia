If you feel like paying $10.00 for "one"(1) pancake be my guest. Yes it was made of quinoa but so what! Even my wife who is more of a foodie than myself thought  this was a bad deal. The pancake looked so lonely and sad when it arrived.

So as my review on yelp will be a warning to other vegans in the Parkdale/Roncesvalles area. 

If your looking for a restaurant that thinks all vegans eat like birds, that restaurant would be Cardinal Rule. 

Please go, but  don't bring your appetite.
