My buddy and I chose this restaurant over there neighbor next-door ,carrabbas, due to outback usually having really good service and food... Not the case last night. Although I was excited to see the Queensland chicken and shrimp back on the menu ,by the time we ordered our food , we had waited almost 35 minutes for entrées to be served. His was good with the  Philly cheesesteak but mine was served lukewarm and my chicken was raw. !  not following the usual customary tradition of restaurants that serve food, the server FINALLY came back around, she said she would send the manager over which took a good five minutes, Manager said that she was going to take the price of the chicken off of my entrée which is just ridiculous!   The manager just was not friendly at all, I realize the restaurant gets very busy but that's no excuse to serve Ron check into a customer the outside was cooked but the inside was still pink and cold! My phone off the urge to scream like Gordon Ramsay "it's RAW"!   Definitely will not be going back unless ownership reaches out.
