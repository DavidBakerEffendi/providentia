Did this place change ownership?? It used to be the place to go in Chandler. Now they line dance??
The staff vests need to go!! The hours have changed(for the worse) and the drink prices all went up.  Service sucks and all the great staff that made the place great have disappeared.
Maybe they sold to corporate, but this is not the Living Room that once was!!
I guess I have to find a new home, because this is not my Living Room!  If it was I would move!
