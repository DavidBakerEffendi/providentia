The food was good, but nothing to write home about, and overpriced for what you get. My kids devoured all of their kids' meais, and really enjoyed the kids' menus. The location on the Strip is nice and gives a good view of the hustle and bustle of the Strip. The service, however, was lousy. Our waiter was friendly, but not at all attentive. When I ordered my cocktail, I also asked for a glass of water. It never showed up, and no one refilled my wife's water glass. We had to remind our server about one of the entrees that probably would not have showed up had we not asked. At one point, our server came by to do the "How is everything?" but he failed to slow down, stop, make eye contact, or give us an opportunity to say anything in response. That was rude. I can tell he felt really busy, but I don't think he should have been. The place was NOT busy. We were sitting on the patio, where about half the tables were occupied, but inside, only about 10% of the tables were occupied. Not going back.
