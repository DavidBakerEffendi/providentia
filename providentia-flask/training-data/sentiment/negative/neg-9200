I had the "famous" hot dog at the MGM and NYNY, they booth sucked ass. We had coupons for free hot dogs and we supposedly got the normal "$6" hot dog, what the hell? It tasted like shit free I can only imagine how mad I would have gotten if I had actually payed for that, slip it... it is NOT a cheap it for the strip, if you really want cheap and decently good hot dogs visit Bill's and go to the cart that is located at the Sports book.
