I get it, it's Subway. 

Due to the line, I used the restroom before ordering. Restrooms had the keys dangling out of the locks (like at a gas station where you have to get a key) so I'm not sure why they even bother with having a key. Came out of the restroom with zero people in line, and waited about 5 minutes to even be acknowledged and no one around. When he actually surfaced, this kid acted like he was on something. I had a coupon for .50 cents off a 6 inch. I always get veggie with extra cheese, so for a 6 inch with extra cheese (that they most certainly charge for the extra cheese) should be 4 slices. He put 3, whatever. Seeing as how my ENTIRE SANDWICH is veggies, when I started telling him the veggies I want, he barely put any. I had to keep asking for more, but when I said I wanted onions, he literally took a large handful and slapped it on there. The bread was stale and gross. I know he didn't apply the coupon I had, and refused to give me a receipt. Seriously?? Literally the only reason I still deal with Subway is that it's close to my house.. from now on I won't be so lazy, and will actually make the trip elsewhere.
