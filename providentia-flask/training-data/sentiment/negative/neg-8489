I went here last week for a coffee and snack. I ordered their version of a Brazilian coffee (kahlua) and my fiance ordered a Spanish coffee  (amaretto).I also ordered a cupcake. 

The cupcake was sooo hard. I told the server and his response was " it was in the fridge,you have to give it a minute ". Also my coffee came and it was a clear liquid for the shot that I poured into my coffee. I wasn't really thinking when I poured it in. When I started drinking it I realized it wasn't kahlua. I asked the server if it was kahlua and he said yes. I don't know why I didn't argue further, but it was probably because I honestly couldn't 100% remember that kahlua was not clear at the moment. Anyways, it definitely is not clear, and it tasted disgusting.

Eventually the owner came by and said "you don't like this? Re the cupcake, I said no. She took it and put it in the table next to us and said something in French. And then told us in English that the guy she passed the cupcake off to was the pastry chef. He stormed off, and I was mortified. 

That was their second chance I gave them. The first time I got an almond croissant, which was stale.
