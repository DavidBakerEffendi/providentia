UPDATE: after waiting for OVER A MONTH for a phone call back from the area manager, i STILL didn't hear anything. I called corporate and she was surprised but she never heard anything from the area manager either. Farmer Boys reaches out to me via Yelp but once I responded, i still didn't hear anything. Corporate was helpful but nothing was done of this issue. Terrible customer service. 

I came here today and ordered a California chicken club combo and a bbq chicken ranch salad. After waiting for 15 minutes I went up to the counter just to ask how much longer my order was going to be. The supervisor checked my receipt, went to the back to talk to the cooks, and then comes back to me and says the the club sandwich takes longer because they have to fry the chicken. FYI, the chicken on my salad is also fried but she never mentioned that at all.  As she was saying that though, I hear the chicken bring dropped in to the fryer so it makes me wonder if my order was skipped over or forgotten. After 20 minutes, I finally got my order but no apology from anyone for the long wait. Once I finally got home, my order was completely wrong and the fries were cold and ended up being trashed. Makes me really resent this place now
