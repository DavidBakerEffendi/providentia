My sister, niece, and I were really excited to try this before I flew back home. Unfortunately, we didn't get that chance. Took a few minutes to be recognized and then when our name was taken, the people after us (with a similar party size) were seated before us. Waited about 10 minutes before a server, who honestly seemed rather out of it, seated us. She said she'd be back with menus and silverware. She never returned. Everywhere around us was hustling and bustling. We saw her, with menus in hand, go to other tables and into the kitchen. Many other servers passed us by. My sister even made eye contact with her to try to get her attention and she looked right at us and then walked back into the kitchen. We honestly felt invisible. After waiting about 15 minutes, after about another 10 minute wait despite there being visibly open tables, we left. At that point, we were starving and I had to get to the airport. Super disappointed but also really rude/unprofessional. I saw her on the way out and let her know we were leaving so feel free to give our table to someone else. She didn't even apologize she just stared at me and mumbled "ok bye." What the heck?
