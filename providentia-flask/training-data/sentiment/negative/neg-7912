Rude!!! Worst first experience. Called to order a pizza the guy who was gonna take my order said the wait would be and hour and 40 mins, okay cool places get busy but that wasn't the problem, once I had said yikes, let me see what my husband says the guy just hangs up!! 
Didn't even say bye or anything. 

Never calling this location!! Awful.
