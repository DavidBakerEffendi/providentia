Really not good food. Very disappointed when we received delivery. 2 burritos - food was super bland. Meat was dry and the tortillas tasted as if they were several days old. Not impressed at all, not passable by any means and will not order from them again. 
Should have ordered from our usual - El Molina down the street. Always good food, tasty and fresh!
