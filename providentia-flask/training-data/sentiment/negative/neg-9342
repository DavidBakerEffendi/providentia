If I could leave zero stars I would. It started off ok and we got seated quickly with a group of another 6 people who were all great. After taking our order we received our drinks and sushi soon after. We then waited and waited without our waiter ever checking on us for refills or anything. As we waited 3 other tables were seated and orders taken. Their chefs showed up and cooked for them and served them food!  We waited over an hour until we finally asked to see a manager. Who never came out after us asking 3 times. Finally we got the attention of our waiter who finally informed us our ticket was lost!  Idk how that's our fault?  But we finally had our chef come to cook for us. Only to be disappointed again because there were 6 in our group who asked for no onions in the fried rice and guess what?  There were onions. So we had to wait for another fried rice to be prepared. We felt bad because it really wasn't the chefs fault but he had to deal with all of our disappointment. The chef was still great but the wait staff suck!  We tipped the chef personally still because the food afterall WAS good. After all this waiting we went to order another bottle of saki but were informed they ran out. On a slow Saturday night. Somehow they were out of saki?  In a Japanese restaurant.  Ridiculous!  Finally we got our checks to find that they refused to do ANYTHING AT ALL to right the situation. No apology, no discount, no offer of any drink to make us feel better about the problem they caused. Nothing. I will NEVER go there again, or any of the other restaurants this group owns!  (Ah-soh, habayashi, etc..). This place just opened and they already lost 8 customers. Absolutely horrible experience.
