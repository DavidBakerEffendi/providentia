My husband and I went out for a date night without the kids. Since we are both sushi lovers, we decided to give Katsu a try. Boy, was that a mistake. Their rolls were mediocre at best. Gummy, cold rice. The spicy salmon was nowhere near spicy. The Dynamite Roll was anything but.
The hot food was even worse.
The Chicken Karage was the most dry, burnt chicken I have ever had the misfortune to taste. The shrimp rolls were like biting into grease rolls. I like deep fried. It takes a lot of grease to turn my stomach, but Katsu managed in spades. Save yourself the indigestion. Skip Katsu.
