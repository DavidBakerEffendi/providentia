Not impressed. The coffee is awful! Shouldn't it taste fresh brewed in the early a.m.? For some reason I decided to get a breakfast bagel sandwich which was nothing special. Most importantly though, the service sucked. We were the only ones in line but the girl behind the counter said to us 3 times, I can help you down here when you're ready. Okay, I get it! I don't see what her point was though cause she was rude and pushy when we did finally place an order.
