After looking through many Delivery menus, we had finally settled on this location (a block away from our Apartments). We called, placed our order with little to no issue. However, upon waiting for the order to be delivered, the driver called with concerns over the address. After clarifying the best we could (The driver has a very strong accent), we waited for our food, instructing him to call us if there were any other issues. After 15-20 minutes had passed (Mind you, the restaurant is within a few minutes of our apartment) we called the store itself. We asked if the driver had actually left, they told us they had. We expressed to them we were not going to pay for cold or soggy food (our order was Chicken fingers in sauce and Fries). We then went through an off and on phone conversation as they put us on hold to contact their driver, where they informed us he couldn't find the place, then he had been there and knocked with no answer (we had been listening intently for the door), he was at the gate to the complex, and eventually while on the phone conversation (the woman on the phone had polite and apologetic for the incident) he knocked on the door finally. By now it had been so long, we had informed the person on the phone we had no intention of paying for and/or accepting the food. They did offer us 20% off (or 3$) for the inconvenience. Once we opened the door, the Driver yelled at us, literally raising his hands (while still holding the food) in an aggressive manner, asking us why we didn't answer the door 15 minutes before hand when he says he had knocked. After a few moments of him harassing us, we closed the door. Finished our conversation with the representative from the store (who again apologized for the incident, and the drivers behavior). And have now requested for the manager to contact us in hopes of preventing situations like this in the future.
