DO NOT EAT THIS !$@#. $40 worth of two specialty pizzas and they cant get the crust right and leave off the bacon from a pizza that has it as a main ingredient! 
 Lovely. Thanks guys. The pizza was a request from a customer I was trying to impress. He specifically asked to add extra bacon. I specifically asked to add extra bacon. I paid extra for the extra bacon and confirmed that I paid for it on the reciept. Not a shred of bacon on a pizza that has bacon as a main ingredient. Thanks a lot, assholes.
