Where to start? My eggs Benedict were great. Now, for the problems. Dirty dishes. Had to ask several times for water or coffee refills. Waitress had us passing stuff to others instead of walking around the table. O.j. Tasted like it had grapefruit juice mixed in or was watered down. Fresh fruit was unripe and/or mushy. Bacon was thin, precooked and tasteless. French toast advertised as brioche but it was regular bread. Annoying burnt toast smell the whole time. Avoid.
