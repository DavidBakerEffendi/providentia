Upon entering there is a full display of cakes which they carry. I was craving a Red Velvet cake and saw that there was a full Red Velvet cake which was pre-sliced. Not one single slice was missing (You will understand later why I make a point about there not being a single slice missing).

The slice of cake was $10.50 which included some vanilla ice cream. The price is in a category of its own. Next level expensive. Super Saiyan level expensive. (I can't believe I'm refering to Dragonball in one of my reviews). I think the most expensive slice of cake I had prior to this was a $9 cheese cake which tasted amazing. So with this kind of price tag I am expected to be blown away. What we get instead is a glob of ice cream placed on top of the Red Velvet cake and another glob put on the side. Yes, a GLOB. Not a scoop which is what you would expect. Terrible presentation. 

The cake itself tasted just as bad as the presentation. The cake was dry, the cream didn't taste anything like it should. Did not even have a hint of the cream cheese flavour it should have. Simply one of the worst cakes I have had. To make things worse, when we left we saw the Red Velvet cake which was on display and it still had not a single slice missing. So either we were served days, possible weeks old cake or the cake they have on display upfront are fake and just for show. I'm pretty sure we were served old cake as it tasted that way. 

WOW.....I'm glad I vented all that out and got that off my chest. 

I also got a Rolo flavoured latte which tasted good but I didn't taste any Rolo. It just tasted like a Hazelnut latte in my opinion. The drink is worth some stars but the cake....STAY AWAY.
