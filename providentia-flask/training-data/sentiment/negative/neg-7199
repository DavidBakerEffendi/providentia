Oh Satan, why. Why did you have to open this upcharging-dishonest-mess-of-a-menu spot? I never write one-star reviews, but what a horrendous experience. I kind of felt bad for the guy behind the counter being berated by practically everyone, but my lort, I understand their rage. I didn't receive any of the sides that came with my meal (beans, rice, pico, sour cream) and was upcharged for meat that already comes with the damn order. What kind of fresh hell is this? Options are limited Terminal B9-15, but steer clear and get a bagel from Einstein Bros. or something.
