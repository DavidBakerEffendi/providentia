Total ripoff! First guy at check in tried to skam me with their extra services. 
The room was really nice.
But when I checked out they charged me 11$ for 1 bottle of water!!!!! No just think! Bottle of water which cost 1$ max. And most hotels even the cheapest ones have 2 complimentary bottles in the room! The facts they actually charge for it, and the amount are unbelievable.
So cheap!
So sketch!
Next time will choose Bellagio! Thanks for nothing
