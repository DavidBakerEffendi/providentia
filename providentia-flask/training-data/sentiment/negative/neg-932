I think we caught this on a bad day since there are so many good reviews and our experience was not a good one. My chicken gyro fell apart in my hand and the chicken had zero  flavor. The pita bread literally split in half . The rice had no flavor either even with the tomato sauce. Oh well $23.00 down the tube.
