Very poor experience. Waited an hour for food that never came. They never put in our appetizer. People around us who came in after us got served and left. The water tastes like it came out of a bucket. Never even got to try the food. I won't be returning anytime soon. The owner never even apologized. I wouldn't even eat there for free.
