I've been to this Einstein's a few times, since we live right down the road. But after today, I won't be going to this location anymore. Place was pretty dirty and disorganized, and they were out of 2 of the carafes of coffee. I waited 10 minutes, then asked one of the employees at the register if they have more Vanilla Hazelnut coffee. She told me they were brewing it right now and it will take a few minutes. Ok, understandable. Then 10 minutes later another customer asked if they had the Vanilla Hazelnut. Then the employee yells over to another employee, "Are you brewing coffee?" Uh, no. So she goes over to brew coffee, and says it will be another 10 minutes. Not only rude to lie to me about it, but also looks like these employees are just plain lazy. What a shame.
