Very disappointed with my recent visit I made across town for some take out.

Ordered 2 butter chicken roti, one medium and one mild.  They marked them like they were but it was 2 medium.  My wife really can't take that kind of spice so she didn't eat making dinner very difficult.

The mango chutney also smelled and tasted like carpet cleaner, very bad experience.
