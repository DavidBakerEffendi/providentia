First off we just got to our room and our restroom had a pubic hair around the lid!! Next there was a damn unused condom under the chair found by my 13 year old son!!!!! Now I know it's a new condom but who travels 1500 miles to settle in what you think is your beautiful hotel room to be so disappointed!! I've stayed at here plenty of times and I've always been satisfied until today! Im going to try another hotel because this one obviously doesn't care for me.
