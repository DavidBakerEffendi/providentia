It is rare when there is not one redeeming quality to a business, but Saddleranch has achieved that level of mediocrity.  The service was poor, it took over 1/2 hour for drinks to arrive even though it wasn't busy.  The food runner was so lackadaisical it was comical.  There was something wrong with all of our entrees, with five people you must really have to work to mess something up on each plate. The manager tried to compensate by bringing us free dessert but we left after waiting over 1/2 hour for that.  For the money the quality of ingredients was very poor.  Let us all be grateful that there are other restaurants!
