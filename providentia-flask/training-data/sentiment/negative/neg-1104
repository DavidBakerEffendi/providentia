Food was OK. Service was great. Avoiding a cockroach under my chair almost made me barf! Watching the server try and stomp on it was comical.  Not having a manager deal with the issue is horrible. Not having anyone monitor their yelp comments is typical of horrible restaurants that don't give a shit!
