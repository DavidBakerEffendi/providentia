I feel bad giving such a low rating because this place is so popular on social media, but honestly it was just really bad. 

I only tried the rainbow bagels with funfetti cream cheese- which is the reason theyre famous on social media. I pre ordered 6 rainbow bagels with one tub of the cream cheese ($35) and was told to pick up the bagels anytime between 7-4. I work 8:30-5 normally so I popped in bright and early at 7:30. 

You would think these would be the freshest bagels in the world because it's so early. What I got was the Most driest bagel I have ever encountered- it makes be believe these bagels were actually frozen and thawed and sold to me, not freshly made. They they so dry they were inedible. I literally ate half of one, thought it might just be the one, so I made another one and it was just as bad so I threw the rest out- such a waste of money and so disappointing. The funfetti cream cheese was good tho- but for the price and hype and for only the cream cheese to be good?!? Sorry but one star.
