OK, I really like the convienence of sandwiches delivered right to my office.  JJ's had been very consistant and delivered good food.  Unfortunately the quality of the food has gone the same way as most chain sandwich shops.  We've been super busy, I needed to order out twice this week.  TUESDAY: Ordered a club sandwich with extra meat.  No extra meat.  Ok one miss, not too bad.  THURSDAY :  Ordered a tuna salad sandwich, onions extra. Opened the wrapper and I got tomatoes, cucumbers,  extra mayo and all of the water they should have drained off the tuna.  Bread was soaked, dissolving into this gooey mayo colored pile of gloop.  
Time to quit JJ's like Subway, Quiznos, Port of Subs and all the others before.
