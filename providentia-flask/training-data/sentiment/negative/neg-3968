Ohhhhh

I visited this establishment for a take out pizza experience. I did call a head. I walked in to an environment that was not well lit. I waited at the counter... No one was around. I waited some more... No one was around. Finally a kid comes out and asks what I need. I tell him, he gives me my order and then I pay and then I leave. The staff seems unfriendly and the establishment felt uninviting. 

This is not pizza or any edible form of what any Italian would call pizza. No passion, no care, no zest for or importance placed on quality of ingredients. 
Really? I cannot be the lone wolf that tastes how bad this is? Lack of quality. 

I am sorry to be so harsh but it just gets annoying to see all of these business get away with mediocrity. Sometimes I feel like we need a champ. Someone to step up and fight for the little guy. Well here it is.... "Rocky music playing in the background" 

Don't go. If you like pizza and respect yourself then do not go. Raise your hands high turn around and walk away. 

Sorry, not sorry.
