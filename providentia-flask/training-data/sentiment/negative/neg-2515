Went multiple times.  Once I downloaded the new app and went for my free slush.  Hit "use this coupon" it disappeared, staff said there was nothing we can do. 
Another time we ordered a drink and an ice cream and people came in behind us with full meals.  We finally left after 30 minutes of waiting with no response from them.
