Run of the mill neighborhood bar. Not sure about the food since I've only had the wings, which are okay. They lose a lot of points because of bad service. 

I understand management wants to watch labor costs and bartenders/servers want to have as many customers for the tips. This place is always understaffed. Two different times I was here to watch a game with a cold drink and dinner. Both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order. This last time I was waving the menu to get her attention and that didn't work. Paid for my beer and left. Went to another nearby bar that had good food and great service.

I was looking for a new neighborhood bar. Ya know...one you would go to several times a week for happy hours and late night fun. Won't be this place.
