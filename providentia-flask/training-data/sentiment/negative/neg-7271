UUGGHHH. You yelp-trolls with broken taste buds got me again, sending me to this 'oh so amazing', 'must try' 'favorite' sushi place. 

What. Is. WRONG with you people?? 

It would be generous to say their sushi was average. It was not freshly made. They serve nasty phoenix tap water, and tea made with nasty phoenix tap water. They tried to make their tempura sauce into something crazy and fancy and it just comes out tasting like it was inspired by spam. 

An all around fail. Thank you once again, yelpers for fooling me into thinking you could actually recognize good food.
