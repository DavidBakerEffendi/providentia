Walking in the place looks cute, clean and not busy. However being ignored so you can finish wrapping silverware before seating us was not cute. My brother had to cough for you to buy a clue we wanted service. After we did get seated and decided what we wanted we were told the shrimp we wanted was not available. Then after picking something else and ordering a salad, it came dry with only a slight drizzle of dressing. At this point a couple walks in and they too have to whistle to get service, totally unacceptable when you only have 4 customers. I ordered the rigatoni which tasted like the pasta had been left out and dried on the edges. My mom ordered the pesto fettuccine which wasn't bad but wasn't good either. My brother ordered the ravioli and said it was good. As we were eating there was some chatter from the kitchen and the language was foul and inappropriate. We over heard the cooks laughing at us because apparently they had saved the last of the shrimp for themselves and decided to cook it while we were there so we could smell it. My mom got up to let them know they had horrible mouths but they never apologized. I was greatly disappointed after all the hype this place received and I can safely say we will not be back. I will say Michelle our server was wonderful and hard working. She did not stop the whole time we were there. I was also very disappointed to see the male employee who was wrapping silverware couldn't even be a gentleman and bring the chairs in from outside before he left. I'm not saying Michelle needed help but it would have been the nice thing to do. Like I said Michelle was awesome and she is the only reason I didn't make a stink about paying for the meal I didn't finish eating.
