Oh my dear ! You will get one star, just because I am keeping an open mind today!
Where to start. I'm chocked at myself for having to write this esp considering the parent restaurant is among the strongest restaurants in Montreal at which I have always been ext satisfied.
Ordered basic stuff: fried calamari and angus AAA filets with quail egg.
Calamari were fried as hard as a brick top. I send it back and asked if I would have the same or something else, to which I said same. 
Guess what? It comes back a 2nd time just as hard. I send it back. I was in a relaxed mood so was not in a state of mind to complain or say much at all - usually not like me. I was however expecting the waitress to perhaps ask the customer, 'is there anything wrong sir, can we do anything to appease you? Sweet nothing; in fact she could not be bothered. 
Wait time between dishes was absurdly long, esp considering lunch menu. Moreover, there was no one in the restaurant.
Beef was average at best.
I was not charged for the calamari, well, this was expected.

Sorry, avoid this place !!!
