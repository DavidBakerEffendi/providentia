Went here tonight. Yes, I know it's a weekend at Westgate, and expected them to be busy. There wasn't a long wait to get sat. Took us a little while to get our drinks out, and then we ordered our food. It took over an hour to get our food out to us, our server she had only checked on us a couple of times, and didn't after the bread sticks, despite the fact that she saw me looking over at her several times during the meal. About 50 minutes after waiting, I went to go look for her to ask where our food had went, couldn't find her. I did see her as well as other servers hanging out with other tables. The table next to us even had to get their own silverware after the food had been brought out. I ended up walking out, paying for my drink and not even getting out food. I had to go somewhere else to eat completely. The server never came over to apologize about our wait, no manager, no other servers came to check up on us after the biscuits were brought out.I even offered to pay for my drink, which she took a while to bring out the check for that, keeping me their angry even longer.It seems like they are very selective about who they serve, saw a lot of girls hanging out with the guys at the tables while other tables were waiting.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service..I couldn't even find a manager to complain to.
