Just another chinese restaurant. Nothing fancy. Ordered the crispy chicken in japanese curry and the order came wrong. They gave us a small portion and then halfway through, the waiter came out with another plate of the dish saying that the cook prepared the wrong portion. What's funny or not-so-funny, is that the peas and carrots on this dish were the frozen stuff you can find in the supermarket freezer. C'mon! I can understand the peas but the carrots? Jeez! And we had phoenix and dragon which is two dishes that is chicken in sa cha sauce (so sweet that you can get diabetic attack) and curry shrimp (5 pieces) which is not bad but not great either. Another odd thing was that our food weren't served at the same time and have to wait at least 3 more min for the next dish to be served. Oh well anyway. Ask me if i'm going back to that place? A big fat NO!!!! I'd rather go to a chinese buffet. But then again I won't either.
