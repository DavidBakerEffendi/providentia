If I could give negative stars to this place I would..what a disappointment. Really wish I had taken the time to read reviews before coming here for brunch today. Anywho came in for brunch with my dad on my lunch break had seen this place a couple of times on my visits to sauce and was super excited to try it after checking out the menu online. Due to only having an hour on my break I ordered some fries and my dad a salad. Both very simple things to prepare.. you would think. The guy who took our orders seemed super casual in his red polo and jeans and after bringing us water immediately took place behind the bar to chat up some guys sitting there. My dad and I waited for more than 30 minutes for this food to be brought out. Had to get up and go grab the only other person working and ask her to check on our food she said sure thing and went to the kitchen came out and then proceeded to ignore us entirely. The guy who had taken our orders still standing there at the bar chatting with someone paid us absolutely no attention this entire time. At this point I'm starving and need to go back to work so we get up to leave and get this the guy says "oh yeah I was just about to go check on your food!" Uh were you really guy? It's ok go back to socializing we won't be back. Wanted to enjoy this place so bad considering the lovely atmosphere but nothing can make up for terrible customer service.
