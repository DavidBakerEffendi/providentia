If I could give no stars I would. After my boyfriend tried to convience me not to get a grill cheese, being a chef he said he'd just make me somthing as good if not better at home, I refused and said I want to support local business and try this place because of the great reviews!  I went over alone and ordered the three cheese with blue cheese,aged cheese and one another I can't remember. Came out on a standered white peice of thin bread with a little cheese. The cheese wasn't even melted after eating half of it my boyfriend wanted to take it back and have them actually melt the cheese all the way. When he returned he told me they rudely looked at him like how dare they bring this uncooked grill cheese back.  They didn't even appoligize...said nothing at all to my boyfriend. I was okay with the bad grilled cheese but terrible customer service in the food industry...unacceptable. How can you be a grilled cheese food truck and not know how to make grilled cheese and be to over the top pricey! Wow...thank god I had an unbelievable lobster roll at the lobster ladies truck before this let down. Should of spent my hard earned cash at the pho king...never again will I support them.
