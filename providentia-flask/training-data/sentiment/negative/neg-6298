This is my second time visiting this location. My friends and family came with me and recommended this place. I attempted to order the Karaage Bowl last week, and there was no rice ( In a Japanese restaurant) so I changed my ordered. So now I visited today, and attempted to order the same bowl a week later... and yet again.... NO RICE! And we called to make sure there was before we arrived. This will be my last attempt to eat in this establishment, due to the simple fact there is never rice!
