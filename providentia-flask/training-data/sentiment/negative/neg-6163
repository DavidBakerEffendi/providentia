Ok warning be prepared for long wait times to get in and poor food when it arrives. 
When we arrived we were told it would be a twenty minute wait time.
After 45 minutes we inquired and were told that they had stopped seating anyone to allow the kitchen to catch up and would be getting to us soon.
They seated us about ten minutes after that.
While we were waiting to be seated we went to the bar to have a drink. We ordered two diet Pepsi's that were were dreadful tasting. I asked the bar tender what was wrong with them and he told me the soda machine wasn't working properly. And that they were trying to fix it! Why the heck serve a bad drink knowing it is bad!
I gave it back and just asked for water instead.
After we were seated we ordered two Ribeye's ($30 a plate for a 12 oz!) with baked potatoes. Then 45 minutes later a cold liver looking piece of meat arrived with the frozen veggies and under-baked potatoes. Oh but it gets better when the waitress came back 15 minutes later and we showed her our food and told her it's actually cold to the touch she rolled her eyes!!
She offered to microwave the food for us or we would have to wait for it be recooked.
After her nasty eye roll and dramatic sigh my wife was over it. Done.

We spoke to the manager and left without eating. We will never be back.
