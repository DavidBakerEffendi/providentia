No Thank You


For a restaurant that's schtick is to treat you rudely, they aren't very good at it. The hostess and the waitress were both very friendly. 
As for the menu, even with the offer of free drinks if you purchased a meal, I couldn't do it. There was nothing on the menu that looked like it should be anywhere near a healthy Being.

Ps-Oh wait, I was supposed to be Mean...
