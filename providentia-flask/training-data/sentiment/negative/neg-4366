Came here for lunch and ordered 2 burritos and chips and salsa. Was told they don't have salsa (what?). Waited 15 minutes. Then were told they didn't have the ingredients for one of the burritos. Changed the order to a chili relleno burrito, waited for another 15 minutes. Got chili relleno but no burrito. And definitely paid for the burrito. Have given this place many chances but have never been satisfied and won't be giving them another chance.
