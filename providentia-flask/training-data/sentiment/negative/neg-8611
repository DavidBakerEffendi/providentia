Won't be bringing my business back to this Wahoo's and I LOVE Wahoo's. I'll gladly drive to Boca Park.

This is the closest of the three valley locations to me, but I'll make the trek to avoid this location.

My food at this location has generally always been subpar compared to other Wahoo's, but this time my incorrect order PLUS the rudest bartender I have ever met in my life did the deed of hammering the final nail into the casket. 

To be clear: I, as a Las Vegan, know and understand the gamers always have priority seating at machines at the bar and always keep that in mind when choosing to sit at the bar.

We walk in. We sit at the bar.

Now, my date and I asked the bar tender to break a $20 for us. We both took $10 of this and began to gamble. We ordered drinks, we ordered food. A couple regular parties walk in. There are 4 empty seats with machines available, but we get the looks. We are sitting at their precious normal machines.

This bartender had the NERVE to tell my boyfriend and me that she will move us if she has to because the machines are "reserved for active players." Am I not actively gambling? I have pushed this button non-stop since I have sat down. So while my man and I secretly discussed our shock under our breath, she noticed. She came over AGAIN and like a stern mother scolding her children she took a tone with us and repeated herself, all while I STILL count FOUR empty machines in the bar. We are the only people with food, drinks, AND actively gaming. Clearly, our 25 cent Keno wasn't going to win her the high tips she would get when the professional bar gamblers hit their flushes and royals.

I am so livid that were blatantly treated like lower class for a higher paying regular gambler. I am not looking for free drinks while sitting at the bar, I am looking for a little gaming fun and to pass the time.

I'll eat and Twin Peaks before returning here.
