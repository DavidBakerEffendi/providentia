House of Pain had a Bad start. Thought it was good we had American server so no language issue. But the ordering was never more difficult!! Guess you can't upgrade to fried rice.. it "cost too much" and "vegs won't fit into bowl".  Server was salty, & non-flexible on any modifications.  And couldn't describe their 8 jewel sauce ..it was "impossible".  
Returned the paper-wrap chicken, it was burnt to the aluminum foil. Had it taken off bill. They said the wrap was too dry. Fried rice tasted kinda burnt like the oil was over fried past smoke-point.  We were not pleased on this Mothers Day meal.
