About 1 year ago, upon my initial visit, the food was great! It was served STEAMING HOT & freshly prepared- you could tell that the food was genuinely prepared by someone who cared. The last 2 times i came, they have unknowledgable young American female teenagers working the order and cash registers, the food is BARELY warm, and SOOOOOOO DRY (barbecue should be JUICY!!!) and the food must have been 3-4 hours old.  It was NOT FRESH and must have been from lunch time. I came around 5. The Indians sure are getting waaay too miserly. I will not be returning- 2x I paid more than $30 for my orders, and the food ended up wasted. Too bad Choolah, you lost me as a customer. No longer a Choolah-head. VERY DISAPPOINTED SINCE I AM AN INDIAN-FOOD FANATIC. will find another place in town.
