This could possibly be the WORST Vietnamese place I've ever been. Just ate there, slow service, stinky fish sauce(I know, it's fish sauce but I know GOOD fish sauce when I see it, smell it. My wife is Vietnamese) The people next to me were starring at the waiter trying to get his attention so they could order. Painful experience.

Vermicelli noodles dish was very small. What do I want for $10.00.

I asked for some mint and they brought me something that was CLEARLY not mint and I told them "this is not mint" and a few min's later another man came over and told me that it was in the mint family. OK, uhm no. A Vietnamese place that doesn't know what mint looks like.............Oh my.

Also check out the pic of the sign telling customers that to-go container are 35 cents. Cheapskates!

:(
Never again! Head to Chandler for some REAL Vietnamese food.


Hmm, they wouldn't allow me to upload the pic of the to-go warning sign*****
