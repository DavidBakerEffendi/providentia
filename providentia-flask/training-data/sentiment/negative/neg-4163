Delivery took a long time, food came hot, but 3 out of my 3 items tasted like shi Crab puffs have no flavor or crab, they were obviously frozen and not fresh. I got the Triple Delight and requested a sauce that they didn't put on or the sauce is just really bad. The beef and chicken both tasted like rubber which made me lose my complete appetite. The food is beyond greasy.  The egg drop soup was the only decent thing and it's not even great. This place was a waste of my precious calories and my Benjamin's! I'll stick with my China Jade, which would smoke this restaurant if they went up next to each other
