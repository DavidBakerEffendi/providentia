I was really disappointed when I ordered food for me and my family and my burger was burnt. The fries were cold and the meat was dry and burnt. I couldn't eat it so I tossed my $6 burger in the garbage. My wife's wasn't as burnt as mine and she was starving so she drowned it in ketchup and got it down. We usually really like farmer boys but this one was not at all like any others. It just pisses me off that you pay $22 for fries and burgers and you can't even eat it.
