Let me start by saying the sushi is good BUT the service is absolutely TERRIBLE!!  Sushi chefs standing around doing nothing but cleaning up for the night with a full restaurant. When I looked at the time they were still open for 2 more hours!!  Waitress never came around and when she did she was less than enthusiastic to help. This place has really gone down hill and its a real let down. Only go here if you're prepared to be super annoyed.
