This used to be my favorite casino until now.  They used to reward their players (Grazie Club) with generous comps/offers.  The marketing department has decided that ,since they are doing so well with trade shows and conferences, they no longer need to care about their patrons anymore.  Out goes the offers or comps.  

All of their Grazie Club players (Gold and Platinum) are complaining on their Facebook fan page.  No one has received any offers for this year.  Numerous phone calls to them have gotten the same lame canned excuses/answers.  Shame on you Palazzo/Venetian.  You advertise and  encourage people to join the Grazie club and play to become Gold and Platinum for special offers and comps.  It's all lies.  

Take your business elsewhere like Wynn or MGM.  They are still rewarding their players.  Bye bye Palazzo/Venetian.
