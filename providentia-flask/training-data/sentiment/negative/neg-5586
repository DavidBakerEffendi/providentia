Would definitely NOT recommend. Extremely overpriced, I have no clue why the line was so long. My egg salad sandwich cost about 3x more than what I felt I got. 

Presentation was sub-par, flavor was bland (tasted the same as a gas station egg salad), and I definitely ate a couple egg shells that were hidden in my egg salad. And there's nothing special about the buns it came with, tasted the same as grocery store buns.

Would not come back again, nor would I go to the LA location near where I live. At that price and experience, I'd rather make my own egg salad at a fraction of the cost, better taste, and better value.
