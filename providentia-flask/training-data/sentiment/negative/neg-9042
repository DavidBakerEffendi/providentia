I had a feeling Kneader's might be bad since the other Utah-based chains that have come to town haven't been that good (I'm looking at you, Cafe Rio and Cafe Zupas), but Kneader's shows them who's boss of mediocrity!

They have one vegetarian sandwich (not including the grilled cheese), and the veggies are cooked in aus jus!!! Seriously! I'm appalled as a vegetarian, and as someone who enjoys the privilege of the sense of taste, I am disgusted by what I ate. I had my husband try it as well to make sure my taste buds weren't off after abstaining from meat the past few years, but he agreed the aus jus taste was accurate.

My husband's sandwich was also bad. His skimpy reuben had roast beef in it, not pastrami. I just couldn't believe my eyes. The parmesan chips were just regular chips covered in Kraft granulated fakey parmesan that didn't even stick. Very overpriced at $8.50 each. To quote Woody Allen, the food was terrible-- and such small portions!
