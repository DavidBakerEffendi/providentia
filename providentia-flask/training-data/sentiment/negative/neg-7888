Came in today in the morning around lunch time with a couple of friends it was our first time here we had read the reviews and decided to give it a try. The service was good and the food was alright however half way through our meal we spotted a cockroach behind where we were sitting. Naturally we were grossed out and informed our waiter. The host then came to us and told us she had taking off the drinks we had and apologized to us for the mishap. Im sorry but to think that the kitchen where our meals have been prepare might of came in contact with roaches is the reason it will be the last time we will be coming here.  Their A from the health department should be reconsidered!
