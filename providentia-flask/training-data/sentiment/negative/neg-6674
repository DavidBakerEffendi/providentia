My family stopped by Fry's Supermarket a few doors down to pick up some groceries.  Seeing that there was as sushi restaurant nearby, I decided to pick up something.  I ordered a few items for take-out.  After looking at the menu, I noticed that they served Korean dishes as well.   Where are the prices for the rolls?  Okay.  I'll find out once I pay.

The salmon teriyaki came with miso soup that tasted like water with a few cubes of tofu.  Preserved Korean side dishes came with the entree, but the side dishes weren't ready yet.  They lacked flavor and taste.  The spicy scallop hand roll was really small and had very small scallops in them.  They are very limited menu for sushi rolls.  I forgot the name of the roll that I got, but it was supposed to be topped with raw salmon.  Where was my salmon?  Oh, it was cut paper-thin and some crab meat was covering it up.  They didn't mess up the CA roll.  I barely got any ginger or wasabi.  The rice used seemed different than rice normally used for making sushi.  

I should've driven a few blocks to Hana Sushi.
