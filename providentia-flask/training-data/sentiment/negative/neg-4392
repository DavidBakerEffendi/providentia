Asked another lady and she ignored us, I was like what is going on here.... Wanted to leave right away but I couldn't cause she took for ever to get me the bill ! Wow . I usually, when I got the bill I got charged for two ice teas two Thai ice teas one soft drink extra, all we ordered and got was ice teas wow keeps getting worst by the minute. I will never ever come back!! I'm pissed! I
