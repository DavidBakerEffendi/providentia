Went to Olive Garden today and had an awful experience. First off our waitress was terrible. We were there for over an hour and a half and never got our breadsticks until the end. My mom nor my grandma got refills and my boyfriend and I had to flag her down to get ours and I just had water. She stopped by our table on her own maybe 3 times. To take our order, serve our food, and bring the check. It wasn't even busy. Then the food was awful. None of us were satisfied. They also have these new machines where you can place your own order and that's how you pay your check right at the table. That is so low class and with that really why have a waiter or waitress? You can do everything yourself other than bring out the food. To top is off while we paid the check at the table the waitress hovered over us and it was uncomfortable leaving a tip with her watching. You can't ask for steakhouse prices with McDonald's service. We will never be going back to Olive Garden again. I have celiacs disease and the gluten free menu was a joke. We can go to the Cheesecake Factory get better service and food and have more options for gluten free and pay the same price or less. Olive Garden is a joke.
