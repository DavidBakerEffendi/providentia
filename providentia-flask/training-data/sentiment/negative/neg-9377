**Don't eat here - just don't do it!!

Took my mom and auntie here for Mother's Day brunch and fully regreted my choice.

For $20/person, I expected decent quality food - even at buffet standards. No, they really missed it here.

I tried:

*Snow Crab: okay but overcooked/rubbery. Fresh seafood in the desert is tough, in their defense.
*3 sushi rolls: worst sushi ever! Tasted like it was made previous day. Rice was bordering on being a little crunchy. Didn't finish.
*Seafood Pasta salad: decent, but a LOT of mayonaise.
*Soft-serve chocolate ice cream: great! But it's made from pre-made mix, so not too tough to mess up this one.


It was nice that they offered complementary champaigne, but again - $20?? 

Plus the overly-saturated second hand smoke is just disgusting. Plus, a small bug ran across the table. I felt SO dirty and will never be returning.
