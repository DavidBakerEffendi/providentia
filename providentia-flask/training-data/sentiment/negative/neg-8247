We were so excited that there was a new Texas Roadhouse being put near our house, come to find out they are absolute rudest Texas Roadhouse we have ever been to. I wish I could give zero stars. 

The parking spaces were a better use than this new Roadhouse. We will not be returning to this location EVER again.
