idk man, it was really f-ing expensive and I didn't enjoy a single dish we ordered..

We had the "well known/famous" gnocchi dish .. the rainbow trout.. and the fried calamari. all of which were mediocre at best. 

It was a pretty painfully slow process to get this food too.. from the ordering wait time, to the time it took to actually get the dishes, to the time it took to pay the bill and get out. 

bad experience man, and felt like a huge waste of 100 bucks. maybe I just ordered all the wrong things. anyway. I wouldn't come back and gamble another 100+ after today.
