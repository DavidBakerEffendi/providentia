This place totally sucks.  I had the unfortunate experience of dining at Onda while staying at the Mirage with my girlfriend.  We were utterly disappointed.  First of all, the service was slow and terrible.  But since we on vacation and not in any hurry, we were willing to overlook the service hoping the quality of the meal would compsensate.  Again, we were let down.  The pasta tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp too long and was reminiscent of something you'd expect from a hospital cafeteria.  Perhaps, I'm a little spoiled from dining in Chicago, but for the prices this place charges we expected a decent meal.  The Mirage should be embarrassed to even have this place in the hotel.  Look for better options in Las Vegas and spare yourself the inevitable disappointment of dining at Onda.
