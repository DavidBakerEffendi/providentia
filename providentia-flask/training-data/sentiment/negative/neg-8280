Had our car in for service nearby so decided to try lunch.  OK atmosphere.  We ordered what we thought was a personal size deep dish pizza to split since we didn't need a huge lunch and this looked ok for $12.49.  Hubby thought it was OK, I thought the crust was tasteless and the sausage was fatty.  Then we got the bill - and the pizza was listed as $20.99!  Well, we misread the menu.  The thin crust 10" was $10-something so we thought the $12.49 would have been the 10 inch deep dish.  Not so!  The $12.49 was for a 7" pizza!!  The "REGULAR" pizza was a mere 10" and was barely enough for the two of us and was $20.99!  And to top it off, hubby's 14 oz beer was $5.29!  So our "inexpensive" lunch cost us over $30 with tip - what a rip off!!! Better be sure you read the tiny little print to know what you're getting.  Now if you want the REAL Uno's pizza, take a drive to Platteville, WI and have one of the best pizzas of your life!!!!!
