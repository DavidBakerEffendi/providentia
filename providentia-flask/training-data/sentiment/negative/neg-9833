My family and I had dinner here for my mother and wifes birthday ... and it was the ABSOLUTE WORST. bread was cold and borderline stale. The pasta dishes my wife and sisters had were tastleless - it tasted like instant noodles with hot water as they didnt even bother to add salt. The gamberri (shirmp and scallop with some rose sauce and rice) dish I had was too salty. 

Now, add a waiter with an attitude to this mix and this takes this place from horrible to unacceptable.  

As regular of Spencers and Auberge du Pommier, this place doesnt even compare when it comes to the ambiance, service and the sophistication of the food. Want great food, nice ambiance and great service,  go to  Spencers and / or Auberge. Want to eat at something that looks like Grandma's kitchen, tasteless / overly salty food and crap service ... eat here!!!

They just lost the business of my whole family .. All 3 GENERATIONS who all live in the MISSISSAUGA ROAD area. 

Will NEVER be back and will tell everyone I know.
