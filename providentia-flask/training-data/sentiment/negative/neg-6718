Will never return! It shouldn't take 20 minutes to wait in line just to order!!! Ridiculous! The line took so long we just left! So many screaming kids. Adults without children should just avoid this place all together. And by the way, please tell the employees people DO NOT like to be called "boss". Completely unacceptable to talk to customers like that.

Blaze pizza has perfected this concept. PizzaRev doesn't win, place or show. Overall horrible experience.
