If I could give this place a zero star, it would still not be enough to describe my experience at this place. Only reason we decided to try this place was because my mom only eats Halal and likes her Pakistani food. And there's a serious lack of Pakistani food around the LV strip. So despite food being terrible, we went there a couple of times since it was across our hotel. In our experience at the restaurant, the only thing that was decent and worth ordering were the naans. The chicken boti dish was worth 12 something dollars for 5 pieces of chicken and plain white rice and was semi decent. The chicken karahi was immensely salty, and chicken tandoori was dry, old, reheated, and tasteless. They always claim to have recently ran out or their items on the menu, so the choices are limited to begin with. 

On our last visit to the restaurant, we placed an order and sat down to eat, we waited for 25 or so minutes only to be reminded by the girl working there that we need to place an order in the front before sitting down. We were famished and now furious to find out that they owner/ manager never took down our order and simply forgot because 'he is busy doing other work'. He was extremely rude, disrespectful to my bf and mom, extremely argumentative for an individual in a service industry, and outright outrageous. He simply kicked us out of the restaurant because while he claimed 'customers are always right', it wasn't his fault. What a nightmare! 

On top of that, place is extremely dirty and not a pleasant place to sit and eat at. 

On the up side, due to the owner's despicable behavior we happened to come across Urban Turban in the same neighborhood. They had impeccable sevice, delicious food, qaint and clean ambiance. I would recommend anyone looking for a delicious desi meal to spend an extra few dollars and try this place. We were all IMPRESSED!
