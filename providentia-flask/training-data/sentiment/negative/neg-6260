This place continues to decline...we have been increasingly disappointed each time and last night was the final nail in the coffin.  We called ahead to see if the game we wanted to watch was on there. First the person on the phone said, "I think we get that channel..." "Can you check?" "Yes, that game is on, I am watching it right now." We were there within 15 minutes,  but it wasn't on.  We were seated and 4 of the 9 tvs in our section were all showing the Ohio State -Wisconsin game which no one was watching.  I asked if one screen (any of the 4) could be switched since none of the tables were watching,  they said no.
   Our poor server had a party of 18 in addition to ours and other tables (i was in the restaurant industry for years, you don't do this), so we rarely saw him. When he first came to the table we said we weren't going to order right away,  he said, "And what will you have? " Apparently waiting to order wasn't an option. 
   The two at the host stand were repeatedly asked how long the wait was and repeated the same answer each time,"There's no way of knowing because the ASU game is on." The biggest issue with that was that it was only on one screen in our half of the dining room,  so it wasn't impacting table turns much, but most guests just left upon being told this. Another group who came in when we did had tried to call ahead for seating and we're told they don't do that. They were quite upset to see several tables pulled together for a different large group coming in...apparently that rule doesn't apply to everyone. 
   The food was okay, but just okay. Average food and terrible service maybe used to fly in Gilbert, but new competition is springing up every day. We will be taking our business there and giving them a shot, because we will never return here.
