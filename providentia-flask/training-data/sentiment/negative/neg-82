I went to this milestones last weekend for brunch and unfortunately it wasn't a great experience at all. First of all it took them 15 minutes to cone to our table to get our drink order meanwhile there was only four table in the restaurant. I ordered mimosa and when it came i noticed that the glass was cracked. I ordered Benedict and it wasn't done the way i asked for it and the fruits were not fresh at all.
