The staff could not understand my order in English; they should have people who can accommodate their customers and their orders. 
Once my food was done, it was all wrong after trying to explain to them exactly how I wanted my tacos. 
Besides that, the place was VERY dirty and had an unacceptable restroom with graffiti all over & a disgusting toilet which I did not even use.
Health department should review this place!!!
It's not right at all.
