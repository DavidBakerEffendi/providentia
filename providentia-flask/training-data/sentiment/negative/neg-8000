We came in around 2am feb 12th,2107 the place was less then half full. Grace was our waitress and it took 50 mins for our food to come out which every plate we received was cold. Ridiculous!!! When we spoke to Ashley the "manager" we explained we had no explanation, no apology of any sort. She granted us with 20% discount....really? What an insult to the experience we had this early morning. Moses was the only one I notice being apologetic and trying to help those around us who were also not being helped. To top it off Ashley seem to be blaming it on Grace for not giving the proper discount. Which ended up not making up for  the bad service you all have to offer on the over night shift. A table of 6 seated behind us left before their food came out because they were so upset. What a disappointing night for your team.
