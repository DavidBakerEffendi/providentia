Upon recently moving to Las Vegas , I had been looking for the ULTIMATE BEST Pastrami ! I asked a Jewish friend of mine who had been living in Vegas awhile ; and he would always refer back to "The Bagel Cafe". Finally I was in the Summerlin area and saw it by chance, and decided to drop in.First of all I asked if they sold Pastrami by the pound and I was told they did for $16.00 dollars a pound. I was shocked at the price, but decided to give it a try upon my Friends recommendation.Let me say it was some of the WORST Pastrami ever and LOADED with FAT, almost 40 % worth.DO THE MATH. If the Pastrami by the pound is 40% FAT; you are really paying $ 30.00 dollars a pound for the MEAT.
I grew up in the L.A. area, so I know a little bit about good Pastrami. The ABSOLUTE BEST in L.A. is The HAT Deli(A Chain) Or Canter`s Deli in Hollywood.My biggest problem with MOST places is "Overpriced and Underportioned" ; and Bagel Cafe fits the bill.I understand it is a Jewish Deli ; but do they have to honestly Gouge people for the prices ?? The Hat and Canters in L.A.serves up some of the tastiest LEAN Pastrami that I have ever had.Don`t expect Lean at The Bagel Cafe.Maybe in New York they like FATTY meat ; but not when I am Paying those prices THANK YOU !!
The Bagels were fairly Big ; but they were $1.10 each.Einstein Bagels are better and wayyy cheaper.
The Bakery case is the Saving grace of this place with some of the most delicious looking pastries and cakes ; but be prepared to pay $ 4-5 dollars for EACH item/Slice of cake or Pastry. Definitely NOT worth it. This is your TYPICAL "Overpriced and Underportioned " place.If money is NO  object, be my Guest ; but, if you`re looking for more Bang for your Buck ; don`t look here !! This is Vegas right ? The LAND of great food deals.Sometimes I MISS L.A. !
