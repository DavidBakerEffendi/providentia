My husband bought buffalo style and garlic parmigiana wings. The taste was great. Problem? They were not cooked all the way through. I told my husband they weren't cooked properly and I through mine out. My stubborn husband felt they were " fine" and kept eating and wound up sick through the night and next morning. So, he was the stupid one here, but that being said, Wing Time needs to teach its employees about raw chicken and the effects it has on the human digestive system!
