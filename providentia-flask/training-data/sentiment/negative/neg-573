I use to love coming to this place. And I've never had an issue before. I usually buy a regular size smoothie for myself and ask them to pour some of it into a kids cup for Caden. This time they told me that they cannot pour excess into a kids cup. I said that's fine because I'm not asking for the excess I just want them to pour some of my cup into a kids cup. When I went to get my cup they just gave me an extra little styrofoam cup on the side for me to pour my drink into. Which was fine for me but then none of the lids fit on it and we were getting it to go.  So I asked for a kids cup that I can put a lid on and they said that they couldn't give me one. They said they couldn't give me one for excess. I think they don't know the meaning of excess. Because it's not excess if it's pouring from my own drink that I purchased.  I thought this was hilarious. I feel like they don't know what it's like to have a kid. Kids spill drinks and so of course I want a lid for my sons drink. I paid more for a big size so I don't think it should be an issue. I know can pay less for a kids size. It's just that a reg size is more than enough for me and I share everything with Caden. I honestly don't think I'll be coming here again and will just make my own smoothies at home.
