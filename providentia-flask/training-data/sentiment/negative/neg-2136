Not very good strip mall Chinese food. Ordered the chicken lo mein which is basically noodles and soy sauce.  The sweet and sour chicken is out of the freezer and the chic pad tai gets a 2 out of 10.  The front of the store was littered with boxes of junk and boxes of product.  The wait staff was average at best and they didn't have a plastic fork.  If u want below average Chinese his is the place for you
