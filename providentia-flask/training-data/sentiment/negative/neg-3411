Are you fucking kidding me? I am in show business. I absolutely can take a joke and get the "theme" of a restaurant immediately. And at this place they throw it it your face as soon as you walk in. That's fine. But bad service and ridiculous prices, and an ugly wait staff force one to make you say "why the hell did I ever go here?". The staff plays their parts well, being total bitches. That's fine. But if you do that than be fucking hot. Like porn star hot. And at the VERY least, get the orders right and LISTEN to what we're paying almost 200.00 for. I could have easily played along had this waitress, who I am doing a kindness keeping her name out of this review, had gotten our order right, taken the time to listen to a damn thing we said, and delivered my friend his Sprite. I mean how long can it take to deliver a spite? I guess in this case of a totally inept wait staff, who couldn't get a job at Denny's, the better part of two hours. The terms, "you're fired", "what kind of idiot am I to choose such a place", and "don't quit your day job" come to mind. You're better off going to McDonalds. Embarrassing that this place exists inside a Las Vegas casino charging stupid prices. Never again. 

Had my fianc√© not been in charge of the bill, I would have walked out without paying a cent. Which was frankly MORE than this inept waitress deserved. Positive: The hats were funny. Fire your staff and start from scratch. Bitchy is a turn on folks. But only if they actually do their jobs and listen. Lucky I didn't throw my drink in their faces. 

If you're stupid enough to ever go to this place, you get what you deserve, as I did. My mistake. 
What the bloody fuck was I thinking?
