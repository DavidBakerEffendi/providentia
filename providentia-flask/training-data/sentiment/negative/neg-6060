Over the past few months this business is going downhill. This Sunday night was horrible. There was spilled soda all over the floor. The pizza was burnt. There is tagging all over the bathroom. The poor girl behind the counter tonight couldn't even help a customer who stated he paid online. She said she didn't know how to verify that! 

We didn't expect a 5 star place for pizza but seriously get a fresh coat of paint for that place and better staff!
