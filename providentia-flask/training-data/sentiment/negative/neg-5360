I'm giving this a 1 star rating strictly based on the steak. I got the bone-in filet and completely disappointed! I have yet to have a steak better than Sullivan's yet I continue to try and experiment with other places. The steak here, while a good cut, was not flavored/seasoned well at all. I prefer more of a peppery seasoning and this was completely lacking. I would not go back for the steak. 

However, the atmosphere was kind of cool. It's like eating dinner in a nightclub but without the crowd. The music they play was getting me in the mood to go out afterwards so I really liked that. The drinks were pretty good and our server was great!

Take the food out of the equation I give the place 4 stars. But paying $60 for a steak, the food weighed a lot on my rating.
