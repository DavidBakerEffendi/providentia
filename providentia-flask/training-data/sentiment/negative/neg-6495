Service was horrible... they forgot to bring me water so i had to ask twice and when i got it, it was warm... waiter dripping with sweat, chefs dont wear gloves when handling food... left our dessert on the counter for 5 minutes before bringing it to us so it was soggy when we got it... my boyfriend gave them a one dollar tip that they didnt even deserve.
