I am not commenting on the quality of food or service but find the restaurant's  self description didn't meet my expectation so I didn't eat there. 

Before deciding to go to Tom's Urban, I read the restaurant description promoting itself "serving an eclectic blend of the world's favorite street food." When I got to the restaurant and looked over the menu, it offered sliders, pizzas and street tacos. When I read "world's favorite street food" I had entirely different expectations and was expecting more international fare. I come from the perspective of having traveled abroad and eaten street food and was expecting something similar. My bad for having this expectation.
