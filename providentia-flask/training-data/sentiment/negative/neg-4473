We live nearby and walked in at 8:30 on a Friday. Many empty tables. Just four of us, looking for a cocktail and nachos. 

Hostess says "We're looking at about twenty". 

"Twenty what? Minutes?!" we say.

"Yeah, sorry, we only have two servers on staff" she replied. 

"We don't want to wait 20 minutes, you really don't want us to eat here??" There was maybe 20 people in the restaurant. 

"Yeah sorry, it will be 20 minutes". 

So we walked out. If they don't want us to sit at an empty table, we won't force our way in.

It was just okay the last time we went, right after they opened. Was hoping they would improve. I guess I'll never know, because I'm never going to attempt to go back.
