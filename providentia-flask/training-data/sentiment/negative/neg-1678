Worst service I've had in a long time. Which is a shame, because I really like Glass Nickel. We just moved to Sun Prairie and were planning to eat here all the time, but now we will never go there again.
 - Went on a Weds night, place wasn't busy at all. It became apparent there were no servers working here - the guy behind the bar waited on our table, which he seemed very uncomfortable doing.
 - No proper menus, we were just given carry out menus. No beer list. We were told to "look at the board behind the bar" which required us to stand and crane our heads over the partition.
- Messed up our drink order and our appetizer. Appetizer arrived after pizzas came out, we asked for it to be taken off our bill. 
- After our pizzas came out, NO ONE came to our table again. No one asked how the food was or if we needed drink refills - which we clearly did, everyone had an empty glass.

I will also note that this isn't my first bad experience with this location. I tried to order delivery a couple months prior. The guy who was taking my order was extremely rude. I wanted to order 5 large pizzas and he treated me like it was a HUGE inconvenience for him to take this order, total asshole. I ended up hanging up on him and taking my business elsewhere. I was willing to give them another chance by dining in - but it was a huge disappointment. It all just makes me very sad - it has such potential to be a great place to hang out, but instead it operates like it opened a week ago - awkward and choppy.
