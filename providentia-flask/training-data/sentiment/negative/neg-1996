I don't think a long review is warranted, simply because it's not safe for me to eat here (peanut allergy). 

Suffice it to say that the waiter straight up told me when I was about to order that it wasn't safe to eat. Good to know, but would be better if it was more well known (or at the very least, better advertised).

EDIT: To clarify, I asked before ordering what I could and could not eat, given that I had a peanut (but not a nut) allergy. The waiter then informed me that nothing was safe, and that's where I take issue: they could easily just clean the cooking material better, but not taking the time or effort to do so warrants my one-star review.

I did my due diligence to verify my situation, so please do not send me further hateful comments regarding my allergy. I cannot choose what I am deathly allergic to - I just have to deal with this throughout my life.
