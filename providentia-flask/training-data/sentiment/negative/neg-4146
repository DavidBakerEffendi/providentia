So my friends had been raving about Wahoo's Fish Taco for a long time so when I heard the new location at Boca was now open I got super excited. I haven't had a decent fish taco anywhere in Vegas and was really looking forward to a great weekend treat. It pains me to say that this was perhaps the worst fish taco, or food in general, I have ever had! The fish was as dry as the desert, along with the taco shells, and the entire combo entree, complete with rice and beans, was essentially flavorless. 

The ordering area had a very conveyor belt like feeling, there is no salsa bar so if you are ordering to go, as I was, you will only get hot sauce if you remember to ask. The sauces themselves definitely had heat, but again nothing particularly interesting or memorable in the flavor department. 

On the upside, the restaurant itself has a fun, open feel with lots of big screens to watch sports and a great bar and patio. I suspect if you're interested in a neighborhood cerveza hang, you will be pleased, but as for the food I'd have to say stop at the Baja Fresh across the parking lot for a fairly decent fish taco before heading to Wahoo's to meet your amigos.
