10/27/2017 I've been coming here for over a year. ordered meatball on my pizza like I have done before. They lied and said it was meatball. Turns out the owner herself lied about it being meatball and they tried to put regular ground beef on it.  I have recently seen this place gone downhill with service for about a month now. I gave them plenty of chances to redeem themselves. Now they won't even give a refund. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else. This is the last time I order here.
