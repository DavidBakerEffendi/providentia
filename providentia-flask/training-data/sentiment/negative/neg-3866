We went here while visiting Montreal for the Women's World Cup and needed a place to watch the USA game. We had checked previously via twitter to make sure they would be showing the match and was assured they would be. My friend that arrived first got us a table, and we were surrounded by televisions that were showing the earlier WWC matches... until they switched all the televisions to a different men's match, despite us being the only ones in that half of the building. It took about 20 minutes for them to get themselves situated and finally put the women's match on that we were there to see - thank goodness we got there early! 

The food was, to put it simply, quite underwhelming. I had poutine, which was okay, and my friends ate hamburgers that looked like frozen burgers - and not the good kind of frozen burger. Drinks were expensive and they had a shockingly bad selection of beer. 

Go somewhere else to watch a sporting event. Try Cage Aux Sports - they were extremely accommodating to us and the food was way better.
