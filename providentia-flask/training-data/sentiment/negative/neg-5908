I have spent my past 3 visits here telling myself  "Meh, its just an off day". After my last trip, im just done. Done and done. Yea, at one point it was good but that was years ago(like, before they expanded). Now its crap food with crap service. On my last visit the waiter dropped sushi in my lap, when it was finally replaced it was awful and then we had to wait 25 minutes for the check(and no, it wasn't very busy).  Ru Sans i am so over you and i will have a hard time trusting food advice from anyone that isn't.
