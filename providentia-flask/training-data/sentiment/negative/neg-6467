I was there in October 2012 and it was fantastic. I was just there again in April and bragged to my friends about how great it was and we were all horribly disappointed. We got there later in the evening and stood in this very slow moving line. I could see a ton of empty tables but for some reason they were staggering in the people about every 5 minutes or so. By the time we got close to the cashier, he anounced it would be closing in 30 minutes. We debated but thought we could eat and be out in 30 minutes. We got in. Service was bad. The server (not sure her name but long ponytail and hefty girl) was very unfriendly. Food was dry and as it got closer to closing time they took our silverware when we went back for "last call". They were still sitting people up to 10 minutes before it was to close and we saw them and were like WTF, those poor people really got ripped off. Anyway I was sad it was not what it was in October.
I have been to Luxur, Excalibur and Paris Buffet too and Paris is the best I have had in LV. I have been there several times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and would highly recommend it. I will probably try others at other hotels before going back for din at TI. I was really embarrassed that I had bragged so much about it to the friends I had brought.
