Just went here for lunch with my husband and our friend and after being there for an hour, I have left without eating. Our friend and I both ordered portobello dishes, but they were completely out of portobellos--which we weren't told about until after we had ordered. Common mistake.. No problem, so we ordered new dishes. 

I then ordered a breakfast pizza (brunch menu was available) without bacon because I am a vegetarian. My husband and our friend received their food and I was told mine would be out soon. They had both nearly finished their food by the time my breakfast pizza arrived...and it had bacon.  Lots of bacon that I couldn't even pick off if I tried. 

Didn't bother to order new food. Service was super slow and low quality. Very disappointed because I recently moved to Pittsburgh and am scouting out places I could enjoy in the future. Probably won't be going back here again.
