The overall quality and presentation left much to be desired. For this price point I'd have expected top shelf on both counts. Shrimp was small and translucent, unappetizing. King crab tasted ok but was small. Split legs were a nice touch. Prime rib had been split lengthwise for some reason and was dry and more done than it should be. Just generally a disappointment. Have and will try other Vegas buffets but this one, sadly is off the list now.
