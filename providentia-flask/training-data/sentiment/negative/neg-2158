This is not fine dining.

My older Son held his Wedding Ceremony here. After they had already booked the place, the Bride's Mother, the Bride, and myself, thought it would be a good idea to "sample" the food.

We were given "samples" of filet, fish, and pork. The appetizer samples tasted good.

Problem, at the wedding, the dinner plate was composed of sample sizes! The food was cold. What was supposed to be a Crab Cake, turned out to be a small crab salad, with a sprinkling of fake crab. 

The 6 ounce steak, was the size of about 3-4 ounces. All were precooked, and served cold. The mashed potatoes side was little more than a table spoon. Everyone left the wedding hungry. 

The room was very small. We had my wedding at Del Frisco's, and our room given as a comp, was twice the size for half the people. 

The cost for my wedding, with far superior, made to order food, and a full open bar was about $90 per per person.  My son's which had "Airline" food, and limited drinks, cost $140 per person. 

This place is known as an after hours place, that crawls with hookers, and druggies. In the summer, it is renown for it's topless pool and hip hop DJs. 

This is not a place to go for a good meal and "fine dining", and certainly, not a wedding.
