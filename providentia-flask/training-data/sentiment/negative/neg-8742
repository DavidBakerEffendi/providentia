Ridiculous and pathetic service.

Last Sunday, when the temperature was extremely hot (35 Degrees Celsius but felt like 40), my girlfriend and I were looking for a [hopefully] shaded patio in order to enjoy cocktails and perhaps some food. 

We were in the North York area and every other restaurant with patio was packed, thanks to the World Cup. We noticed that this place was almost empty and decided to go. 

So, we walk in and ask if we could be seated at the patio but the hostess denies us. I ask why, since the patio is half full (or half empty in this case lol), and she tells me that they're short staffed (*brilliant business strategy on the first weekend of the World Cup) and that they wouldn't be able to handle another table, but also that there's a long waiting list... so I look at the waiting list and there are no names! It's empty, so I ask her to put my name on the list and tell her we'll wait at the bar. 

We get to bar and there's 1 other man seated and 2 other tables with 4 people each nearby. I greet the bartender...Blank stare from said bartender. Ok. I spend the next 15 minutes trying to get his attention lol, raising my hand, trying to make eye contact, saying sorry. He doesn't say a word. Just blank stares. Keep in mind that the inside of the restaurant was almost completely empty, maybe 5% capacity.

Perhaps the barman was angry because they were short staffed and he was the only one making drinks for everyone in the restaurant... but it really wasn't busy at all. He wasn't being bothered every minute, and he was taking his sweet time making simple drinks. We were not offered water nor did he ask to take an order from us.

A few more minutes later, the hostess came to see us, I figured "great, we finally got a spot" but she only came to ask if we were going to be waiting at the bar... lol! At that point, we were fed up, so we decided to go elsewhere.
