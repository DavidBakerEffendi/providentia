Dreadful. I ordered it crispy or well done. It was soggy. Gross. About as appetizing as soggy underpants. The cheese and toppings can't even stay on. I think they forgot it was a delivery and let it sit. They also fuck you on the toppings. A buck for six jalepeno slices? A 20 dollar pizza that tastes worse than a 5 dollar shit pizza from little Ceasars. Save your money. The hunt for good pizza in Vegas continues. Just not here.
