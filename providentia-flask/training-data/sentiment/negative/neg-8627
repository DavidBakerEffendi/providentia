The food really isn't that bad. It's the rude people that work there. Just call and see. The lady I spoke to who I think is from the east coast is just a plain bitch. Nothing else to it. She acts like it's an inconvenience when you call her to place an order. When you go in, they have never said thank you, not even once, they never answer the phone nicely, they are just insincere and rude. It's really just bad customer service that makes this a terrible place. I used to go here quite often but honestly the service just isn't worth the convenient location.
