IF YOU CAME HERE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW ABOUT THIS PLACE, Start scrolling and you will see everyone mentioned a very rude lady. IF YOU COME AND SEE THE BITCH WITH THE NIKE LOGO EYEBROWS YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO COME BACK. SOMEONE FOUND A ROACH LEG ON THEIR SUSHI. I waited for 10 mins at the door no one sat me, even though a couple people walked past me and dindnt even look at me. I sat myself cause there was a ton of empty spots. This one lady got mad at me and said "WELL WE ALL BUSY SO" THIS B!TCH LOOK LIKE THE MATCH MAKER IN MULAN with her dark ass eyebrows.She actually asked me to MOVE OUT OF MY SPOT SO SHE CAN SAT OTHER PEOPLE THERE. WHERES THE FUCKING MANNERS?!? She brought me my water and slammed it on the table, I couldn't even drink the water cause I'm afraid she probably took it from the toilet, she took my order paper after IGNORING ME SOME MORE and tossed it to the lady making infront of me. EXTREMELY RUDE. I'm sure she's the owner too, IF THE OWNER IS TREATING PEOPLE LIKE THAT HOW THE WORKER WILL TREAT YOU?!? The worker was yelling across the restaurant in Korean, this family brought their young baby and the baby started screaming and the MATCHMAKER started giving them attitude. WOW JUST WOW. Reasonable price but service is horrible if you go around dinner it's best to go before 6, the quality is shit but cheap.
