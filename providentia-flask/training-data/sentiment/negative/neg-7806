I went in and the pizza was disgusting. The workers were extremely rude and one of them cussed at me! I think her name was Robin but she was not nice at all. Definitely not recommending to anyone and going to be telling everyone not to go. Seems like no one was clean and the environment was gross. The bathroom was....just awful. New owners suck. DONT GO IN THERE. Go to domino's instead. At least they are nice and wash their hands.
P.s. since I I didn't include a date he said this was a fake review. This happened a few weeks ago.  Again. Don't go there!!
