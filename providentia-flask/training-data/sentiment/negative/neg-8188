Came here with my sister on the weekend.  It wasn't overly busy but for some reason the waitress avoided taking our order for almost 15 minutes but had no problem refilling the water glasses at the table beside us several times.  My sister ordered the mushroom crepe and I had the chicken one.  I don't know what kind of chicken they used but it was far from being the texture of chicken.  Seemed more like soggy chicken flavoured tofu.  I'm adding some pics, was not impressed with the plates they served the meal on.  Seriously can't you afford to invest in new dishes that don't have chunks cut out!  Disgusting.  Won't be back.
