We stopped by to have a dinner with kids and got few pizzas and a salad. If kids don't like pizza it must be really bad (they said that even the school district one is better). One of the pizzas was ordered on thicker crust and came out all burnt under. We returned it and were told that this crust burns easier... so what?? if they know about it why not adjust the cooking time appropriately. When making pizza they didn't just brush the crust with little oil... they poured a whole bunch. Pizza was so greasy that my wife couldn't even eat more than 2 tiny slices. 

Salads look like an afterthought idea to sell to people that can't have their greasy pizza. 

I guess the idea of making your own unlimited topping pizza is great and there is a bunch of the similar type of places opened up recently. It's just PizzaRev failed miserably to deliver on it's fancy promise... I'd go to The Pizza Kitchen any day over this one.
