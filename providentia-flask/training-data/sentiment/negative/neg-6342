So, 6 of us sitting at a table in the middle of the restaurant. It took, let me see, about 20 minutes of someone to attend to us for just a presence of a server to talk to us. We asked about happy hour, server LISA said it won't be until 11pm. Ok fine so we decided to let her know that we will think about it and she said she will be right back. Literally NO one was on this restaurant. We had our mind set and ready to order. We asked a gentleman to ask for our server because it was time to order. (11pm happy our time). We kept waiting hoping Lisa would come, but she was just standing with her Co worker at our eye site looking at us and not doing anything at all. It's past 15 minutes, no water, no service we all decided to just leave the place. Being LOCAL checking out this new place. That was a terrible service.. in which this is being in the strip, expectations of good customer service should be implemented. Therefore, we went to CPK next door and received phenomenal customer service from Austin.
