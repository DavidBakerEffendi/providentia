Last night was the last time I will ever stop at this panda. My family and I went in there to have dinner. It was 9:05 pm. There was 5 employees there, not one acknowledged us. One lady was cleaning the glass, the other cooking, and the rest appear to be having a conversation through their headsets. We stood there for 5 min waiting for someone to say something. Worst customer service, what's wrong with these people?
