My girlfriend and I ate at this restaurant last night, so here's my personal review. We ordered the sweet and sour chicken, a special type of rice, won ton soup and a few other things and it all tasted great, service was fast and the staff was courteous. The reason for the 1 star review is because towards the end of our meal, my girlfriend says "is that an ant on the table"? It sure was. Between crawling on the table and the wall connected to our table, I counted a total of 6 ants. Completely disgusted by that and the fact that when I brought it up to the staff, he kills an ant on site by squishing it with his finger and then just walks away like it's normal. This is all it takes to keep us from ever coming back to this place again.
