The man who took my order was very friendly but as I sat down to wait for my food I noticed none of the workers were wearing gloves. As I watched, the man tossing the noddles had no gloves and to me that is very unsanitary. It's not hard to put on gloves. I mean for all I know the guys could have just left the bathroom and Didn't wash their hands. Then another worker wiped his hands with the sanitizer towel then grabbed some cabbage and became to steam it WITH HIS BARE HANDS! Gross. I addressed my concern with the man who took my order and he politely gave me a refund. I'll never eat here again which is unfortunate because the food is actually pretty decent.
