Don't believe the hype -- the only thing keeping this place open is the funny name. 

Paid $40 for 2 mediocre egg sandwiches. The bacon was so fatty you couldn't even eat it. The egg was so small I didn't even know it was an egg sandwich.

I ordered cold brew iced coffee which was good (and strong), but I also asked for a cup of water - they declined and said they didn't offer that; I would have to go to the bar (which was CLOSED!).

Watched a cook wipe his nose with his hand and proceed to still cook.

Don't plan on returning. Your money can do way better elsewhere for a breakfast joint.
