Went here yesterday for the first time since opening and ordered the chicken wings which were smoked.  The wings themselves (plain) were VERY salty and had buffalo and teriyaki on sauces on the side with a side of fries which were completely over salted!!! I hate salty food, (McDonalds does this to there fries now too) HEY!!!! customers can sprinkle their OWN damn food with salt. I was pissed and wished I had not went.  No MAS!
