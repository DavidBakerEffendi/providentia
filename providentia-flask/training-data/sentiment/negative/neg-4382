Pizza was soggy and had a very thick crust (this was not a deep dish or Sicilian). Prices were higher then those shown on the online menu.  When  shown the difference the delivery person  without hesitation pointed to the menu he brought showing the disclaimer that  prices can change without notice. This probably happens often.

Don't be a sucker and order from this masquerade of a pizza shop!
