When I drove by I had high hopes.  Not so much after stopping in.   The dogs were just ok.  I got the White Hot and a regular with Coney sauce.  The wife got a Kraut dog.  We each had an order of fries.  Mine were the garlic Parmesan hers were the rosemary.   We couldn't tell the difference between the two.  There was not enough salt/flavoring on either of them to tell the difference.  The Coney sauce tasted burnt.  The Kraut dog was just okay.  The white hot was just fine. And last of all the prices were very high.  We wont be back which is a shame.  The decor is great. The service was fine.    The place could be great it just needs some work and better quality control and 15 to 20% lower pricing.
