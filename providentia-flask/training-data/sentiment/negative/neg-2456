Brought my dad here to eat based on the "good" reviews BAD IDEA! From the moment we walked in and waited at the hostess stand. After being seated we ordered our drinks we then noticed stuck on food on my dad's plate so when the waitress brought us our drinks he requested a clean plate. All was good. We ordered mushrooms for starters, they were good. Next, we ordered our meals. I ordered "King" crab and a lobster tail which also came with a clam chowder soup. The soup was horrible no flavor no meat nothing really just a milk base with a couple potatoes. The crab was a joke there was nothing "king" about it unless you were pulling it from your fish tank.  As for the lobster tail it was very pretty but no flavor and on the rubbery side. My dad ordered filet mignon and didn't even eat a quarter of it I think that speaks for itself. Service from our server was good but we won't be back definitely wasn't worth the money next time we'll stick to our original plan of Outback!
