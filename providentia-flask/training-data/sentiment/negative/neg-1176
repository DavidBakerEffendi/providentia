I don't know what happen to the Olive Garden company, but I can say that quality and service is not what is use to be. This location in particular is just plain horrible. Went in for lunch today and it really took them about 10 min for any waiter,busier. human being that works there to acknowledge me. When the waiter finally came and took my order she did deliver it pretty fast, although it was just a soup and salad meal, but when she brought my meal, the plate the she served me had left over sauce on the side very noticeable but then she just wipe it off like quickly with her hand thats just plain disgusting, also the soup that i got was just broth. I will probably never come back to this place, I do hope the health district on the other hand pays this place a visit.
