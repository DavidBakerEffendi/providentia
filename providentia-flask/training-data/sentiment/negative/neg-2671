Very disappointed eating here after all the great reviews. We had a shrimp nachos dish which was huge, but was very bland had no flavor. Most of the cheese was not even melted. We also had a southwestern chicken taco salad which had a bad flavor and did not taste fresh. This was the worst Mexican food we ever had. Beware.
