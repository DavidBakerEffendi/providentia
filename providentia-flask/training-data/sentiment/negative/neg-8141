I keep trying to give this place a chance, but cant after my experience today. the drive thru is extremely slow. I was the third car and I waited 12 mins to actually get my drink in hand. now the drink. I ordered a 16 oz and was a little baffled when she told me my total was 5.89. that is more than a dollar more than Starbucks. come to find out a 16 oz is really probably a 20-24 oz. so I was charged and given a much larger coffee than wanted. to top the experience off, the guy who opened the window was rude. I said "good morning" and offered him my card. his reply back was "it 5.89". then after about 3 mins, he brings my card back and doesn't say thank you or any type of acknowledgement. finally my huge ass drink arrives, and hands me then drink with no thank you or parting comment. needless to say, I put my tip money back in my purse, customer service is such a big thing in this town because every business is replaceable. wish I could say the coffee was good, but it's pure sugar in every sip.
