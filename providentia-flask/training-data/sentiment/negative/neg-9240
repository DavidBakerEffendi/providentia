Perhaps the WORST "Italian" restaurant in which I've ever eaten.
* Dark and noisy.
* Ridiculously expensive - the cheapest dish was in the neighborhood of $30 AND there's something like a $15 fee for sharing
* Portions are small
* Food is tasteless and uninspiring
* "Wine" that was probably watered down - we joked that it was either a) old grape juice that had fermented slightly, or b) colored water that they showed a picture of a wine bottle to and told it "you're not the wine they want...you're the wine they need"

On the + side:
* the little dude wandering around and playing accordion was hilarious.
* the bread was good

Never going back there again.  This is a hole in the wall that should be spackled over, sanded, painted, and then set on fire to collect the insurance money.  Because that kind of thing NEVER happens in Italian restaurants.
