I visited red sea a couple of years ago, and I really liked the atmosphere and the service. I'm sorry to report that things have changed and I will not be visiting red sea again. I visit different hookah bars often and I must say this is one of the worst experiences I have had. The bowl got over heated and instead of fixing the problem, he took the coals off and told us to wait... Really? The Shisha is burned to the top of the screen, waiting is not going to help. I could have just smoked my hookah at home.
