Overall I really like the Pickle Barrel chains, but this one stands out as terrible.

We had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was full of empty tables because, "we don't have enough servers to serve you." Once seated it was another 10 minutes before a waitress came by and took our order. 

The CHOCOLATE milk shakes was a light khaki colour for the lack of chocolate, and came in a mug with a broken handle that almost cut my hand open. My dessert spoon had mysterious crud stuck to it.

And, on top of all this, the waitress short changed me when I paid in cash!!

Unless you enjoy having to wait, being ignored, and then served substandard food and overcharges, STAY AWAY from this location of the Pickle Barrel.
