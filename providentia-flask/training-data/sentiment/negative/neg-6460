Stopped in on Monday night at 6:45. Ask to sit outside and got seated. Had menus given to us. Sat there for over 10 minutes and no drink orders, water, not a thing was said to us. Waited 5 more minutes then got up and walked out. A server stopped us and said are you leaving? I said yeah I waited 15 minutes and did not even get a glass of water? Lots of restaurants on Shea want my dime so I'm out. Another server apologized but there were just 5 tables on the patio.. They were not busy.. I've had drinks there at the Bar and the bartenders were great but I guess sitting away from the bar is a bad idea. Anyway went to Jade Palace and had amazing moo go gai pan. Update: 2/21/18 as you see the customer service manager contacted me, I gave him my number and he said they would be in touch. Still yet to hear from them about my experience.
