This place is very unimpressive I've had better tasting Chinese food at Panda Express or any other fast food Chinese hole  in the wall.

Everything was just a bunch of watery vegetables with a few pieces of meat or shrimp. Every dish no matter what it was tasted the same and looked the same. Boring tasteless food.
