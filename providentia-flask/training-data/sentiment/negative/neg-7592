SCAM!! We saw a few pictures of the minced beef with rice on Yelp and it wasn't on the menu so we asked the waiter if it were possible to make this for us. They ended charging us $20 for the dish and the average price of all their rice and noodles dishes is $15 so we thought that was very suspicious. I didn't think to look at the menu prices on Yelp at the time but I just looked and the minced beef rice was $12.50. Menu prices have probably changed a little by then...but not $20. RIDICULOUS!!!!! 

Moving along.. We got our check and paid. They never gave us our change. It was so hard to get their attention because they kept avoiding our table and looking away. Finally we flagged someone down and asked for our change. They assumed the change was tip. Ok a restaurant should never assume the change is tip. You can't just keep a customer's change without asking. And we didn't even leave enough for it to be considered tip.... Anyway we were very upset because the service was just really bad. We got our change and left a tip that we felt reflected the service. As we were walking out, the waiter ran to us and told us that they don't need our change and handed us back the tip. I think this speaks for itself.....
