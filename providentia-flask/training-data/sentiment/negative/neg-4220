This place sucks. Twice now I've gone. The first time they put onions in my pad Thai. Who the hell does that? Doesn't say it has onions on the menu. So whatever, I'm over it. I go back to give it a second shot. I get the panang curry. How can you screw that up? Right? I get home and guess what? More onions!!! Again, didn't say it had onions on the menu. If you didn't notice, I hate onions. Also I don't appreciate paying 10 bucks for a meal, when your menu lies about what's in it. Screw you papaya Thai.
