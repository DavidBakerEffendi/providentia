Horrible, horrible, horrible service. I waited over ten minutes during lunch to have someone take my order. I made eye contact with multiple people and nothing... not sure why I was being ignored because the place wasn't even that busy. 

I ended up walking out. I won't be returning here, which is unfortunate given I work close by and love sushi.
