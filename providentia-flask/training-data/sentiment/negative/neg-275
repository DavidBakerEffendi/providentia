This review is only about my recent visit. 

I only go to Tim Hortons for three reasons: sausage biscuit, ice capp, and honey cruller. On my most recent visit, I decided to change things up and tried their strawberry shortcake doughnut. It's a specialty doughnut, so it cost more than the usual. Despite its fancy presentation, the doughnut didn't live up to its name. The doughnut was, basically, two dry pieces of doughnut sandwiching whipped cream and strawberry jam. Extremely disappointing. Also, the service was unsatisfactory... The cashiers didn't even make an effort.
