Horrible! Spent 45 minutes waiting for a table then spent another 1 waiting for our food. Had a table of 5 with 2 bowls of Pho and regular entrees for the rest. In order for us to get our food we had to ask the waiters and waitresses why it's taking so long at least 3 times, and each time we asked they came back with "let me check on it." Anyways, it was towards closing of the restaurant that we had received our dishes after everyone had left. Even then when new people kept coming in, they had received their food first instead of us. So before we left we attempted to chat with a manager about the lack of service and was given a bus boy to come to us instead. We explained the issue and they did nothing to resolve it on their own. The actual manager and owner saw us multiple times and did nothing to assist. Worst Vietnamese restaurant ever. Da Vang is better than this place. 

Now for the food, the bowls of Pho were small and the broth was plain chicken broth. The entrees were not only cold they were in small portions as well. For the amount of food you get here the price is definitely not worth it. 

J out.
