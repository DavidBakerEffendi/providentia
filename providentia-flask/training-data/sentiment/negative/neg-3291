Obviously the staff has been changed and it's not for the best my boyfriend has lived in this area forever so I am a regular we sat at the bar for 20 mins before being asked if we need help ahhh duh we are here of course the water had stuff floating in it from glasses being dirty and the soda we ordered after that was flat soup was cold wings were salty steak was over cooked and service was horrible let's rewind go back and attempt to regain old staff the flow was better energy was better I'm never going back
