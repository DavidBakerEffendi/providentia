Welp, I have to do it. I have to smash this location in particular, in the kisser. 

When I am in Calgary for business I will go to this place because they have tofu and larger tables to meet with staff etc...the service has NEVER been good on the lounge side - ever. 

After going here for nearly 5 years on and off the final straw was this month (Feb) when we arrived to actually meet friends in the lounge. They were there for 10 minutes before us an an un-bussed table waiting to be acknowledged. 

We tried several times to flag down a server - and finally had to beg a busser (after bussing our own table) to find us someone to take our money.

The usual brand of college aged, aloof & ditsy type person was offered to us. We had to beg twice more for a couple of rounds of drinks and traded horror stories about that location. 

To add, I was the only one who ordered anything because everyone else wasn't going to pay $$$$$ for poor service. I ordered a side salad add tofu. It came on a side plate, about 1.5 cups of "mixed greens out of the bag" and 2oz of soggy tofu for a grand total of $10.50. 

(Later in the week I was in Vancouver on business as well and found the same dish for $7.50 served in the lounge by somewhat more attentive staff).

Calgary isn't a great foodie hotspot but these "Donnelly" type locations should have their butts in gear after decades on the food scene. It's a repetitive business that is just sucking wind. I don't care WHO serves me as long as they care that I am there. 

Officially, boycotting Earls Restaurants in Canada.
