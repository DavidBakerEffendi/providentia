Got seated in decent time frame. Waiter came by and i ordered the ramen, not spicy for the baby (as I'm pointing to my toddler). Waiter is impatient Ramen comes and its spicy. I tell the lady I asked for no spice amd told her who i ordered it with. She walks off. She walks by later and i asked if the other ramen is coming soon. And she replies "you want another one?" Seriously. Finally another gets delivered and I'm reminded that when i order in the future, let them know if i don't want it spicy. Um. I did. The waiter that took the order comes by and tells me the same as the lady and i reminded him that i did. I'm pissed at this point and ready to leave and ask for to go container for my son's ramen. They bring me a container that is wet?! Um. Is it used and rinsed?! They said it wasn't amd they just washed it for me. What?! Ok I'm done here. And btw... so many of their dishes were going around with no covers. Won't be back.
