Don't come in for a beer cuz they don't have any... Chips and salsa not as good as Chuys was and the menu was a) inaccessible (I don't want to read a novel, I just want some tacos) and b) EXPENSIVE!!!

The staff seemed entirely disinterested in working or engaging the customers. Yes, there were TVs - half were tuned to infomercials. Most striking was the deafening silence -no music, no TV audio, no nothing. I won't be going back.
