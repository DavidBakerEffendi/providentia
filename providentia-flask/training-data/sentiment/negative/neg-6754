If you want to feel unwelcomed this is the place to go. Not only is the staff unfriendly but the patrons will constantly stare and throw daggers your way if you don't look like a hipster. The self-service area contained only a few napkins (which I refilled for the other patrons who rudely stared while I did) and ran short on eating utensils. Two separate times staff members went to the self-service table and didn't bother to refill the forks or knives. When asking the staff questions we were met with ambivalence and made to feel like we were waisting there time. Will not ever be back.
