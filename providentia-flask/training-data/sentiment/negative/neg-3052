Ugh.... I was really disappointed by my visit - after hoping for a great experience at this new location - on a route that we frequent often!

The chicken used in the burrito is very spicy - too spicy for my wife - and barely okay for me.  

The selection of add on's is very limited- particularly versus MOE's (in nearby Cranberry); no sauteed onions, no roasted corn....

There is no option for whole grain wrap, like you can get at.... (moe's...)

The chips are greasy and at additional expense - unlike that other place....

The quantity of food is less than that other place as well  - where we often have some leftovers for a later snack....

I won't be going back.
