The Pho was good can't complain about that , but the service just made it a completely experience. Waiter only cane to the table to take our order , and to deliver our food. Other than that M.I.A . Never came back to check if everything was okay at all even once . I never got a water refill . I had to personally get up and ask, they weren't even busy. I personally don't recommend this place . Horrible customer service. I as a customer will never come to this location again.
