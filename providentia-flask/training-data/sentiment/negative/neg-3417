Where to begin on this fiasco the 4 cups of 16 oz glasses of orange juice equaling out to $20 !! no water on the table no re fills for orange juice, burnt English muffin on eggs Benedict , extremely rude service bye wait staff after being told to wait 15 min on a sat morning day before Easter then after getting to our tables another 5 10 minutes to find our server who we still have no idea name or no name greeting to the waitstaff  hostess talking about us when we can see what there saying and when there pointing MOST UNPROFESSIONAL  RESTAURANT ON THE STRIP. We should of ate at the coffee and donuts shop in the lobby would of been a faster and nicer service then inside the restaurant. When we complained about the burn't toast see pics they laughed and we saw them. Being a cook myself I hold standards. The eggs Benedict sauce was bland tasted store bought. The prices just extremely pricey for breakfast at Donald Trump hotels las vegas they only offer DJT and dine room service however if the food nearly tasted as bad as the experience and I mean the overall experience was that bad I would never step foot in a DJT OR TRUMP hotel ever again. You would think that if a customer sent back a burnt muffin that the GM would of at least looked at our bill and comped the food on that item or walked over and talked to us and said sorry for the mishap however they stood on there perch on the wall near the kitchen door. I am shocked at this experience. I highly recommend eating else where on top of it our bill was 50 + something with no comps VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED
