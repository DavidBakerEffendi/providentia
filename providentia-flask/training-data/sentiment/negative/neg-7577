I can see why this place needs all their many celebrity endorsements. It's because their food sucks. 

My girlfriends ordered cupcakes there. They looked fabulous and cost more than the usual cupcake, but they tasted like crap. The tops were rock hard. We had to peel them off and the frosting was overly sweet. I tried the red velvet and chocolate and the red velvet was the best of the two, which isn't saying much. 

This place is called the Sugar Factory so they should be really good at all things sweet, but I really don't think they care what they sell their patrons. They have the name and the publicity so they will continue to make money off their terrible food. I would love to see a picture of a celebrity taking a bite out of one of their cupcakes instead of sucking on a lollipop.
