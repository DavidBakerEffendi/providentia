Worst pizza ever, and they got my  order wrong and late like always, NOBODY LIKES HAND STYLE CRUST that's why they are 5 dollars, I paid extra for a pan crust but brought me the nastiest hand crust pizza ever, the pizza was "$11" plus $3 delivery fee +$1 tax +$2 tip....total $17 on a $5 pizza .
Never having pizza hut again.
