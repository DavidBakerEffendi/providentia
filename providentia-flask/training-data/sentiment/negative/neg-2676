I have come to this one a few times. Every time I go something is messed up. The last time I came, no one gave me the soda I paid for. I didn't notice until I got home. I wrote an email to them and got no response.  I just came again for pizza, let them know what happened last time and their response was a mumbled, "well that's no good," and stared at me with no intention of ever fixing it. Definitely won't be retuning to this Pizza Hut. Spend your money somewhere else, even Little Caesars has better customer service than that.
