Just went to the grill here and our presence wasn't even acknowledged. They weren't even busy. We walked up the hostess said have a seat-didn't offer any menus or a warm welcome. And after sitting for about 5 minutes w/out being serviced we decided maybe sitting at the counter may be a better option. We sat down and again there were at least 2 servers and a busser still no hello or a menu. Made eye contact with the cooks-still nothing. So after about another 7 minutes we decided to leave. How hard is it to greet someone and you WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY? Just flat out rude. I went there b/c I was in the area and the yelp reviews. Never again!
