I have been eating Capriotti's for over a decade.  They opened this location recently and I have been in before and everything was fine; good food and friendly service.  Not so much today.  We arrived a little before 12:20 and the polite cashier took our order and we paid by 12:20.  It is now 12:58 and my husband has no food.  It took over 20 minutes for my Italian sandwich to be made and it was mediocre at best, the veggies aren't as fresh as I am used to.  At minute 30 my husband asked about his sandwich (he is a tall and friendly guy) and was told with attitude that they didn't have a ticket with his food on it.  He was then ignored while workers snapped at each other to make his food.  I worked in an expensive seafood restaurant and know what customer service is and this isn't it.  There was no apology and I am frankly livid.  It has now been over 40 minutes with no food and no acknowledgement whatsoever.  People that came in 5 minutes ago have their food while my husband sits hungry.  Any sort of apology or act of remorse or care would be great and I will update if one comes.  If not I will drive out of my way to never come here again.

Update:  After 46 minutes my husband received his cheesesteak.  It is hot and delicious and he got an apology from the cashier.  It seems to be her first job but she tried and I commend her for that.  Whoever owns/ manages this location better look at their staff and figure it out or they will lose business for sure.
