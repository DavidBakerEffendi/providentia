I've frequented Carolinas over the past few years and have had mixed experiences. The last two visits have been subpar and today's experience inspired me to leave this one star review. I decided to stop in for a late carryout dinner at 730pm hoping to get in and out quickly. To my discontent, it took me nearly 25 minutes to get my food (2 tacos, beans and rice). There's absolutely no reason why tacos should take more than 5 min to serve, especially at a restaurant who specializes in them. By the time I got home five min later the food was lukewarm and the chicken tacos severely lacked in flavor. If that wasn't bad enough, I only received about a spoonful of rice with my meal. Not even enough rice to feed a small child. This is not what I was looking forward to after a long day of work. This experience will probably be my last at Carolina's.
