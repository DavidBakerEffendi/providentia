So we were staying at treasure island for two nights right and we saw we had a coupon and we came and it was 35 dollars still so we waited like 10 minutes for our server to get there and we went and got our food and the miso soup tasted like the cheap 30 cent soup you would get at Walmart and then the crabs did not taste that good never ever coming back here.
