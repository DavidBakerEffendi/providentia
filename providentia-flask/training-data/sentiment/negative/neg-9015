We decided to head for BJ's over Fuddruckers last week. I ordered my favorite Jalopena Burger medium.  My hubby ordered sliders well done. When they came out everything looked beautiful, like a picture. I took a bite of my tough burger. My husband opened up his burger and it was medium. I do no appreciate overly done meat and my hubby likes his cooked til it's dead! When the waitress came back we made the decision to have our meal done again. When my burger came out, the presentation was not very comforting. It was not built up the way the previous burger had been served. This time my wedge fries came out over done and lukewarm! My hubby noticed that his wedge fries were also overdone this time round. I took a few bites out of my burger and left all my wedge fries which are normally scarfed up first thing. I left a whole burger on my plate. I said WE WILL NEVER GO BACK. I do believe it is the way things are said to the cooks in the kitchen. They tork them off with some comment about the food. What should be done, is just put in another order. After the food is checked, THEN the comment can be made about the first order for this customer. This way the manager, who SHOULD be bringing out the replacement dish can see with their own eyes what is on the plate. I can say the coffee is good.
