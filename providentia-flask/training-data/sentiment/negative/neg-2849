Why we keep going back is beyond me! Service is always terrible , the steaks were good and that's it., that's as far as it goes . Food runner brings our food and reaches across my face to serve my husbands plate to him, rather than walking behind me and serving him on his side ! Next... The sides took over 5 min. To be served.. I've waited tables in the past and have never forgotten on how to serve ppl, plus i tend to be a bit more  patient , I'm tired of wasting good money on so so food and crappy ass service .... We're done !
