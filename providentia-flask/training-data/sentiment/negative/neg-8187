A couple weeks ago, I came to Matsuda for dinner. I won't be back.

I don't think I can visit another AYCE with worse service.
They always serve you only half of what you order, pretend to not see you when you're trying to get their attention and the place is just not clean!

2 hours of waiting before any food arrives. 

Yes, the food quality is slightly better than other AYCE sushi restaurants. But I live in North York and happy to have sushi legend near me when I want my AYCE sushi  fix. 

There's always something dirty in the utensils they serve in. 
My submitted photo already made the lipstick stain less obvious...
No thank you!
