I only went because I had a coupon for a free Bacon Clubhouse Burger which was as expected... blah.  With all the wonderful Non Fast Food places to get a burger these days (at a fairly competitive price) why ever choose fast fast food?  Really?  Why?

I haven't been to McDonald's in about 5 or 6 years and no reason to ever go again.
