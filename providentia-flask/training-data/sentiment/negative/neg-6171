I would NEVER eat here again! They dont wear gloves when they prepare the food and I totally understand that you dont have too since the grill is right there but not everyone works on the grill and the same woman taking money I witness her cut my sub. Sandwhich was not worth $11. Jersey Mike's is much better!
