Here after church for friends bday. The wait time was not bad for a party of 6 and baby. 3 out of the 6 people enjoyed their meals. But this is my review and unfortunately I was one of the not happy customers. I ordered a simple turkey club. It was brought out missing the bacon and the bread wasn't toasted either...so I had a bland turkey sandwich for 11 bucks? Not a good experience. I am sure other options would have been better but this item will be off my radar from now on.
