To be honest this joint should be 1.5. But here, today, I don't feel to round up to 2. 

Popeyes is undoubtedly the best fried chicken a chain has to offer to its clientele. 
But at this location there are few things that are essentially important for a food joint to keep in check so that customers can plan to come back again:
- fast service: the biz falls under the category of FAST food right? Well, this one it ain't. 
- friendliness: not a very welcoming approach. 
- flavour: some of us ordered a spicy chicken (some ordered tenders some other the wings or the Cajun sandwich). It's supposed to be spicy: once again, it ain't. 

Gotta be honest though: this time the food wasn't greasy at all, it was well fried, but this is all I have to give them in favour. Anything else, unfortunately not. 
Turn to other Popeyes if you don't mind walk/drive a bit.

Or, if you feel more like for an independent joint, you might want to give it a try to a new restaurant  not far from this location that turns these little birds into a full flavour experience: "The Dirty Bird Chicken + Waffles" on 79 Kensington Ave.
