This is one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had- one of those that my boyfriend and I still look back on and laugh about. When we first entered there was no one to seat us for some time, we picked a table along the wall and quickly came to find that there were countless ants making their way up the wall, marching single file, straight to our salt and pepper shakers. Again, couldn't find a waitress, so we re-seated ourselves, and explained calmly that we had to move due to ants (which were sprayed with what appeared to be blue windex and wiped away haphazardly by a bus boy). While perusing the menu at our new table, two ants walked across it. WHAT the heck, did we bring them with us from the other table? Are they still crawling on me? Is the whole restaurant infested?  Gross. At this point, I want to leave but the boyfriend is begging starvation and we end up staying. Our salads come. Mine has a hair in it. I'm out. Grossed out. Didn't even try my chicken parm. The boyfriend had a soggy seafood pasta which a watery oily sauce. They do appear to make their own noodles though which I think deserves credit. In any case, I was right (as I usually am), we should have just left.
