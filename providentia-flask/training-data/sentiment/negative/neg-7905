So ive ordered the delivery three times now. same thing each time. The Combination egg noodle soup. Supposed to come with egg noodles, shrimp, and pork. Everytime Ive ordered this, I've literally received 1 shrimp. Yea, ONE SINGLE SHRIMP. You should rename it the "Egg noodle with pork a ONE single shrimp tail."  And I dont know why you changed your egg noodles but they were awful. Probably wont order here anymore.
