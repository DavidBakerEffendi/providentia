Very bad experience. Fails completely in regards to food as well as service. This was perhaps the worst service experience I have ever had. The owner was too rude and unprofessional. She needs to get management and hospitality courses and then run a restaurant. Terrible value for money and too small portion sizes.

It all started with warm beer. When asked the server told that their cooler was not working. If this was the case then they should have told that the same before. Then we ordered the appetizer "Delhi ki papri chaat" which according to the menu should have papri, potatoes, chickpeas and chutneys. But we were served with just papri and chutney (no potatoes, no chickpeas, plain papri and chutney). On asking the server told that he will call the owner to talk to. The owner never showed up until we were done eating the main course. On asking the server again to call the owner to talk to but she didn't even have the courtesy to show up. On our getting upset on receiving the check, the server was able to call the owner lady who instead of accepting the mistake or apologizing and replacing the dish, kept saying that they alter the menu for their american customers and were too busy to change the menu. On top of that, to my surprise, she blamed is for calling her thrice to enquire about the appetizer we were served as she was too busy that evening and kept on giving lame excuses. We ended up getting no replacement for the appetizer and ruining our dinner!!!

Would never even think of going there and would not recommend ever.
