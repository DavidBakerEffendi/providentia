I'll be honest I did not get a chance to even eat here. However, the service is severely lacking in my opinion. I walked up and reviewed the menu board and asked for the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce. "What bread?" I'm asked. I repeat that I'd like the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce with tomatoes and black olives. The reply, "we can't do that, the lettuce is small you need the bread". Not quite sure that I understood, I asked "You're saying I can't get chicken salad without the bread?" The reply, "you need the bread."

Now I like bread as much as the next guy but sometimes I just do not want to be filled up by bread. I've always assumed that chicken salad could be eaten by itself and enjoyed in that manner. In fact, I've eaten it this way for many years. Apparently that was incomprehensible to the staff here. I won't bother returning in the future.
