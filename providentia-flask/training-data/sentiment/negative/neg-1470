This is probably the third or fourth time Yelp has let me down when it comes to picking a new place to eat. I went here during a relatively slow time and I probably wasted 30 minutes to receive my substandard meal. Regardless of that the service is absolutely horrible (but expected); the servers have no idea what they are doing and know nothing about the food they serve. I wouldn't recommend visiting this place as it'll be a waste of your time.
