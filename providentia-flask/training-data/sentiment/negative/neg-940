I've given sushi D many chances ( I was in denial that they're standards had gone down, it was in times - not too long ago, a great place). 
I should've seen the red flag and left when I saw their former table server making the sushi. 
I will never come here again. They even managed to mess up the best thing they have on the menu : rock shrimp. Truly a saddening disappointment.
From the waitress who looks like she hates her job and never smiles, to the quality of te food that had depreciated, I just don't know how they're still in business. I'd rather go to Akita sushi, where the food is fresher an tastes better. 
Farewell Sushi D, wish I could say it's been a slice, but...
