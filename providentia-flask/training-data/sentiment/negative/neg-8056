The only good thing about this place was the service.   Service was awesome now just need a new cook.  My girlfriend and I were highly disappointed with the quality of the food.  We started with the 3 wing garlic Parmesan as a appetizer.   These are full chicken wings and are huge.  These lacked any real garlic Parmesan taste and left much to be desired.   We still had high hopes for this bbq place.  I ordered the half rack of ribs and beef brisket and side of fries.  The ribs game out very dry and burnt with little meat.  The beef brisket was very overlooked and tasted like roast beef.  The fries were average and only decent item with my meal. I expect more out of a true bbq restaurant.  My beautiful girlfriend ordered the ny strip steak with asparagus.  The menu described the steak as melt in your mouth.  They must be thinking there customers are sharks because the steak was so tuff and dry and was a big disappointment to my girlfriend who had a tuff time just chewing this meat. Now we drove Out of the way to visit this highly yelp reviewed BBQ place.  Now I have to take my gf to coach outlet to makeup for this huge mistake.
