Gave this place one more try because I really want to like it but all 3 times we have been unimpressed with the food.  Here we sit on a Friday night and the place is empty while all the other restaurants are packed. Overcooked burgers, floppy fatty bacon on the blt, so so food choices... sadly we will not be back.  3 strikes and you're out.
