I've gone to this establishment two other times and had no issues. However there is a first time for everything. I stopped by today at around noon, ordered a Coconut Milk Tea with Boba. To be told they have run out of Boba. This was definitely the last time I go here. I'm still shocked at how a place runs our of Boba 2 hours after opening. I will stick to No. 1 Boba Tea.
