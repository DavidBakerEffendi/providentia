I had eaten here before and it was great. Although it had been very long since my last visit. I had decided to spend the 48.00$ and enjoy some seafood. I was extremely disappointed. I was one of the first few people in line, so I was one of the first to get food and my first bite set the bar for the rest of the evening at this buffet. Everything I bit into was COLD. It tasted as if they saved the food from the night, hell the week before. After a few times around the Buffet and trying to find something decent of which there was nothing. I gave up and had some dessert which was probably the only food that was good. Even the shrimp still had that nasty brown line running down it and you know what that is. I honestly felt as if I was going to be sick. I worried about it for a few hours. My advice to anyone that enjoys to eat. Drive right on by this place and go directly to Caesars. I'm not trying to give them the business and they have some issues as well but for the $$ spent it's a way better deal and the food is really fresh and warm.
