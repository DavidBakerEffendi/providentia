You know it was a bad meal when your server brings you the bill and says "at least the bill came fast," then hovers over you watching you pay. Where was all this attention when we actually needed it?

We waited at the front for a while for a hostess. That was clue number one we should of left. We were seated and ordered our appetizers. They took 40 minutes just for 2 apps. Once they came out we then ordered our entrees so they'd be ready quicker. They took 30min.
The reason we went to Milestones was for their steaks. We were told they were out of steaks. I ordered the chicken club. I was then told they were out of the bread but could put it on a burger bun. My boyfriend ordered the burger. Food was dismal. Burger bun was too big for sandwich.
The apps were disappointing. We got the popcorn shrimp. It's a brown bag (looks cheap) with popcorn, then 6 little shrimps on top. Let's be real here, how much does popcorn cost? Next to nothing. They could of at least seasoned it. The fries as an app we wouldn't of ordered had we known we'd be getting the burgers with fries. 
We agreed we could of gone to an actual burger place (The Works) for better burgers & service. 

Had they told us right away that they were behind in the kitchen, we could of left or been prepared. Had they told us they were out of steaks we could of left or decided to wait it out for a different meal. There was NO accommodation made to try to make up for them being out of steaks & bread. No apology. No manager came to our table to try to fix it.  We came in from the advertisement and we told too bad we're out. Feels like false advertising.
