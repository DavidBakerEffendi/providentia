I like Del Taco in general, but I won't be going back to this location. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with no sauce, but they gave me one with sauce. The tortilla was hard and it looked like it had been sitting for awhile. I also had to wait for them to come back to the window for part of my order that they forgot.
