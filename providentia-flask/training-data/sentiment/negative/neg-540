Decent food let down by totally rubbish service. Went for lunch and BEWARE if you ask for anything that deviates from the exact menu. Actually, even on menu stuff the staff seem to be confused by. I wanted a greek chicken wrap minus feta and despite asking multiple times the staff put a lot of feta on the wrap. The person I was with wanted the Mediterranean sandwich minus the egg and what she got was a bog standard lettuce sand which with mayo...the staff just couldn't understand us. The one turned round to see if there was such a thing as a "Mediterranean" sandwich on the menu, which there obviously was since we saw it and ordered it! The staff at the checkout looked and sounded utterly fed up and served us with about as much enthusiasm as someone going to have their wisdom teeth extracted. Oh and they had also run out of bagels by noon. There are plenty of decent spots to eat around here, my advice is to go to them and steer well clear of this place.
