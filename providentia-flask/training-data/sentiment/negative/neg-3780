This is a particularly bad Boston market. Came for lunch and they were either out of most of the sides or they'd been sitting under the heat lamps so long that they were awful. Also, I ordered the three piece chicken and got two legs that were smaller than the average wing and the smallest thigh I've ever been served. And they were understaffed and the staff they had was borderline incompetent... definitely slow as hell. Anybody needing chicken or home style food would do better to go a block away and get something at the fry's grocery store.
