Too pricy for a vegan. They don't have that option. Had a bowl of salad. Fantastic salad but rest was blah. Horrible Asian selection. Kimchi & tofu soup was okay but Italian & rest was hohum. Seafood stunk. Meat platters were disgusting to look at but what am I to do with a family of 10. I was out voted. If they had vegan choice at 1/2 price I wouldn't be giving them 1 star. $35 for small bowl of greens is just too much.
