First off ive given this restaurant 3 chances...the reason why we go there it's because they do have boba as well so it makes it easier to kill two birds with one stone. But you guys need work I'm the type that enjoys pho at least one or twice a week and it's lacking...what type of Vietnamese restaurant doesn't have spring rolls?  Annie Pho all day people get it right and save a couple bucks because it's pricey for pho anyone that tells you this place is the best doesn't know pho..
