If I can give zero I would.  I'm walking out of this place with my family as we speak.  I bought a 80 dollar Groupon for 40. Good deal right? Wrong. 
I went to this place with 4 people including myself. The Groupon states that you only have to spend 80 worth of food. The "chef" came over very aggressive asking to see our Groupon. My dad went to sign in his Groupon as she tried to snatch if phone out of his hand.  I told her to hold on he is loggining in. She told us that we didn't order 4 entrees. I explained that wasn't in the terms in conditions. She told us that we were trying to "rip her off". Are you serious. We ordered appetizer and entrees adding up to 80. She literally was being so rude and my dad is a senior citizen.  Will never be going back. 

Anyways bread took over 20 minutes. And appetizers were just ok.  
Suggest if you want Italian. Go to cheesecake or somewhere on the south side.
