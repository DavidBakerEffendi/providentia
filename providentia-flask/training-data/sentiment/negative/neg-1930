I read somewhere ..' be like Fred, don't be here' I agree with this statement 100%. 

We had reservations and only to be greeted with 'im busy, I don't care you have a reservation. You wait". 

30 mins later we are seated. 

Took forever for the food to arrive. The lobster soup was pretty good. Interesting concept. Baked with a puff on top. The rest of the meal was not good. I had the scallops and the bread pudding. 

Anyway in short, be like Fred.
