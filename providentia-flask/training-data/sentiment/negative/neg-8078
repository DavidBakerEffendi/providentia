DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION---------------The hostess was sitting at the bar and didnt even acknowledge us for a few minutes. Finally, she came over and brought us to our table without saying a word or cleaning it off. She then proceeded to throw our menus on the table and told us to "enjoy" while already walking away. We had a coupon for another location apparently, the manager came out and said "next time.. look at the location on the email", like we were stupid. (The email had another address but stated nothing about it not being valid at other locations) over all a terrible and gloomy experience from start to finish. We left before even finishing our chips due to the terrible and unwelcoming staff. Avoid this location at all costs.
