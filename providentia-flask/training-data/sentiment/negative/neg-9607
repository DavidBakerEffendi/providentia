Average bagels, but that's not why they get one star........

The woman behind the counter who helped me, was abrasive and gross.  

As I waited for my order, I watched her eat food behind the counter, pick pieces of food out of her mouth with her bare hands, TWICE, then handle someone else's order *with her bare hands*.  Additionally, she was fairly abrasive. 

I was going to leave and abandon the order, but I had some extenuating circumstances, so I simply watched her carefully. For my order, thankfully she put on gloves.  Perhaps she noticed that I was watching her (?).

It was stunning to me that someone who works in food service would engage in such blatant unclean behavior.  Surely, this isn't the first time she's behaved like this and what the owner is thinking having such help is beyond me.
