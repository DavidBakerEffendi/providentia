I don't understand why this establishment is popular. We ordered two dishes: Buta don (rice bowl of rice with pork where the best part was...the bland ice) and a very soggy okonomiyaki covered in salad and shrimps. Awful. Does the chef know what an okonomiyaki is supposed to look and taste like? Does the waitress have any clue?

Maybe it's because everything is so overly salted that people need to buy a lot of alcohol to quench their thirst, so much that they end up having a good time in the end... it's genius! It's the only possible explanation that I can find. 

Avoid Big in Japan the Restaurant. I do hear that Big in Japan the Bar is quite good tho.
