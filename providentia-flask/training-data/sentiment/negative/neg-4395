Last night we arrived at 6:00 PM as a party of 6.  Put our name in for a table and we were the wait would be 45 minutes.    At 8:15 we were still waiting for a table.  Multiple smaller parties were seated before us but the staff could never seem to figure out how to seat a larger party.  We were asked to wait upstairs in a lounge type area where nobody took our drink order or checked on us.  We finally walked out the door at 8:30 and were never seated.  I strongly recommend never going here.
