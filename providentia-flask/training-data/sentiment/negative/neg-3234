There are only a handful of tables full and two servers. We stood next to a family who was immediately seated and were ignored the entire time. We ended up leaving since the servers basically chose to neglect even telling us that they will get to us. 

What is wrong with these servers that they cannot properly communicate to their customers upon entry. Very disappointing.
