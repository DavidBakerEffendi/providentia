The last couple of times that I have been here the rooftop patio is always closed off and or rented out. I understand, you are quite busy. That is the least of my concerns at a place I've loved for a long time. I need to make a very accurate comment about this place; the service is absolutely horrible! On more than 5-10 occasions I have come and sat at the ground level bar, new downstairs patio, or rooftop and it takes multiple people to recognize we have sat down and sometimes up to 15 -20 minutes to even be acknowledged or be served. I cannot lie or exaggerate about the timeframe! Trust me, I wish I was exaggerating. I first brushed it off because this was such a great place to come to but something needs to be brought to attention. I understand when the place is fully booked and events pack up the place and I have been courteous to timeframe of service in those circumstances. The problem I believe lies in the people you hire. You can't have 6 people behind a bar regardless if you are a bar back or not and not be acknowledged customers for long periods of time. The training just needs to be better at the very least greet people and say "I'll be with you in a minute" instead of no eye contact or acknowledgment. I hope management or someone can see that from a loyal customer who has come here since the opening, please fix or find a way to better train your employees. The sad truth is I've mentioned this to the last few people who have come to this location with me and they finish my sentence agreeing, I'm just the one finally making it evident to bring it to your attention. I love you top golf. Work on your service for the love of everyone!
