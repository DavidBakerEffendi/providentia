Really enjoyed this restaurant in the past. Good food and good service. Went there tonight and sat on their patio with our dog. Only 3 other tables occupied. The waitress walked in and out of the restaurant 5 times without so much as a mention that she would "be with us in a minute" Left after being ignored for 35 minutes. Very disappointing
