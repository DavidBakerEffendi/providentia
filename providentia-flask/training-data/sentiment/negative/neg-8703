I was very disappointed! The dinning area large and beautiful at first look, but when I sat down I noticed unswept floors and food on table platforms that was to be silver and shinny. There was a lot of food choices, but most of the meat taste old, not fresh,  crab legs were small and didn't have full meat inside, and every dish was not kept at proper temperature, all things I tried were Luke warm. Even ice creams had. Ice frosted over it and the one I thought was fresh didn't taste fresh either. Another customer over heard my party talking about food and they agreed and said "this place won't be open long" I give it all thumbs down, the price I paid was way too much for what I could tolerate to eat. I won't be back there!
