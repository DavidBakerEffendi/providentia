I HATE IT WHEN A GREAT PLACE TO EAT CHANGES MANAGEMENT!!! Cause what's the first thing they do...they raise price on everything. Now the menu stayed the same but now you have to pay extra for things that usually came with the meal like their flat bread. I had the chicken karai and usually it was a good helping of food now it's a smaller portion and costs more then before! Plus it used to be that the dish had whole pieces of bone in chicken. Which was awesome, now it seems they used scraps of what was ever left over! The dish tasted the same but not nearly worth the price! Plus the place was not very clean, tables were not wiped down and this is when it opened! Sorry to say I won't be back!
