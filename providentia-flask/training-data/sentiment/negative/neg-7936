Came in a Friday for lunch around 12pm & place was packed. Writing this review as I wait to be able to order. Standing in line for an hr now. I should have left but my co-workers wanted to try it. If this is how long it takes I won't be back again. I've been to Blaze Pizza several times @ peak times & they have the system down & get you moved through the line fast. Based on service time alone it gets a 1 star. Haven't even tried the pizza yet. It took up. All of my lunch hr then some. :-(

Update after trying pizza...not really impressed. Super skimpy on toppings. I ordered sausage & fennel pizza & added mushrooms & basically there was 1 piece of sausage & mushroom on each piece. Very disappointed. Sticking with Blaze.
