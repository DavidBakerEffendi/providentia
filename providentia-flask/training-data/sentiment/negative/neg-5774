One of worst dining experiences ever. My friends and I (5 of us ) decided to have some Korean food here cuz apparently this restaurant is kinda popular (and you have to wait in line at 9pm), it turns out the food is really mediocre here. The bill was $64 something we gave $90 in cash, hoping to get some change in order to split the bill between us. Firstly the waiter brought back $25, one $20, one $5. I asked the waiter to split the $20 into four $5 bills, and the waiter obviously thought it some kind of hassle and swore in Korean. I don't understand Korean but I guess it pretty much wasn't something nice.
