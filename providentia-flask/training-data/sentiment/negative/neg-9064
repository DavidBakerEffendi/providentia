The pizza is good but I stopped coming here when an older lady was talking on her cell phone, set the phone down where they make the pizza and started making an order. My chicken wings were not done all the way and I came back, instead of getting a new order she instructed the employee to re-cook them in the oil ( they had buffalo sauce on them) and re-sauce them. That was so gross!!! Wash your hands!! Don't set your cellphone down and make food and pick up phone like nothing and do not re-cook food. It's convenient and maybe one day I will give them another shot.
