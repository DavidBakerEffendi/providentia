First time here and had the worst experience. We had to be seated at the bar because all the tables were reserved but empty . The girl working at the bar was really rude. she didn't greet us  she just put the menu down on the bar and walked away. Than I asked for a drink and she was very rude. First time here and very sad because I won't be back. I loved the music!
