Did I go here on bizzarro world day?  The bagel I had was hard as a rock and inedible and all these folks on yelp are raving about it.  Everyone I know that has gone here says that the bagels are bad., and well that is the basis for their business.  If I am going to eat a chain store bagel I head to Einsteins .
