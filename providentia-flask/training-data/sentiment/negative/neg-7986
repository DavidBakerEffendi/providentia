It's Presidents' Day, the rest of the office is off enjoying their day while I'm stuck inside. I decide to treat myself with sushi so I've been hyping myself up all day. I walk in an sit down at the bar, only to be told by the manager that they've called last call for lunch and pointed to the sushi bar saying "you can get sashimi but that's it." I left. The funny thing is I was going to order sashimi... 

First: who closes for lunch at 2 anymore? It sushi not fine dining.

Second: if you're going to close at 2 for the afternoon you should at the very least post it on your door and website.

Third: why would you turn away paying customers?

I used to enjoy visiting here, but the lackluster service has put me off from visiting again. Also carpet in a sushi restaurant is disgusting.
