Man, has this place gone downhill I mean way down to the dark side. The place was so freaking dirty as if it was never been cleaned. We sat down at a round table and there was still sauce from the previous dinner, there was an unknown black object on one of the plate and another one on one of my chopsticks. Goddammit people when you set the table can't see it was still dirty. Clean it up you bunch lazy P.O.S. The pot of tea they threw on the table tasted more liked tea flavored water and it was hardly warm. At that point if my little girl weren't complaining hungry we would walked right out of there. I had a feeling this was not going to be good, so we ordered the bare minimum as not to waste any of our money. Not only had the price gone way up and the portion way down, the food was just simply bad, so bad I would nominate this place has the worst food in Vegas.
