I walked into Barriques yesterday to drink an iced soy mocha and play cards with my friend.  We have been doing this for about 2 years on a semi-regular basis.  I usually order the Iced Soy Chai (which is phenomenal), but that day I decided I wanted a little more caffeine and went for the mocha.  It is a really key point that I drink soy milk because I am lactose intolerant and have major issues with normal milk.  I have never had any issues prior to yesterday with this issue.  I ordered my iced soy mocha, confirmed that they understood I would like soy and when I got it, I drank it assuming it was soy milk.  Soon after I finished it, I realized that something was wrong with the drink.  I was enjoying a dairy free sandwich and a iced coffee.  I have been up all night, nauseous amongst other problems.  This only happens when I consume pure dairy cow milk.  

I do not enjoy being told that I am drinking soy milk when I am adamant that I cannot drink milk and being tricked.  I will not be a regular customer anymore to this establishment.  The employees are not careful and obviously do not care!  No thank you.
