Wasn't impressed at all.  Had a bad experience at the Cuyahoga Falls location and this one I've eaten at twice and I'm not sure how or why they opened this new location.  Had the Shrimp app which is a copy of Bang Bang Shrimp but it was awful by comparison.

I've also had the smoked pork chop - They soak it in liquid smoke type brine.  It's not smoked so don't advertise as such.  Wife and I were both disappointed in our meals and have not been back since.

Applebees much better and more consistent (although that's not where we'd choose to go for a nice dinner).  However the ambiance of the place is nice.  That's about it.
