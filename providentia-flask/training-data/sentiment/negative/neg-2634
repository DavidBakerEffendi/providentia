The food was at best ok. My fav part was the sushi ginger they incorporated into the pickled veg.. and hardly looked like pickled veg, a bit of cabbage and some super overly pickled jalape√±os. The carrots pretty much non existent, oh and no cilantro so I'm not sure I would even categorize that as a ban mi!!  It's sad the food world we live in the expectation and the what people do to escape the near budget a restaurant hads to survive off of.. but hears the thing you don't take shortcuts and make really good food people want to eat... well then there is no problem at all!! A win. For everyone. Very disappointed and the fruit cup grapes and bananas like a horrible hot mess of wilted grapes and brown bananas!
