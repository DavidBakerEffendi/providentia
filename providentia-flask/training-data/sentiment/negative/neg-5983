Here are the positives in this restaurant: 
*Waiters are present

*They take credit card & cash 
*They are still in business 
*The ambiance is nice 

The negatives: 
*Very overpriced, not exceptional sushi. 
*The hostess asked "Have you been here before" three times because she really didn't care and wasn't listening 
*There was a group of waiters,waitresses & a manager making fun of a customer in obvious sight of everyone else. It was very unprofessional and quite rude. This is the main reason for the one star! 
*Coming from LA and visited the best Little Tokyo sushi, this place sucks!
