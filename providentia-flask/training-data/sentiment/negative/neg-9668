Ok, so I am only giving Bamboo Grille 1 star due to the fact that they stopped serving sushi as of May 31, 2012.  This was outrageous to me considering the fact that in my opinion their sushi was the best in Phoenix and not all that expensive.  I am saddened that I cannot go to what was one of my favorite sushi places anymore. :(
