This place looks amazing, great facilities...but that will never make up for the absolute worst service I have experienced in Arizona.  
We were told our wait for a golf spot was 30 minutes.  So we went to the bar to have a drink.  We sat at a dirty table that never got bussed for over an hour while we waited for our golf lane that was only supposed to be a 30 minute wait.  Not only that, but no one took our order for 20 minutes, then only served us one drink and we never saw them again.  It took us going to get a front desk staffer to find our waiter to close out our bar tab.  We were so frustrated that we ended up asking for a refund and leaving.
