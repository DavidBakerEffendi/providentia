Just finished the buffet about 30 mins ago. His was our first time eating at this buffet. Worst buffet in Vegas for the money. My husband and I paid $115, that was including tips. I wish I can give them zero stars. I'm a buffet fanatic and my husband is not a fan of buffets but he goes because he knows I love the variety. 

Our first round we got shrimp cocktail, oysters, clams, mussel, crawfish, crab legs, sausages

The only edible items were the shrimp, sausages and crab legs. Clams and mussels were bland, over cooked and dumped on ice. Oysters were also tasteless. The disappointing thing with the shrimp cocktails was that they are not big shrimp or peeled. For the price of the buffet that should be a given. Just like all the other premium seafood buffets. 

Their was seriously only about 20 different food options and that's not an exaggerated number. Disappointing when they charge $45 per person. All in all most of everything was overcooked and bland. I couldn't use enough cocktail sauce or Tabasco for some flavors.  

I didn't think it's possible to leave a buffet feeling hungry but I did tonight. What a waste of money! Never again will I eat here again. My husband said that we could've paid a little bit more for bacchanal at least they have more food to choose from!!! If you have any doubts about trying this place save  your money and go somewhere else. We felt so robbed leaving the place. Not sure if the people giving this 4 or 5 stars have ever eaten seafood when it's cooked correctly. Shame on you Rio!
