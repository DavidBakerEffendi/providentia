We came tonight to use a coupon we bought, and I should have read the most current review before I bought the coupon. Just like the other reviewer, we arrived and waited at the hostess stand... and waited... and waited. I poked my head around to the bar side and the dining room side and saw people working (and eating), but no one ever came to the hostess stand. A waiter even walked by us twice on his way out to the patio and back in, and he never even acknowledged us. 

After 10 minutes of waiting, we cancelled our reservation on OpenTable and went to Vine, where we had a fantastic experience. Now I'm stuck with a coupon I don't even want to use because I have no interest in going back.
