Terrible service! Our group made reservations and received service 20 min after our group was seated, and then received our drinks 40 min later (which was brought out by the manager after we had someone ask after our drinks). The manager then preceded to presume we were in the wrong about our time of drink orders . Our food orders were taken half a table at a time with 20min in between. Once the food was served , they forgot many of the side orders that were then brought out cold. Food and drinks were great once we finally got them.
