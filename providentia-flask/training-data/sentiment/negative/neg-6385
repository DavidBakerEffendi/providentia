They now offer more things for me to try since my last visit .

 The hot salsa tasted like can , I could taste can , it was canned smooth tomato product that was slightly spiked with something spicy . I tried the pico and I am not sure if the chopped tomatoes were frozen because they looked like frozen and thawed . The tomatoes were also unripe and the seasoning was unpleasant to me . 

I will not fault them for the margarita since I didn't expect the best but the margarita tasted like dry mix .

As I mentioned in my last Yelp I didn't care for the seasoning of the chicken I had last time but I thought it was just me . I was afraid to order chicken again so I ordered a chili relleno . I took one bite and I didn't spit it out but I couldn't take a second bite either .  I only tasted pan oil . My husband tried it and he said it was awful and he felt bad  and said to try his food . I tried a piece of beef from his platter and it was just dry and tasted like it was just plain dry beef just soaked in jalape√±o brine . 

Maybe they are better at times and I was just unlucky with my visits .

I think it was one of the owners that asked me how everything was . I didn't have the balls to tell her . Would you?
