Came to Eat Park today expecting to have a good experience haven't been here in a long time wanted something different I got something different all right food that was half cooked broccoli that was rotten a server they had no clue what she was doing she had her head in the clouds obviously or didn't just even know what she needed to do my sons onion rings were half cooked I ordered liver and onions and needless to say they do not know how to do liver or onions asked for some Gravy to put over The liver and onions 25 minutes later still no gravy try to get the server to come over she was taking everybody else's order that's fine but it would've took her two seconds to go back there and grab a cup of gravy so I could've ate my meal because the liver and onions was so disgusting I need something to cover it up because I was at that hungry needless to say I eat liver and onions and I know what they're supposed to taste like they do not know what they're doing with them here I guess if you're going to come to Eat Park come at breakfast time because if you don't you're going to get crap food
