We came here thinking it would be bomb. However, as soon as they were lucky enough to received the arrival of the The Molde's you got two hostess standing there no greet, no nothing, my husband had to yell at the hostess to get some attention. We got seated at a dirty ass table, and when I say dirty I mean, the seats had stains on them, the benches were full of spill marks and barf. We sat down and we realized we're too good for this dirty ass place. And walked the hell on out. Bye Felicia!
