We arrived, where seated and given water.......25 minutes later we left. Not once did anyone even speak to us, and it wasn't busy either. We really wanted to try out this place but no one would take our order. We instead went to Billy Barooz and had a wonderful meal and a great waitress.

BTW Wedge: it was my wife's birthday, thanks! *sarcasm
