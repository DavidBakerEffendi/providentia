We just went to the 4302 E Ray Rd location in Phoenix AZ. Although the food was OK, the restaurant was in terrible condition.
It smelled like disinfectant as we walked in, and we discovered why. As you walked further in to the store there was an odor of sewer backup.

After we got our food, we looked at MOST of the tables trying to find a clean one. The best one still needed the chairs to be wiped off, and when running a napkin over the table, it came up black.

The ice machine's grate was broken and laying in the bottom of the drain, and the doors to cabinets below the ice machine were broken and hanging on angles. I should have taken pictures.

We even noticed that the large plastic cup we got for our drink was dirty on the outside like the person unwrapping them had newspaper ink on their hands or something.

Needless to say, we will not be going back to that location and may not do ANY location in the future. Although many have way more STARS!!

The manager mentioned being NEW at that store, so I certainly hope he was there to FIX the issues.
