Our server was a complete jerk. He came to our table with an attitude! No greetings just, "So what's your order?" My husband says, "I'd like a tea, no lemon" our servers answer was "what? I'm not here to take that order" My husband and I thought maybe we should leave then...anyway we ordered and our food took forever to get out then it  tasted old like it had been sitting....I love french fries and it was cold and soggy. This server never came back to check on us but so weird... this server seemed to be good with everyone else, but with us.... our food wasn't touched, he didnt bother to ask how everything was, still with an irritating attitude, he threw our bill on the table to me and not even asked if we needed refills on our drinks....mind you, this was our 1st time at this establishment that has descent reviews......never walking into this place again...I'd rather go to Dicks Last Resort if I wanted to be treated like this...and had better food.
