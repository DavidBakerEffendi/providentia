Where to begin? I can't deny that the chef/owner is a reflective business man, but to put it mildly he's lacking in customer service skills.

I'd tried to get in to use a coupon I'd purchased for $25 dollars at least 3 times before I actually made it in.

Attempt one: "We don't accept reservations this late." (The coupon required a reservation) 
Attempt two: "We're not open this late on Sundays" (It was 7pm) 
Attempt three: "We're not open, doing construction on the patio."

In each attempt mentioned above, a man answered the phone and seemed to begrudge my attempts to patron his business with a tone in his voice and curtness in his reply.

The final time I attempted to make a reservation a woman answered, she was much more professional and customer-service oriented. (Maybe she should be in charge of answering the phone. Hint. Hint.)

After arriving I was informed that my coupon had expired; $25 wasted.
The owner said he felt bad about it, and gave us a few free drinks. I was livid. However, I felt a little better after the pretentious European wine (very mediocre tasting). The salad was disappointing, the cheese overpowered it. I might have been happier with just a wedge of cheese on a plate.

The friend a brought with me added chicken to his salad and got food poisoning.

I think I should be forgiven for the one-star review, the rating is well deserved.
