How do you mess up Subway?

I used to have swim meets at the nearby olympium a lot and Subway is, in theory, a great post-swim meal. This location always managed to disappoint me - it took a total of 14 minutes to make one sandwich once, and I was the only customer in there. I don't even understand how they managed that.
