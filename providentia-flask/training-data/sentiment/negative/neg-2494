Incredibly slow and rude! About a month ago I went to Ling & Louie's for take out. The order was more than 25 minutes overdue, and when I simply asked how much longer it would be, the bartender said very rudely that it's not her problem.  She never did check on the order, and I got the idea I was being ignored, so after another 25 minutes I simply left. I decided I would give them another chance tonight, so I went in for my pick up order at the time it was supposed to be ready, and it wasn't ready, and I waited another 25 minutes. I asked the bartender how much longer it would be, and she just said I don't know, with no indication she was going to find out. I asked again a few minutes later how much longer it would be, and pointed out I've been waiting for a long time. She said I could talk to the manager if I wanted, with no other solution offered, so I said yes then I'd like to talk to her manager very much. At that point she spent the next 10 minutes waiting on customers and doing one task after another with out informing her manager that I was waiting to speak with him. Unbelievable!!! I finally just walked out again. That's the last time I will walk him to his ridiculously rude restaurant.
