I always enjoy eating in at Flock when I have a girls lunch or dinner. And even more when I take my daughter out for a lunch. What I always forget is how slow and forgetful the service staff are, especially when I'm there with my daughter. Waiting 40min for a chicken breast and fries is obscene, within a half empty restaurant with 5 staff. And no surprise, my 6 year old daughter loses her mind as well. Note to staff: your location is in the middle of a neighbourhood with moms that lunch with kids...serve them first. Serve them fast, so that we can get on with our day.
