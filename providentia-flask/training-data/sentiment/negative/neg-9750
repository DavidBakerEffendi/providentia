Well what can you really say, it's Taco Bell. My family rarely eat fast food, but once in awhile it always hits the spot. Unfortunately the service in the drive-thru deliberately tries to screw over the customer. Grouchy lady (not that I expect much anyway) with star tattoos on her neck ruined the experience. I asked for extra mild sauce, she repeated the request and then when we got home we had one packet for a family of four. Completely deliberate. If she's doing that imagine what she's doing to the store owner. Lady, if you don't like your job, quit! Let someone else get hired that wants to work.
