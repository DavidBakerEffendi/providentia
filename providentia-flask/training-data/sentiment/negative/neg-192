As someone who eats out very regularly,I want to like the eat n park chain as they are everywhere in Pittsburgh but I  dont understand why. Must be because its cheap when you have a family. If you frequent fast food or rarely go out you might be ok with spending money here, but the Pittsburgh area is full of great inexpensive options that taste good. The salad dressings on the bar are tasteless and the soups are  as well. Most of this is frozen food and it will satisfy kids with plain burger and fry, pancakes, eggs options, I imagine that's why it's popular or for people out late drinking when everything tasted good. Also its relatively inexpensive so people must like eat n park for that. The biscuit and gravy is bland too. Burgers are edible not great and the fish sandwich is the frozen plain Jane type with a huge bun. The fish itself not tasty
