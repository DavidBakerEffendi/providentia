At the rooftop bar and ordered Barbacoa Nachos for $12.  Received a plate of chips with some beans and very little Barbacoa.  Complained to the serving staff about the limited toppings and was told I would have to pay for additional toppings.  The cost would be $4.  Unacceptable for $12 nachos.  I've been here 3 times now and every time I leave disappointed.  I recommend to avoid this place.
