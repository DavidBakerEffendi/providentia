It hurts to even give this place 1 star. WORST SERVICE EVER! it takes 25 minutes for a ham and cheese crepe ti be ready and they forget the sauce. 

I once stopped by to get three bottles of water. They gave me 2 warm ones and a cold one. It took them 6 mins to get me 2 glasses of ice. 

This place shouldn't be open, it's a crime.
