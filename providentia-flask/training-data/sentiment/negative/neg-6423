Huge menu of approximately 160 dishes to choose. Actually the way this restaurant works is to use about 10 different sauces to stir-fry different combinations of meat and vegetables. There is no taste in their food, and the meat is not fresh. In addition, their kitchen's sanitation is a strong problem, I wouldn't recommend this place.
