I have eaten here twice in the past 2 months.  I had a bad experience both times and won't be back.  First time I went it was ice cold in the dining room.  I had to ask 3 different people 3 different times to turn the heat up.  I finally asked to speak to the manager and they told me it had been turned up and would need a few minutes.  It was a large space.  People at the table next to me thanked me for asking.  They were cold, too.  I ordered a burger and fries and had no issue with the food this visit.

Second visit was last week.  I ordered the bison burger special and chips.  Outside of the burger was cooked.  When I got to the middle it was completely raw.  I bit into a huge section of raw meat.  It completely turned my stomach.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit.  They apologized and took the burger off my bill.  I paid for the rest.  I don't expect anything more than that.  They did their job.  

Overall, a nice concept.  I won't be back.
