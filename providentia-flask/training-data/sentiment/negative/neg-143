Super disappointing... and adding that we are locals, and ventured out to the strip, I think it makes it even worse. This was actually our 3rd time here. 1st time was a horrible experience. My husband wrote a YELP review, and the manager reached out and apologized and urged us to try again. We did, and it was fantastic. Great service, great seats outdoor, delicious drinks and fantastic food. 2nd time, not even close. Never got the 2 waters we ordered, took over 15 mins to get a beer and margarita. Once our food finally came out, it was cold. Like ice cold. We asked for forks and knives two times and finally my husband got up and walked over to the stand and grabbed two himself. We are beginning to think that this is a great spot on a super low volume day. The first time we came with the awful experience, it was just before a concert. The second time was middle of the day on a Thursday, and everything was flawless. This last time was a total disaster. Super disappointing as we will be frequenting the T-Mobile area for many hockey games and would have loved to have this be "our place"....
