Went there last Wednesday and had one of the worst dining experiences imaginable.  Waited an hour and a half for a salad and pizza.  On complaining to the Manager about the situation he was rude and arrogant.  The pizza was awful, burnt on the corner and the salad was just so-so.  Very expensive for what it is also.  Will never go there again.
