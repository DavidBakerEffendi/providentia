I'm still shocked at how horrible my service was with Palermo's Pizza today.

I ordered a cold tuna sandwich for lunch today at work. Now we order from them all the time at work and last time I ordered the exact same thing I ordered today it took twenty minutes today it took over two hours and I never even got my food.

There is honestly nothing worse than waiting two hours at work for food that is never coming. 

I called not once but twice to see why it was taking so long and their excuse was the driver got turned around. It's a tuna sandwich. You literally have to put tuna on bread and drive it over here. Definitely not a two hour wait.

Finally I gave up on getting fed and called and asked for them to cancel my order and return my money. Then I got hung up on.

Super professional. 

No one at our establishment will be ordering from here again. If you value your time and money you wouldn't either.
