I come to this page and am greeted by the suggestion to book a table...I think not!!! 

Spent $40 on take out and my order is wrong and missing a main part of the meal. Not impressed, as this is the second time this has happened. They seal the take out bag like Fort Knox so there was no way to check without making my car smell like a kitchen. Not impressed and will only be returning for a refund of my meal. This is my second bad experience in as many weeks with take out on the Danforth. Having worked in the service industry for many years, I'm not a fan of folks not doing their jobs (kitchen to front of house). If you're 'above it all', find work elsewhere.
