This place is subpar for the price. If I'm paying $50 for just a steak, I expect to have an ambiance that is nice, romantic and dressier. Not people with kids, dressed in sandals and shorts. For two and 1 glass each of wine I spent $250...for meh steak and some mashed potatoes and mushrooms. It was our anniversary and I could have spent the same at a nice restaurant and gotten an even more special experience.
