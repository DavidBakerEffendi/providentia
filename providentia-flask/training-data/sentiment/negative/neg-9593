On Saturday 8/27 after leaving the Southern Women's Show at the Charlotte Convention Center, my party of 4 agreed to have lunch in Uptown. My niece checked several media sites for both reviews and operating hours and affirmed that 2pm was when the restaurant opened. We arrived promptly at 2pm. There was no private event signage anywhere, and as we entered a hostess came up to the reservation desk, asked how many in our party and proceeded to seat us. First thing we noticed was a very heavy smell of GAS which permeated the entire restaurant. Windows and fans were on as if trying to clear out the horrible smell. Still we remained and while reviewing the menu, someone came out of the kitchen stating, "they were closed for a private event and we could not remain". In amazement we looked around and we four were the only people in the place. No obe else from the "private party" were there. No signs, decorations, balloons ir ither guests. As we gathered up our belongings and got up from a well worn sofa, no one said sorry for the inconvenience or even offered us any token of appreciation for stopping by in the first place. Parking is minimal at best , having counted exactly 7 car spaces directly in front, and other reserved parking at the building rear  which clearly established parking could lead to your car being booted. For a first impression, I was not impressed, leaving both hungry, annoyed and irritated. Perception is Reality in the hospitality business and this first and last visit made things clear. This is not a customer centric restaurant, and the employees lack the appropriate skill set to appease clientele. I will patronize establishments that clearly want my business!
