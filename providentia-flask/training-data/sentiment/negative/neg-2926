Terrible!!! Do not come here. There's. Reason for the reviews. The buffer tasted awful. The food was old and you could tell it had been sitting there for a while. I got sick for the next two days afterwards. I spoke to management and they had no care or concern about me or any of their other patrons. Just stay away. There are many buffets on the strip, go to any of those.
