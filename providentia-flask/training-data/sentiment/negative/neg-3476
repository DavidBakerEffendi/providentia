Not very impressive. Arrived with my wife for lunch. No one at host stand, waited for 10 minutes in 100 degrees, and decided to sit down at one of the many empty tables. A very unhappy looking lady instantly appeared and asked us what we were doing. We explained that there was no host so we decided we should sit down. Someone who I would guess to be a manager appears and tells we can`t sit there because the table was booked. What a joke the place was half empty. Tells us that they were backed up, and we would have to wait for a table. WTF, half the tables were empty. We walked outside to discuss while they thought about which empty table to put us at. My wife had been there a few times before and really liked the place, and said the customer service was not usually so bad so we decided to give it another try. Went back in and after about 10 minutes the manager guy comes back over and says he has a table for us, adding under his breath "I thought you left" Well if we had any sense we would have done. Got to table ordered food and drinks. Service was painfully slow. Took about 40 minutes to get the food. Other people around us got theirs before us. Maybe we were being punished for sitting down without permission. Food was pretty good. Had Bruschetta and Panini. 

Warning Postino you might be trendy, and fashionable now, but if your staff act with this level of arrogance and indifference toward customers you will go the way of many others that have disappeared from the Phoenix  culinary scene.
