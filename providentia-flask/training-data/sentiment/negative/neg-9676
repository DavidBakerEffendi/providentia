This place deserves no stars which means if possible if would have negative stars. Went there last night. We stood waiting for a table outside for 30 minutes as people helped theieselves to tables even dirty ones. There were signs on gate that stated wait for host to be served. We asked numerous times when we would be seated they kept saying five minutes when if came time for us they said they had to split up tables. We told them certain people Sat without being taken to table. They didn't make them move. Waitresses and hostesses were rude unprofessional and very insulting. I will not attempt to go there again. We go downtown every Month to motorcycles on main and enjoy the food and entertainment. We were wanting to try something new but I can guarantee I won't bother going there. We went two doors down to nangos. It had great food and service. I talked to the president of NY group and shared my disappointment with margaritas and he said sell one place he won't try. They were looking for a place to eat dinner. He said he will make sure he doesn't suggest this rude bad customer service place to people he knows. Margaritas needs to listen to their potential customers especially after they have walked by them numerous times seeing the same people standing there and do not acknowledge them and at same time see people change at tables that weren't there before or been seated.  THAT IS A NEGATIVE STAR. CAN'T POST WITH OUT PUTTING A STAR RATING SO REMEMBER IT IS A NEGATIVE STAR. They need to learn how to put  their priorities in check
