Ok so I have eaten many crepes in my life being born in Paris and all. So I wasn't expecting much from this place. But my oh my how much below par this place was. I ordered the St. Louise and the bf got the Fruits de la mer. Both of our crepes took over 10 mins to make, and when we got it they were both semi cold...mildly warm in the middle. My crepe was drenched in the bechamel sauce which had like no taste. The actual crepe itself was very flour-ie tasting. The deli ham and cheese helped the food go down. My bf did not enjoy his crepe one bit...what a dissapointment. Also savory crepe should never be the same price as dessert crepes (8.99). Stay away.
