Went here to purchase a soda. Asked the cashier if I could try the soda first since the one we got last night was flat and we didn't feel like spending money on a flat soda. The ever so rude Gemma made little comments like "oh like we're wine tasting here" or when I told her that the three different sodas I tried were all flat that id prefer a bottled soda she said, "so I wasted a cup." Really unnecessary. First of, the cup didn't come out of her pocket. Second I told her prior to purchasing it that I wanted to try the drinks, so it's not my fault she grabbed a large cup already. 

The previous night my father in law purchased food and the food tasted like it has been sitting all day and was never replenished. The breading on the walnut prawns were chewy and not crispy anymore and the veggies were soggy. 

I won't be returning to this location ever and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Not even for a drink. Two days in a row the drinks were flat. Small portions with old tasting food. No thanks.
