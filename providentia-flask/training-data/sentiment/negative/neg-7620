I wish I could give them 0 stars, but unfortunately, Yelp will not allow me to do so. I was starving after a long day of work and decided to go to Chipotle since it was on the way home. I asked for the steak bowl and when the lady scooped up a spoonful of meat, she decided to shake some back in their container and left me with only 5 cubes of meat! The spoon wasn't even 1/4 full. I'm a small person, but that's even TOO little for me. I had to ask her to add some more meat because that was too RIDICULOUS, and to make things WORSE, she charged me for extra meat. I was so hungry I couldn't even argue with her about how little she had given me the 1st time. I don't know what kind of business Chipotle is running but this isn't the first time this happened to me. It was, however, the most absurd and smallest portion I've ever received from them. So, i had to write a review. I cannot express in words how unhappy I was that day and how angry it made me, but all I can say is I'M NEVER GOING BACK!!!!!!! Even if it was the only place left on the planet that had food; with their portions, I would die starving anyway.
