OMg this place is so dirty now.  I can't even tell the design of the carpet as it is now just cakes in old grease.  They used to have good Chinese BBQ but now that is expensive, burnt, and the butchers give the worst pieces of meat.  They make you buy a minimum of one pound and don't even give you the piece you ask for.  If you want a pound , they give you 2 pounds.  Diner beware.
