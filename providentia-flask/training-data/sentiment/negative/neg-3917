This is my second time eating in, and I've ordered once online. All three times I've had sushi ... and all three times it was disappointing. The rice was warm, dry and overly sticky. The salmon was room temperature. The deep fried oreos were meh. I've had much better. The waiter never asked if I wanted a refill on my pepsi, and only asked how the food was as I was paying. 
The only high point from the restaurant was the mango salad I ordered online previously. 
All and all, I'd go somewhere else if you're looking for sushi.
