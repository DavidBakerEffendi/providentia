This used to be my favorite spot until I was recently informed that they no longer except military IDs. "What sense does that make?" What happens to the out of town military that visit????Maybe I'm wrong, but someone needs to clarify the situation because that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Way to support troops if it is true however......that is a major slap to their faces. Come on gold spike you can do better than that.
