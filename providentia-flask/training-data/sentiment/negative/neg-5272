Bad service, bad food. One star for interior design. 

Ordered the burger, which looked good but taste/flavor was not there -- definitely not worth for $19. 

Our server had an attitude, and was extremely unprofessional/had no sense of urgency. If the servers don't care for quality service then I can only imagine what management is like. 

No hospitality. Unprofessional and unfriendly, the food wasn't even good to makeup for the bad service.
