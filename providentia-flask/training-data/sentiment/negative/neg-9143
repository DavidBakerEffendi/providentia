I wanted to try for so long and got really excited after reading a couple reviews on here but I was sadly disappointed

I asked for spicy, I am not sure if they forgot or if that was their spicy but I was not happy with that, their piri piri needs to be replaced as well

This place is within walking distance and I will never return due to lack of quality and being blessed with superior options within driving distance
