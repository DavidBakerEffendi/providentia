What the h*ll?

We had just finished up a conference in the Mesa area and with few dining options available at 11:00 pm, other than Denny's, and that was NOT going to happen, we opted for BJ's Brew House.  As a adamant hater of chain restaurants, I did not have high expectations of this establishment and, well, still don't.  Yes, it's cheap, the food offerings mediocre and boring and the service disinterested, but when the choices are between Denny's and BJ's, I'll opt to fast for the evening next time.  Really, it is a small wonder why those who live in the suburbs are so overweight with so few healthy dining options.
