Because this is so close to our house we have been here a few times. We keep given it chances but alway are reminded why we should never return. Service is underwhelming and very slow. Food is mediocre.. Maybe new management would help? Also, if your child plays with the table side iPad device, plan on paying a fee of $1.99 for that.
