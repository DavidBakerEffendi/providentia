If I could give this location zero stars I would. The inside of this place smells like it was cleaned with an old moldy rag. The floors are sticky throughout and the drink station was so filthy and falling apart.... I felt like I needed a shower after leaving. The lady that took my order was incredibly rude and not personable in any way shape or form. I stood there waiting to place my order for about 10 minutes and she was still rude to me even though I waited patiently. If you hate your job and people that much why are you even working there?! The food was not even worth it and wasnt even warm. Wont be returning to this location.
