Omg I will never go to this location ever. We arrived at about 930p on Friday night. It took about 30 mins or more for our food to come out. When it came out, it was cold steak. The chicken was dry and covered in BBQ sauce. The baked potato was under cooked and the butter, cheese, and sour cream didn't melt. We asked for a manage it took him forever to come out. Then he said they turned off the equipment to heat the food. He gave us coupons, but then brought us the bill and charged us full price for food we didn't eat. Finally, another manager came out out took the food off of the bill. The process was over 30 plus mins.
