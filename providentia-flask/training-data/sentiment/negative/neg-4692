Wanting a quick meal I stopped by this restaurant that seems to be very busy with take out orders.  I ordered a Pad-Thai to be safe and a friend ordered the Singapore noodles.  This was the worst pad Thai I've ever had. The overpowering smell of fish was disgusting. I asked for limes to offset the fish sauce and they brought me 3 shriveled dry limes that had at most 1 drop of juice left in them. I brought it up to the server and his reply was "no exchange". I said that I've had pad Thai hundreds of times at different places and I've never had it with this much fish sauce. The rude reply was "that's how we make, if you don't eat you stirr pay" I put it aside and shared the Singapore noodles with my friend. They were dry and not very good either, but it was edible. The shrimp tastes like it's been sitting on the counter for a month. You'll have suppress your gag reflex if you eat their shrimp. 

I honestly don't know how this place stays busy. All I know is with the abundance of Asian restaurants available in Brossard I'll be avoiding this place.
