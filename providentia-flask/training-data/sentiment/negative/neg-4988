Worst Johnny Rockets you will ever experience. The staff act like they have no sense, they walk towards the back & wait forever before coming back to the front...one guy was walking around with his pants sagging and boxers showing (so ridiculous), and to top it all off it took FOREVER to get a simple order. We ended up demanding a refund due to waiting so long. Others were complaining too...trust me, skip this place & go somewhere else, what a joke
