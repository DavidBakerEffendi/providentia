Went to this location to get together with some friends and watch football on a Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, the service we received was horrible. No one acknowledged our presence when we walked in and our waitress didn't come to our table until 10 mins after we sat down. The waitress rolled her eyes at us when we ordered, brought out the wrong food and would drop our drinks at the end of the table and walk away. We talked to the manager on duty and unfortunately he was no better. He had no idea how to respond when we voiced our complaints, he stood there and let out a laugh. Food was just ok. If there were football specials, we didn't know about them. An extremely disappointing experience!
