Who ever said this is the best pizza in town either works there or knows someone that does. Because I just ate there and the pizza was bad. But the guy next to me his looked really good. The person that was working was his personal waitress thou.  I've been there more then a couple times it seems it's good when the owner is there. If you try it go to the one on Ray road,  it's better.  O what sauce ?
