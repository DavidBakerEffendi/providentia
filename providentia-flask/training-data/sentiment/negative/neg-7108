Went there by myself tonight, was seated in a booth. Only 8 people were in there at 6:30. Waited 10 minutes and no one acknowledged that I was there. Don't know how the food is but I don't care. The service is better at Jack in the box. They survived without me before and will continue on without me. This place sucks for service.
