So grossed out right now I can't even wrap my head around what I just saw.  One of the male middle eastern workers nonchalantly sticks his hand down the front of his pants, scratches himself when he thinks no one is looking, then continues making food.  Ill never go back after seeing that animal do that, so freaking gross.  Its a shame because all the female baristas are always so nice and helpful, and I used to really enjoy their coffee.
