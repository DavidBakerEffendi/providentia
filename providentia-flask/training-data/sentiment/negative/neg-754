Haven't been to chili's in a while and now I remember why. My husband and myself walked in and got seated pretty fast, the people behind us were sat 5 minutes after us. The waitress didn't come over for about ten minutes to introduce herself or even ask for drink orders. When she finally took our drink order she didn't ask about appetizers which okay is fine but when it took another ten minutes to bring our drinks she said she would be right back to take our order but she didn't come back for another 15 mins. Now mind you it wasn't busy probably 4 tables of people around us. She finally took our order and it took about 25 minutes to get our appetizer, the app came out cold and the fires were soggy. Our food came out another 20 mins later and not delivered by our waitress, the manger of the kitchen dropped off our food and left. My husband ordered the shrimp and it was over cooked from sitting under the heat lamps, my burger came out but it took my fries 7 mins. The people behind us didn't get their food till we were done eating!! When we finally saw our server again it was so she could drop off our check. We paid and left not happy about how long we were there and the food was awful. We will not be returning.
