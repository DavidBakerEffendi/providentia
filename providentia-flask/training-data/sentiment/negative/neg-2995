The last time I went to Mimi's Cafe, at 7450 W Bell Rd, Glendale, AZ 85308, was June 29th, my wife's birthday. We arrived at Mimi's at approximately 3:30 PM. The place was empty except for a small section that probably comprised one-quarter of the place. There was a couple waiting where one normally sits to await a table. Jokingly I asked them if they were waiting for a table. They responded, yes, we're waiting for a booth. Still not sure they weren't joking, I told the hostess we're a party of three and we'ed like a booth. The hostess said you'll have to wait after this couple, they're waiting for a booth also. I asked really! This place is empty! I said okay, we'll get a booth at Ajo Al's (a Mexican-American restaurant that shares the parking lot with Mimi's). We walked over to Ajo Al's which was just as empty as Mimi's. The hostess told us to sit where ever we'd like. The waiter was friendly, helpful and very attentive. I don't know if I'll ever go to Mimi's again. This is a classic example of a business thinking they're too successful to bother with customer service.
