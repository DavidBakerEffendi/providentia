Had @CousinsSubs for lunch Tuesday.

The person at the counter was very nice, and gave me the combo price for a bag of chips, even though I didn't buy them at the same time.

That being said, the 2-for-$5 sandwiches were not anything remotely approaching "a good value".

The floor had visible mop streaks, likely from already-filthy water, the tables were sticky, there was a large collection of baskets on top of the trash can.

I would not return here unless there was nothing else available.
