I came here before work and put my order in at 5:34. My order was ready at 5:48. They were out of bananas, so I couldnt have my strawberry banana smoothie. I personally think that if you are trying to promote rapid check out or fast lane check out, especially if you have a drive-through, then the food should be getting prepared faster than 12 minutes. I had ordered the you pick to so half of a strawberry poppyseed salad and half of a turkey bravo sandwich. At the end when the guy gave me my food, I had to doublecheck and look for my smoothie. He even forgot to put in the chips. However, he did apologize for the long wait. It is not a convenient time frame for people who are going through the drive-through or coming into the store and waiting for their food. I was going into work after. So I was getting anxious about the time. I don't know if this is the proper standard for time for Panera. Kinda crappy experience for my first time at this Panera. The quality of the sandwich was OK. The salad was good as usual.
