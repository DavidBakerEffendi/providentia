I came here in 1992 and it was SO lacking in flavor, charm, value or anything else that I've remembered it all these years later.  Until today I was willing to forgive and forget but then I saw in the photos here on yelp that nothing has changed since then!  Where the hell WERE you back then, yelp?  THOUSANDS from around the world could've been warned at least 23 years earlier.  Especially me.

Came here with a party of 12 and the service was ok.  One person asked if the broiled salmon was fresh or frozen.  "FRESH!" the waitress replied enthusiastically.  It was frozen.  Every item on the menu came either out of a can or out of a freezer.  Pasta was boiled ahead of time and reheated.  EVERYTHING was greasy, running with butter and/or margarine.  As you can imagine, the wine was the cheapest jug p!ss money can buy.  Even the garlic bread was foul.  How can you ruin GARLIC BREAD?!!!  It didn't even offer much to entertain us at the level of kitsch.  COWBOY-Italian decor would best describe it.  COWBOY-Italian?

I am of Italian descent and was very offended that they had the nerve to call this Italian food.  I could have understood better perhaps if it was still 1973 and Nixon was still in office.  It wasn't even cheap.  Frankly, you couldn't PAY me to eat this slop but I suspect that hordes of tourists from China and American flyover country will keep them in business for many years to come, putting ketchup on their chicken parm and drinking their powdered instant cappuccino with whipped cream.  The way I see it, you can either join them or live.

'Nuff said.
