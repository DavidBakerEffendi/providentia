Be careful, this place accommodates parties of four people max comfortably since it's a small place. They have more tables for couples. The waiter we got was so unenthused when my family of six walked in. He also gave lousy service. The sushi itself was average, 3 star. But I give this place 1 star because I got the worst food poisoning of my life. Granted it's raw fish, so I take a cayenne pill to help kill any bacteria which should be suitable enough(if sushi is fresh/ prepared correctly). Unfortunately I had stomach aches, threw up, and had diarrhea. All together bad experience, would not come back.
