0.0. From the dirty bar to poor slow and dumb service and how they could screw up beer? I have been here every few weeks for a year. Same poor midweek service all the time. Anyway this week I order a beer strike 1 were out, order beer #2 and drink about half. It tastes bad, like sour ice tea. I report to the bar tender who tells me yeah and she had another complaint earlier I just say look quit serving it and leave.. I get home and start barfing..bad beer? dirty glass? one of the two.
