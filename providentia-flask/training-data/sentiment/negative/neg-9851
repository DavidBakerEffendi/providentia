It is always nice to have restaurants close by and in your neighborhood. However, this is an instance in which a family would be better off getting a frozen pizza or better yet, getting a pizza dough and building your own. 
When asked if anything on the menu was made in-house, the answer was a resigned no. When asked how does a pizza restaurant get away with frozen pizza dough and frozen cheese curds and frozen breadsticks, the answer was, 'well, we used to, but we stopped because it was too much effort.'
Unfortunately, my dining dollars were too much effort to earn too.
