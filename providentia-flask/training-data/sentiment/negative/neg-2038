Looking for a delicious all day breakfast spot near home. This place looked like it fit the bill perfectly. 2nd highest rating out of all restaurants near me...I assumed the service would reflect this but I was certainly mistaken. I placed a pick up order through Yelp and received my confirmation e-mail that my order would be ready within 10-35 mins. 20 mins later I come by and have someone go in to pick up the food. When they asked the waitress for the order under one of our names, the waitress said she did not have any orders under that name but handed us an order that seemed similar and we paid. When I checked the take out boxes to see our food, I quickly realized that it was someone else's order. I went inside and informed the waitress that this was not our order and specified what I had ordered. She went to the kitchen and came back and said my order was not done yet. I went outside to wait in the car expecting it to be a couple minutes long. When I come back inside the waitress tells me they never received any order and asked what I would like to eat. Just asked for my $ back and left!
