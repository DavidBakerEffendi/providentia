I am a Groupon customer and that is how I found out about this restaurant. While I didn't have any major concerns regarding the food, I did have an extremely poor customer service experience that goes along with previous reviewers in that the owner can not handle any sort of criticism.

On Groupon, I left a "Tip for others" that recommended the voucher due to fair value. I did point out that without the voucher, the prices were too high. The owner then messaged me through Groupon to send a condescending message accusing me of lying about their value.

I then left a review on their Facebook page, saying that it is unacceptable customer service to mock any sort of criticism toward the restaurant. There are also others, who have left glowing reviews of the restaurant but pointed out areas they could improve, and the owner ended up mocking them. This isn't a "one-time" mistake, this is an on-going issue in regards to feedback. To further prove this, the owner blocked me from their page and left a mocking "sorry" comment in response to my concerns on how they handle criticism.

Overall, I encourage people to avoid this restaurant based on how the owner disrespects its customers. There are many other restaurants with better value and better service so why waste your money here?

And to those wanting to try this restaurant using Groupon, don't. There are too many horror stories on how Groupon customers are mistreated with being forced to the back of the store, sat in a completely different section, told they can't use their Groupon on certain days with no warning, and slow/uncaring service.
