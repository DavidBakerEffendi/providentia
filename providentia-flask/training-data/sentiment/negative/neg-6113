I typically love eating at Cantina, but what I experienced last night may keep me from visiting for a long time. I ordered salmon, medium temp, however it came out close to rare. I showed the waiter and he apologized and took it back to make another. The manager brought out a "new one" not even 5 minutes later, which was now cooked well done, AND was the SAME piece I sent back earlier. I know this because I cut all the way through the middle and it was returned in the same 2 pieces, but strategically put together like it was still a whole piece.
