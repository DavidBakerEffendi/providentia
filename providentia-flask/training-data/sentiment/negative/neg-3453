Tried this place for the first time after moving to Fountain Hills and very disappointed in the quality of pizza I brought home.  The crust was very tough and very little sauce on the pizza.  The young man who helped me was glued to his cell phone the whole time I waited for the pizza. It rolled out of the oven and I had to tell him it was done. I hated to interrupt his phone time but was hungry.  I would not recommend this place.   Floor was dirty also.
