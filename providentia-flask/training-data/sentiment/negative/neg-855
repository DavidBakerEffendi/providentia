I don't know what goes on here, but have been here a number of times.... the service was terrible on the last visit and will not be going back as a result. Place was half empty, the new waitress was rude, inattentive and disrespectful. When I asked where my drink was, she actually shushed me like I was her child. She never came by after the food came to ask how it was or to refill drinks. Time to find another Thai restaurant...
