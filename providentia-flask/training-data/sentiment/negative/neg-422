This could be the worst cracker with cheese on it I've ever had. I can't even call this pizza!! Hard crunchy not crispy bite, a crunchy snap to it......gross!! Ohh and it was cut into squares and all uneven. This blew my mind!! Usually when you have been flying across the country and haven't eaten all day everything and anything would taste good at this moment. To top it all off beside the worst cracker cheese n meat I've ever eaten these two cracker pizzas cost us $50!!!!!!! Absolutely outrageous and it tasted horrendous. If all u have at home is crackers n cheese and this is the last stop besides the shell gas station for something quick save ur money and taste buds and eat the crackers you have at home I bet you anything you want it will be a better dinner than we just had from here!! Our 1 year old loves pizza and she wouldn't even eat it. TERRIBLE!!  Pictures to follow
