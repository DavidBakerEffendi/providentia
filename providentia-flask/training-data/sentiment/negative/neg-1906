I was the friend who dined with Andrew that ngiht he referred to in his review.  Went for some Chicken, placed our orders....had our apps and a glass of wine when it all went downhill.  The manager sat down next to us to break the news..."We are out of chicken!".  He offered us some non-poultry items and we both settled on the Filet. We never would have ordered the Filet, especially at a Chicken joint, but our hands were tied. We should have thought about ordering a burger from thier neighbor, The Grind.  The steak was okay but not what I was looking for. The manager assured us he would work this out on the bill. They got us a dessert and originally only the dessert was comped on the check. We called the manager over and he than took 20% off the bill.  He asked if we were okay with that, but we were not in the mood to haggle.  Truthfully, comping the entire meal would have been appropriate in that situation.  Huge dissapointment and not eager to try thier chicken anymore, especially if it tastes like beef!
