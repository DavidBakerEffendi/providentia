Hubby and I went here today shortly after they opened thinking we'd get the freshest food of the day. Very wrong. Food was old and cold, like it was leftovers from previous days. Very gross. We went to Hibachi Grill instead and though it wasn't fabulous, the sushi guy saved the day with freshness and creativity!
