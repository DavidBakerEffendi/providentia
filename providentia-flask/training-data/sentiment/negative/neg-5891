If you like to have buffet while you're in Las Vegas, we don't recommend going to Bellagio. Their website says the price would be $34.99, but after waiting over half an hour in line, they tell us the price is $48.99. Others waiting in line had also expected to pay $34.99. After the meal we will never visit again  because the food and environment are not worth this price!
