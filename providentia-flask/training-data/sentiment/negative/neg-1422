This place Sucks overall

I went for the 10 wing deal, got home ate about
6 then tossed the rest. I hate feeling obligated to eat something 
I don't like,  considering the price I paid; this was one of those times.


Cons
- wings are jumbo size and not cooked thoroughly
- they charge for watered down ranch
- the sauce taste like shit
 
Pros
- service was ok

Too bad this place sucks because I like eating good wings especially if it's close to home.
