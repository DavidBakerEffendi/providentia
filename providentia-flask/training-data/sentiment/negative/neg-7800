I used to love Nova's. Had the best iced vanilla chai latte every single time. But today alone has made me never want to go again. The woman behind the counter was training a rookie. She got my drink order(two of the same) wrong. When I asked if it was a chai latte she went on this everlasting rant about snobby people and their ridiculous drink orders and just wouldn't stop complaining about her job. She added espresso to make it a latte and then exclaimed it was her last day. I get in my car drive down the road, take a sip and it tasted nothing like my order. The customer service here is laughable, the product knowledge and execution is borderline horrific. Never shopping with them again. Dilworth Coffee is not only competitive priced but the quality 10x better.
