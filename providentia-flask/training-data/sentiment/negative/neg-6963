4th gluten free pizza - do not order this option. 

The crust was burnt, the buffalo mozzarella was melted but not browned and the sausage was swimming betwixt the sauce and cheese.

I've ordered the soy cheese and soy sausage three times - once was it made well.

I'm not a fan of so-called real pizza and I'll bet the traditional pizza there is good.
BUT
If a restaurant charges these higher price for gluten & soy options (of which I'll pay) - you'd better do them at a C level not D-.  4th time is not and nor will be the charm for these options. Do yourself & customers a favor and take them off the menu.
