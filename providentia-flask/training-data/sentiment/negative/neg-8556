My wife and I decided to try the B spot after being curious about their menu. The food came out super fast. Cooked to a visual perfect. Onion rings were great. Carnival like flavor to the onion batter. The taste of the burgers was fresh. One could tell they took pride in the origins of their beef. The table sauces were extensive. In fact 6 in all, from balsamic burger sauce, to a greek ShaSha sauce, to a coffee bbq, to good old American Katsup. They also had a pickle bar that was quite laughable despite some unique selections. The meal ate well but digested harsh. The two of us had flu-like symptoms post-meal and I woke in the middle of the night with a raging set of stomach pains and morning diarrea. Considering that was the last thing I ate for the day i'm sure it was the culperate. All in all I would have rather eat'in at FIVE GUYS. They have a cheaper and more supperior burger that you can get what ever you want on. Although we didn't try B-spots fries FIVE GUYS fries look superior. Only benifit to B-spot = You can order a beer with ur burger. Mike Symon and Doug Pekivich should have thought a lil harder before investing in a resturaunt that will only last maybe five years at the most. It will ultimately face the fate of bar-symon in Avon. Thumbs down boys! Grab ur sweetie, go to FIVE GUYS in the promenade right behind Symons joint, order togo, stop at Minnoti's accross the street, grab a six pack or a bottle of wine and go enjoy your meal at any of Westlake's many parks or beaches. You'll have a thousand percent better meal than at the B-spot. P.S. : The rule card gimmick is riddiculous! Save the ego trip dbags!
