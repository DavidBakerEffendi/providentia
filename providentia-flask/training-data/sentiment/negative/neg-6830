Don't waste your time. 

I had high expectations for this highly reviewed cafe. We went on a Saturday afternoon and we had a bit of a timeline. (My friend and I were headed to the film festival.)

We waited in line and the host took our name. That was it. No approximate wait time. And there were two parties ahead of us. I asked him how long of a wait, and before I had a chance to explain our situation he cut me off and said I don't know and walked away. 

I was contemplating getting take out if the wait was long, but after that POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE I was not impressed. We left right then.  

I can't say how the food was. So it might be amazing... but with that BAD attitude, I will never go back.
