Wow, was not expecting this poor quality of pizza. Do not go here if you have a pizza craving. We were deceived by the website, which looks great. The pizza and salads look fresh. The prices are ridiculous, $12.00 for a personal 9" pizza that resembled cardboard. We got one with arugula, prosciutto, goat cheese and a balsamic glaze. Nothing tastes fresh and there was barely enough cheese to cover the pizza. Everything just felt skimpy. Thankfully we didn't get the large for $24.00! The Qing a were no better- the chicken was very dry, the sauce was light and they tasted as if they had been reheated in a microwave. Needless to say, as Davidson residents, we will not be returning here. May be best for local college students, though it's probably out of their price range.
