Only one star from me. I really don't love this bar.  

I was really disappointed with every aspect of this place.  Service was non existent.  She took a very long time for her to initially come to our table.  Our waitress was hardly seen the entire evening.  

My husband and I were splitting the nachos.  It's very rare for a place to mess up nachos.  I mean.... how can you mess up nachos? Well they succeeded in this.  Neither of us liked it.  There wasn't a good flavor at all.  You can choose chicken or beef.  We chose beef.  Little did we know it was a shredded beef and not a ground beef.  The beef was dry and cold.  Our friend was highly disappointed in his meal as well.  Again, no flavor in country fried steak.  Bummer.

Please trust me and skip this place.
