Came here for quick brunch after church since its right next door. Great atmosphere and location but that's all this place has going for it. Service is bad. Food is bad. Water was empty. 

We ordered the burger and Benedict.  We asked for bacon on the side for the burger, but that is not how it came. Its okay we took the bacon off, and put it on the side ourselves. Strike 1. The fries were great though. 

Benedict was terrible. It was not even warm when it came out. Sauce was mediocre. The potatoes were the only good thing of this dish. 

The kitchen staff came and brought gravy on the side. I did not order this and he left it here for me. It was an awkward three minute exchange. I had began to try it since they brought it out and the waiter came rushing out and grabbed it and said this was not for me. And headed to other side of the bar and handed it to the lady EVEN THOUGH I DIPPED MY FORK IN IT AND ATE IT!!!!!! I was appalled. The man next to me noticed as well and was just as shocked as I was. 

Never got my water refilled a single time. Same with my friend. Just ate our food and stayed parched with nothing to quench our thirst. It also took 15 min for them to collect our payment. 

Stay away from here.
