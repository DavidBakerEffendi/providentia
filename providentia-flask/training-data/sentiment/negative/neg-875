Sure to tell everyone I've been a chef for 42 years I can taste and I'm seeing the cans in the kitchen. Knort swiss makes a pho powder as in base. Which is filled with charcoal I'm sorry I know what I mean but I don't have time to explain it chemicals and that's why it's so cloudy and thick. It's not made from scratch to make a consomm√© is made out of meat not bones this place uses powder. That's why my coeliac friend gets sick when she goes there it's not the rice noodle it's the broth. But sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive
