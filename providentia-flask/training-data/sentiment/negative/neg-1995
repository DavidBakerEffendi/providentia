I have never had a more awkward drive-thru situation in my entire life. 

I personally don't eat here because their food nauseates me for some reason (sanitation?), but my husband likes it so I came here for him tonight. 

Selina, the gal who took my order according to the receipt, was ridiculously awkward. I ordered, she repeated it back incorrectly in pieces. I re-ordered it. She repeated it, I said "correct".... Then there was silence for 30 seconds. So I asked, "Are you done asking questions or what's going on?"

She repeated my order again INCORRECTLY. I corrected her and just drove around to the window. I don't have time for these games all night. When I pulled up to the window she was telling her colleagues about how awkward I am. 

Seriously: Chicken, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and a coca-cola is probably one of the most common meals in America. I'd hate to know what my experience would have been like if I had a complex order. 

Be professional at your job and do it right, thanks. I don't normally call poor employees out by name, but this is well-deserved.
