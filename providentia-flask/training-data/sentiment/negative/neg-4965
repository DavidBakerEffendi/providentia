Zero stars. Overpriced and wretched food. I ordered the $27 seabass and I was served a previously frozen, dried out hockey puck that resembled TV dinner fish. Sent it back and got the $18 canned Campbell's stew...errr I mean....the short ribs stew. Awful. The appetizer was the 'world famous' pretzel fondue which you could order from any TGI Friday's or Chili's for a few bucks less. I'll never go there again. I'm usually not this hostile in my reviews but these guys should be ashamed of themselves for their menu prices..
