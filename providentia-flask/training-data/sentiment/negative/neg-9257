I will start by saying that the food here is amazing. I continue to come for it despite what I will go on to say: the service is very poor. Time and time again, I come back with an open mind and already low expectations, I am let down once again. They seem to always be grossly understaffed, their preparation is not consistent and the place has not been clean the last few times I've been in. Tables sit un-bussed while hostesses sit at the front and chat. All in all- not recommended and I cross my fingers hoping they will get it together.
