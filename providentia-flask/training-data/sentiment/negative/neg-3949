Worst service. Overcharged - and lied to over and over again while the delivery guy tried to think of a reason to stick. There is no reason a medium pizza that's 14.99 on your website should come to $25 before tip - especially when that's not what I was quoted on the phone. 

My own fault for ordering from dominos in a moment of apartment packing craziness.
