I have been a regular lunch customer of Mr. Brews on Junction Rd since they opened. While the food is good, I doubt I will be going back as the service has been on the decline. Every time I have been there over the last several months there has been a totally different staff manning the operation. 

Today was the last straw - we placed our order at the same time as another table. At the time there were only five people in the place, including us, our food was not even put on the grill until the table who placed their order at the same time we did, was served.They got their food at 11:20 - we did not get ours until 11:35, by that time we had to get it to go to take back to the office. Again, the place was NOT EVEN BUSY!
