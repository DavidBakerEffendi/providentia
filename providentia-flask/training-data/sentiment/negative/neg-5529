Still terrible. Service is still rude and incompetent. I met a friend here for a coffee at her suggestion and ordered an Earl Grey tea and... They gave me a green tea??? I can see it was an honest mistake but the girl behind the counter was so cold that I didn't even bother to ask for my proper order. AVOID. Plenty of other nice and friendly coffee shops in the area!
