Mediocre food.  Terrible service.  Way too overpriced.  I got the wild wild spider roll.  It was served with what looked like fried corn flakes???  Weird.  Our waiter was Pascual.  My husband never got the sushi he ordered and our server never checked back with us after dropping off the food.  His loss because we would have ordered another round of drinks and we tend to overtip.  It wasn't busy.  I wait tables and am completely understanding when a server is busy but this was not the case.  This was our second time and last time to Ru Sans.  Very disappointing.
