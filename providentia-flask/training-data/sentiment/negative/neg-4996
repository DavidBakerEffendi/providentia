We tried the buffet for lunch on a Friday afternoon and were very disappointed.  The service was basically nonexistent from the time we sat down, and getting a refill on a mimosa or a bloody mary took almost 10 minutes.  The atmosphere was cramped and felt claustrophobic, with people and dirty dishes sitting around everywhere.  There are no windows in the restaurant so the lighting is also very artificial and seems to cast a strange yellow glow over the room.  Not my idea of what a $38 buffet should be.  

The food.  Oh, the food.  Bellagio has really dropped the ball on this one.  All of their other restaurants (including in-room service), really have excellent food, but everything here was just mediocre.  The soups were under seasoned, and the breakfast items all greasy and overcooked.  The sushi and seafood looked fresh, but upon tasting it back at the table I could tell that it was not of the quality I had come to expect of the property.  The "fresh" fruit was terrible, and the chefs/dining staff refilling stations during our visit were messy and impolite. 

Needless to say, we will not be going back.  There are MUCH better buffets on the Strip that I would visit.  Cheers!
