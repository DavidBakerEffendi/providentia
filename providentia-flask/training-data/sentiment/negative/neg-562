Made another visit to this place about a month ago.  The food has gone down hill and really, nothing tasted that great.  Not that I do the fountain things, but they weren't working and the ice cream machine was empty also.  For a Friday night, it was just an awful experience.  I'd rather had spent my money on fast food.  Done patronizing here.
