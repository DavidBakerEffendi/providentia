The one star is purely for the effort that went into the decor and  presentation of this restaurant. Job well done to the designer! The service and food were poor, and I will not be returning to this much hyped restaurant. I made a reservation 2 days ahead hoping to score a nice table. We were greeted and straight away seated in the worst corner of one of the many rooms although the place was only about 20% full. Then we were greeted by a very inexperienced waitress, who sounded 'rehearsed' for lack of a better description. We requested for a better table, she returned in 5 minutes saying ' unfortunately they were completely booked so we have to stay at our current table'. We were confused and looked around at at least 5 empty tables of 2 and asked... Surely you're not completely booked? Her response was that there was nothing she could do. The food was less than mediocre.... Sorry to say, didn't taste like the creation of a chef but rather a shortcut produced by a cook that may have been hired on a budget. Overall, they reek of inexperienced staff, poor management and clueless running of what sounded like a great new addition to Torontos Italian scene. There appear to be more staff than guests, but that may be because we were at the worst table, at the entrance, a place much better suited for a plant or a coat rack, and not a guest table. Sort your management out, and make your focus your food, as you so elegantly do so on your misleading website. A Saturday night out should be a pleasing and comfortable experience, not an underachieving show of restaurant management. Hope you're doing better in 6 months!
