We like to go there after work for Happy Hour on the patio.  They have 2 Happy Hour menus and until tonight, we have ALWAYS ordered off both, with no problems whatsoever.  Tonight, however was a different story.  We were charged regular prices for most of our bill and when we asked about why, the waiter was dismissive and rude about it, loud enough for neighboring tables to hear.  He did take the bill and come back very quickly, saying that the bill was correct and just dropped it on the table.  I would have expected a manager to stop by and say something, anything, but evidently the managers there do not care if their tables have issues, they just hide in the back.  At no time, did we ever see a manager that night, but for 5 minutes (before we ordered) while she lit some patio heaters, then she disappeared the rest of the night.  I would expect them to do at least one table touch during the meal.  I guess it's not a "Fleming's thing".  All in all very disappointed with the service, the confusion regarding the bill, the menu and the way it was handled and we won't be back.
