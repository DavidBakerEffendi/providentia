Where do I start??first I was excited to try the new Chile roast beef burrito ,and they were out ,ok I went ahead and got another meat and asked for mild sauce they were out ,ok next I ordered enchilada style ,they just passed it thru the stove not even long enough to melt the cheese ,as I'm waiting to pay (yes I still was willing to eat here) a young black woman who made my order is poking her finger in the meats trying to taste which ones the best to make herself a plate ,they were out of lettuce and the cook brings out a bucket of lettuce in water and puts it on my order still dripping wet ,finally I sit to eat and somewhat enjoy my meal only to bite into hard rice!!!when I tell the manager she says cafe Rios rice is supposed to be hard ...w...t...f I'm mexican and I always cook rice I think I know if rice is under cooked so I just asked for a refund and went on my way so not worth it !!!this location fell off do ur self a favor and go somewhere else plz
