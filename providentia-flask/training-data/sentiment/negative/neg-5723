What a disappointment. Took a friend for a special birthday dinner to enjoy his first hibachi and "show."  From the beginning, I felt rushed. While the food was actually good enough, we might as well have been peeking through a kitchen window. The hibachi chef confirmed our orders, put the food on, cooked it and left. 
There were no knife tricks, no flaming onion volcano, no saki bombs, no food toss, no joking with the chef...actually, he didn't even talk to us. 
My friend's birthday was not acknowledged and as soon as our dinner plate was cleared, we received out check. Too bad, we had planned on dessert. 
Have been to this hibachi several times since I discovered it but I won't be back. It's gone downhill, the service is poor and, quite frankly, without the show, it's overpriced for the food. I'd rather the drive to Benihana on the east side or even Wasabi....service is always great, show is great and you get the noodles without the extra charge.
