I visisted this Wendy's often when I first started working nearby in Shadyside. But I quickly learned my lesson. I got tired of spending 20 minutes of my lunch break waiting in line. No less than 20 minutes. Every. Single. Time. The drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins. Plus, the staff is rude. I've driven out of my way a few times to the Wendy's in Wilkinsburg just to avoid this place.

Anyway, I have no qualms with the food, as it's the same as any other Wendy's. So it's fine if you have time to kill.
