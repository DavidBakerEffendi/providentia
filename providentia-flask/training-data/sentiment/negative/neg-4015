Always loved this place, but last time we tried it had a terrible experience.  Wanted to order fish and was told they no longer served it.  About 5 minutes later the same waitress brings out a huge fish plate for the lady next to us.  We are like " What the HECK" ????  Needless to say if we are not good enough to eat what anyone else gets, then we are taking our business else where.  The food that we got was not that great this time anyway.
