I always had a fondness for The Peppermill.  For one, I grew up with one in the neighboring town and I spent a lot of time there in high school.  For two, it just exudes Vegas.

I will not be returning.

After getting our drinks and ordering my daughter's food, I witnessed a cockroach crawl across the table.

The waitress came over as I was standing up to leave, in shock, and I explained that a cockroach came over... my friend brushed it off the table... and I stomped on it.  I pointed to its carcass on the floor.  I was still putting my coat on when a manager came by and asked me to please stay.

She said they were sprayed the previous day and that they were assured they had no bugs.  She invited me to look at the kitchen to see how clean it is.  Then she moved us to a different table.  

I was really freaking out, but no one else in my party seemed to be bothered by the bug.  My daughter has mild OCD and I didn't want to exacerbate it, so I tried my best to not draw too much attention to the situation.  She was starving and it was almost bedtime so I allowed her to eat her pancake and we just stayed.  I know for certain if she was not there that I would have RUN out.

I tried my best to eat a couple bites of my food, but I was paranoid the entire time and could not eat.

Our bill was comped, as it should have been.  Still, I feel someone needs to take a look into this.  Restaurants just can't have cockroaches crawling across tables and still actually think they are clean, can they?
