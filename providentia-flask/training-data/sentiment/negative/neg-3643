Received a card for $20 when I dined at Roy's for my birthday. The waitress explained that I could use it at anytime. I went to Roy's today during the aloha hour and was told I couldn't use the card. The lobster potstickers were soaked in the butter sauce and the crab fried rice was bland. Before today I enjoyed the food and atmosphere but after my experience today I won't be back. 

Thanks for the disappointment.
