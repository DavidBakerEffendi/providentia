Typical bar atmosphere with not so typical menu. Order the Fried pickles and they came with a sauce so thin and watery and it didn't cling to the pickles, which were so salty, I felt my ankles expand as I ate them. I asked for a different sauce, but that was thin too. The Turkey with avocado was so blend and tasteless, dry as my hair, and in desperate need of some kind of sauce to hide the earthy taste of the sprouts on it. My Asian sesame salad was boring, and barely a sesame seed in sight, as it says on menu. The dressing was typical Asian, almost teriyaki-ish and salty as hell, which now started the swelling of my fingers. I miss the usual bar menu of chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks.  Bars should stick to the tried and true unless you've mastered the menu outside the box. This is one of those bars.
