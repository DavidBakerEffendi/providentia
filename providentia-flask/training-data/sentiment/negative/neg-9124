this is worst restaurant in canada, i ordered lamb karahi and it was full of oil, tasteless and very expensive and very less quantity, and then rotis are very hard to eat, even animals can't eat this food, i wish there was minus rating for this, i recommend don't visit this restaurant, they don't have seating capacity and looting all customers with high prices
