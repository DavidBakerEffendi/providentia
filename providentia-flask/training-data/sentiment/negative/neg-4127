Don't open a tab here. The bartenders will charge other people's drinks to your card, and then refuse to give you an itemized receipt showing what you ordered. They kicked my girlfriend out on my birthday, refused to let me close my tab (I walked out with her to make sure she got into the cab safely), and then the next day had charged me for $150 worth of drinks I never ordered, as well as gave themselves a $50 tip. 

Just a bad place with dishonest, poor management, there are much better places to go to in Old Town.
