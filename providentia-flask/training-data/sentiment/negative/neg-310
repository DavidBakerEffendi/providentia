Absolutely disappointed with Eliseo's pizza!! My husband brought pizza home, it was BURNT!! The crust was UNEDIBLE! What kind of "pizza" is that?! I always look at pizza at store. The worst part, Frances, is the mgr, "Mike" could do nothing to resolve my issue. Our conversation was transmitted through young girl. After expressing my disappointment & dedication to Eliseo's, 20+ yrs, Mike couldn't help me, unless I brought pizza back. Are u kidding? I bought pizza to watch NFL draft! Well, I wasn't about to drive another 40 mins because negligence on Eliseo's part!! Frances, I'll take my business elsewhere. And you really need to have your "managers" take a class in business interaction with dedicated clientele!! #unsatisfiedcustomer
