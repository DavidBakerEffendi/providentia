So I decided to try something brand new and Brazilian food sounded very interesting for me. I made the biggest mistake of my life. This is my first experience with Brazilian food but I'm sure this place does not do it justice.

When I walked in, the lady told me she would be right with me and walked to the kitchen for a good 10 minutes. Then another customer came in and she took his order right away ahead of mine. Again, after taking the second customers order, she told me she would be right back.

Just when I was about to leave she comes back out and asks "what do you want?" I the rudest tone you can imagine.

I had a lamb gyro combo which included salad, fries, the gyro, and a drink.

I was surprised when the wait wasn't long since she made me wait so long already. Then I realized why it was so fast.

I'm not joking when I say the lamb pieces looked like microwaveable sausage patties. The fries looked like microwave food as well. I figured I should be open to all types of food, but this place has almost scarred me for life. I hope I can find a place to change my mind about Brazilian food.
