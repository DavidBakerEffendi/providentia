6 of us came in and had a table in no time. We were greeted by our waitress right away and orders for drinks were taken. The menu is typical of a small pub, but I had been told of their Surf and turf special of steak and lobster tail. I had that on my mind as orders were placed. Myself and my buddy ordered the same meal, both ordering our steaks medium rare. 20-25 minutes later our meals for 5 in our party was brought out. My wife didn't receive her dinner of steak and potato. Mine and my buddies steak was crisp, and so over cooked it was dry and stiff. Our Lobster tails were extremely small (2oz) and straight up cold and rubbery. We asked for our meals to be redone and our waitress finally sent them back. Meanwhile we sit there and wait. About 10 minutes later we receive our plates back, but no lobster. Just a steak on the plate.  WTH!! This whole time, my wife has NEVER had her meal brought to the table! Complete BS and I told the waitress and she said she couldn't get it from the kitchen?! I'm pissed and told her so. Finally after everyone is almost done, my wife's steak is brought to the table. She liked it and was finally happy. Because the Saturday special of Lobster and steak comes with no sides for $19 I paid that price for just a steak. Once it was brought to the table, yes it was indeed good, but damn! So many missed opportunities to have this a good meal.  I can't ever see coming back to this place, as there are so many other places in Las Vegas that have better food and quality service and actually care about the consumers experience.
