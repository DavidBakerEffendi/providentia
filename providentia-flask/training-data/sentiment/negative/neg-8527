Absolute rip off and garbage! What a joke no better than your local buffets at home.  We went for breakfast on a Saturday morning and got f'd over.  We were charged dinner prices and not offered the champagne brunch. The breakfast food was cold and like eating at a military base. Cafeteria pancakes and french toast. They had started to turn over to lunch and we sampled other foods to find something decent. Pizza undercooked and similar to what my kids would get at school. Chinese..only 2 dishes both ehh. Many different types of food italian,chinese, sushi,etc but none...none of them done well. We were dumb enough to just walk up and pay. If you don't believe this is crap try it for yourself..just by discounted tickets so you don't get taken as bad as we did..$60 plus for 2
