So I've used this Pizza Hut for years. It's less than half a mile from my home, so it's always been a go to for us. 
I've always done to blind ordering as well, super convenient and quick. 

Well tonight, I placed an order at 3:30pm to be delivered at 5 pm. I've done this before with this location and have never had issues until tonight. 
First, 5:20 rolled around and my order still hadn't been delivered. No one called to let me know they were running late either. Had they done this, I wouldn't be so irked. So I called in to see what the deal was. The girl I spoke with mumbled her name so I was unable to understand her. She said if the order wasn't to be in 10 more minutes to call back.
Driver showed up in that 10 minute frame and handed me cold pizzas and baked bread sticks. I'm completely irritated at this point because my food was late, my family was hungry, and now we have to wait even longer to reheat food that should have been hot when delivered. But then, I call back in to let them know I did receive my order but was extremely disappointed and the same girl decides to give me attitude for me being upset over getting my order cold. 
Then she said "well what do you want me to do about it..?" By this point, I had paid cash, so I was unsure exactly how they could even remedy it. But the attitude from this girl had thrown me so off that I was just ready to end the call. 

Maybe I'll go in to speak with the manager tomorrow. 

Point is, order from somewhere else.
