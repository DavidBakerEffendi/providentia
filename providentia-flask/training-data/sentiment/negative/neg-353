I met up with my friend and her coworkers. They had been here on the patio but I am the late worker.  Apparently I have walked straight into a nightmare. No one greeted me, even thought there were plenty of servers walking by. Yes, the rest of the table looked pretty "done" but shouldn't the server know that there's a new person here? Say hi, ask if I want anything, pretend you care. When I finally had a server, I asked what is their drink specials, and her response was "I don't think I can serve you."  WHAT??  She offered me a water. 
Turned out they have denied service to the entire table because they have a one drink an hour limit. WHAT?? Mind you I was with people who just got off work, including a CFO of the company.  We were not some youngins making troubles. Plus, I just got there, obviously haven't had any drink. 
We left shortly after, still baffled. Which restaurant doesn't serve their patrons? I guess one that doesn't want any business.
