NOT WORTH THE MONEY 

stop here to eat dinner and sat at the bar  and ordered a regular beef cheeseburger and the cost was $18 and change. The Burger and fries where good but nothing you can't get at hero burgers. 
Waitress was friendly and helped me with the menu and service was fast.. but when the waitress went to inquire how much longer for the food the chef yelled at her and said "if people don't want to wait tell them to go to McDonald's I'm sick of people bothering g me" sad thing is I never asked her how long I was enjoying my beer while waiting for my food... definitely won't be going back
