I think this is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Order two enchiladas and you couldn't even see them on the plate. My plate looked like a big pile of slop. This is the first time I've ever been here and I've lived in Scottsdale over 20 years. I'm still trying to figure out how this place has even been in business that long. I'll surely never go there again. Absolutely horrid!
