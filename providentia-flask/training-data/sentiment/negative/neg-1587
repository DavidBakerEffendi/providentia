If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  The meat has no flavour, they cover it with  so much sauce making it a soppy mess that breaks open after the first few bites.  The fries are nasty (i was desperate), the samosa was even worse (i threw it out after the first bite).  

It used to be good many years ago when they first opened.  But it's been bad for a long time now.  

And when you say "no onions"...keep an eye on the guy because you'll have to remind him...everytime.
