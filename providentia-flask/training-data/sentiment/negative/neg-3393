Excited to see Golden Dragon open, I stopped for egg rolls and soup to take home.  But, I guess the place is under new ownership because of, and since the remodel.  If it's the same owner, then you should not have fixed something that wasn't broken.  

It was about 8:20 pm, yesterday.   There were only a few people in there and they were way in the back. One table with patrons and a couple sitting at a brand new sushi counter watching sushi being made.  BUT, there was not a single customer or employee in the newly remodeled storefront and not a soul seated or working in bar.   I saw a closed door with light coming out from bottom that was probably the kitchen as that is where it used to be located however i had no intention of going back and knocking.  Neither was I about to trod all the way to the back of restaurant to ask the waitress who saw me, where whoever was supposed to work the front of store and register area, was.  And now, I have no intention of going back after having gone there for years.  There are too many other fish in the stream.  Oops, I meant to say other Chinese restaurants in the area.
