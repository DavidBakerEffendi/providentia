I really wanted to like this place but man was I disappointed. We went on Labor Day and before we head over my husband called to see if they were open since it was a holiday, the lady answered and said "yes we are open" and hung up. When we got there we were waved over to the counter so we could order our take out. The tallish girl taking our order looked miserable and angry. I asked about a menu item and what the dish contained and she literally just read the name of the dish off the menu and didn't tell me what else was in it. I asked if i could substitute white rice with brown rice and she just said "no". She was rude and just glared at us while we went over the menu and made us feel really uncomfortable. I ended up ordering chicken with noodles and they were super salty and the noodles had a weird synthetic taste. I had to throw it in a pan at home and added some sesame oil and other veggies and spices to make it decent enough to eat. If the food would've been good I would've returned but i won't return for bad service and bad food. Oh and I saw google reviews where a ton of people were complaining about the same girl I hope she reads them and fix's her attitude or gets a job where she'll be happy.
