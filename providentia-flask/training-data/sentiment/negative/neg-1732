If you like Asian noodles even a little bit, do yourself a huge favour and don't waste your time or money at Liberty Noodle. I made the mistake of going here not once, but twice, and ordering the Tonkatsu Ramen since it was a cold day and I didn't feel like freezing my ass off down the street.

The broth was weak and the noodles tasted doughy and undercooked. Pork was weirdly dry in some places and very fatty and sloppy in others.

Then, forgetting this bad experience, I ordered the same thing again. When my memory kicked in, my heart sank as I remembered the unfortunate ramen I'd had before. Fool me once, shame on Liberty Noodle. Fool me twice... well, you get the idea.

Even if it happens to be cold, walk just a little bit further and get something decent, because the ramen here is very sub par and not worth staying indoors for.

Also annoyed that people leave their garbage and trays all over the place in this food court. Slobs! Pick up after yourself so that others don't have to!
