I was SHOCKED at the lack of human kindness by these people!  My mom & I went in this place today, Sept 20th, for lunch.  While we were eating, a obviously homeless man came in a had the money to purchase a LARGE soda, he filled his cup and just sat down and the Chinese man came out from the back and waved him to get out.  I stood up at that time and asked the man if I could buy him lunch, he looked tired, hot & hungry.  I purchased him a lunch and and my mother & I continued to eat our lunch.  They proceeded to make his meal in a TO GO BOX & BAG and hold the door open for him and tell him to "get out".  I stood up and questioned why they made him leave and they said "he stink".  I stood next to him when I asked him what he wanted to eat and 3 other older ladies came in and said he didn't stink!!  What happened to kindness to others and I've always been taught if you go to a fast food place and make ANY purchase, you can sit down in their establishment to drink or eat it.  We will NEVER go back or recommend them to ANYONE!!
