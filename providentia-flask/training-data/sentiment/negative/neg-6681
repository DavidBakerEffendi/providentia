After a game of ball hockey, my team and I decided to grab dinner to celebrate another successful season and with our experience with Indie Ale House in our last season outing, most of us had high hopes coming to The Caledonian for a Scottish dinner after an intense game.  Unfortunately, this place around the area was quite disappointing given it had positive reviews on yelp.

First of all, if you had been reading my reviews, you will know lighting is very important for me.  I dislike dim places because it makes me very sleepy and energy draining when I'm supposed to enjoy a meal especially at night! (maybe it would be considered as romantic if i was actually on a date).  Lighting is terrible here, it's so dim I can actually fall asleep.  Second, the ventilation was terrible, no AC at all on a day that is 25 degrees outside, our party had to move closer to the patio to actually feel a little breeze.  Third, the service was not great, server was not very attentive, wasn't polite either and didn't smile much,  But consider they only had two waitress that night, I guess I shouldn't expect great service. Actually, I blame it on the dim lighting/atmosphere as I believe it must have took a toll on the waitress mentally as well as the night went on.  Fourth, the food was not impressive at all.  I ordered the Scottish Steak Pie hoping it would be decent because this is a Scottish restaurant afterall and the pie was terrible.  Sauce was not flavorful at all, the steak was very chunky and rough and the potato didn't taste good.

The only positive I have for this restaurant and deserves the 1 star I am giving is because when I asked for a recommendation on a light beer, the waitress recommended the Innis & Gunn Lager and I really enjoyed it.

Overall, if you are on a date and/or you are into whisky, with their wide selections of whisky, you will find one that is for you.
