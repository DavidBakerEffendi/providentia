I read all the negative reviews on this place but Blogto really sold it for me... that crystal ball was Instagram worthy lol. Anyhow came with a few friends, took forever for someone to greet us at the door. That was already a sign for poor service to come. Once we did sit at a table, we noticed lots of items on the menu were crossed off or simply unavailable. After sitting for quite some time, we were having a difficult time getting any server's attention. We gave up and thought someone would eventually come up to at least give us water. The answer was nope. So we got up, left the restaurant.. and I doubt anyone even knew.
