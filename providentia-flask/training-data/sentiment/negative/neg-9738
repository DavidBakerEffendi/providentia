Do not go here!  Run, run, run.  Pulled in here because it is at the end of the strip and wanted some quick eats.  

Ordered 2 famous stars, a large Dr Pepper and a large Iced Tea with Lemon.  The lemon was given to me in a bag, um ok.  It was late on Saturday night, not too bad of a wait.  The drive thru gal had no voice at all, was literally a whisper.  

The bag was given to us with the drinks and we drove off.  I put the lemon in the tea and took a drink and almost died.  It tasted like a rat had crawled in the iced tea machine and died.  I didn't know it was possible to get iced tea wrong.  I am sure it was the dirty machine.  I had my husband taste it and he almost choked to death.  I had him try it to reassure myself I wasn't being dramatic.  

In the bag was some extra food ( 2 spicy chicken sandwiches to be exact.)  Great, you would say free food, to substitute the almost $2.00 drink we trashed.  No, no, and more no, we didn't even feed that crap to the dog!  This place needs to be shut down!!! I have never, ever said that about a place on Yelp before. 

I am very shocked no one got food poisoning from the burgers.
