My husband and I used to frequently go to the Rainbow location. We tried this location since it's closer to where we live now. I'm disappointed with the food at this location. I was hoping for some consistency given that it's owned and operated by the same owner but the food taste totally different. The fish cake at this location is overly cooked and made my stomach hurt. The larb salad also tasted differently. I wouldn't mind driving all the way to the rainbow location for good quality food.
