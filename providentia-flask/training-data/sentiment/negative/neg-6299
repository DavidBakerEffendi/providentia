You guys are ok, but lack any morals whatsoever. I pulled up to the Dt today,  and said " can you please pull to the front" I said no, i want to wait here. I used to work for arbys and I know what your doing,  your trying to beat the clock and fake report to your manager as well as the district supervisor.  I hope they see this as u guys try to Cheat and pull cars forward. I won't ever do that so your wasting your time with me
