My husband, daughter & I were discriminated by a man named Ariel aka Papa since we were hispanic because he came to our table to take our order whenever he felt like it didn't bother telling us the daily specials or came to our table to see if we needed anything  & if it wasn't for the guy who was getting the tables ready for the next customers we would of never gotten our salads or soup. Ariel aka  Papa came up to every table & gave them excellent service & made sure had everything they needed. We were discriminated by an Argentina Man who spoke Spanish & we left him no tip for the shitty service he gave us. The manager was nice gave us cappuccinos to go & ice cream for our daughter.
