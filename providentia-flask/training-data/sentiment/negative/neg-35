Had dinner here with a couple of former coworkers.  I previously ate at their San Antonio Riverwalk location and had a great experience.  This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  As previous reviews have stated, this restaurant's gimmick is that all the workers act like dicks, hence the name.  However, there is a fine line between sarcasm, which I can deal with, and rudeness/disrespect.  I love sarcasm.  However, unless you know me really well, I can't deal with racial/ethnic humor.

In addition to the rudeness of the workers there, the prices are completely outrageous!  I had a pitcher of beer and was charged $19.  My pasta dish cost $15.  Are you serious?!?  I should've heeded our food server's advice and gone to McDonald's to order off their value menu.

Bottom line...DO NOT eat at this Dick's location unless you like to be overcharged for food/beer and like being treated with disrespect.  Consider yourself warned.
