I gave this place one stars because of the service I received. My mom and I are waiting for our food, that's was taking along time by the way, and we are making small talk with the lady at the window. 

The lady sees the logo of company my mom works for on her shirt. The lady immediately starts to bad mouth the company saying she had a bad experience and starts to go off. We did not come here to be harassed while we wait for our food. Putting my mom an awkward position and apologized to the lady for her bad experience on the companies behalf. They need to teach their works about proper conversation with customers. True it could have been just that one lady but it was completely unnecessary. If this incident did not happen I would still be going here.
