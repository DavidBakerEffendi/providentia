My last three orders have been below average to terrible. So disappointed. The fish has been cut in an odd manner, too thick, and has tasted progressively fishier. My last order was inedible, everything got thrown in the trash. The order was wrong, to boot. Ginger and wasabi has often been missing from take out orders. I don't know what's going on but I hope the new chef get things together.
