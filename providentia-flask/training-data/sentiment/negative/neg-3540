Karen was the worse pharmacist I've ever felt with she told me at 5:30 it's now 5:50 and I'm told she can't fill my medication because she didn't manage her time well.  I'm a father who needs his medication filled I am shopping with my baby and this lady is to old to be working she is talking to people and not filling prescriptions very very disappointing
