We visited on a Sunday around time for brunch and were informed after we ordered that they only had ONE more biscuit and was that ok? Our order required 3...so no that's not ok.  The food is mediocre at best and the staff doesn't speak very good English. I ordered a chicken philly, what I got was lunch meat chicken warmed up with onions peppers and mushrooms. Another person in the group got a panini and specifically asked for no onions no tomatoes and got both on their sandwich - when we sent it back they literally just took them off and handed it back.   Overall it was not the worst food we've ever had but we will definitely not be going back or recommending it to anyone.
