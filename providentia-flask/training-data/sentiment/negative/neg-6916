So I really liked this place, then I had a bad experience... tonight I was in with my son, we normally visit this location 2x a week... there was 3 people in line including me, so the girl making the burrito started hurrying and slopping everything on the burrito very carelessly. I got to the register to pay and before I could get my wallet put away the owner was telling me I needed to move to the other side of the counter so he could help the customer behind me. I found this to be a very odd comment and it just struck me as rude. I told the manager there was no need to be rude, as I grabbed my food from the other side of the counter. I said this quietly as to not alert the other guests or make a scene. Then he decided to loudly say "excuse me?" In a very rude tone, once again and then said "he didn't think he was being rude"... I walked away with my food. I expected him to come to the table afterwards and apologize... yet he ignored me and then quickly left the store. The poor girl working there felt so bad that she brought a coupon to the table and apologized for him. The 17yr old girl had more tact then the owner of the business. Regardless of wether or not you thought you were being rude sir, you should still offer up and apology to a customer that frequents your establishment. I can assure you that I won't be back to your location, and I'm sure the people behind me that we're trying it for the first time probably won't be back either. Your retort was rude enough to get a gasp from the woman behind me.... not good business.
