i saw 4 1/2 stars on this restaurant  so instead of going to my neighbor hood sushi restaurant  with yaki soba on my mind i decided to try this place i showed up at 1130 a m  i was the only person there, when i walked in the owner handed me a menu i went to a table and had a seat i went over the menu 3 or 4 times he sorta asked me if i was ready to order from behind the front desk i guess he did not wat to walk to my table to take my order  i asked him if he had yaki soba  he said no and left it at that so i ordered the lunch special w/chicken katsu the piece of chicken was maybe 3 oz piece 5/6 tempura battered vege a shrimp and a pot sticker and a small salad  6.50  he brought it to my table and left and returned to the back of the restaurant when i finished i went to the front desk he seamed ancious to cash me out but i ordered a side of pot stickers he brought those out and set them on the table ,as my glass of water was empty he never offered to re fill it  it is now noon and the place is still empty NOT A SOUL hmmmm I finished the pot stickers which were weak at best went and paid a rediculous 12.00$ oh all right 11 and change  never the less i left no tip.....you think  boy is this person really in the restaurant business?????????????????????
