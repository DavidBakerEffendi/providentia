If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Reverse racism at it's finest. We had a large group of 11 people and we all decided to meet here for dinner before going to see our friend DJ at another location. The service was slow but we were willing to overlook that. We all sat at a big table and never had a waitress come to our table at all. Finally, a woman came over to ask if we were there to see the band, we answered no and that we were there for some food. She flat out told us that we were not welcomed there and that we would have to leave, it was about 7:00pm and the band wasn't even on until 8 so we should have had plenty of time to get a quick bite and leave. We asked her if we were expected to stand up to eat and she responded that we can use the table but AS SOON as we are done we had to leave. We left embarrassed and very upset. I will never go back!!
