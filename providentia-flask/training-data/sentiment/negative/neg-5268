I've never given a 1 star review before. We came here tonight with my husband's family for Mother's Day. We were celebrating his mom of course, & myself as I'm pregnant with our first baby. We had a reservation & were seated with no problems. They seemed busy but there were still open tables the entire time we dined. We had two waitresses & at first everything was going smoothly. Got our drinks quickly, orders placed once all the menus were closed. I've been to other CPK's & across the board the food is good. Tonight I ordered the Garlic Cream Fettuccine + mushrooms. It was exactly what I wanted! After dinner we ordered 3 desserts & all were delicious! The reason I'm giving 1 star is because of the service. One waitress, Ryan, was really great! Friendly, personable & helpful! The other, Ray, came by at some point to ask if we needed anything else & if we wanted dessert. My husband asked if she could take some of the empty plates & told her we would definitely get dessert but we'd wait until his mom was done eating. She took a couple plates as she ROLLED HER EYES! I couldn't believe it. It was so incredibly rude! Everyone at the table witnessed it & it was extremely uncomfortable. My husband was not being unkind by any means. We were there to enjoy the holiday, we planned to & did stay a long time. I don't know if she took offense to his request or his answer to her question, that yes we would be ordering dessert? But being so outrightly unprofessional & to our faces, was uncalled for. As dinner went on service became slower & less available. We had to ask for refills, stop other servers walking by to ask for water. Overall it ended up being really disappointing & a terrible experience, especially on Mother's Day!
