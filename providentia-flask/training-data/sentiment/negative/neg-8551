First of all. 1 star is being generous.  This buffet is the worst!  The free drinks in the casino shouldn't even sway you into this joint.  Can't believe they have the audacity to charge almost the same as the other top notch worthy ones do!  And charge kids the same price as adults 
The staff are all pretty much rude & miserable.  Some of our party were overcharged, they sat us in different sections despite it being empty, & our "server" was giving me attitude & dirty looks.  The selection sucks!  I had 1 plate of dry prime rib, nasty mashed potatoes & Mac & cheese, and fried rice.  Everything was salty, and I saw a couple of knats in the salad cooler.  Do yourself a favor, and go to the pizzeria for a dry $12 cheese slice, and spend the other $20 in a slot.  You'll feel much more satisfied!!
