The only good thing about this place was the beer selection. The food is flavorless. The service sucks. With a little bit of leadership and a decent chef this place would always be packed. Jacob the waiter said to ask for him next time. Don't ask for Jacob! He was horrible. He took my wife's beer before she was done. Jacob, smoke less pot it will get you farther in life.
