We stopped to grab some breakfast Saturday morning and upon walking in we were told it was at least a 30 minute wait.  There was a decent crowd waiting to be seated to eat, and were all told about the same thing. The odd thing was that there was a ton of open seating! The entire Bar area was unoccupied, as were all the tables outside but one. We wanted to sit outside and enjoy some food. She told us If we wanted to eat at either of those places we would still have to wait the 30 min. There was a Santa 5k that morning.  Sounds like poor planning to be unprepared for what could have been a lucrative morning for the restaurant.  We ended up leaving and going to eat somewhere else.
