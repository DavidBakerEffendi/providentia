This has to be the oddest restaurant I have been to in a while!  First lets start with the waiter/cook he doubles up as both so its no wonder his clothes are very dirty but it gives the wrong impression when you are greeted by a less than clean person.  This should have been our clue to exit but we decided to stay since we had a groupon.  Secondly, the wait time for the food was excessive around 45 minutes, too much for me.  While we were waiting a long 45 minutes we could hear the conversations between the owner and the 2 kitchen staff she had, very uncomfortable.  As the waiter/cook was bringing out the food we could see his buttocks because his pants were falling, not a pleasant sight especially when you're about to eat.  Third, the food finally came out and I do have to say the mango lassi was good and the tikki chat but that's about it.  We ordered chicken 65 that was more like chili chicken and was super spicy I couldn't eat it but my husband liked it, but even he said it was too spicy and he is Indian.  We also ordered chicken tikka masala and shahi paneer.  The chiken tikka masla did not taste like tikka masala and had too much garam masala.  Even I can make better tikka masala.  I threw it wnen I got home because it was inedible.  The shahi paneer was bland and oily, you could see the oil on top of the gravy.  The naan was also bland, I don't know how you can go wrong with naan but it tasted like hard paper.  The staff was nice but again the atmosphere in the restaurant was weird, you could see they were struggling with the food and getting it out.  I consider myself a fair person and I am just being honest with my experience.  I hope this review helps because I always read reviews even though I didn't read the reviews for this restaurant before I went.
