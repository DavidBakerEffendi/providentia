This location sucks. 

I would love to know why the guy in front of me was offered fresh orange chicken while the rude lady serving the ordered scooped old orange chicken into mine. Seriously. I'm right behind him. I want fresh orange chicken too. Oh and I got it. After dirty looks from the rest of the employees. Thanks guys!
