I found little to like about John Cutter. The waitress was pleasant at first but she never did understand that we wanted TWO steak and cheese sandwiches with extra plates. We ordered two medium rare hamburgers that came out beyond well done.  The sides with all of these were supposed to be Caesar Salad.  Although the restaurant was sparsely populated when we got there, our orders took about 40 minutes to be delivered, some of which time was spent with the orders sitting under heat lamps.  When we finally got the food, we found the salad and pickles had been brought to warm by the heat lamps. 

So we ended up eating overcooked hamburgers that had ingredients other than what we specifically ordered.  The steak and cheese was dismal and didn't even look right.  The salad was inadvertently cooked by the heat lamp and limp.  

When we mentioned this to our server, she explained that there were only two waitresses there as if that explained everything.

This is a restaurant we will avoid.
