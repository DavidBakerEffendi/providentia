It was around 6:30 on a Friday when my husband was trying to find something quick to get just before our plane was going to board.  This place was close to our gate and had a vegetarian option.  Normally, we enjoy Mexican food and I find it pretty hard to screw up.  Until we got a veggie burrito from here, that is.

They were getting ready to close (who closes at 6:30?), so maybe that had something to do with it.  The burrito had some kind of off peanut buttery taste to it, and despite the fact that I was starving, I managed to only eat a couple bites before giving up.

I would say no to this place, unless your super pressed for time and ready to pass out from hunger.
