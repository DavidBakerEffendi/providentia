My friend decided to meet first to grab a table, turns out we were the only ones there waiting for a couple people from our party to arrive. In the beginning, everything was great and servers joked around. However, we did not get our orders in until 40 mins. MINIMUM ... other customers came in and got their food before we even got acknowledged for ordering. We were there at about 9pm and did not get our food until about 10:30 - 10:45pm. The server's mood all of a sudden changed from happy to annoyed once she arrived to get our orders in. I tip base on service, and this place clearly did not meet any of my expectations for customer service. Having previous and current experience in customer service, I would have felt regrettably empathetic towards my customers and understood the reason why I did not receive any tip (if I was as rude as our host).
