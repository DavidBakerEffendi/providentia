I worked at hooters for 8 months and let me tell you! There is this manager who is an absolute pig named Julius. He tells the cooks that all the girls are "lazy hoes". He told a hispanic girl to "go home and get your green card", he said to another girl "are you retarded? literally, do you have a mental illness?". He is a bad person and should be fired! Multiple girls have quit/walked out during a shift, including myself. I will be calling HR about him! He makes a fun place to work turn into the worst place to work so quickly. Hooters should change their ways if they want to keep a good staff going.
