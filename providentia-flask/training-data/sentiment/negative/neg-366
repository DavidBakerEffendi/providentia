Hello,

Your restaurant provides terrible service.  My family booked 3 tables there to have a 10 course dinner type meal for approximately 25 people and your restaurant really disappointed us.

First of all, your waitress was rude to us and rolled her eyes and complained about us as we got organized into our seats.  Then we found aphid-like bugs in your baby bok choy.  When we complained, she said that it is normal... is it really normal to serve bugs to your customers?  It was only after much complaint and refusal to eat the dish that your manager offered to replace the dish, even though we had ask for a refund for that particular dish.

Your manager told us that we can replace the dish with anything we liked, but apparently he really meant any cheap dish we wanted, he suggested noodles or rice even though that already came with our set course.  In the end, the replacement dish looked like it was meant to serve 1 person, when we had to share this with 12 per table.

We brought a cake to cut and we insisted on cutting it ourselves.  But then your waitress interrupted us half way through cutting the cake and insisted that she could do a better job.  She took over and butchered our cake into crumbles and then scooped these crumbs onto plates to be served.  You ruined our cake!

Anyways, I highly doubt that anyone from the restaurant would see this, but I do want to state on here that the manager of this horrible restaurant is Angela Lin.  And I hope that by adding this business on here that anyone that even thought about trying this business would re-think their decision.
