Great food, but had a terrible large group experience. Last year we had our staff Christmas party at Cibo and had such a good experience that we decided to book at Cibo again this year. We had about 35 guests and did the family-style dinner. Wow, were we surprised when we each received HALF the quantity of food compared to last year and each paid fully TWICE the price as last year!! Unbelievable!! Last year we each paid $40 each (includes gratuity, etc.) and this year we each paid OVER $80 EACH. Seriously, Cibo... who do you guys think you are??  Teatro? Ceasars Steackhouse? Ruth's Chris?  You guys serve pizza and fancy pasta... Albeit very good pizza and pasta. So we will definitely NOT be having our staff party there next year. Too bad, because they are a great restaurant with great food and atmosphere. Hopefully they can make some changes.
