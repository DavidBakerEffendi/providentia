*NO STARS*

My GF and I had some extreme munchies going on one night recently and wanted some vegan ice cream.
Looked them up online and it said they had some options available...

We get there and they are busy no biggie.

When our turn came I asked the young lady behind the counter to point out their vegan options to save time on trying to figure out which ones were and which ones weren't .

She looked at me like I was from another planet.

She said, "oh we don't have that".
I said it says you do online...
Nothing.

I look around and on a chalk board menu it plainly said that they had vegan date shakes!
I'm thinking score!

She turns around to look at the board like she has no idea it was even written there.
Turns back around and shrugs and says sorry we don't have that either.

Fail.
