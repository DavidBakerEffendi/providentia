This place was recommended by a colleague from the area so when I visited a friend from high school, we went with her family. They had never been but have heard of it. The restaurant is located in the really nice South Park area which was surprising to me. The ambiance and decor of the place was fun and eclectic; there were cameras stuck to the ceiling of the entry-way, fun Tex-Mex themed paintings, etc. Now the real reason we went was to eat, not to take in the art on the wall. The food was not good. At all. Really, really bad. I would have rather eaten at Taco Bell and I haven't been there in about 15+ years. I have made better enchiladas at home, and I look forward to eating better food than I can cook at restaurants, especially at a Mexican restaurant. Clearly the people who gave this place more than 2 stars have never had Tex-Mex before because the food at this place was awful. My friend asked for no beans as a side on her dish. It came out with beans on it. She said I asked for no beans. Waitress asked her if she is allergic. Friend says, no I just don't like beans and I asked not to have them. Waitress says do you want your meal replated or remade. Friend says just replate it without the beans. Waitress says, ok they don't look appetizing anyway. I look down at the beans on my plate...thanks Ms. Waitress Lady for further ruining an already horribly tasting dinner. Half a star for the fries tasting good that I ate off of my friend's kid's plate of a grilled cheese and fries because I couldn't even finish my dinner. Another half star for the restaurant decor. 1 Star total is all this place is gonna get. Ever.
