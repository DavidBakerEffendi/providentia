The pepperoni pizza is pretty good and they have great hours, I love how late they are open! BUT they were rude to us and didn't let us eat our pick up order at their little counter, they basically kicked us out and it was cold and raining out, super lame. And the prices were way too much-$14 for a small pizza? Not cool. Wouldn't return.
