So myself and my girl just left applebees and the experience started off rocky by having 0 clean tables than making us wait  1 1/2 hours for APPETIZERS alone and then the boneless wings were cold and my spinach artichoke dip was setteled and crusted over you know ? Cause it has cheese in it, the service was terrible had no refills the entire time i was there while the table full of dudes got all her attention, and when the food finally was brought out my "medium" steak was burnt my girls "medium" burger was well done at this point i was furious and handled it in a manor that wasnt correct but i just felt literally disrespected so i walked out. The manager caught me outside and was wondering if i paid for my meal i told him that i couldnt and explained my reasoning he said i shoulda came to him and i agreed but i didnt want to over react on him so i removed the myself, anyway he didnt apologize after hearin my explaination and offered nothin to try and get my business back... a customer is 90% more likely to stay loyal if there problem is fixed than the customer that never had one. Will never be back... TILL I DIE lol jk but for real never goin back
