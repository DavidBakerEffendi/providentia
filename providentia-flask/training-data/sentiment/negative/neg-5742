Ordered a few times from this place and it's always 2 large party trays and always paid cash to receive the discount. I received a discount card through one of the owners which was 10% off. I placed an order today and asked them the offer, the guy on the phone said if you paid cash will receive 10% off, I then asked if the discount card is applicable and it's not asked if I can use visa with discount card guy said no only debit or cash. Went to pick up the food and the guy said I can't use debit with discount card and that I have to pay cash. What is the point for this discount card??? I understand Visa or MC the store pays terminal fees but I'm paying with debit. Spent 40min looking for a bank and driving through traffic. If you receive a discount card just throw it in the garbage! Horrible communication with very little understanding of customer service. Will be going to different place from now on.
