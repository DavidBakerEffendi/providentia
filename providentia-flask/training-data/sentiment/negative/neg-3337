Ground beef, beans, cheese, sour cream burrito is what I unfortunately ordered. What I received was salty soup wrapped in a paper thin flour tortilla. The burrito filling was literally watery, soup beef sauce soup with bean soup with watery sour cream. The burrito was loosely wrapped (can't wrap soup tightly). This "burrito" had NO flavor, but salt. Lots and lots of salt. How they even thought this "food" was acceptable is beyond me. I will NEVER eat there again.
