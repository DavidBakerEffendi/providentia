My friend and I were visiting from out of town and decided to try this place out when we saw their groupon. The first thing we noticed was an empty parking lot at 7:30 pm on a holiday weekend. Awful location?

Upon entering we felt a little relieved with the warm reception from the young host. He found us a booth quickly and was kind enough to turn off the fan that was blowing our paper table cloth everywhere. 

Although delivered quickly, after one sip of our Diet "COKE", it was obvious that it was RC Diet Cola and right from a flat 2-liter bottle. 

The salad bar, if that's what you would call it, was slim pickens and only offered hearts of romaine and three dressings. They had some other Italian appetizers as well, ie. rolled deli ham and cheese cubes. 

The hot plate section was not labeled and it took an explanation from the young host in order for us to know what the dishes were. The Chicken Cacciatore and Cheese Balls were incredible :) 

Main course: As the first round of meats arrived, you can tell that they were made very recently. We received italian sausage, grilled pineapple, garlic bread, pork rib, grilled chicken, and top sirloin. They were up to par in taste and served from a hot skewer and the portions were fair.  We never received any tri-tip, leg of lamb, or filet mignon - all of which are advertised on their groupon/website! 

The highlight of our underwhelming experience was the warm smile and friendly attitude from the head chef and his staff. 

In all honesty, the groupon price we paid ($65 incl tip) is still a pretty high for what we received.
