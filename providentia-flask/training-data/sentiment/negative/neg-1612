Ok... I get it... You are an Irish pub.  Doesn't mean you have to charge high British isle prices.  Holy hell, way way way overpriced.  I expect to get screwed on prices in Scottsdale, but not here.  Food is ok but not worth the premium.  Atmosphere is ok, but not as ritzy as the menu prices lead you to believe. Don't eat here unless you like overpriced food.

Oh, and asking customers to share tables is extra tacky.

And by the way, waitresses are supposed to ask if you need refills... Not disappear to the bar to watch a football game.  Poor service!
