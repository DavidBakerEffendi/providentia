I can say for me that this place is somewhere I will never attend. My friend enjoyed his meal, but as a VEGETARIAN they are downright awful. They made me feel horrible for being a vegetarian because both servers kept sighing to thinking of option for me to eat. The girl server left, and the guy server was left to deal with me, the demanding customer. He suggested vermicelli with fried veggies, peanuts, and it'll almost be like some sort of pad thai, it wasn't. When the food came out.. It was a plate of what looked like canned vegetables, which were cold, and the vermicelli had no sauce (sort of pad thai my ass) it was simply the noodles alone. I had two bites and it was distasteful. They didn't care about me as a customer and my needs, which are very basic. I've been to enough pho places where they have plenty of vegetarian options. I hate to rant, but for once I felt bad for inconveniencing them. When I went to pay, he didn't even ask me about my food, after he took away a full plate. I can't believe he didn't ask what was wrong, or even try to accommodate me. He charged me FULL PRICE!! Even though the people who may read/skim this post may think I am a hippy that complains too much.. no... simply just letting you know of service you shouldn't have to go through.
