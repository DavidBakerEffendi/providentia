Obnoxious loud music. The owners obviously have no clue what their business model actually is. Why would you set up quaint little living rooms within the living room for your customers if they can't hear each other talking? Isn't that what a wine bar is supposed to be? A place to relax with friends? I don't find it relaxing to have to scream to my friend who is sitting exactly 1 foot away from me. If we wanted to be assaulted with deafening, dreadful music we can go to a dance club. We asked the waitress to have them turn down the music and she screamed at me " YEAH, OTHERS HAVE ASKED TOO. I'LL TELL THEM AGAIN!" Very disappointing experience. They might want to figure out your business model.
