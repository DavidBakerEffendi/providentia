**DO NOT EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS PLACE**

Food quality and service are outrageously poor. I've never left a restaurant angry and feeling ripped off before.

Food came 1 hr later. Tables that ordered after us were served. When I asked the server (Kayla), all she told us was that she checked on our order.

When the food came out, it was cold and barely edible. The guest I came with didn't bother eat to eat most of it but had to eat something as it was already very late. We also didn't want to send any food back as (1) we didn't want to wait another hour and (2)we had to be elsewhere.

When I told Kayla the food was cold and poorly cooked, she just apologized. Didn't offer to bring anything new to replace. She only offered us a drink. A drink isn't going to make my hunger go away!

Kayla should have brought a manager over to talk to us as the food being super late, cold, and barely edible is all unacceptable. 

I'll never go back there ever again. 

This is one of my worst dining experiences.
