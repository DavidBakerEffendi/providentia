After devouring an excellent meal next door in under 11 minutes, my friends and I still weren't totally satisfied so we popped in this taco joint to check it out. We ordered a couple of tacos each and a couple of Mexican soft drinks to share. 

Being born and partially raised in Mexico, I naturally asked for the salsas (in Spanish with a Chilango accent) when the lady brought our order. She nervously gave me an unbelievable response: "we don't prepare our food too spicy here." I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I had to confirm:" you don't have salsa here?" "We don't."

I don't know if they really don't serve salsas or they ran out and had to use a lame excuse, but that and the fact that they put purple cabbage in their tacos, failed the test...go else where if you want Mexican tacos.
