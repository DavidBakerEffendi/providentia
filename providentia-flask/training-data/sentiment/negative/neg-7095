The location was great and their happy hour deals are pretty good as well. Unfortunately that's all for the positives of my experience. 

Our waitress was not helpful and even rude. My vegetarian friend wanted to try one of the burgers without meat and the waitress said with tons of attitude "it's a burger, what's the point of getting it without meat?". For meat lovers, this is a good point. But as a waitress your job is not to judge or lecture your visitors. My friend felt bad at ordered an appetizer instead. I ordered half sweet potato fries and half regular fries with a side of the avocado chicken tacos.  The food arrived around 25 minutes later and super cold. I would've kindly asked the waitress for warmer food but she just dumped the food on our table and left as fast as she could. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. I wanted some ranch to make the food a little edible since I hate wasting food. I went up to the host and asked for ranch (our waitress was still mia) but with even more attitude she answered "your waitress can get you that". 

Worst of all is that the you place wasn't even packed. Such a horrible experience
