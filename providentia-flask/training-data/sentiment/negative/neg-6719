This place is gross.  We were in Vegas with my boyfriend's parents for Thanksgiving (yes, I know this is weird) and my boyfriend's dad really likes buffets.  He is diabetic and likes the variety and that he can find things friendly to his intense diet.  I, on the other hand, do not have such dietary restrictions, and just found this food to be disgusting.  I got a little bit of a few different things (some sort of steak, pizza, corn, a roll, mashed potatoes) and everything was so bland, salty and improperly cooked that I just couldn't do it.  I started getting a headache from the amount of salt in everything.  The desserts were decent and I had a bunch of melon alongside some forgettable but palatable sweets.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
