My parents and I came here for brunch on Dec. 28. We were charged holiday prices for $40+ per person, while there was absolutely ZERO information of this price posted on their website. Because we had been waiting a while in the line, we didn't bother too much with it and dined here. Most of the food tasted OK.

And here comes the worst thing. After we had this meal, we experienced severe stomach pains and diarrhea in the evening. It was the only meal we had that day before feeling the pain, so it was very likely the cause. We don't know exactly which food went wrong. The prime rib and leg of lamb appeared to be too raw. The snow crab legs were strangely sour and not fresh. Any of them could be the reason.

My advice is to avoid this restaurant. My stomach is still aching when writing this review.
