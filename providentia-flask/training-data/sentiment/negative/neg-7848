The St. Lawrence Market is closed on Mondays, and so I have to resort to other lunch options.  A short walk from the market I stumbled across Taste of Mediterranean and it's $4.99 quarter chicken dinner with rice and potatoes sounded pretty good.  Well it wasn't.

The chicken was dry, as it had been sitting in a heated tray for awhile, and the rice was bland and boring.  You really do pay for what you get.
