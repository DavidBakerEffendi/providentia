No flame-broiled "have it your way" goodness here.  The burgers are microwaved, the fries are right next to the line of customers waiting to order. Nothing to stop greasy kids from reaching in and touching them, or from Suzie Sicky from sneezing all over them. 

I had a late landing here and wanted to grab something to eat before heading to my hotel. Burger King was one of the few options available (if not the only one).  The cashier was filthy (hands/shirt), and could barely understand my order. He got it wrong and proceeded to argue with me until I said I wasn't paying $4.00 for a plain cheeseburger (it was $2.50). Finally, he called his supervisor who sorted it out (he thought I had ordered a double).  Ugh. Frustration after a flight is the last thing you need. 

Skip this place.  It would be better to go hungry than to eat here.
