I have NEVER had an employee at any restaurant become physically violent with paying customers, until yesterday. My friends and I are regulars at Blue Agave, coming in almost every night after work for a drink and occasional beer pong. We're always respectful and have never had a problem. Tonight an employee, Eddie, asked if he could play next, and we agreed. Then before we had a chance to finish the game we were still in, he states we have two minutes to finish, and when we asked why he said he can do whatever he wants "because he works there." This man then becomes very hostile, getting in my friends face and actually FLIPPING the beer pong table over. He proceeds to yell and scream at my friends for the next twenty minutes, and everyone at the bar (even the people not involved) left because of it. We would hate to lose out on our favorite place because of one incident, but something has to be done when an employee becomes violent. It's unacceptable.
