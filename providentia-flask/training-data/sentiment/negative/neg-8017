Cons
1. This place has no sign and it's very hard to find if its your first time. 
2. The whole basement including the washroom has a stink of aged oil. And environment in the basement and the sinks are badly maintained.
3. That pork belly thing is fried too hard and has no pork belly in it period. It tasted like a deep(too hard) fried fast food meatball from a freezer
4. Avocado salad has probably 5 avocados in it.
5. The Buffalo tofu was hell. Never had a tofu fried as hard on the crust as this one. Once you bite in, you know wanna finish eating it. 
6.the pork kimchi fried rice has nothing special, not enough salt. No surprise in the flavours.
7.OVERRATED. FOOD IS BAD

PROS
1.Drink was okay
2. Service was okay
