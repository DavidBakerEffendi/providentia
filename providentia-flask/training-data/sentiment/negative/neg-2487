I would give 0 stars if possible. This Tim Hortons is very slow, and every time i have been here there has been some problem. Their hash browns always taste bad and the employees are very rude. If you have a complaint about your order or they forget something they get angry with you, even though they are the ones that screwed up.   Everyone i know now avoids this tims because it is not worth the time or effort. Definitely avoid this timmies.
