The fry bread was decent.  The toppings were really weird though.  She said the green chile came with beans but i think they were over boiled refried beans as there were no whole beans in tact. I think it came with this gelatinous meat but i wasn't sure.  Would not recommend eating here unless they revamped their ingredients.  

It was just a soggy mess.
