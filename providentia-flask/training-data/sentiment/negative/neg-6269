Great food, great customer service. Bad review though towards who appeared to be the manager talking loudly about how his employee is going to regret only "being with two women". Then he goes on to talk about screwing around with women and because you've been with them one night doesn't mean "you need to talk about their feelings". All in for free love here but your blatant disregard for women- disgusting.
