You know, I keep giving this place a shot.  Every single time I go I'm disappointed.  I used to think that I was maybe ordering the wrong thing, but after like 4 "wrong things" in a row I'm done throwing money away.  I once had a vegetarian fajita that came with carrot coins.  Like the frozen kind.  For $14.  I'm currently eating $11 carne asada tacos that consisted of three sad little tacos with overlooked meat, no rice or beans on the side, and nothing but some really crazy overly potent hot sauce. So basically after drink and a tip i spent $17 on three of the tiniest worst tacos I've ever had in my life. Maybe it is just me, everything my dining partners are currently eating looks pretty good but I'm just sitting here staring at them because I finished my limp tacos in about 2 bites and two minutes.  Who knows, maybe I'm consistently ordering the wrong thing, but I never seem to have that problem anywhere else.
