I just had a terrible first experience here. We went on a Monday afternoon, ordered a bagel bucket. The girl getting our bagels insisted that we could only choose 12, I had to point to the menu to show her that the bucket has 13. Their bagels were smaller than normal Einsteins and very over-baked, burnt in spots.

They had a pay pass for the credit card, so my husband did that as I handed her our coupon (he was a little over-eager to use the pay pass). The older cashier woman said that as soon as it registered the credit card, the transaction was complete and she couldn't take my coupon. I asked if she could void it, and she said to just use the coupon next time. I told her I'd really like to use it now (we don't go that often), and she said it would be a hassle for her records to do the refund. I asked if she could please do it anyways, and she did (very grumpily). We had to sign the refund receipt before she re-did the transaction, and when asked if she had a pen she replied "No, we don't have any pens." What business doesn't have a pen? So I fish through my purse and finally found a pen. She also wouldn't let me use my $5 gift card AND a 25% off coupon, I had to choose which one I wanted to use. I wasn't sure when she was finished with the second transaction, because she didn't say "ok," "thank you," or anything.

Some of the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. Save yourself a hassle and go down to the Einsten on Chandler Blvd. by 101. Whoever is managing this place needs to really focus on their customer service, and I am not surprised why business there is incredibly sparse.
