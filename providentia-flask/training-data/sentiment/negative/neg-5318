Besides finding GLASS in our butter, the service was very slow and food was not worth the price. For their selections and quality of the food, the menu would be better suited at the $15-20 range and not high $20's-30's.

 In addition, our reservations were incorrectly made and the waiter was extremely skiddish and unknowledgable about the food.Furthermore, when we notified management of the glass in our food- the bar manager promised someone would call me the next day to 'right their wrong.' 

Three days later I called and after being hung up on, I finally spoke with John, he asked me what I wanted after I explained who I was. After I told him I was promised Bonterra would 'right this wrong,' he then tried to pass the glass of as ROCK SALT. I told him, 'uh, no. it was not rock salt, i can tell the difference. besides, rock salt would not cut my gum.' Finally, he offered a refund or gift certificates-- I accpeted the refund. John told me it would take 36 hours to process. A week later, still no refund was processed. I again had to contact Bonterra. John emailed me back: "We do not have access to your full credit numbers and exp date. We were waiting to hear from you so we could process." Bonterra has my cell phone number, my husband's cell phone number and both of our email addresses.

 I was quite surprised by the complete lack of urgency and pure laziness by the owner. I guess, if I were running a business and someone found glass in my food, I would act hastily to make sure my customer's image of my restaurant is not tainted.

Now, not only is there a cut in my gum left from my experience at Bonterra, there is also a bitter taste in my mouth.
