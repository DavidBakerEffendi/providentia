This used to be one of our go to places to eat. We ate there on Sunday and not one thing was right. The food was burned the appetizers were not cooked correctly it was bad. But, what would have been fine is if instead of taking the food and throwing it away if the bartender would have just got us food that was cooked correctly or at least taken it off our bill. We didn't eat the food we told him it wasn't good he said sorry and threw it away right in front of us. He did not take it off the bill and he did not get us food that we could eat. I don't get it.
