at minimum we expect good service and ..for us..hot coffee.
it's self serve and they have 2 reg. coffee options,  both were cold. we notified the staff and then 15 minutes later had to remind then again. no one was in the restaurant and plenty of staff walking around in the afternoon. 
10 min later the new pot arrived with an apology. we tried it...cold coffee.  the staff person apologised ..dais the extra pot was supposed to be bit not apparently no one chucked it. she said she would make a new fresh pot. 15 min later the pot arrived.  it was hot but the 2nd dark roast pot never showed up.  nor will we next time. 

the carrot cake was delicious but needed our coffee we paid for. details count.
