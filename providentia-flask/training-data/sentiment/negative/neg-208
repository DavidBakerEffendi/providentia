It's a shame that you can't give a business a zero star rating because that is what this place is. 
I recently dined here during a busy lunch hour. I should have known something was wrong when we were served minutes after sitting. My chicken was served raw. I informed our server. She took the dish away and had the meat grilled. The meat was still raw, but now the rest of my meal was cold. The pita bread the chicken laid on was drenched in grill residue and liquid. It was gross. Once again I informed the server and she apologized. We were under the impression that we were being offered some dessert and tea. We had the tea $1.99 and the dessert $1.99, but to our surprise only the tea was comp. wow what a terrible experience. 
Well you won't see me eating here any time soon. The tables are so close together that I had to remove my coat in order to squeeze into my chair and I'm an average size person. Just terrible. From customer service to quality of food. Save your money and go elsewhere.
