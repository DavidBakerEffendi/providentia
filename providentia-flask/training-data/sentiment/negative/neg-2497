What a dump!

The famed patio looks like it never got finished, with the untreated floors and walls put together with mismatched pieces of plywood.

The place is chronically understaffed to the point that you have to get up and get your own beer and order food from the bar yourself.  No wonder the waitresses are grumpy.

The cheap tight ass owners of this bar should be ashamed.
