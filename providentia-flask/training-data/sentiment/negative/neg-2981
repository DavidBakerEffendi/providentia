I really wanted to like this place.  The lady that gave me the samples were super nice, the food tasted pretty good as the samples.  The whole idea is very interesting.  I truly wanted to like this place.

I ordered the diablo chicken in a cheese quesadilla and the red jade chicken in a burrito.  I chose to go with the jerk fried rice and refried beans.  

So, the food came and looked pretty good, and a lot for the price.  But it just didnt taste all that great.  The red jade chicken was just the meat wrapped in a tortilla.  Nothing else in the "burrito".  The meat was all questionable... when I order chicken I like to see whole pieces of white meat, not grey/clear meat covered in batter.  The diablo chicken was kind of odd with the cheese.  The only thing that tasted fantastic was the snickerdoodle that came with the meal.

So the meal was just so-so... then I got back to the office... bad times ahead followed by another bad time at home.  Something just didn't sit right.  I can't recommend this place to anyone unless you enjoy an personal opera show in the bathroom.
