I have never heard of Via Delosantos but my sister told me the food was amazing and she was shocked I have never heard of this place. While I was waiting to be seated I pulled up Yelp on my phone and started reading reviews. Arik B's review was funny as hell but also scared the shit out of me. The chips and salsa were good but not great. The rice and beans were blah. The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese. I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible. My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that. During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking " Dammit Arik B was right"!
