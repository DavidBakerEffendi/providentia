My goal here is a PSA to VEGETARIANS...  

The menu at Totts seems to have a significant vegetarian menu, but eater beware that here, fish sauce, shrimp paste, eggs, and CHICKEN powder, is considered vegetarian.  You are best off asking for a "vegan" option.  ( I think there is only one).  

I think I eventually got  the Spicy Szechuan with tofu/veggies. The portion was huge, the veggies were fresh.  It tasted ok. The restaurant is clean. The server / host staff was very nice.  The owner, I am truly disappointed in. 

I got there, ordered what I presumed was vegetarian (asked if sauce had shrimp/fish paste -they said no).  Afterwards, I asked if the curries had fish/shrimp paste, and she said yes, and asked if I had an issue with animal byproducts, because the dish I had ordered, has CHICKEN powder in it.  Apparently they consider Chicken powder to be vegetarian.  Fine, whatever, we have different definitions. I appreciated that the woman went back to grab my ticket / ask if I could get the dish without it / what I could get instead. 

Next the owner came over to me, and got really upset!  All I asked him, was to clarify what on their menu, did not have any animal byproducts.  His response was that your people come in here all the time and have different definitions of vegetarian.  This is my restaurant, and yes, here this is what I call vegetarian.  Fine, I'll agree to disagree on the definition of vegetarian, but by no means, as the owner should he have YELLED at me for inquiring what he considered to be vegetarian / what they had that did not have animal products in it.  

If we had not already paid, I would have left.  

So while, the place is clean, staff was nice, food was ok, the owner/GM was outright rude, and had extremely POOR customer service.  For that I go out of my way to write a review, give you a 1, and tell ALL OF MY VEGETARIAN friends to avoid your restaurant.  

Thanks for the unpleasant experience.
