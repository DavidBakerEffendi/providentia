It is a shame I can't give this place zero stars. They advertise to come celebrate Christmas with them and we did due to a change in family plans. Well celebrating with them means a limited menu as they consider Christmas an "event". Oh and.. They were out of nearly everything. Now let's talk about their Mac n cheese... 

They used to have what I considered the best Mac n cheese ever, it was their truffle Mac n cheese, served in a large skillet oozing with creamy cheesy goodness. They changed the menu so now it is in a tiny skillet. I still hoped for the best and gave it a taste.. Well it is now spicy. Mind you I ordered the truffle one,not the jalapeno one. So we complained and were told that IS the truffle one. They use a "queso" cheese in all of their Mac n cheeses now. Translation? Less costly. I couldn't taste the truffle in it and other that some small chopped pieces that could have been regular mushrooms, there was no real evidence it was there. 

Drinks. They used to have a pretty amazing Moscow mule. That's gone. They don't even carry ginger beer anymore to make it. Don't they know what the drink trends are right now?

Service.. I'll give the guy behind the bar a break in not serving is for the first 5ish or so minutes we sat there, he was new and in training. Our order was wrong numerous times. Even our bill came with someone else's food listed on it. 

I'm heartbroken at how far down this place has plummeted to. It used to be pretty good service, great food and drinks. We will be spending our money elsewhere.
