No flavour whatsoever, when the noodles came the soup was completely clear and I thought maybe that's normal. BUT NOPE. The soup was bland and had no flavour to it no matter how much chili oil and vinegar I added it was still really bad. Not sure how this place has such high rating. Waited over 30 mins for the noodles.
