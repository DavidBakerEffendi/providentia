Dirty dirty dirty. 1 hour before closing.  2 employees standing around chitchatting.   Every table dirty.  Didn't bother to wipe the one we chose so we brushed the crumbs on the floor.  We were the only customers in the place.  The worst part was the bathroom.  Funky!  Old dirt in every corner.  Old soap filthy piled on the floor and down the wall.  Gas station bathrooms are cleaner.  Disappointing, I visit many of these shops and I have never seen anything like this.
