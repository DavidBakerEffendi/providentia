Last night me and my friend went there and ordered togo and paid almost $90 for chicken feet, smoked duck, etc. When I got the order and check them at home it was totally not worth it. I mean, the portions of the food are TOO small. I was so disappointed and felt like i was totally wheedled by the photos that the restaurant posted on Yelp!!
