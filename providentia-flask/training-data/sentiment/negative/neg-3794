Came here today, had the worst service and experience ever leaving me to never want to come back. 

I came here with my family for there lunch special curry chicken and fish ball pork bone soup with drinks that came with it. 

So our food came shortly after we placed the order, but our drinks omg.... Took 25mins to come.. Just to bring us lemon tea,milk tea, coffee. What aggravated me was I already asked a waiter to bring me the drinks he said OK. Then 15 minutes later I had to ask a rude lady to bring me drinks.. I called her over while she was walking towards a table but she completely ignored me and rudely replied in Chinese  she was busy while giving me the dirtiest look ever. 

 What the HELLL.....  This is the second time I have been mistreated at this restaurant, just the first time I let it go since maybe it was a bad day.. But this time, I doubt it.

So, later I was already disappointed that the hospitality and service was so rude that made me come to the conclusion to  not give them much tips. 

So we paid and they disrespectfully asked for tips in a manner I have never seen before holding us back, not letting us leave untill we told them they didn't deserve that much tips. They treated us like crap, saying how we didn't give them enough tips and how if we don't like their service we don't need to come back.


Thanks for giving me the worst experience in the world, wasting my money and time. 

Also, I would recommend if anyone comes here to eat, don't ask for much because they are not going to treat you well.

Believe it or not I have never built so much hate for a restaurant till today. If they are not bad I wouldn't bother ranting and blowing off steam on yelp.
