Pros: Nice little out side seating area if the weather is right.

Cons: Complete lack of manners 
 

Other: Food and wine are ok. 


I went here with a friend of mine on a Friday around 5:30pm. Initially everything was fine. The food was ok, the wine was good, and the server was good. It gets a bit crowded on a Friday after work so it's a little loud and can be hard to find seating. 

In the middle of our meal the manager or the owner (tall, thin, silver haired gentleman in his 50s?) comes over to our table and grabs the chair my (large very noticeable) purse was placed in, leaving me with no choice but to quickly snatch my purse before he takes it with him to another table. I looked at my friend in shock like "What?" as a group of guys at  the next table over look at me with shock on their faces. Clearly we were all thinking the same thing "What the hell? Did he really just do that?". I left there with little enthusiasm about the place. 

The second time I went back was again on a week day, around the same time. The place wasn't busy just yet and I was quickly seated at a table. I sipped on a glass of wine, waiting a couple minutes for my friend. The place started to fill in a bit and I was then informed that I would be moving to a different table so they could accomodate a larger party. Rather than move, I decided to leave.

What is it with this place and their lack of manners? What ever happened to ASKING someone if they would mind if you took the chair or if they would mind moving to a different table? I would have absolutely said yes to both of these request and not be posting a 1 star review.

I don't believe in rewarding bad behavior so I won't be revisting nor will I be recommending this place.
