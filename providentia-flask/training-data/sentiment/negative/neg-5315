If you have children you do NOT want to go here.

We went to the Blue Plate this afternoon for a late lunch after sledding at Olbrich Park. We were waiting for a booth and were invited to go to the counter so we could be seated immediately. Our four year old son sat down next to a heavy set women eating lunch. She proceeded to remark, "I don't want to sit next to a squirmy kid" and the hostess behind the counter look at us like we were bothering her and how dare we bring a four year old to the counter. It was uncomfortable and rather rude.

If you are not a tragic hipster or if you have kids, do not bother going to the Blue Plate Diner. The Daisy Cafe is right down the road is is very kid/family friendly. The food at the Blue Plate is mediocre at best and atmosphere stinks.
