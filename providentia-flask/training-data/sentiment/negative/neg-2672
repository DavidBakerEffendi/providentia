BEWARE--false advertisement and ripoff pricing for their holiday pricing!!! We ate there last night, 12/19/15, and were seated at 9pm and they close at 10pm.  While waiting in line I asked one of the host what time they stop cooking and he said 10:30pm so figured worth it since we'd have at least 1.5 hr to eat. Since it was 12/19, they charged more, like $49.99/pp and no child pricing even though we brought our son. So for 3 of us we paid over $150 for dinner, for that price you'd expect great food and service but instead we got:
- unfriendly service from their food staff (except for our waitress) 
- the cioppino station says "made to order" so when I walked up I asked for made to order but the woman just served me a bowl from the already cooked pot, when I asked about it, she just replied, "too busy, no time" -- wtf, this is bellagio service?!! Besides, it's the last hour, how busy can you be?
- their holiday menu posted "grilled lobster tails" but no didn't see any, closest thing was crawfish
- like I said earlier, the host told me they stop cooking at 10:30pm but at 10pm the caviar station was already closed.  Tried to get some frozen yogurt from their machine but they already started draining the machine at 10pm
- all the food tasted they were cooked in massive so no flavor whatsoever 
For the price we paid, just ridiculous with the food quality, fraudulent advertising, unfriendly and lying staff. Never again would I patronize bellagio or their buffet.
