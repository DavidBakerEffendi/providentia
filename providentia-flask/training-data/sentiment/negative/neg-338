I don't get the allure of this place? Had a sushi craving and figured I would stop in early before the place got super crowded based on yelp reviews it gets crazy. My Yelp comrades were not lying, the place opens at 11:30 by 11:50 the place was packed. First thing that rubbed me the wrong way, the hostess had an attitude. She tried to sit me at the bar, I requested I be placed at a small table instead. However, before she would let me finish my request she quips I can't have a booth as I am a party of one. Ok...great...if you would let me finish my sentence you would know I wasn't requesting a booth (I get y'all get packed and need the seats). Strike 1. 

Strike 2... the layout of the place is awful for a sushi buffet I mean people were crashing into each other trying to get around to the sushi or their respective tables. I'm sure they can figure out how to reorganize the interior to make it a bit more logical in terms of the layout. I found it very stressful to navigate around servers, staff, and guests. 

Strike 3...the sushi pretty much was awful. There were no labels telling you what type of fish was in each roll. Many of the rolls were deep fried and filled with cream cheese or covered in mayo. A few of the nigiri pieces were decent with seared tuna being an option at one point. Would it really be that hard to over some sushi that isn't deep fried or covered in mayo/cream cheese. Also, isn't it a health code violation to not label the food being served? Seems like a big risk to take given how litigious Americans are and the prevalence of food allergies. 

Skip Ru San's and go to Mr. Tokyo - you know exactly what you are getting, the staff is friendly, and you can skip the anxiety inducing procedure to get sushi as you order as you go.
