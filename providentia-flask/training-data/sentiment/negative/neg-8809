Wow Omg wow and I don't mean that in a good way . Super rude service trying to make my man and I pay 20 dollars each to get in. I was like like no way I'm a local I'm not paying to get in. So after that argument we walk in and it was so dark and smelt terrible. It was was like no other smell I had smelt before. Then it came to me cigarette smoke and the smell of a mortuary. Sad to say it but Play it Again Sams is the death row for pimped out strippers.
