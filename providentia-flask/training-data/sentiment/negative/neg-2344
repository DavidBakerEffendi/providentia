I go to Burger King quite often but this location is a poor reflection of the overall franchise. The food here is passable; not horrible since they have the same recipe as all other Burger Kings, but not particularly good either. The service though is seriously a problem.

Never have I ever seen staff as unsociable, rude, and unaccommodating as the ones here. It's a dingy restaurant with dim lighting and an old looking interior, so of course I didn't walk in expecting fine dining-level customer service. However, just from a short interaction at the cash register, the staff here (and not just one member but multiple staff members) clearly demonstrated to me how much they hated their lives and didn't give a single shit about their customers.

I asked about something, they said they didn't have it; no problem, I understand that things happen. But did they offer alternatives or even a meaningless "sorry for the inconvenience"? No. The staff here have a serious attitude problem; they don't just lack proper customer service skills, they lack basic manners. That of course is more than enough to convince me never to come back to this location again. There's a reason why this place was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon.
