I absolutely despise this location whether it is drive through, pick up or delivery. My order is never right, they are super slow and they don't care when they screw up. Out of the three ways to get food here, I think sitting and eating is the best option, however the amount of children screaming and crying inside makes me cringe. 

The drive through and delivery is always aggravating. My order has NEVER been right when I order swiss chalet. When I order Harvey's in the drive thru I have no issues (both drive thrus are the same place). Since they are already taking 10-15 minutes to get me my order for the drive thru window, why not take an extra minute or two to make sure it's right..it's not that hard esp if I'm the only person in the drive thru. I always have to double check my order, park and than go inside to get it fixed where I have to wait in line again. 

I REALLY HATE THIS LOCATION!
