hi,  place posts own fake good reviews, this is a REAL review from a REAL person
:
this  is the worst restaurant i have been to in las vegas, first: their baked goods are old and hard ! they buy their bagels frozen and defrost them ( i saw the bag).
the food is awful we ordered brisket sandwich, potato salad, chicken soup, salmon platter, pastrami sandwich, hamburger with cole slaw (the hamburger was immediately sent back it was hard and flat as a hockey puck :  (    cole slaw was gross and slimy.. the sandwiches were tasteless
the pastrami : not edible, the soup was cold and from a can, the potato salad came from a plastic tub. they are making nothing homemade as they "claim", the salmon was a salmon substitute ( very gummy after one bite, i was afraid to eat anymore in a chance i would become ill).. all of their food is frozen and microwaved.go buy a frozen sandwich, microwave it thats what our disgusting sandwiches tasted like for quadruple the price!!.. the waitress told me and rolled her eyes, she also told us she found a new waitress job because they have to tell customers food is homemade when nothing is made there and she did not want to lie to customers. i repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE
