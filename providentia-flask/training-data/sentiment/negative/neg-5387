I haven't been here in about 2 years and decided to go last night. The silverware I got was dirty and had stains/food remains on it and my wine glass also had some food particles on it. So I asked for new silverware and a new wine glass. I ordered soup as an appetizer and the spoon that came with it was dirty too. I took it to the bathroom and washed it because that's the only way I could assure that it's actually CLEAN! I barely ate any of my soup and I requested the tab and left. I cannot eat in a place that does not seem clean and sanitary, that is a big issue for me. The management here really needs to look into this and make some implementations to ensure that their dishes and silverware are actually getting cleaned properly. I will not be returning.
