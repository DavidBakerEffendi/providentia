Delivery guy was awesome even though he looked like he should be retired. Called them because we thought that it was a cheese pizza and the tag said medium even though we ordered a large. The guy who answered began yelling at me saying that he gave us an extra large and that they put the pepperoni under the cheese to reduce the grease. The pizza was swimming in grease and I told him that I didn't know about the pepperoni and that he shouldn't yell at his customers when they were just asking for clarification. I asked to speak to the manager and he said that was him. Terrible customer service.  I will never order from here again.
