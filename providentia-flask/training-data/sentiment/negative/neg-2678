I was out with a group of 7 looking for a bubble tea place and we ended up here.  Horrible choice. 

Firstly, the service was horrible.  There was a single female employee but she was "too shy" to serve us, so her boyfriend took our orders (he is NOT employed there; pretty ridiculous).  It took 30 minutes for all our orders to come (just 7 bubble teas, no food) and our order was even messed up. 

The bubble tea itself was not that great.  I ordered a mango slush and it was definitely lacking in flavour.  My friends also said similar things about their drinks (except for one friend who ordered the pina colada).  

When we paid, the female employee also gave me the wrong amount of change.  I don't think someone who can't count money or even serve guests should be working at a place like this.  

Luckily I enjoyed the decor, which was anime themed (good thing I'm a One Piece fan), but I'm pretty sure they're using licensed characters without permission...My advice is to avoid this place and just cross the parking lot for better bubble tea.
