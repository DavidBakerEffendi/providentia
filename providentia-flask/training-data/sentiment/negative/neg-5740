Oh how I regret not looking at the yelp reviews for this place before I stepped inside this place!

My wife wanted to eat a specific noodle dish that was spicy, the next door restaurant told us this restaurant served it.  It was around 8PM on Tuesday and there were no other customers besides us.  After we got seated and given menus, I was a bit surprised at the condition of the tables.  Granted I don't care if the furniture is worn as long as great food is served but the menu was also sticky.  

We ordered a spicy noodle dish and spicy shredded potatoes.  The shredded potatoes were more expensive than Dong Ting Chun and when it was finally served the portion was considerably smaller.  The peppers they used in this dish was the standard dried red peppers which are not spicy to me although the flavor of the dish was decent.

The bowl of noodles was also much smaller and my wife who has a small appetite was able to finish it despite not even being hungry.  Absolute ripoff in portion.

White rice was also not given, I had to ask for rice.  I didn't know they would charge me for this rice.  

After the meal, my wife had very painful diarrhea once we got back to the hotel.  A truly terrible restaurant.

I implore any prospective patrons to read all the other reviews as they are spot on!

The only thing I found to be positive about this place was the big TV playing Chinese TV shows, but who goes to a restaurant just to watch TV.
