I came here the other night with my family, very excited to try a new restaurant. I am sooo disappointed. The service was great, waiters and waitresses were very friendly however the food left much to be desired. Coming from a Latino family I have high expectations for Mexican/Latino establishments and I would rate this place on the same level as Taco Bell. The refried beans definitely came from a can, had the consistency of cement and had no flavor whatsoever, not even any cheese and the rice was severely dry and under-seasoned. The dishes that were supposed to have cheese in them either had no cheese or were smothered velveeta, GROSS. All food the food was bland and to be quite honest, all 7 in attendance for dinner there last night feel sick afterwards. The prices are too high for what you actually get, all in all, super disappointed
