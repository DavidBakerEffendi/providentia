On our way back home from some house hunting my wife and I passed Kretlzers and figured, "lets give it a shot, something new!"  We started with a stuffed pretzel, which was merely a pretzel roll cut in half and less than half way melted cheese set in the middle... It wasn't bad, but not what one would expect when they see "stuffed pretzel".  My wife ordered the meatball hoagie with potato pancakes, and me, the beef and cheddar melt.  The meatball, my wife said, was just average, but the potato pancakes, we both agreed, were pretty darn good.  The beef and cheddar, oh the beef and cheddar... AWFUL! It was tasteless and so dry that I could barely swallow it... I asked for some au jus thinking it would help... It didn't, mainly because the au jus sucked as well.

Our waitress was nice, no overly personable, but nice, young and a bit shy I believe.  She apologized for the sandwich and took it off the bill...

I don't see any reason to ever go back...
