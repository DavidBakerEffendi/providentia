Ten Ren is one of the earliest Taiwanese restaurants  that was introduced into Canada.  In recent years their specialty is adding the tea aroma into their dishes.

My visit tonight was very disappointing.  We ordered a Sausage Minced Pork Rice (茶香香腸肉燥飯）, a Minced Pork Dry Noodle （茶香擔仔麵), a boiled vegetable with Minced Pork （肉燥燙青菜）and a Deep Fried Squid Balls （炸花枝丸）plus two large iced teas.

First of all, the tables weren't full and they had two servers on the floor and two bartenders / baristas making drinks.  The server came promptly to take our orders.  When I ordered in Mandarin, the server replied in English asking details on my order.  First of all, it is a manner and etiquette that you reply in the language I speak to you in, unless you don't understand the language.  Which you can kindly tell me.  However she did not do so.

Secondly,  our food took at least over 20 min to arrive at the table.  This is not because the kitchen couldn't put out food fast enough, it is because the server choose to ignore to put food onto our table simply because that table wasn't the table she took orders.  It wasn't until I asked that why the food was out for at least 10 min and no one took it to our table then she apologized and took it to us.

Thirdly, when the food arrived, not only was the food lukewarm, but the specialty was no specialty at all!  The tea aroma was not there in any of the tea dishes we ordered.  The noodle content was only 1/3 of the bowl and it charged me $9.99!  Our total bill came out to be a little over $51 tax included.

Ten Ren is a brand that brings childhood memories and this unpleasant experience totally ruined my childhood memories!  I believe this is the last time that I will go there.

After having dinner there, the next day both my husband and I started to have upset stomach.  Until now we are still sick.
