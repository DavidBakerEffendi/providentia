Slowest.......McDonald's........ever.  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT come here if you think you're going to just waltz through here on your way to work.  You'll be better off stopping at the farm to pick up your ham, eggs, and cheese to make your own McMuffin.  This is newly remodeled with two drive-thru lanes, which is hilarious considering they were ten times faster when they had just one.  I have been here on about four separate occasions that I can remember, three being drive-thru, and I have (not exaggerating in the least) waited 10-15 minutes every single time.  Of these four times not once did I go during a peak busy hour and sometimes I was the only one in line.  Not sure what they're doing in there but it definitely isn't fast...
