This place is always extremely slow especially at night. While it is convenient to go through the drive through, waiting 20 minutes or more isn't. It makes me wonder what they're doing in there when they say "please wait one moment" and it's been 5 minutes since I've heard anything from them. They don't have any customers inside so what's the hold up?
