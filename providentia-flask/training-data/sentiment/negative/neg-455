I ordered a raspberry lemonade. I got 2 refills. I was seated near some high school girls who the waiter needed to fart with. That's the word I meant. He stunk. As far as food I ordered it was the never ending pasta bowl. The chef saw me walk in and sat out 5 bowls right away. My other reviews on yelp are indicative of an overweight person so needless to say 5 bowls was a good over/under. I got 2 bowls total. Whilst farting with those girls the waiter wasn't taking their order or anyone else's. So others had to wait which made my waiting even longer. I think his name is Clayton and he has a twin working there too because he had to tell the girls just everything about himself.
