This place (owned by a different group of people) just opened up today, taking over what was once Sushi Hut.

Oh, god.

They have a roll named "Lady GaGa." Let that sink in for a few seconds. "Lady GaGa." Gives new meaning to tuck and roll, I guess.

I still went through and got a katsudon--only to find out I can't actually eat it because it has onions on it (I have a food allergy) because it wasn't stated on the menu. Is this my fault? Yes and no. I should have done what everyone with food allergies should do--ask. However, I also believe it's kind of important to have that information on the menu just in case! Because food allergies aside from milk and peanuts, do, in fact, exist.

It's new, and I'm probably being way too harsh by only offering one star because maybe it's just an opening fluke--but the few bites I can take out of this that aren't covered in onion just aren't satisfying. It's tough, it's chewy, and it doesn't have a good taste at all. I'm just kind of disappointed and hungry all the way around.
