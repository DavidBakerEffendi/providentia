We went to the new location last night to celebrate my daughter's 16th Birthday.  We were met with very rude service from the hostess.  We were a party of 5 and were advised that we couldn't be seated until a majority of our party was there.  My daughter and I waited and when our 3rd person showed up we asked to be seated since a majority of our party was there.  The hostess told us that she needed at least one more person to arrive.  I explained that we were waiting for my elderly parents who are 81 and 89 to arrive and that they had gotten lost and would be there any moment.  We wanted to sit and order drinks while we waited.  It was a Monday night and the restaurant was less than half full.  She ignored my request.  My partner followed her and insisted that we be seated.  She finally agreed to seat us but gave us a an eye roll and dirty look.  Had it not been my daughter's birthday I would have left.  Our waiter was friendly and the food was good but not award winning good.  I like the atmosphere but honestly had a bad feeling after our encounter with the hostess.  I do not think I will return.  There are many great restaurants in Central Phoenix that are welcoming and friendly to return to one that doesn't care about their customers.
