OK. So I didn't bother eating there. I can not give the food a review.  I was seated  and they explained how everything worked... I had 3 kids with me and their choice was mac and cheese or chicken soup.... I thought this place was a buffet style?  The cards... everyone over 4 years old has to get one... that is company policy.... and if your kid looses one we have to charge you 50$  It didn't take long and we left.  The people parked next to us had the same experience... I don't see this place lasting long at all... We found another place that was similar and the food was good...The cool thing...  we didn't have to pay for 3.49 for each cup of soup and the kids had some variety...  I might try it again (not bring kids) and  give their food a chance but I have a feeling they will be closed by then...
