Their street tacos are gross..... I once had a chicken taco that had not one piece of edible meat in it..... nothing but knotty fatty weird pieces of chicken.  The carne asada is even worse.I'm a serious street taco person and my wife loves their shredded tacos but every time I give this place another shot I'm severely grossed out. You can hear them hacking up the taco meat in the back not caring what they're cutting through then they pick nothing out and throw it on a shell . I'll be going to Frijoles and frescas down the street from now on where I've been several times and never got anything gnarly in my meat.
