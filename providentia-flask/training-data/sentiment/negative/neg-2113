I'm a native NY'er with 30 plus years of Wo Hop on Mott Street under my belt. Moving to the west coast destroyed my taste for Chinese food until I found Sam Woo. Although it's only about 75% as good as NYC Chinese, it's the best I found in Vegas.  It does lack in some areas though but I guess that's how it is out here. My biggest complaint about the place though is the price and the service. What costs you $15 in NYC will push you back $30 bucks here. Plus, the waiters here can't handle more than three tables at a time. Because of that, I go here every three months or so. I'm learning to live without it now unlike NYC where I made an appearance on Mott Street weekly. I'd rather go to a $11 Buffett now than this place.
