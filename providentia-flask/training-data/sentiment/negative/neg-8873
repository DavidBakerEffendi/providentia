My boyfriend and I came in here to grab two coffees before heading to an appointment we had at 10am. We got to 32 Shea at 8:50am and walked inside to order. It wasn't busy and there were two people ahead of us. We watched people come in and out with drinks and so I went inside and asked about our coffee order. The not to happy lady working the front counter said that the ticket didn't come out and needed to take my order again to give to the baristas. I then went back outside thinking she would have them make the drinks right away knowing that we had been waiting. Another 10 minutes go by and I see customers walking in and out with drinks. I went back inside for the third time and they were still not making our drinks and she then proceeded to tell me they were making them now. A few minutes later, still nothing. I went inside and they were continuing to make other customers drinks. It was 9:30 and we needed to leave to make our appointment on time. I told the not to lovely or caring front desk girl that we don't have time to wait for our drinks and they all just turned around and looked at me and didn't say a word. No apologies, no money back offers. Nothing. We went in there knowing we had 40 minutes to order two cappuccinos. I would not recommend this place due to poor customer service and lack of communication and respect for their customers.
