Went to the "Thanksgiving Buffet" today. It was horrible. the "prime rib" was extremely fatty. The "turkey breast" was dry and the "ham" , I think it was ham looked liked spam. The side dishes were not hot at all. The only thing I liked was the server and the unlimited coffee and ice tea. They also had breakfast items that looked terribly tired. The bacon was swimming in grease. Never again will I eat there and I feel liked my family were totally deceived with the promise of a "Thanksgiving Buffet".
