Customer service hete is absolutely horrendous.  We  waited for the woman at the drive thru to acknowledge our presence for about 5+ minutes. When she finally did she said "go ahead." We said thank you and please multiple times and she never said anything in return. When we got our food, it was spilling out o@f its container and into the plastic bag. This employee had no manners and very little job appreciation. I will never return.
