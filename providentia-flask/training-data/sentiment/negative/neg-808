My friend was having a Meetup here for over 20 people. It seems they cant accommodate that many people and become hostile towards large groups. 
last night at the El Chorro was such a mess. I just cannot believe that they treated our group so bad. 
Thanks to our friend Ana for getting us over to Hearth61 it was such better place and roomy as well. Hearth61 also didn't ask our group for one bill either, wont be coming back to El Crapo ever again.
