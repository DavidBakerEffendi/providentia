Our girls were begging for us to take them for dinner and cheese cake. We decided to try the out. It was a horrible experience. First the waiter was so busy she never even looked at us or give us ant real atention. She was rushing us to give her the drink order and pushing to order our food as soon we sat down. I hate waiters to rush me before I even have a chace to look at the menu. I ordered a Cesar Salad  wirh Chicken when I started eating I found a long black hair tangled the the lettuce. So gross. Then my daughter's meatball and spaghetti pasta came. OMG! Horrible no taste completely cold and the plate all dirty with this disgusting tomato sauce. Sent it back asked for them to write off from check and the only thing they took out was the salad. The supposed Manager came to the table, a very sloppy looking blonde older woman, never gave eye contact or an apology, just told me she would get me another salad. Another salad? Forget it!  One hair was enough. Our family will never be back to eat here again. A $90.00 check was a complete slap on the face. Very disapointed .
