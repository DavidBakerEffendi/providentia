They didn't take the wax paper off my cheese before they melted it. I ended up chewing it before I noticed. Pulled the other half of my sandwich apart to find more. Even after pulling it out it all tasted like wax. When I brought this to the employees' attention I just got weird looks and 'what do you want us to do about it,' 'It's still good.' No it tastes like wax, and I had to pull it all into pieces. I didn't even a "oops sorry." I just threw it out.
