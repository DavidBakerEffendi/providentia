This place pretty much sucks... the only thing I enjoyed was my queso. Every time I try and give it a new chance, it never comes out good. Yesterday I had the pollo benidno (sp) dish and the presentation was awful. It was a small piece of chicken that only took three bites. A scoop of rice that I got maybe 10 bites out of with cheese sauce on top. For 9.99 a fish...I don't think it's worth it. Go to El Camino in Aurora!
