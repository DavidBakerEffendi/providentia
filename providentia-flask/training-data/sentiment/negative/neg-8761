We went last night (around 10pm) thinking we'd hear live music on a sat night(nope) and almost a non existent dance floor! Waited line for 20min and watched several girls with Mini dresses gain VIP access and bump our place back in line! I'd go back for day drinking and to try lunch only because I love DB music!
