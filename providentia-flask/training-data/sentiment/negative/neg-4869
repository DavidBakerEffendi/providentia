Went here around 9pm, it was a full house so I had hopes that this dessert place is good but nope. Me and my boyfriend order two different waffles with ice cream, one had pistachio ice cream and mine had velvet. My velvet ice cream was just "okay", nothing special. I tired my boyfriends pistachio ice-cream, it was just gross, it didn't taste like pistachio but something foreign. The waffles were cold, dry and bland. Definitely not worth the time and money to revisit this place
