This place is a classic, it used to be one of my regular places, good food, decent service, been around a long time, good vibe here. I sent in last month and they had new menus - they at least DOUBLED the prices on the menu. 20.00 bucks for a taco plate, no thanks! one of the nice things about mexican food is that it is affordable. Not here!  this place just lost my long term business.
