The buffet is gross and not worth the money. We went here to enjoy a night of Bingo with some friends to celebrate a birthday. We decided it would be easier to eat at the buffet beforehand. Unfortunately, it was a huge mistake. The only thing that tasted good was the salad. Everything else was borderline inedible. Won't be eating here when we come back to the casino.
