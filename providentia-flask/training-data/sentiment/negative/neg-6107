I'm a little embarrassed that Audi would have their A4 launch party here. To give them the benefit of the doubt, it is a launch party so it is expected that the restaurant would be busier than normal.

We waited 45 minutes for 2 rolls and a side, and received no refills on our waters. 

They claimed they comped us, but they just comped a roll they charged me for and didn't I receive. 

Short staffed the night of a launched party, I'm displeased.
