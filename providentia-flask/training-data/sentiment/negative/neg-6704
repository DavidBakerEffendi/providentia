I seriously hope I don't offend the loyal patrons of Enrico's Pizza with the following observation's but here they are. I was once awed by the remarkable creations that sprung forth from this magical Kingston Rd. kitchen, but sadly ten years later the pizza at Enrico's ceases to amaze or even satisfy a churning stomach. 

Scenario: I had been bogged down at work all day and neglected to tend to the most base of human needs, eating. I hadn't ingested anything since 9:00am because I simply hadn't had the chance. I drove directly from work to a Softball game at Blantyre Park. we realized that we we were playing an hour later than we had originally thought and I decided that I would try Enrico's being that it was in the relative proximity.  I took orders and was on my way. 

I will save a lengthy diatribe about the utter lack of quality that I subjected my empty stomach to. But will say this, I seriously considered giving my second slice away and was seconds away from doing just that before a friend jumped in and offered me a trade, his slice for mine. Now I will say that his was better, but it still lacked the quality of the Enrico's of my childhood and now I only have past memories of the glory that Enrico's once held
