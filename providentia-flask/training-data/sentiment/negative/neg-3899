How many different ways can I say "food poisoning".  I know...it's shocking...a Michelin star and all....but it's true.  The only thing I ate that my husband did not was their "signature" Maytag blue cheese souffle.  I woke up the morning after regretting ever having stepped into the restaurant.  It was violent.  I guess it can happen anywhere.  To tell you the truth, the most shocking part of the experience was the total apathy of the restaurant management.  I called to inquire & let them know.  They promptly referred me to "security", who referred me to "risk management", who blew me off.  I guess they won't respond unless my lawyer calls.  Craziness.
