I received a coupon from Pei Wei yesterday for 33% off of Rice, Noodle and Salad Bowls. I gave the coupon to the cashier before placing the order. When the order was rung up, it wasn't giving me the correct discount. The cashier argued with me at first that I was receiving the discount, but the math wasn't adding up. The items on the ticket matched the coupon and, it wasn't working. She asked if she should go to the manager, and I said yes. I was only coming to Pei Wei today because of the 33% off. That's a great discount! 

The manager was very snotty about the situation. He refused to come to speak with me and kept saying, "I have no control over that. I don't issue the coupons. Corporate does." He said that 3 times. Then, he said, "if you want to give her a 25% discount, do it". I had a coupon that stated I should receive 33% off. The cashier came back and repeated what he said and said "I can give you a 25% discount, if you want". Why in the world would I want a 25% discount if I have a coupon from Pei Wei offering 33% off? I told them to cancel my order and I won't be back. The manager's attitude was appalling! If corporate Pei Wei offers 33% off, you are still responsible to honor it. The coupon didn't say, "well, hey, if the manager of a Pei Wei doesn't issue the coupon and corporate does, be prepared for 25% off." It said 33% off!

There was a way that the manager could have handled this correctly. He could have offered something that made up the difference like a free little appetizer or anything, but he made no attempt to fix the issue and acted very exasperated as if I should be ashamed of myself for expecting them to honor the coupon. Seriously??? 

I've been a customer of Pei Wei for more than a decade. I WILL NOT BE BACK. This was some of the worst customer service I have ever received. The manager really needs to learn customer service and maybe take some anger management classes.
