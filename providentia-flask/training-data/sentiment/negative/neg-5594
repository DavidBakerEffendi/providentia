The rooms are decent but nothing to write home about. Most hotels in Vegas have as good or better rooms for the price. The huge issue I have with this place is service. It is terrible. The bar is way under staffed and the bar tender actually told me to wait again and again for 20 minutes. I finally went to the front desk and bought a fifth of jack to pour for myself and friends. The bartender never even came back.

Now that would not really justify a 1 star vote but I stayed there for two nights and had a terrible time getting drinks at the slots and table games. I even requested drink service from the pit boss and he said "yeah it can be tough as we have cut back on cocktailers" what? so they know the bar service sucks but still they do it? bad business
