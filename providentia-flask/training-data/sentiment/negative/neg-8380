Didn't even get to sit down. Walked in, walked out. Plenty of two seat tables open. She tried to seat us right next to the door. I asked if we could not sit by the door. I was brought to another table with the shittiest attitude. I didn't even sit down. I wanted to spit in her face. Won't be going back anytime soon. I can't stand it when your job is to be a host and you cop an attitude..
