I won't be coming back here. Awful experience last night with a server who had a major attitude problem. Not to mention, they made our party sign a contract and we would be charged $100 if our party of 9 was missing ANY people. The restaurant's food isn't even that good to have a stupid policy like this. Not to mention, our party was limited to a smaller menu simply due to our party size.
