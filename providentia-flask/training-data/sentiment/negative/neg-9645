I've never written one of these reviews before but after our experience here I felt I needed to. For those of you who don't want to read my rant, food is awful and made us physically sick.  My boyfriend and I split the chicken fajitas and his dad had the chili relleno, which he said was mediocre. There's no other way to say it, our fajitas were horrible! There were a total of 8 small pieces of tough non-delicious chicken. I kid you not, EIGHT PIECES! And I swear there must have been a whole large onion in it. That, paired with the canned beans and dry rice, had both me and my boyfriend sick all night and part of the following morning. And to wrap it all up, the waitress forgot my boyfriends drink which isn't a big deal but she also forgot she was at work and literally had to flag her down from playing on her phone. The only thing we liked there was my mango Margarita. Props for that I guess...
