Went to this place but different location for the third time, wonder what is the big deal???  Had shredded beef bland taco plate when indeed I ordered the crispy chicken tacos!  I complained about my order and told them I would take the beef because I did not have time to wait was due back at work.  They searched my order and found the chicken request was not included on my order...did not get a refund or credit either!  The food here looks good but it is bland and tasteless.  Being of mexican decent I know good tasting restaurant mexican food when I taste it and this place ceases to amaze me how bad their food is and all the people who love to go?  Its constantly crowded and over rated.  Service is not even good!  Will not waste my money, time or frustration here again.
