Never order! On 5/10/13, my coworkers and I ordered Mr. Hunan's in tempe at 10:30am. At 12pm they brought 2/3 orders. I called and the guy said it would be another hour and then hung up on me! I called back at 12:50 and asked for a manager and he immediately hung up! I never got my food! (i am also diabetic and got sick waiting so long to eat) Don't ever eat there! Ugh! 

Update as of 5/24/13: Learned today that Mr. Hunan's is on the Dirty Diner's list for 7 violations! Look it up! They are horrible! Worst customer service ever and they're nasty!
