Not sure where the great reviews are coming from? My wife and I ate here today,  Easter Sunday and the service was horrible. Our drinking glass had dirty finger prints on the water spotted glasses... pretty gross. Food was ok but over priced for what it was. The waitress wasn't friendly at all. she seemed to have a bit of an attitude. She never really said anything or did anything to us just never said anything when laying the food on our table as she walked by... we had to ask for silver ware no big deal.... We over heard one guy say he wanted to move tables because of her. As a customer I feel employees should treat their customers with a kind greeting no matter how busy or upset they are. Not happy with this place except loved eating outside on the vegas strip.
