One word for the buffet is overrated. 

They have the expectant buffet items, but the items were subpar. Also the three hour wait is another story... Hm... Why not pick a fight with the pushy foreign people during the wait because you're bored? Yes. It might be your only entertainment. Well, there's no way getting around the wait unless you're some "m-life" member. Pfft. My taxi driver recommended the Bally's buffet which I wish we knew about. 

Anyways, just don't go.
