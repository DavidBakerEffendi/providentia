Horrible ! A few friends and myself went here and it took us about 2 hours to get our food . When we finally got it it was cold and not what we ordered! The table behind us had troubles with their order as well . The supervisor told us since we had such a bad experience she was only going to charge us for about 2 meals . When the waitress brung us the check she we saw that we were charged for everything! Our food was cold and had hair in it ! Once we tried to explain that we were being charged for things the supervisor said she wasn't going to charge us for she Flipped out! The waitress was a white girl with red hair , bunch of tattoos and the worst attitude! My friends and I will never come here again !
