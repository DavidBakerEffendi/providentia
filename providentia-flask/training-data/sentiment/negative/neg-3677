I didn't write this review until now because I felt like our case might have been an anomaly so long ago when we went to CIBO for the first and only time. However, a friend has recently gone and had the same major incident.

Although I could write a lot more about my underwhelming experience, the most important part of this review is that CIBO does not take allergies with the utmost of seriousness, nor do they train their staff to do so.

I have a fatal allergy to nuts, which was clearly communicated to my server. She was meant to order a salad without walnuts, but delivered it with the walnuts and was unapologetic or concerned when I let her know (after taking my first bite). The rest of the evening continued to be a gong show, but to me, this was an extremely important slip-up, one that could cost my life.

I just learned last night that a friend of mine ended up in urgent care after a similar experience. It was also their first visit to the restaurant. He is extremely cautious about his nut allergy, so I know that they would have absolutely been forthcoming with their server about it.

CIBO, please educate your staff about the dangers of food allergies. All other restaurants seem to be well-versed, and often follow-up with a manager's visit to the table (unnecessary, but appreciated). Sadly, we will not return to this restaurant, as there are many other choices in the city who consider the health of their patrons their top priority.
