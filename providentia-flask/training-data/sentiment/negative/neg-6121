I was exited to try this buffet what a disappointment. 

Sushi - Rice was hard and fish not fresh

Kobe Beef - Just tough and chewy. I could not finish it.

Braised Short Ribs - Salty 

Spring Rolls - Hard and I could not chew them

Pork Buns - Dry and salty

I will just stop there. It was a a huge disappointment. Nothing really stood out and wowed me. This was my last Vegas buffet. My best meal this trip to Vegas was 
Jack In The Box when I was leaving town. If you offered me this buffet or fast food I would go with the fast food.
