I'm not sure if I should even be writing a review for this place as I have yet to try out their food offering.  But since they opened, I've never been able to visit the store to actually buy food, not because I haven't tried but because their posted hours are almost always not kept.  How many more chances does a place deserve, if you've gone by the store at 4-5 different times and they're always closed?  

How do you run an business without sticking to your posted business hours?  That's a promise you make to your customers.  If Minky's keep this up, it'll meet the same fate that Piazza Monte did who previously occupied this space.  

Will update this review once I've had a chance to try out the food.
