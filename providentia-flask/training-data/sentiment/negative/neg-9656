My husband and I decided to give this little Italian restaurant a try. We have come across some real authentic Italian treasures this way, however this was NOT one.
We had soup and salad which was ok and each ordered their Stromboli ... It comes with mushroom, sausage, and pepperoni. My husband asked to hold the mushrooms. The sauce was poor quality canned marinara. The dough was still raw in the center through out the Stromboli. Mine, which had mushrooms, was 50% stuffed with cheap canned mushrooms. 
We ate what we could from opening it and eating around the raw dough. When we brought it to the waiters attention he explained that all restaurants get the same complaint 
The "Owners" never offered to come speak with us and made it clear that they could care less about the low quality and undercooked food. We paid 29.49 and tipped the waiter his appropriate 15% ( we normally tip at least 30%).... Don't waist your money!!!! There are plenty of really good restaurants that deserve and appreciate your business... This is not one!!!!If I could rate it zero stars, I would!!!
