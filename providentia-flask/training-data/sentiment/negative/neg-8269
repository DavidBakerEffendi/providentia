After walking around the Mirage looking for some food, this restaurant looked pleasant enough. We sat down, were choosing our meal, to discover a German COCKROACH crawling upon our menu. Is the food unclean? Bug infestation? Call me petty but I refuse to eat at a place that supply's bugs as their main course.
