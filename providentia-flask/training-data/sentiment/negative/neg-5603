So being that it was mothers day busy got it. However when the table beside you sat down about half hour after you got there food first was a problem for sure. The appitizers took forever but got them finally. Then got the food cold dead cold. Then my salmon came with a person hair in it so thanks I was disgusted. They said we shall re do them 2 hours down and really not hungry mow. Then waiting on drinks at least half hour to hour to get the refills. Then we realize the steaks were minus the garlic butter sauce, and then my salmon had a tiny piece of bacon on it.. ughh. Then to top it off we get the adjusted bill it was still 91 dollars for what 2 hour wait and bad food. You call that adjusted um seriously. So I would strongly suggest think twice if your hungry. That makes both times we have been here for the terrible food and pay that.. so don't worry I don't plan on ever coming back. So thanks we see what they now. Thanks for ruining my mother's day meal one day I get to go our and pick a place and this what I got. This mom was very sad now headed to burger King cause I am hungry.
