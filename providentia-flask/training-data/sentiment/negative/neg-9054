Oyyy hate to do this but it was not good one bit. Highly overpriced (considering where it was located). I love French food and was visiting in the area for the day, but this was a dreadful mistake. 
Had a quiche and there were bitter (old?) vegetables.
Either way, it was terrible.
My friend ended up getting a crepe/omelette and it smelled disgusting.  We ordered coffees and they were $2.75 and nothing special whatsoever (just regular run-of-the-mill stuff). 

Umm so what was good?
I would say it is quiet but hey, that could be bad, too, right?
