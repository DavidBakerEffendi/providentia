To begin, no one greeted us at the door. Seemed like the waitresses were more intent on conversing with one another then getting us seated. The head hostess rolled her eyes at us when we asked to be seated on the patio. A very poor first impression.

After being seated, we noticed that the waitress always seemed rushed. Even quipping that it was a "slow night", we still went through 10-15 minute periods where we were not waited upon. We waited 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order and then another hour to receive our food.

The bison burger was a complete disappointment. It came dry and cold. Even the highly recommended "Mac and cheese" side came dry. Nothing seemed to be seasoned, not even black pepper or salt!

My friend's order of ostrich burger was no different. Again, dry, and bland. Neither of us could finish our meals.

The owner, however, was an exceedingly kind individual. You could tell that he cared about our experience. He offered us free drinks and comped our meals.

To end off our night, we find out that the waitress had mixed up the glass of wine with a more expensive glass. So what i thought was a $8 glass of wine became $10 (a small difference, but just another mistake).

Overall, i would give this place another try. But, i would hold off until they got their act together. If things don't shape up soon, im not sure how they could keep going.
