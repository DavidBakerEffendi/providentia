Blegh! The only reason I went here was because I really needed Chinese food in my life but was too lazy to travel. So I went right down the street. The food VISUALLY looked appealing but flavor totally escaped this place. I guess, salt, pepper, broth, onion and any other seasoning is not allowed here. I was so super disappointed. Save your money and just go to the usual place that you go to and avoid this disappointment.
