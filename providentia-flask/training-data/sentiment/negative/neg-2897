Caveat Emptor...let the buyer beware! We have been going here for the last few years and have seen a steady decline in customer service. We come from Arizona and purchased a few gift cards, which they told us we couldn't use because their system was down. Sounds bogus and supposedly the gift card system will be back up on Tuesday 10/14? I wonder...how do they know that? It's fishy to me. Not to mention the so-called host Jerry started screaming at me. Just amazed that these places get too big for their britches. By the way the food is on the downturn too, unfortunately. Bottom line: take care of the customer! They seem to have forgotten that.
