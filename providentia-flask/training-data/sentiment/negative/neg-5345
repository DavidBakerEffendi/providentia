Food was good! The waitress (Vanessa) was HORRIBLE! Was not attentive, not sarcastic, just rude... There is a line and she crossed it to me... Didn't have fun with the experience... She was bit involved and didn't seem to enjoy her job. Disappointed that we found this in Vegas of all places!!! Will not come back to this location.....
