I absolutely love Thai food and order it all the time. I've been to Thailand and tried almost ever single Thai dish there is. For the first time ever I've come across the restaurant with the most flavorless dishes ever. We got a delivery and My Thai noodles were over cooked, with no sauce and 3 pieces of chicken. My boyfriend's pad thai was so sad looking (again with 2-3 pieces of. Small chicken) that after 2 bites I just decided to make my own sauces for both the noddles and pad Thai. There are many amazing Thai restaurants in both Tempe and Mesa - stay away from this one.
