Whoa!
 
So I was impressed by the last time I was here and thought it was great. 

Here's a tip. Don't buy a Groupon. You will be completely ignored. 

1) Ignored. Got a happy hr chard while waiting for my friend. She showed up at 5:07, I was there at 4:50. Ordered a glass of wine at happy hour prices while waiting. Got it prob 10 mins later.
2) Friend shows at 5:07... no waiter until 5:20 ish. (First waiter) Order first course and her wine.
3) Waiter 1 asks about 2nd and 3rd courses. Ordered by 5:30.  (See 23 mins in between)
4) 5:40 Friends glass of wine shows up (2nd waitress) and then 1st course (3rd waiter)
5) Soup and salad complete.... Do you want wine? Water? Nope. No contact after delivered by waiter #1
6) Waitress #2 shows up.. can i take your plates? No water No ask of other drinks.
7) Waiter 3 delivers pork belly. No service no wine no water
8)  Pork belly overdone. Still somewhat ok with Johnny cakes. Never talked to, never asked any questions about getting anything else, how is the food etc.
9) Waiting.. waiting.. Enter hostess. Clears. table.
10) 605 main course shows up delivered by waiter 3. 
11) Where is wine pairing? 
12) 615, almost done with course, wine shows up.
13) 630. Where is a server? No questions, no water, no anything else? Wanted dessert...
13b) Get up and ask hostess for check since we are completely ignored. 
14) Hostess takes phone for groupon and gracious enough to do something that isn't her job.
15) Hostess brings wrong check (Not her job)
16) Get up to tell hostess it's wrong check (Not her job)
17) Hostess brings correct check (Not her job)
18) Get all thanks for coming in from waiter 1, waitess 2 who never spent any time waiting on anything.

Forget it. I brought a friend because I had a good experience before. Never again. 

Thanks for nothing. Took over an hour and a three quarters for 3 courses and terrible service. 

Soup was delicious.
Pork belly overcooked 
Steak was perfect. Beans were still crunchy. 
Will not be back. 

I generally am an overtipper on the price of the bill when I have a Groupon... and I always tip on the base price of the meal, not the Groupon price - not this time. But jeez - Groupon discrimination. Not going back.
