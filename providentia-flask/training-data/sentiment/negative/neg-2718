This used to be one of my favorite casinos: Classy rooms, great sports book, good casino-floor bar... but now I simply cannot set foot in it due to the perfume smell they pump in!

Even standing outside the main doors it is overpowering.  Whatever you do, don't book a room here unless you're somehow handicapped in what you can smell or are one of those terrible women that everyone hates because they can't smell the shitloads of perfume they themselves wear.
