I usually like BWW but this place was bad. Pretty empty when we got there at 8pm, a couple of 8-10 people groups came in and there was still plenty of room. First sign of trouble, "I'll have a ... IPA, draft", comes back in a bit "we are out of that", "I'll have the Dogfish 60 IPA" (a pretty standard IPA), comes back in a bit "we are out of that, how about a Stone IPA", "Sure" I say, comes back in a bit "we are out of that", WTF? My wife orders coffee, "we are out of creamer, we do have milk", OK, whatever. Put in a order for wings, pretty simple, it's in their name, it took 1/2 an hour for them to show up. They would stop by every 5-10 minutes to see if we wanted a beer refill, no thanks, I'll finish my food and get out of here.
