We went there last Sunday for lunch.  The food tasted good and I liked the claim  about no MSF.  So far so good until .... we got home and all felt extremely sleepy.  It was a general weak/fatigue feeling.  It was not food poisoning and no one threw up or made a run to the bathroom.  It was as if we were under "influence".  I slept twice.  My mom could not manage to eat even around dinner time.  My BF dozed off on the couch.  I did not get better until after I had my dinner (mainly protein).  

It was strange, and the only common denominator among all parties was that one lunch.  I am not sure if it is due to "MSG" or other things in the food.   I just know that I won't go back.
