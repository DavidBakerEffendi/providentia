My boyfriend and I wondered over here at about 10 am on a Sunday. We were greeted not with a hello but a very rude "We have no prime rib and no crab legs!" We had never been here so we didn't know that was the normal menu. We said that would be fine we were just really hungry. After listening to the cashier bash one of the employees standing near the door and paying almost $40.00 for the two of us to get breakfast we were taken to our table. We both went and grabbed a plate and headed back. Not only was everything on my plate cold (ham, pork, some kind of breakfast sausage) but we didn't get a drink until we asked for a waiter after 20 minutes! The staff were all gathered near the drink station talking. We ate maybe 2 bites of our food and decided since it was cold we didn't want to be sick and left. We will never eat here again!!!!

**Update- This business did reach out to me after reading my review and have extended an invitation to try it again which I think is very cool. I have not had a chance to take them up on their offer but I think it says good things about management.
