Recommended by a coworker who typically has great taste. Honey Salt did NOT live up to the hype . While the staff is very nice and has the right tone for the atmosphere, the food is not worth the time ( very slow service). Calamari was rubbery and over cooked. Husband's Sea Scallops were cooked unevenly and were a huge disappointment. Duroc pork chop was ordered medium and came over cooked as well, chutney looked like it came out of a deep freezer. Grits were okay. Rainbow carrots were the best effort made, but come on- its carrots. Upon learning we were unhappy with our meal- the appropriate actions were taken, so you've got to appreciate that,but we won't be back. A real disappointment.
