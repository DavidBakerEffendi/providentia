Was hoping to come try this place out after a hike at Red Rock and was disappointed to have a "closed" sign simply hung without care.  The food on the website makes it look like it would challenge Cafe Rio but guess that's not the case. Even the companies own website says they are open, which isn't true. Considering how many places have burritos and tacos, not sure I'll even bother trying to come back to this place again. Makes you wonder why they would close, health district shut them down? Treat their employees poorly so they don't have staff to keep it open? Doesn't matter now, lost this customer.
