At the time of year 2002, the Venetian was the top of line for me. The hotel stay was about $250 a night. I stayed with friends for about 3 nights. The room was huge having 2 queen beds and a sofa queen bed. There were 2 TVs.  One TV in the sofa area and another in the 2 queen beds area. The only issue is that if you remove or move a any items in the refrigerator, then you would be charged that rate for the removed item. I was charged a rate, in which my friend argued with them and they removed the charge.  

Now it should be a 3 star hotel

I have stayed at the Venetian back in 2010 and it was not well taken care of. For better rooms, you would need to stay in the Venezia or the Palazzo. 

The rating of this room is still ok, but not as clean and taken care of as the rest of the other hotels.
