We just ate here for lunch and it was absolutely, positively the most horrendous service I have ever received at a restaurant.  We waited over 1 hour and 45 minutes for our food and the only reason we didn't just walk was they kept saying it was on it's way.. obviously a lie.  Then we found out that they mixed our ticket up with someone else's... they clearly had not even looked into the problem for the last hour we were asking about the food and people that were seated 45 minutes after us were receiving theirs!!  That is just laziness.  There was minimal apology from the manager and absolutely zero remorse or apology from the waitress who had clearly not done anything to advocate for us in the kitchen.  On top of that, the shepherd pie was bland and the salad was doused in dressing.

Coming out for lunch with the office and it taking over 2 hours to eat is absolutely unacceptable.  We used to come here regularly after work, but after today we will NEVER be back.
