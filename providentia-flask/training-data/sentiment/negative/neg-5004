Went for a bite at an awkward time on Sunday, between lunch and dinner. Had the duck fat fries and buffalo chicken wings, neither of which were great. Would have been okay, but the service was just plain rude. She was stunned that we didn't want to order alcohol and was visibly impatient as we placed our orders.

By far the worst service I've ever received at any restaurant.
