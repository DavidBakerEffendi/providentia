The hubby and I came here after seeing a movie. I ordered a burger with a red ale, nothing fancy, just simple. I got sick from my meal. I'll probably be up all night getting sick from whatever was in the food I ate. To make matters worse, it happened a few hours before our flight home so I'll have to hold it together long enough to get home on the plane without getting sick. Thanks a lot, Lazy Dog! Your food and what it did to me is the perfect way to end this trip.
