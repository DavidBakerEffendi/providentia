Okay so Fuddruckers... I like several things about this place. The food is really good. The jalapeno cheese sauce is truly amazing and burgers are yummy.

But here's the downside unfortunately I've eaten here three separate times. The price is kinda expensive, which I look past for good food. The service wasn't that impressive. But here's the real kick to a restaurant that I enjoy the food, Is I've gotten food poisoning all three times. That's enough to scare me off from here. I chalked the first time up to a pretty rare hamburger. the second time was maybe dumb luck because the burger that time was well. But on my third visit I'm blaming the restaurant because this is pretty impressive on how I get ill every time I eat here. Worst of all it was not just me. 

Now I don't have a weak stomach by any means and your food is really good. But I'm not sure what it is and why I get food poisoning every time I come here. But it's probably a issue with your level of sanitation. My guess.

My advice to anyone who reads this, be careful. The food is good. But you're probably going to shit and pule your brains out for a day or so.
