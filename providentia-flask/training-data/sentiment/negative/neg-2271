Considering I work in the airport, I know lines are long and most of the employees hate their jobs. I get it. But when you ask for no mayonnaise because your ALLERGIC, you'd think to include that part on the note so it can be conveyed to the sandwich maker. Nope. Never happens, the managers are sweethearts, but the employees they need to check into. 4 out of 5 times I get mayonnaise & a dirty look . And sometimes if your extra lucky they will even leave the plastic on the cheese slices for you when you bite into your sandwich.

Honestly the one star is for the managers. If I could give the restaurant less stars I would.
