If you are looking for Pad Thai go someplace else. What they gave me smelled bad, and was WAY over seasoned with salt. It was inedible. 

For a carry-out Chinese place this falls horribly short of already low expectations. 

The only saving grace of the food was the fried dumplings. 

Sad. Just embarrassingly sad.
