Normally, it's really super duper awesome food. That should be the only reason to ever come here. But customer service has never been good... possibly decent if the counter person is someone new and they haven't been indoctrinated to being a bitch. I've been here more than 30 or so times and each and every time, the counter person is always rude, arrogant, and pretentious with holier-than-thou smug look and attitude. Tonight... when I'm really hungry and not in the mood to tolerate shitty attitude, this was the straw the broke the camel's back. I mentioned I had a burger before but don't remember what it was and the counter person said it probably was the red potatoes/garbanzo but suggested the beet burger and I'm not into it. I asked if I could get crispy onions that normally would come on the beet burger to be placed on the red potatoes/garbanzo burger and the counter person said No! In an offended way and flustered while she talked down to me saying that I should have the food the way it's made because everything is paired perfectly the way it is. Ok, I wanted to walk out then and there. Ummm... if I'm paying for something, would it fucking kill you to put onions on burger for me since I like onions?! I ended up ordering the breakfast burrito instead and just wanted to have something to refuel. Seriously, what ever happened to customer service?! I hate how vegans are so damn smug. You can take your Marxist attitudes and shove it. This is another place that's gone wrong.
