Very pricey and the selection of food is limited and is not what i expect. Dont waste your money. I cant fathom why the crab leg was split in half and then soak in hot water, are you serious? That would drain the juice from the meat itself and whoever thought of doing that is cheap and cheat on the people who unknowingly paid for. Save yourself from the ridiculous amount of money you pay. Luxor is better if you want crab legs they have a good kind of crab legs.And seriously upon payment they would ask for a tip? I haven't been served yet why are you asking for a tip? I wont come back
