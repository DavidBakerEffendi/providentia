I've been to this location numerous times just because it's so convenient, but I don't plan on returning. The quality at this location is awful. We ordered chips and queso and the chips were terribly stale. When we asked for new chips, the employee turned to her colleague and asked for new chips to be made as "the chips have been stale all day." Not too sure if she knew we heard her, but if you knew the chips were stale, why would you knowingly continue to serve them to your patrons!?! I can only assume they could care less about the quality of their product and their employees take zero pride in their workplace. Such a shame. This location is an embarrassment. I'll be driving farther from now on to go to a Cafe Rio that cares about who and what they serve.
