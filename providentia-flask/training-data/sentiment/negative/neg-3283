The owner of this establishment is outright very rude and has an attitude that makes you feel that you don't matter. This was one of our favorite places to go and used Groupons whenever it's available. However, using Groupons seems to be unwelcomed to the owner. He didn't even acknowledge us as normal owners would. At first I thought it was me who felt that way, but after hearing what my daughter inlaw experienced, I was furious and realized that my feelings were real. Normally, I don't write negative reviews but after reading some of the comments made, I felt that I needed to add to it. 
Because we dont consume alcohol with our food, they seem to feel that we're taking advantage. If you don't want us to use Groupons for just dinner, do not advertise your business there. I will definitely report to Groupon of our bad experience and will request a refund since we did buy several.
I'm sorry to say that this Hawaii influenced restaurant does NOT have the Aloha Spirit. We will not be coming back here ever, and rest assured my many friends and family will be informed. 
I just hope that the people working there realizes that respect is earned when given.
