HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!  DINERS BEWARE!

We had lunch at this place yesterday......it turned to be a horrifying experience. As I finished lunch portion and got myself some of the dessert, while conversing with my friend who was enjoying his round 2 of lunch.......I noticed a C O C K R O A C H  walking around the stuffed and fried potatoes serving dish at the buffet bar! Yes you read right a F'n cockroach!  I was disgusted, nauseated and nearly vomited. I brought it to the lady's attention (she does not speak English!!!!), she called another guy who took the dish to the kitchen. When they opened the kitchen door, I became more nauseous.  Kitchen looked awful, dirty and unkempt. They guy then came out and started walking around as if nothing had happened. No one apologized or came to talk to me about this miserable experience.  I insisted on speaking to the owner. They finally got him. I told him about it. He immediately canceled the check and that was pretty much it. No apologies, no what action they will take to remedy this. 
needless to say, I will report this to city health department.  But I thought everyone out there should know about this.  In this day and age, in the U.S., this SHOULD NOT happen!
