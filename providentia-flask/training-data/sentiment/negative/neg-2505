If it was possible to give this place a half of a star, I would. Tacky, unattractive waitresses. Poor concept. And the fact they are actually promoting poor health is extremely sad.  But then a again the owner is short and bald which explains everything. You have to try to get attention somewhere. It is no wonder some of the other branches are closing their doors.
