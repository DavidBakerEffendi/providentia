Horrible experience here.
Pros:...
Cons: 
-Our waitress smelled.  I'm sorry to say it but she had terrible BO. 
-The miso soup was screaming hot, like out of a microwave hot and it burned my mouth
-Before we even had 2 bites of out appetizers, our entrees were brought out
-I had "sushi" and it was so poorly constructed that I couldn't pick it up with chopsticks, the slices were of such different thicknesses that it looked like a joke
-Before we were halfway through our entrees, the check was brought out, waitress never asked how this were or if we'd like anything else.
-Not plates were ever cleared
P.S. the restaurant wasn't busy and I was there on an anniversary date
