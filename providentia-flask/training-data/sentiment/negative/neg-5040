Where do I even start? The owner/manager whatever she was, was the rudest woman I've ever encountered. She berated her employees and gave the place an air of stress, tension and  unease. Joey, who was the brunt of most of her meanness was the kindness guy, so funny and nice. The restaurant itself was dirty, smelled funny and had bad service. The food was not that great but the chef did a good job. The waitress was nice but came off as flustered and overwhelmed. We did teppanyaki ate and paid. When we got to the car someone came out and said that we'd been over charged and they'd overhead them say that we'd paid for everyone at the table. I went back in and waited my turn all the while listening to the owner run around yelling at her employees. When they got to us it turned out we'd been charged correctly after all but she yelled at the employees anyway.  The evening ended with me literally yelling at the owner to be nice. Horrible experience.
