I was expecting the same service as from any other Red Devil restaurant, but it was completely opposite. I picked up my take out order only to have it spill all over me and the inside of my truck just setting it down. I grabbed the bags and took it to the counter and made the 2 so called employees aware and all he did was grab a small plastic bag, another paper bag and told me to handle it because he didn't have time. I grabbed my order and took to the lobby and expressed my frustrations to him and he tells me that I need to calm down around his customers. I believe I was a customer as well, but didn't get treated that way. That is the first and last time I will eat at that location. Pathetic service at best
