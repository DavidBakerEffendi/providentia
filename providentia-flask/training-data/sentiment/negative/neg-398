The concept is cool make your own pizza and it comes out within minutes. Add as much toppings as you want and POOF you have your own personal pizza.  OK... I'm just ok with it bc I've been to their competitors and I thought they would be different from pictures on FB which showed a line of draft beers... that was misleading. What kinda got me pissed was that I ordered a house salad and I asked for onions and the dude behind counter said rudely "no I can't put onions, you want croutons"  why the F can u not put onions? I asked .... rudely he states "because I can't".  Maybe he was having a bad day but no need to be like that. Anyway so service sucks and pizza was decent at best. What I did enjoy was the plethora of hot sauces. I always end my reviews with a saying... this time I'll pass on the saying
