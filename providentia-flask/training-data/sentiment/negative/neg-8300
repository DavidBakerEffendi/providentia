The worst service. Since this place is the only Chinese takeout in the area we gave this place two try's in hopes that perhaps the first time was an isolated incident. However each time was we went the service and food were consistent. Consistently awful. 
The manager is extremely rude. He literally threw my credit card back at me after I submitted it for payment. 

The food is really awful. I would rather go downtown or to any takeout place other than this place if I wanted Chinese. 

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.
