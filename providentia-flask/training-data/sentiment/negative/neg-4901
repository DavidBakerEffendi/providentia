I ordered through GrubHub on the Yelp app, and was told it would be 35 minutes. The driver notified me on her arrival at the store that the restaurant hadn't even began preparing my order. She actually saw the order on their counter and had to notify them it was there. Then after 15 minutes, only gave her 2 of 3 sandwiches and informed the driver they were out of tuna. The driver was patient and waited, I cannot believe she had to. I should have paid better heed to previous reviews. Stay away from this location.
