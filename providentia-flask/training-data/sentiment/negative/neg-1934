These stupid idiots! I went here and I stood at the counter while the dummy 1 and dummy 2 sat there gossiping. I ask  dumb ass 1 ( Aracely) if they were making anything fresh, seeing that it was only around 8:15 pm 

So I ask what the wait time is and dummy 1 says the wait time is five minutes. She then proceeds to ask the next Black who comes in if we were paying together. Really dumb ass! So here I am waiting, after 10 minutes, I ask how much longer it's going to be. This dummy asked the cook and he says 5 minutes! Really another 5 minutes...I decided to leave so I didn't slap this idiot across the face with a spring roll that I didn't pay for.

You better believe I'm reporting this entire experience. My time was wasted and not once did this chicken head apologize.
