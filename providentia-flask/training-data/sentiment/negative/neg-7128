I visited their kiosk at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

First off, the area was a mess. No effort was made to tidy up the serving area or the adjacent dining area. I picked a one meat, one veggie plate with the lamb and something, I don't remember now. It didn't look appetizing but it was the most appealing thing behind the glass, but the stuff looked as if it had been sitting around for hours. OK, whatever, I didn't eat breakfast and I need to eat something. So I take a few bites of the veggie with some of the rice. It doesn't taste bad, but it was cool, not hot or even warm.

After a few bites, I have to run to a bathroom, and I pitched the rest of the meal in the trash. I didn't even get to the lamb.

Less than 12 hours later I had chills, cold sweats and felt nauseous. I missed an entire day of the show I was attending. Thanks guys, you're sure swell!
