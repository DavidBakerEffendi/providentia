Although the drinks are nice, the help is pathetic.  I asked for an Al pacino only to find the old recipe (9 mos ago) is no longer the same number of shots.

I then asked why there was no chocolate around the cup, "oh we do that sometimes, but didnt know what you wanted..seriouslY?

Lastly I said no problem, what's your name, he says NONE OF YOUR business....really?  The new owner needs to get a fucking clue.  your help knowing when they're wrong just made it the worst situation.  As a top reviewer, I will make it my mission to expose everything about a business, and this type of stupidity, by a 20 something kid that had no interest in being honest was enough to get me to flip him off...his attitude was the worst I've dealt with in years and although I know better, I expect better.

Lastly, he hollers at me, I served you after we're closed...yet the sign said open, and the door was wide open...really?  What a worthless waste of 20something space...get a clue kid, if the door is open you own it...don't be a douchebag.

Do NOT waste your time here, the new owner has no flippin clue what his staff is doing and as a result, you're drop in business is due to that...best wishes, looking forward to the next business to take it's place.

BTW, I lived in Seattle 19 yrs...I know coffee...not faux coffee...seriously, if you can see through the pissed off rant, you'll know you're better off going up one more exit to Starbucks.
