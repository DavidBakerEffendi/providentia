Wife and I stopped in for lunch.  I ordered bone in wings with lemon pepper.  My wife had the boneless garlic Parmesan.  My wings were cooked perfectly but the oil was not allowed to drain before putting them in my tray.  The wings on the bottom of the tray were saturated with oil because they were in oil about 1/4 inch deep.  My wife's boneless wings were oily due to the excess batter that was on the so called boneless wings which had a very thick batter that held in the oil.  She ended up removing the batter and just eating the chicken.  The veggie sticks (carrots and celery) were old and crusty looking.  Like they had been in the refrigerator for quite a few days.  The Cole slaw was OK, but could have had just a little more sugar to make it better.  The music drove us crazy the entire time we were trying to enjoy our meal.  Why do businesses play Rap music?  Just turn off the so called music and let us eat in peace.
