This place is not good AT ALL!!!  The seating is not comfortable. If you want a chair with a back you have to sit at the bar. Took our food over an hour. The waitress said there was a mix up in the kitchen! The place isn't that big anyway! Not many people there so what was the problem?!?!?  Food had no seasoning. Asked for mayonnaise. Never got it. Potatoes overcooked. Will not be returning!
