Oh where to start..... Went here last weekend on a Friday and the place was maybe 10% full. Yet I was asked why I did not have reservations. *looking around* are you serious?? They had like 20 plus tables that were not even a third were filled throughout the whole evening. The patio had so much potential, however having no lighting I was not the only one struggling to see the menu. By the end of the night we were lit by a cell phone glow of people around us trying to read their menus. How romantic!

Drinks: The extremely watered down sangria that tasted like white grape juice with A SINGLE canned peach slice stuck to the bottom. Just nasty. Even the water smelled like mildew and I didn't dare touch the dried out lemons.

Appetizer: My fiance ordered the Fiaggi Misti (meat and cheese assortment, supposedly) It consisted of Oscar Meyer look a like garlic bologna, even worse "sopressatta" that looked like a hunk of fat, and two choices of tiny pieces of dried out cheeses. Oh yes, let us not forget the store bought bread sticks brought out in their packaging still, on top of the assortment still in the damn wrappers, stuck between 3 kalamata olives. What the hell do I do with all the wrappers now? Beyond disgusting. Worst part is that they charge $15 for the damn thing!! 

Dinner: Now I enjoy my pizza well done. I just do. Don't ask, just make it happen, ok??! The Toscana pizza that we ordered, was neither well done, and had Wal-Mart quality ingredients. Terrible mozzarella, soggy whole mushrooms, and bland sausage with zero fennel, whatsoever. The sauce was more of a bland paste than a sauce. 

Waiting 35+ minutes for the bill when asked several times ensured the zero likely-hood of us ever returning. EVER. But with two servers for the entire place, what did we expect?
