Interesting decor, mediocre food, slightly creepy accordion player.   Free wine with dinner was horrible and food comes out on carts - looks like they are serving a huge number of people as quick as they can.  Salads were made way ahead (not good) and pasta was just ok.   Large volume of food at reasonable (for Vegas) price
