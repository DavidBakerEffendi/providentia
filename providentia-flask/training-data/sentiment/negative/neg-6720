Absolutely a horrible experience. We ate at Sky on a Friday night and there were only 2 other tables. This should of been our sign. We sit down and order our drinks as well as appetizers at the same time. 15 minutes later our appetizers come out and still no drinks. At this point we are a bit annoyed. Next, the food comes out along with the salads and soups we ordered which should of came out prior to our entrees. When our meal was over our waiter asked to high five everyone at our table. Completely unprofessional and not wanted. Lastly one of the couples at our table had a coupon of which had to be scanned from her phone so the waiter took her phone to the computer to do so. He comes back 10 minutes later and forgets her phone. The service was the worst I have ever experienced. I will NEVER be back and I will tell everyone I know to not waste their time.
