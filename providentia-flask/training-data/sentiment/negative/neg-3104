If I could I would give this place 1.5 stars: 1 star for the excellent service from Dougie our waiter, who thought he was making great suggestions, and made us feel welcome at this establishment5 for my yummy Almond Joy martini.  In short... The Sugar Factory should just stick to making drinks, and desserts/candy.  Let some place else handle the food, as everything we had was either missing a component (we weren't informed about the missing ingredient until we complained about it... and didn't get comped), stale, way overpriced like the 3 tiny ass mac & cheese balls and a boat load of creamy tomato sauce for $15, or outright horrible.  If you're in the mood for drinks and dessert this is the place.  For food... please do your stomach and wallet a favor and go some place else.
