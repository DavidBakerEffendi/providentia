Horrible customer service.  I will never return again.  I came here for lunch with my 5 month old baby who was sleeping in a car seat and my mother and we asked for a table of 3.  The server initially seated us at a table that's good for 4 people, which is fine, because I could use the extra seat to support the infant car seat.  After settling down, making sure not to disturb my baby and adjusting the seat so that the car seat was secured; she then asked us to move to another table.  I asked her why? and she said the car seat is taking up too much space.  At this point I was really annoyed as I already lugged the 40lb infant car seat into the restaurant and sat at the table she brought us to and we had already settled down and she had the audacity to ask us to sit at another table.  My breaking point was that the restaurant was NOT BUSY at all, it was not even quarter full on a Friday afternoon.   I'm not about to play musical chairs here.  Obviously the server does not have any common sense or courtesy.  We walked out of the restaurant, because we do not deserve to be treated this way.  I'm sure the food is not even that great, we ended up going to Sushi Legend near the Chartwell shopping Centre.  They are much more accommodating to family and had way better customer service.  So I suggest to others to save your money and go somewhere else where you are welcomed.
