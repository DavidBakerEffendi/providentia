Not at all authentic.  The noodles are not good ramen noodles,  they lack the chew n texture of ramen noodles.   It was more of a Chinese noodle.   We had spicy tonkatsu,  original tonkatsu,  spicy miso and black.   The spicy tonkatsu lacked flavor and was oily. The only ramen that had decent flavor was the black.   Service was awful,  wrong orders,  missing items,  didn't take down items ordered. We will not be back
