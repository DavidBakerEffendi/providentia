Customer service and bell service worst experience ever when checking out. Not coming back ever here again . When I was checking out I simply asked a question and your worker who was assisting me had the biggest attitude. My questioned was about the bell service and there was a miss understanding communication. I was explaining him what happened. How to check out with bell service because it was my first time getting it. I came in line first earlier thinking it was okay to check out first before getting bell service. The lady who was directing the line to the worker to help the check out for the customer. I briefly asked her that I wanted to get bell service for the check out. She said go to the room and dail luggage . Then come back down for the check out. So when I came down I told your employee what had happened during I was in the process of checking out. He had me go back upstairs and to get my ticket for bells service. Once , I enter the room my items weren't there. Once, again I called luggage service explained what happened. The lady had no clue if they took our belongings. So , she redirected me to the bell service desk. I go to the valet / luggage bell service. Explain the guy what happened and I gave him my room number. That I didn't get my ticket for bell service. Very unprofessional overall from customer service, bell service , and also Sunday evening roughly 11pm there was 2 security guys . My friend and I were together and he saw me with my friend as I'm scanning my key card. He stops my friend is she with you. Of course she is I did not appreciate that at all. I was a loyalty customer for the past 2 yrs . The guy go helped me did not smile or didn't even asked how was my stay . Also, the room cleanliness was score of 0 the head broad was so dusty that your maid has not dust at all . You can aslo even see dust on the stand lamp . For the price I paid this should of never happened .
