I came in before 9pm and that's a mistake because the chips are cold and rather chewy. The rice I ordered was dry and hard and my server was busy chatting it up with other staff rather than taking care of me. I have to keep in mind that this is not Gallo Blanco and this hot mess needs more help than taking the physical location of an awesome restaurant. Remain tranquilo and move on.
