Absolutely awful service!! My mom and I just went for a late night dinner and no one came to our table. The place was empty so I thought maybe you had to dine at the bar. I asked the bartender if we order with her and she said, "oh yeah I can take your order, I see you" then when she came she rudely asked if we wanted something to drink and when she brought our waters she walked away immediately. There was NO ONE in there. HORRIBLE. I suggest the owner reevaluates his staff because I work in the restaurant industry and I can understand certain situations but jeez that service was the worst. Lol comical.
