My boyfriend just got the worst food poisoning from your Subway last night. He had the Rotisserie chicken and has been puking straight from 4-9am. We will never eat here again. Unfortunate because we live across the street. We've been trying to call you all morning and you don't answer your phones. It's pretty ridiculous. "Eat Fresh" more like "Kill me now"
