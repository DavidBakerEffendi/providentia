I was really wanting to like this place. I went here for a french coffee and to take a look at their baked items. I wasn't really hungry tho so I just settled for the coffee. They asked me if I'd like cream and I said yes. I am handed a cup with no cream and every sip of coffee that I could bare to take had coffee grounds in it. Unfortunately I didn't take a sip until I was far away from this place. Maybe I'll go back to try their baked goods because they did look good.... and maybe I'll try the coffee again but for now 1 star.
