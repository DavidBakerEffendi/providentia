After finding out they are serving Kobe beef steak we decided to bypass M's and Aria's and eat at Bellagio's. What can go wrong with all you can eat Kobe beef, right?! WRONG!! What a horrible mistake we made. First of all, they charge kids 5 and over FULL price as adults. What a rip-off, how much can 6 yrs old eats?!.....
The Kobe beef is such a disappointment, the meat is overcooked and dry like they are from Home Town buffet, I tried two different batches and they all tasted the same.  I actually felt sorry for the "KOBE" cows that had to die for this... With so much other BETTER options around Vegas, we will never be back at Bellagio's buffet.
