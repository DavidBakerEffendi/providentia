Definitely not for us....Fries and onion rings were greasy. The onion rings were like the cheapest ones from the grocery store. The hot dog was blackened. With two kids meals and one hamburger and one hot dog and a small order of onion rings which was 6 onion rings (since they wouldn't substitute a few rings for fires) the bill was $32.We definitely have no plans to return.
