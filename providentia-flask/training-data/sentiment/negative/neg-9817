I tried this place a couple years ago after it replaced the last restaurant, and hadn't been back. I looked at the reviews, gave the place the good of the doubt, and tried it again. The food is awful. Some other reviewers mentioned that the americanized food wasn't good, but the 'authentic' chinese food was great. I ordered the shrimp and eggplant in szechwan sauce, as I assumed that may be somewhat authentic. There was no flavor I could point out whatsoever. The eggplant was mushy and bland. The shrimp tasted like garlic and nothing else. I remembered the fried rice from before and it reminded me why it took me years to go back.
Take a drive, go to China Chili in Phoenix, get the Sichuan Prawns (notice, they are spelled correctly), and enjoy your food. I ask you to never go to this restaurant.
