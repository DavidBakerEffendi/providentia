Usually we like Salty's but when we went there for a fun Saturday Cinco De Mayo party. Our day went from fun to totally grossed out!!!!
They had these plastic yard glasses that they were selling for $5,so if you pay the extra $$$ and you get to keep the glass.
 Well apparently they didn't order enough, and they were telling the bus boys they need to try and collect them if they could. Now I'm all about helping some one out in need. That is if they ask me nicely....BUT.......there was this little punk a$$ bus boy that wasn't even asking if we would give them up, he was trying to just take them off our table. 
Rule #1 DON'T TOUCH MY BEER. 
Rule #2 ASK ME NICELY IF YOU CAN TAKE MY STUFF FROM MY
TABLE.
Rule #3 DON'T MAKE RUDE COMMENTS ABOUT MY FRIENDS AND I WHEN WE SAY NO THANK YOU.
See it's really not our problem you guys ran out. Call you beer vendor and ask him to bring you more. That's what you pay him for. 
So after a while some of us decided to mingle and see what they had going on in the blocked off parking, with the band and stuff.
And who should we see rifling thru THE GARBAGE but that same bus boy looking for those green PLASTIC yard glasses!!!! 
I almost threw up my overpriced cheese quesadilia!! We could not believe it. We told the management what we saw, and hopefully it wasn't the same management that told him to do it. And they seemed less then interested.
Instead of telling management I should have called the Board of Health. YUCK!!!!
Think of it this way people, if they're pulling those plastic cups out of the trash to make more $$$$ what else are they pulling out of the trash to resale to make more $$$$. That is just Wrong and Nasty!!!
Salty's you should really be ashamed of yourselves.
