I love getting smoothies but, unfortunately, today I wasn't loving it. It took almost 10 minutes standing at the counter to even get acknowledged. I understand being busy. All the different locations are. However, they typically will yell out, "be right with you." Not here! Noting! We were actually thinking about leaving and driving down the street to the other location.
