Wow this place amazes me with the service I receive when I come here. If I could give no stars I would. The only reason I came here again is because it's so close but forget it... I'm so done with this location... Rude people on the intercom whom have absolutely no patience and will hang up the Mic if you take too long *if your family has a question* I have received multiple wrong orders and it seems as if all the staff here really doesn't care about the customers. I realize that it isn't a career but the least the associates could do was to try and care.... F- sonic management never coming here again. I'm disgusted....
