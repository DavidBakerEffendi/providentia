Yuck!! We ordered delivery a week ago! I really wanted this place to be my new fried chicken place since it's in the neighbourhood, but all I got was gravy that was thinner than soup, chicken that had no flavour other than salt, and lots of salt! And the Mac salad wasn't even homemade! Take  out menu was put in garbage so I can forget this whole ordeal!
