Ok, the pho was not bad tasting at all. It was actually ok however 2 hours after I ate it I experienced dizziness and got nauseated and ill! I threw up all the food that I ate from that place. I do not now what that happened but it happened to me. The food was not bad and the waiter barely understood English. I cannot recommend this place after it made me so ill. I do not wish it on anyone. Be warned.
