This review is about the FOOD only! I'm in town and without a vehicle so naturally I was looking up some tasty delivery options on yelp, when I came across cuisine malaya, I was elated to see that they delivered.  I got my food fast, both dishes came in very nice containers and I was sure i was in for a real treat! Based on other reviewers I had the steamed Popiah  and the beef Char kway teow..

Back to the opening of the containers.... First the steamed popiah, I'll admit I have never had popiah before and they probably would have been better if they were fried.   The popiah consisted of a thick roll stuffed with mostly rice and some other ingredients, it was topped and garnished very nicely, the problem is.... It didn't taste like anything!!!  I'm a firm believer in not eating tasteless food.   

The char kway teow was similar in appearance to pad see ewe but again, this dish was tasteless..... I mean I couldn't taste any flavors! How does this even happen?? Did they forget to add flavor to my meal???  I ended up only eating a tiny amount of my food... 

 It's so sad when you have something that looks delicious, but turns out to be a barrel of bland.....
