Very disappointing and they just didn't seem to care. I researched a central place for a group coming from around the Valley to meet for a late brunch. I was excited to see that this place served brunch until 3pm with $2 drink specials. Once seated I went back up to the hostess to ask for a brunch menu and was told there was no brunch or drink specials today because of an event. The lunch menu was a bit disappointing with few options that seemed overpriced. We were sat at a table that hung out into the main walkway so a few of our party kept getting bumped by staff and customers. They serve everything in GIANT bowls and platters that just make it difficult to fit everything on your table. The BBQ chicken chopped salad was a huge disappointment- I asked for no tomatoes which meant I didn't get any other toppings either. The explanation given was that the toppings are premixed with the tomatoes. This may have affected my ordering decision and a good server would have mentioned this up front. I can make chicken and lettuce at home. My chicken salad was also lacking much chicken. Before the food even arrived the manager came by the table and asked how things were going. I attempted to let him know I felt like there was a "bait and switch" with the brunch menu and information presented online. He immediately shut us down and said it was because if an event at the stadium. I pointed out there is no mention of this policy on the website and the event wasn't for another 2 hours. The other frustration was the server just couldn't keep our drinks filled- this Phoenix people! I spent my college days waiting tables and my husband has been in the food service industry for 16 years, we try to be understanding and realize sometimes things happen, but this was such a collection of awfulness I just had to let people know.
