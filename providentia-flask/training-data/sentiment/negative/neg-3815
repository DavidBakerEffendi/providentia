Apparently u need to go with a group of 4 or 3 vs 2 as we got there about 20 min earlier than a group of 4 and had to wait an extra 20 min after they got sat. I complained and they explained that they only have so many 2 man seats. That's complete bullshit. It's completely diff if it's a table that sits 8-10. Obv they don't want to sit 2 but to say 3/4 gets priority is crazy. Also, they have way to much bar seating that u can order from the bar the whole menu but not get the wine along with it. Makes no sense. I haven't even eaten and I hate this place but I'm too hungry to leave. Better be good!
