Lotus of Siam is SOOO!!! much better but Chada Thai is open late. We recently returned to Chada Thai after 2 &1/2 years, The food was barely OK but we did not get sick this time. However, the memory of how sick we got from Chada Thai's food before still remains very vivid, as does the memory of how very little their management cared about the problem. We had several excellent meals there before but they poisoned us and could not have cared less. This place sucks and their sanitation cannot be trusted, we will probably not return and I advise you to do the same if you care about your health. So many other good and CLEAN Thai places in the valley...
