This place has pretty nice decor when you walk in, we can here for lunch and got the lunch specials, which was very inexpensive and a pretty good deal. Comes with soup, salad and soda for $6.95. my bf ordered the pad thai and I got the chicken with bell  peppers and basil. It was just bleh and ok to my taste. They gave us hot mustard which I felt was very chinese and not too thai authentic.
