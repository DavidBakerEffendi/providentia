The ambience might be deceptive. Looks good but smells like an old place. Food was terrible. It was so salty that I fear to get high blood pressure. I ordered Pad See Mee (Drunken noodles) or whatever it is called! The quality of the ingredients were ridiculously stale. The sauce tray (where they put chilli and all) had a big hair on it. Seemed nobody cared to clean it. The waitress was good and polite. And that was the only positive thing. 
Worst is the price! So since we were 7 people so they charged us 18% more on the check. I mean what the hell!

If you are planning to eat good THAI food I would suggest NOT to come here!
