This restaurant shouldn't have opened, I went to this restaurant last summer and sat on the patio I was extremely excited to visit because had heard great things about them and always passed and saw their flames outside. The waitresses were nice and we did get seated on the patio at our request but the food was where things turned down hill. We started off with the Mac n cheese balls which were very large and delicious . We then moved onto the mains where I ordered the pasta which was an extreme salt bomb to the point where I wasn't able to eat it ! The waiter noticed I wasn't eating my food and offered me a box to which I told her it's extremely salty and she may as well throw it out she said to me that no one else has complained about it for the night and she took it and left with it to throw out. My friend had the Caesar salad and it was fine. We ordered two margaritas and before I could have a second sip of mine there was a huge fly in it! The waitress walked over and asked if we were good on drinks and I said you can throw mine out there's a huge fly in it and she said "oh no" and took it and threw it out. In the end I only enjoyed the Mac n cheese balls and the water from fired up and on my bill I paid $108 for the pasta two margaritas a Caesar salad and Mac n cheese balls and still went home hungry! If my review was not enough for you not to go one of my co workers went and had just as awful and experience and my banker recently told me about their bad experience there as well, all of them vowing to never return to such a joke of an over priced business
