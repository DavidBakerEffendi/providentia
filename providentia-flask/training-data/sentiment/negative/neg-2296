Went there yesterday for lunch. I ordered a crispy pimento cheese chicken sandwich. I received my sandwich in as much time as I could wash my hands and fill a water. As a matter of fact... all 4 of our food orders were just as fast as McDonalds.  Orders came out in about 2 minutes, maybe less.I took one big bite into my plump crispy chicken sandwich and I got a mouthful of raw pink chicken. It was really gross. Took it back and manager on duty offered me another meal. So I got an unbreaded chicken sandwich with avocado. That sandwich too also was handed to me in about 45 seconds. What?  Are they precooking everything here now?  Another poorly prepped sandwich with all of the avocado unevenly placed and hanging out the rear of the sandwich. This place IS NOT about QUALITY.  Rename this place to PUD with no Q for quality. People Undedicated to Quality because this place serves way too fast to be properly prepped.
