What a disappointment. I have never experienced such bad service as I have just had at this restaurant. We waited over an hour for our meal to come and it never came. We kept being told it will be out in 5 minutes and it never came . Come on. We ended up leaving without ever getting our food. There was only 3 other tables full so it sure wasn't because they were busy ( I understand now why this restaurant is always empty ) it's unfortunate as we always want to support smaller individually owned restaurants but I would of died starving waiting for that meal. Calling yourself a fine restaurant not only means for the food but also the service . Tumi and the staff at Tumi there is nothing fine about you or your service. I can not comment on the food as we never got it.
