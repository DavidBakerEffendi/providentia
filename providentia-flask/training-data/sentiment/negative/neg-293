I tried this place one time about ten years ago and I was not overly impressed with what I got then, but all you hear is Beardens this Beardens that I felt I would be fair to give them another shot post remodel. I went in on a Monday evening I got a cheeseburger with some traditional toppings and a milkshake. The cheeseburger was indeed as greasy as I remember the first time. Not to mention completely tasteless. I have to say for all the hype I have heard about this place it is truly one of the most disappointing burgers I have ever had, and if I am experienced in anything it is how a burger should taste. The Milkshake was handed over to me and was already starting to go "runny" by the time I took my first sip. I have to say I was completely unimpressed with the milkshake and my experience overall. 

I long to live the experience people seem to have with this place. I always root for local businesses to do well, but I have to say from my standpoint Beardens has run out of chances.
