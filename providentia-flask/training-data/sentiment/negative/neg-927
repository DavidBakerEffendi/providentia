My friend picked me up a bowl from here, it had steak, rice ,lettuce, guac, and salsa.
Let me start off, The vegetables did not look fresh AT ALL. The steak is a little chewy and the quality of this place just seems to have progressively gotten worse over time. Oh did I also mention? While eating my bowl, halfway in I find a blue piece of plastic. At first I thought maybe it can be the beans shells or something but nope it's clear blue plastic tape looking thing. This is terrible they had E-coli like about a year ago and now this! (Maybe I'm being a little dramatic) but this just shows me They don't care about their customers ):
