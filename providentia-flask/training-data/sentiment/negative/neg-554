one star because its required.

this place is SUCH a let down. 
im not sure how the overall rating of this place is so high. 
but to each their own i guess.

the waffles are crisp and then all air once you start eating. no flavor at all.
 addons are a buck a piece (strawberries, cherry pie filling, etc.) which is a little much in my opinion but alright.
you get unlimited coffee, which we had too wait for twice because they ran out.
in my opinion they should keep up on that especially around breakfast time.
also,if you add 'hashbrowns'
its a buck for a hashbrown that mcdonalds serves.
seriously?

they serve you on styrafoam and make you eat with plastic utensils.

they also dont know how to cook eggs over medium.
so if that is how you like them, order them medium well and maybe theyll get it correctly.

if their quality of food was better,
the concept of the place would work out well.

this place is pathetic.
waffles at ihop are way more impressive.
