Unfortunately, I have to take the time to write this review.  I just got off of a phone call with the GM Chris from the Mesa and Dobson location.  We are a family of 5, Mom, Dad and three small children.  We received coupons in the mail to try this pizza and the first time, it was very good.  We ordered the Godfather which was recommended and turned out great.  So last night we tried it again and to our dismay was beyond disappointed!!!!  It had a horrible after taste as if the red chilli peppers, parmesan or the giardinera were rotten, moldy or had just gone bad in some way!  We called immediately to make them aware of the situation and they came back with an offer of an eleven dollar credit after we spent close to $40 and almost $60 the first time vs. taking responsibility of what happened.  The manager Kevin promised we would receive a call back today from his GM Chris, which never happened.. We had to call back tonight to explain what happened to speak to the GM Chris and again unfortunately we were treated the exact same way as last night!  On top of that Chris said, I apologize you didn't get a call back, I told my am manager to call you and he never did.  Also dismissing any responsibility and almost denying what happened to us and trying to say this never happened before or could ever happen.  It's not about the credit it's about the responsibility and we would Never want this to happen to Anyone else!!  Today no one in our family felt right after last night's pizza dinner.
