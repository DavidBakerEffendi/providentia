Worst experiences ever here. 

Slowest drive thru. Waited 15 minutes for one mocha. They even asked me what I ordered after waiting 10 minutes waiting outside. They made my order. 

I used Eat24 to order ahead recently. When I showed up to pick up the order they hadn't even received it yet. They first told me I ordered from the other location. They told me. Not asked me. I showed the receipt and the correct address. They asked me to pay in cash or card. I was not going to pay twice for my drink! They did NOT believe I even ordered. I started to get the feeling they thought I was trying to scam them! They phoned Eat24 and so did I. I wanted a refund, after 45 minutes on hold, EAT24 confirmed the restaurant should've received the order. They refunded me. This staff working were condescending and made me never want to come back to this establishment. 

I probably never will.
