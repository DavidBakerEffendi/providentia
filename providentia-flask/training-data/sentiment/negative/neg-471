Pei Wei Sunday with the kids is something we do a lot. And this location is the closest. Went there a few Sundays ago, and despite the fact that we go there all the time, it was the last time for sure. The girl at the register was obviously unhappy, and ruined my desire to give this establishment anymore of my money. She should work for the post office, or be a telemarketer. If you hate your job that much, you should look for another one. Management: you should be aware of this, and correct that. Now we are going to the one on Baseline in Gilbert/Mesa, where service; yes, service in a Pei Wei, is very good. They care, they pay attention, they are happy to see and serve you. Anyway, the Wok salad was good, which explains the One star; but bye bye Pei Wei on Guadalupe and Mc Cormick, you will never see me again.
