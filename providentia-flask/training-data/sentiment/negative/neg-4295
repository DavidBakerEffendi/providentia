One star for nice staff.  Zero for food.
I REEEEEEEALLY wanted to like this place.  I like to mix up my routine and not just go to one seafood restaurant all the time (Hot N Juicy Crawfish) HOWEVER, I would not come back here, even if someone paid me to.  I ordered my usual mild crawfish with all seasonings and got a bowl half full of frozen (the legs and antennae were all broken off) crawfish.  There was no seasoning, just some water at the bottom of the bowl with limp onion pieces.  I asked for a side of spicy garlic butter sauce and that helped a little bit but does not change the fact that the crawfish was not fresh.  The corn that came with my crawfish had no seasoning either and tasted like it was old or had freezer burn or something.  Bleh. I also ordered the large fried shrimp which granted were actually pretty big but sadly not battered??  The fries were just ok.  I will take my Texas born and raised self over to Hot N Juicy where even though it's not real "louisiana style" it's still flavorful and infinity times better then this place.  I also got a 10% off discount I guess cuz it had just opened when I went but yea.  Thanks but no thanks.
