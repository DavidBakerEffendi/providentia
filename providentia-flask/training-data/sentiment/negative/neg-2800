Very poor service. If this restaurant would like to survive then the manager will need to train their servers about proper customer service that is even if they have one. I noticed this place has fewer people coming in and I am 100% sure that has to do with their service. Food is okay, nothing outrageous, I think the happy hour sign will get rookies to come in but the food alone are overprice and the serving isn't that big therefore you get 50% off during happy hour which equals to basically the same as most sushi places.
