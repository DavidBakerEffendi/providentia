Today my friend and I ordered lunch.  She got a turkey hoagie and onion rings.  The hoagie was cold and onion rings burnt so bad that the container melted.  She called the place and asked them to replace her order, the man replied 45 min at least.  This was at 1 pm which meant she would now have to wait until almost 2 for lunch so she asked to be reimbursed instead and was told no but you can have a store credit because we don't do that here.  Umm what hold up you want me to pay for burnt food with melted styfoam and a cold hoagie? That was it the conclusion was the manager would not refund her the money so she is forced to eat there again if she wants any compensation for her sad lunch.
