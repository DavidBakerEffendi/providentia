Ok since this has been my go to place for breakfast i was very lenient with the mistakes and downfalls of this restaurant but today when they not only missed an entire entree for a to go order, couldn't get my name right and i couldn't get a straight answer when i asked how long it would take to get my missed order it sent me over the top and that is why i'm changing this 5 star review to a 1 star....i'll drive the extra 30 seconds down rainbow to the egg works next time.
