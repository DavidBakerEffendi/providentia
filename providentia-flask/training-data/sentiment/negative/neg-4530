Went here on my last trip to Vegas.  I had never been here before but was told by my dining mate that it would be an experience.

Luckily had made a reservation because the wait was absurd.  We waited about 15 minutes to be seated despite having a reservation.

I tried the fried pickles, fried cheese, and the fried shrimp.  All of these items were not good.  Also, water was not free.

Honestly, I was surprised at how little we were teased and heckled by our server.  Additionally, we did not receive our hats until we were paying the check.  I would have appreciated more attention, because the infamous servers are such a huge part of the dining experience here.  I was definitely disappointed by my dining experience at Dick's.
