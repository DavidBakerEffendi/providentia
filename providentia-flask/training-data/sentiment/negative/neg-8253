This was an awful experience. No chef but supposedly the pasta was fresh?! Hmmm... freshly microwaved chicken parm and not tasty at all.. and I'm really not that picky of an eater but this was gross. We talked about how Gordon Ramsey would throw it across the room into the garbage can it was that bad.  Then had to deal with a RUDE manager.  Do NOT recommend this place to anyone. They lost my future business.  What a shame
