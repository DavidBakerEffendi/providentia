The service I have received at Ancora has always been slow and the staff has always displayed attitude. The coffee is mediocre and there are limited choices on any given day. The bakery is all dry and stale and clearly imported from a local purveyor. What little food they used to serve was bland and inadequate in portion. The come across like a Starbucks wannabe--and yes, I hate the chains--but they fall short of even those mediocre standards. 

You might see members of Garbage there, but a tasteless band loves tasteless fare.
