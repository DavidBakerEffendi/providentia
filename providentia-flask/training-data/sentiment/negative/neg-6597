This is the second time I've eaten here. The first time it was ok, however, this time we waited for an hour for our food. It was ridiculous!!  When I asked our server about our food after waiting 45 minutes she was a little put out. I'm sorry but waiting this long for a salad and sandwich and pasta is not acceptable.
