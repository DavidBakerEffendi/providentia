If I could rate this location lower I would.

I have been refraining from "yelping" this location for quite awhile due to hoping it would get better, but it hasn't. 

I started working near this location Nov 2015 when this location was getting ready to open. Excited to have a tropical near me for lunch breaks and so forth. I have been to this location around 12 times in the first few months, and each and every time, I've waited 20+ mins, my order was wrong, and the staff didn't care. The constant turnaround in baristas or smoothie makers or whatever they are called, is atrocious. If I order food, it's either not the way I ordered it or not even the right food. Thinking the mobile app was the solution, I tried that. I have to order 30 minutes before I actually want my food because they screw everything up. Clearly management has no idea what they are doing, whether it be store level or upper management. This place is truly the worse location of them all, with horrid leadership that has no sense of customer recovery.

I hope the corporate office knows that this location, being open barely 2 years, with a 1-2 star yelp review cannot maintain profitability when every customer hates their experience. I hadn't been to this location in over a year and I tried once more to see if it got better a few weeks ago, and it has only maintained the poor service that this location has shown since day 1. Upper management should probably get involved and make some drastic changes, or this location won't be able to make it for much longer.
