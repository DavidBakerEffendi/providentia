The food they served us was cold. The only think that almost burned my mouth was the chicken nuggets. We asked them to remake the food. This time, the fries and nuggets were hit, but burgers still cold. Asked for a refund on one of the burgers and the lady wants to argue that it's fresh! Fresh doesn't mean heated to the proper temperature. There was maybe 5 people in the whole store, you can produce hot food. You can't get by solely based on the name Wendy's, you have to deliver as well. This location did not.
