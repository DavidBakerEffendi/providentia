Last night was our 1st visit to stone and vine and might be the last. After we sat water was dropped off by a busser; but it took almost 10 min for our waitress to get our drink order. Then 6 minutes passed before they were dropped off by the bartender with a joke about them melting at the bar. It was obvious that our server was over whelmed. 
We had the meatballs, the salmon and shrimp Alfredo. All the sauces tasted Like they were out of a can; and for an Italian restaurant you would expect pepper grinders at the tables. We go to salt and lime often and are convinced that they are always short staffed in all their establishments. Their other restaurants have decent food but I do not recommend stone and vine to anyone that is looking for service or a flavorful meal.
