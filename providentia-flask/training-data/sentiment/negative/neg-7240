WILL NOT EVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN. Placed delivery order at 7pm, called the restaurant at 8:40pm to ask about our delivery and the women put us on hold but all we could hear was yelling... we began yelling into the phone to get their attention after 5 min on hold. We hung up and called back again and when the lady answered we explained to her that we had ordered our food over 1 hour and 45 min ago and she immediately yelled "it's on it's way". We finally received our food 2 hours later. Very disappointed with the customer service and unfortunately will not be ordering from there ever again.
