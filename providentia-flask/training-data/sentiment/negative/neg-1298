It started off great! Fabulous customer service, very warm & welcoming. But as time went on, a few things happened. Our chips, fresh out of the kitchen...were stale. Not only were they stale but there were onions & green peppers (IN THE CHIPS)! How does that happen?! It was like someone threw it in there! Then! We watched a server clean the table with a rag from God knows where - without sterilizing the table. The veggies tasted like rubber & had no flavor. It's like they just microwaved the veggies...all in all, not clean & food was not worth $40 spent...Left extremely disappointed.
