My boyfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas and wanted to have a nice dinner that left our bellies happy but didn't take away from the money we were saving for our gambling addiction. Unfortunately, google led us to this sad sad establishment that looked more like a cheap brothel with its decor and bright florescent pink & blue lights. We ordered the Peppermill sampler. This name should be changed to "The Frozen Walmart Sampler" We've had higher quality food from CVS. We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, we were presented with a bottle of pond water. And at $34 it felt equivalent to a punch in the tooth. I enjoy the taste of nose bleeds better. Our entrees were Gyros & a rack of pork ribs. When I say Gyros, I mean dried out sanitary towels that wouldn't even satisfy the drunkest person. I'd rather wither away in the Vegas dessert than eat these Gyros that were wrapped in a loaf of bread. And as for the pork ribs, I've seen more quality meat on a stray Afghan dog. The ribs were smothered in what can only be described as Goodwill's branded barbecue sauce. We took one bite of these entrees & immediately realized we had made the worst mistake either of us had made in our entire lives. My boyfriend stated that he'd rather be given a prostate exam by Captain Hook, I agreed. We were given better service from the uber driver. We were seen by so many waiters/waitresses it was enough to cause attachment issues in our personal relationships. As for the bathrooms, they were disgusting. They had has much cleanliness as a porta potty construction site after they had eaten Mexican food. I thought Jack Nicholson was going to axe down the door. The overall atmosphere was equivalent to that of Michael Jackson's funeral. The costumes that the people in the kitchen wear will fool you, they are not chefs. We still left a tip because we felt as if we were doing an act of kindness helping our poor waiter out of that place.
