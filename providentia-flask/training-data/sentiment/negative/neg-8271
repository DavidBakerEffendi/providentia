An empty restaurant on a Saturday night should have been the first clue to walk away! 
I used to always enjoy coming here, yet this time the food was utterly horrible. The food was so salty that it burned my mouth and I was not able to eat another bite. 
It seems like people are starting to stay away from here. I will definetly never return to here again.
