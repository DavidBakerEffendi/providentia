Horrible smell like sewer or dirty rags, we were hoping the food and more beers would help overcome the smell but it didn't.  After 45 minutes we had to ask about our Prime Rib Sliders and were told they "ran out".......but found enough for 3 of them...hmm...where?.....very gray meat which made us lose our appetites.

Callie came to the table and really did her best, but unfortunately we won't be back.  Between the smell and gray meat.  Very disappointing since it's soo close to home.

Again, Callie deserves a star for her efforts to try to get us to come back.  But the smell alone will keep us away.  The beer was cold!

This bar could do a great business if someone focused more on the smell and attention to detail.  Prime location for a perfect neighborhood bar which we were hoping to find.
