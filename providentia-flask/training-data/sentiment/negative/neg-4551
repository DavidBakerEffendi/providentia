I had the chicken shawarma and I did not like it.   The chicken tasted like it was boiled.  It didn't taste like it was roasted at all.  And the sauce was bland and watery.  And I asked for extra sauce.  Chicken was all dark meat; no white.  Upside:  portion size was adequate.  My husband liked it though; his preference is dark meat.  His top priority is portion size, whereas mine is taste.
