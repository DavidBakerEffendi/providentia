The food here is absolutely horrible. We had issues with every thing ordered except the iced tea. The food is completely unflavored, salty, and low quality.  We ordered the Mandarin family dinner which was a bundle of appetizers and entrees. The issues listed below were addressed with the manager/owner but he made excuses for the problems and did not attempt to correct. I would not recommend this restaurant in any way shape or form to anyone for fear they will be disappointed or sick.

The issues
1. Fried wontons - cold, hard and no filling. 
2. Egg rolls - filled with old meat and tasted awful. 
3. Egg drop soup was really thick from over cooking
4. The fried rice was full of old and new meat (complemented by the light and dark colors plus an old taste)
5.  The Mongolian beef was the most offensive in taste - super salty and watery (the manager said that's how they do it there).
6. The sweet and sour chicken tasted like donuts deep fried in old oil. The shell of the pastry was crisp but every piece was doughy.  Topping the chicken was a sweet glaze but did not complement the chicken. 
7. Stale fortune cookie

The dinner was finished with some odd baklava looking sweet but we were so done with the restaurant that we didn't try it.
