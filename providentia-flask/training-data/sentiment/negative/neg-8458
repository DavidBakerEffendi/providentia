1. Decor of a 50's diner. 
2.  Riff raff clientele 
3. Took forever to get waited on. 
4. Another eon to get the food. 
5. Young portly tattooed waiter obviously didn't know what he was doing. 
6. Salad ordered by my wife.  How can you screw up a salad?  Well, some lettuce leaves had brown spots, that's how. 
7. Sweet potato fries had been sitting for awhile before being served, kinda soggy. 
8. Make up your own burger.  So I did, so maybe it was my fault it tasted like some fool had put it together. 
9.  Is there a minus star rating?
