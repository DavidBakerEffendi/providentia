OH MY GUNESS!!!!!!!

This McDonalds is the worst piece of shit I have EVER SEEN in my life. I kid you not..

I came in here recently to order a happy meal and a sweet tea. Sounds pretty easy right. Well....

I was waiting...and waiting. Still no food. 

All of the other people who were waiting and those who were coming in afater me got theirs before me.

Finally I couldn't take it anymore and I told the num nut female who was  working at the register I want a refund. 

What's SAD is when the guy came over to give me my refund.....their was no apology....no NOTHING

I will never step into this hell hole again.

Look at all of the one star reviews....and now I know why....I wish I could just give them no stars. 

P.S.  The drink area  is the dirtiest, grimiest area I have ever seen....floor is disgusting. looks like it's never been cleaned in all of its life...Phewwww 

Save yourself the trouble and go to either Flamingo/Eastern...or Desert Inn/Pecos McLeod.
