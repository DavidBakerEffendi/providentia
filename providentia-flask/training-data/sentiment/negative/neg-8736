Wow. Just wow. The management here needs to train their staff big time. We walked in and immediately I see two customers ordering sandwiches and one girl making their sandwiches VERY SLOWLY. Also behind the counter is the  "supervisor" on duty, who is on the phone enjoying herself while more people come in to get their sandwiches behind a backed up line. 

After 15 mins of watching this girl make SLOW as possible sandwiches for two demanding customers who want everything just so, another customer walks in. We casually tell her we have been waiting almost 20 mins and she says loudly "Oh no I have to get going I can't wait that long." 

Then by some miracle the "supervisor" gets off the phone and helps move the line along built up by this SLOW AS A SNAIL girl. The "supervisor" makes my boyfriend's sandwich in 8 seconds. Mine took 3 mins by this SLOW girl who struggled with avacado..... finally I told her to just wrap it up I have to go. 

Overall I can see the associates are not floor ready for speed and accuracy. I can see the "supervisors" are not trained with self awareness and leadership skills to build the business.
