Made reservations last week. Web page said restaurant was closed for a Tiff Event and would re-open Sept 12. Made reservation by email for Sept 12th and called today to re-confirm and was told the restaurant could not honour the reservation. Nobody from Boil  even bothered to email me of this, talk about CRAP SERVICE. If you are planning a special occasion or event don't bother considering this place. Worst service ever. If you can't honour a reservation, please let your customers know in advance :(...
