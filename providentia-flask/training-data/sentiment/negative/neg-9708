If your gay don't come here the bartenders are so unfriendly. They judge here and make you feel like your worth nothing. Ashely is the worst she doesn't like Hispanics or gays. This place is horrible when it comes to service. Odds are coming back are slim. Sad that people still judge you for being a certain race or simply being you.
