I was extremely disappointed with the service here. 

we came here for brunch, (should say
lunch) and the restaurant only had one other couple there.

the waitress came over and because we knew what we wanted we ordered right away. He got eggs Benny with turkey bacon and soft eggs I got just the eggs Benny with soft eggs.

- our order was wrong, she gave us hard eggs
- seeing as the restaurant was empty, she could have come over to see if we needed anything, she never did.
we had to ask for more water and juice 

she didn't even come over to ask if everything was okay after we finished we had to ask for the bill. 

truly disappointed. I'll stick to the eggsmart on Kennedy and 401 for my breakfast fix.
