The only reason I gave them one star is that the Biscuits were good.  I was shocked when we were told that instead of having a choice of soup or salad it was just salad, or you could pay $3.00 more for a half cup of clam chowder, or $4.00 more for a "bowl" of soup.  I ordered the Bar harbor seafood dish, this dish was $27.00. I sent it back, the cook dumped a huge amount of raw, cold,  chopped tomatoes on top of the dish. Out of 6 mussels, only 2 were opened, no lemons were offered, no cheese, and waitress never came back to check to see how our meal was. And to make matters worse, my husband told the waitress that it was my birthday.  Worst food ever. Husbands food looked like something you would be served in a cafeteria. He had the Flounder, it was just that,  fillets of fish and a baked potato...no garnish. nothing to make it more appealing. My dish was so unappealing, and bland but the waitress never came back. Red Lobster made a lovely day bitter.
