I rarely complain, but the past 2 visits I made the employees did not have good hygiene and was a bit disgusting with the food. The cashier who handed me my cup had dirty nails and was scratching their face while ringing me up. The employees who handled the food was showing a customer the cheese over the glass, the cheese fell on the top of the glass, then decided to pick it up and throw the cheese back into the fresh cheese instead of disposing it. I wouldn't mind coming back because the food is good, but the employees just need to be more aware of cleanliness and their personal care.
