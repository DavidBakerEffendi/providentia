The location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful. The food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite.
We were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one!
Even my little daughter who loves french fries couldn't eat them because they weren't fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!
