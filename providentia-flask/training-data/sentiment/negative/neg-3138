My experience here with a group of 5 people was not good. We arrived for lunch right before midday and the place wasn't very busy. We got super slow service - it took nearly 30 minutes to serve the meal - and aside from one person who ordered a burger, everyone else who had chicken ceaser salads and other similar dishes were all commenting how poor quality the food was. 

I won't be going back.
