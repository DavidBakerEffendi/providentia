Went here for a pre-valentine's day dinner on Friday the 13th. 4-course menu for $85 per person. 

The restaurant crammed as many 2-tops as possible very close to one another violating any possible privacy. 

Service was nothing but transactional, think diner style. We felt rushed towards the end. With two dinners, a few glasses of wine, and a 20% tip the bill was north of $270 for a couple, and based on the quality of food (not bad, but nothing to write home about), mediocre service, I don't think this place is worth ever going back to.
