Worst service ever! I ordered a simple bowl of oatmeal and raisin bread. It took a good 30 min. The waitress made no acknowledgement about the extended wait. Then the table who was their waiting before me asked was this a usual wait for food,  the waitress gave a a blank stare and through her hands up with no apology or care. I will not be returning and recommend people steer clear of this place. Even if it was not at the waitress fault saying that you are aware the meal was not in a timely fashion is proper customer service.
