Pretty awful. Crap service, server didn't bother to ask if we needed separate checks- we have him 2 cards assuming he'd split up our  bill based on what we ordered. Slow service, especially for how slow restaurant was and for what we ordered. Food wasn't great either. Had hummus trio. Hummus was fine but toast points I was give were stale. It was pretty gross. 

I would pass on this place, better places in the same area.
