The only reason someone should ever go is for the entertainment factor Dick's is famous for. And probably not even then... If you're there for more than an hour, you'll see the same shtick repeated on the newest batch of tourists. 

The food was a complete joke. SO overpriced for the quality. The words "wet paper towels" were used to describe someone's chicken wings and 13 bucks for a plain burger that probably came from a frozen package purchased at Costco... Then add a dollar for additional toppings, including cheese.

The price and quality of the food is what totally turned me off. I wouldn't go back.
