Yeah, this place has officially hit rock bottom. A friend invited me to dinner, so I thought, hmm why not? I will try this place again.

So first, our server, Shawn, was nice. Not very attentive but he seemed busy.  We ordered the cheese curds and fried pickles. The pickles were some of the best I had had. The cheese curds were average. 

I then ordered the beef medallions. It came with a salad. The salad before the meal was the high point. The medallions should have been cooked medium. I could not see how they were cooked because they were covered in cold congealed gravy. The meat was rubbery and overcooked. The gravy looks like it had been microwaves over and over several times. It was globby. Is that a word?  Because I can not think of another word. My mashed potatoes were cold. And in no way tasty or "loaded" as described. 

I never send food back but I did this time. The GM Andrea brought it back to me. It was OBVIOUSLY just microwaved. She did nothing to say she was sorry that my food was cold. It was obviously prepared and sat under the lights for awhile. 

I didn't finish it, I barely ate anything but the steamed vegetables and I was charged in full for my meal. It was awful. Andrea was so quick to leave that I did not get to tell her the beer I ordered was flat. The whole meal was gross.
