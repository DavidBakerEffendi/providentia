When we first got in the waitress came up and got our drink order, she brought us our drinks and said she would give us a bit with the menu. She never came back, after sitting for half an hour no one came to help us. It seemed like a steady pace for a Sunday morning but there was more than enough staff to help the number if guests. After realizing the family that had came in before us was already 3/4 done their meal we decided to just get up and leave.
