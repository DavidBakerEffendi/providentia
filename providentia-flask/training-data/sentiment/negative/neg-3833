Worst experience with this Naked City. Gives the brand a serious bad name! Never coming back or ordering 

I was able to contact the manager of the store to detail the issue with the food. the gentleman was extremely rude and inconsiderate about the issues. The pizza was uncut and the manager suggested that I get in the kitchen and use a knife to cut the pizza myself. his excuse was that they were too busy. So I mentioned the salad being extremely small and he said that they are meant to be small and that they are an express place that doesn't serve restaurant portions. This has ruined my overall experience with my first UNER EATS experience.
