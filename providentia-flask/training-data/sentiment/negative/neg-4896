Food is always ok.  Ordered the Cesar salad and the salad was old...  The place smells really bad it's dirty and they were four employees standing around doing nothing on the Sunday afternoon when there's no customers but me inside. The floor was dirty no paper towels in the bathroom and it smelled horrible don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon, I think I'll just stick with the Sahara location for now.

Whatever happened to employees taking pride in their job and doing what they're supposed to like mopping and cleaning and making the place look good not here!!
