Called ahead to make reservations and we're assured that we didn't need them. Arrived 15 minutes later and they didn't have one table free. Said that we would have to wait at least 15 minutes. Noticed that one table had been waiting 10 minutes so they got up to get menus themselves. Walked out at that point.
