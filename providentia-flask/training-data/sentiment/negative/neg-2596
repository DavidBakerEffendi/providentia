Too bad I could not give 1/2 star! I used to make the trek to Bellagio Buffet when I was visiting Vegas but I had not done so for the last 7 years because my friends do like Buffets--I love sampling different dishes and preparations.

I am glad I didn't convince my friends to try Bellagio.

Bellagio has gone downhill food quality, variety, presentation, and freshness from sitting around too long so it barely rates above any buffet you would find anywhere. Only thing that has gone up is the price.

I remember the first time that had venison that I enjoyed was at the Bellagio, that same dinner a long time ago had Beef Wellington, Pheasant, Leg of Lamb, and Prime Rib which was much leaner than my recent visit--seriously 30% fat is excessive.

Overcooked vegetables, skimpy salad bar selection, 3 soups (tomato basil, chicken noodle, and tortilla soup) what?! Souplantation carries 10 soups and the chicken soup was more than chicken broth with noodle.

Dessert disaster! I couldn't even salvage dinner with sweets. Poor selection and microscopic petit fours size pies---huh? I was not interested in appetizers at the end my meal.

I could be more forgiving if weren't that I remember when the Bellagio strived to uphold their reputation as having the best buffet in Vegas. 

Avoid disappointment, skip the line, high price and most importantly poor experience.  Avoid the Bellagio.
