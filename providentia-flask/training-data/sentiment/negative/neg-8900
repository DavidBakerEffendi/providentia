I am SO disappointed in the customer service of this place! I ordered a beer with lime, they bring me the beer, its warm and than tell me they have no lime so I told them i didn't want it. They tell me they are going to remove the charge but instead they charge my card for both tickets one with the beer and one without. It takes me 3 days to get through to a person on the phone and then he proceeds to tell me that unless I come in there with the credit card he cant do anything. I explained I lived out of state and I was told "so what do you want us to do?" I said refund my card on the one check, he said sorry can't do that? WHAT???? Had to call my bank and report it as a fraudulent charge in order for me to get my money back.
