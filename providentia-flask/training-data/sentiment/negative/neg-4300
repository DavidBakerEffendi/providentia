Been here years ago and then recently went back. 

when I first went here I was amazed at the fast service and the quality of the sushi, not sure if it was just an off night when I went a couple months ago but it was like night and day. They were constantly mixing up the orders, and the server was not helpful at all. They were missing stuff from our orders and it took them forever to bring out our food. The quality of the sushi was not so great, and the sashimi was cut too thick and I am not saying I am an expert by any means, but I personally don't like my sashimi thick. 

I mean i wish I could write more positive things but the last experience left a sour taste in my mouth, literally.

I will be constantly checking for new reviews on this place, to see if i should try it one more time, and if i do try it again, i will re-review!
