So far, service in the lounge is horrid.....and to continue with this thought, took 15 minutes to get a menu. 20 for a drink. 

Food was ~ my god, I can't even smash it that badly because it was only nachos. How do you screw up nachos? If you would like to know, go to Moxies. 

Had 3 Caesars, asked for extra spicy. Even said "look, I mean really spicy, I'm not being a jerk, but every time I order spicy in this province, I get nada". Server giggles and laughs and says that I'll get spicy. 

Did not whatsoever. On round 1 or 2. 

We were over a barrel that day and had to stop - it was that or starve because the equal food casualty "Shark Club" is the only other resto there. 

There were actually only 3 people at the bar. Us two, and two tables of four. 3 people on duty. Mymymy.
