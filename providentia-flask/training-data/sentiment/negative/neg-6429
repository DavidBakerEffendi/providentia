Wow!  used to really like this place, but someone who shouldn't be doing this is running the Danforth franchise. Chicken Shwarma, slopped the ingredients together like WTF, under the grill for no more the 5-10 seconds. I was in and out inside of a minute. Sound like a good effort? Ali Baba has lost a step. Fortunately, there are other and better options for the same type if meal. Stay away!
