This review has been a long time coming, it was just a lot of a situation so definitely needed to be addressed. We came because we saw it was a new place we'd never heard of and wanted to try. I don't know if offended is the right word, but definitely unprofessional all the way around. 

Beginning of the experience we hadn't been there so we asked a few questions about recommendations, both the waitress and manager Ming contradicted themselves at EVERY aspect of our questions. 1: what would u recommend. "Bla bla bla jerk chicken is good", what wouldn't u get?: jerk chicken. WHAT?! Okay, nevermind on that. 

Then with the food which wasn't good at all. Friend got the souvlaki, I customed my order in which I got a chicken sandwich turned into a burger, and my boyfriend got the sparks burger. Burger was meh, dryish. Souvlaki was REALLY DRY. My food was the best which wasn't saying much because it was good because of the flavours I chose but sure. 

Manager kept coming up to us to see how we were doing which I'd usually say is a plus point, but no. First rule, DO NOT SWEAR TO UR CUSTOMERS. Second rule, my name is my name, not "baby girl". Literal words that came out of his mouth when we were talking to him saying about promoting the place, "I'm lazy maybe in the summer" Then he says that they're gunna rebuild the menu and add "crap" to make money such as jalape√±o poppers n stuff. N I'm like okay he just needs to leave at this point. 

Another point to make is the waitress made me feel super not confident about myself. Our friend was dressed in a suit bc of what he did that day, asks him what the occasion is because we're just "whatever". Excuse me I came from work rushed to put my makeup on and I don't feel very good being called "whatever". Overall, the people that work here need to learn customer service and how to speak to people.
