The person behind the prep table dose not speak enough English every time I buy a sandwich they ask him to put extra fries but he never get it . Honest to god their sandwiches have no taste just like a dead body.
But the one on Dundas square away better I. I use to go there but recently the new manager is terrible so I quit
Over all I won't go back . Rather give my business to someone else who appreciate customers.
