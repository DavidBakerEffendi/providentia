This has to be one of the most inefficient Dennys I have ever been to. Waited 20 minutes before having to find someone to take out drink order then another 10 minutes to get a coffee, OJ and water. Had the waitress take our ores right away then waited another 45 minutes to get it. Good didn't come out all together,still waiting for other half of our order and what did come out is cold. 

Ridiculous wait times. They know their Sunday rush times and should accommodate with additional staff. Won't ever be back to this dennys.
