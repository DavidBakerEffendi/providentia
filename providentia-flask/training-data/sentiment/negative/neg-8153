The food is pretty good but the service is without a doubt some of the worst I have experienced. I have tried on several occasions to use Kneaders for business lunches as my office is close by. I place the order ahead of time and each time I have arrived they seem surprised by my request and have to find my order to start preparing it. This last time today it affected an important meeting for me. I waited for a half hour while they made 4 sandwiches and I watched the guy packing it up stop 4 times to text on his phone. He then took it somewhere and set it down. They had no idea anyone was waiting so I had to ask 2 different people to please get me my order. I have given this place several chances to redeem themselves but this is obviously a chronic problem. Not going back.
