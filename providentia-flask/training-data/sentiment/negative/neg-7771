I was very disappointed  with my stay here. I was at the Venetian for a real estate convention from Tuesday  through Friday. First of all when we checked it there was a long line,  finally the person behind the counter was very rude.  We had booked a suite and even upgraded to a larger suite.  Last year I stayed at the Palazzo and the overall level of service was superb. We requested house keeping to go at 5:30pm and no one showed up, finally of wednesday house keeping was cleaning while we where in the room. My friend asked if they could change her bed and ahe said they would have to charge her for it, but she could leave the sheets for her... wth, it's  not like we got a free room we paid a lot of money to get the suite.  Lastly on our departure we called in to get our luggage out of the room at 10:50a.m. and asked for a late check out, not only did they not accomdate us, they keep tranferring us from one department to the other and kept being on hold. They said they could do the late check out and to get the service to pick up our luggage it would take 30-45minutes which we didnt have time to spare. So we had to carry all our belong to get them checked in so we could have breakfast. As we are walking down stairs most of the guest have their luggage too. Long store short, we had checked in out luggahe and had the car parked in valet.  By the time we where ready to leave I  was told it would take 15 minutes to get my car and luggage... IT TOOK OVER 1 HOUR and the guy that brought the luggage was yelling at me, didn't  even  help us store our luggage and still wanted a tip.... You got to be f***** kidding me. 

Never in my life would I stay here again stay!!!
