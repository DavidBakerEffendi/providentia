Darius was a very cool person!! He was dancing with me and my friends and was awesome! However, our server was horrid along with security. There were literally 6 servers/security men standing against the wall staring at me and my friends, making us feel SO uncomfortable during our entire experience for NO reason. None of us were doing anything wrong, yet we all felt so uncomfortable. I do not appreciate this!!! Overall, it had potential to be a good experience, but because of the lack of hospitality, I am appalled and will probably never come back
