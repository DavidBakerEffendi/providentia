Where to begin... I am a long time yelp user, but I have never written a review before now. This place is so bad that I had to sign up just so I can give it one star. I wish I could give it zero.

It took almost an hr to get the food and although they say it's made fresh, it was definitely not worth the hr wait. The cashier guy even tried to rip us off by adding extra charges for items that are advertised on their menu to come with the dish. when confronted he just quickly gave us $1 (suppose to be $1.49) to shut us up and had the audacity to expect a tip. Very poor customer service and food was below average and highly overpriced.

The rant could continue, but I'll leave it with this warning: the taco place next door is amazing, and even though the line is intimidating GO THERE. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS
