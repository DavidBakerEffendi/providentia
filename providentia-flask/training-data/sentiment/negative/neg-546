All around disappointing. Went on Sunday morning at 11am. Mistake number one. Place was crazy busy with the  after church crowd.  Our party of four gave our name to the hostess to be placed on the waiting list, and crammed into a crowded foyer to wait to be called. After about an hour, we checked again with the hostess, who informed us that 'she called our name a long time ago'. They never took the effort to come into the waiting area to call us. 
It just continues to go downhill from there. The service was slow, waitress looked tired, was unpersonable had a tired/angry demeanor.  Everyone working there looked like they hadn't been to sleep in the past 24 hours and projected a demeanor that they all hated their jobs. Empty water glass, and the list goes on.  
Our breakfasts took 45 minutes to arrive. Food was hot, but Mediocre at best.  I won't be coming back. 2 hours of my time to eat an $11 omelette with hash browns and a coke served by a staff that just looked and acted miserable.  Even the cashier seemed apathetic. I wanted to get a dessert, but didn't feel like waiting for the tired stressed waitress to bring me one, and felt too uncomfortable to ask the cashier for one to go. I got the impression that they just would have been too bothered to box one up for me.
I get better food, service and wait times at the Waffle House, which isn't saying much. 
I should know better than to listen to a recommendation from that douche Guy Fieri.
