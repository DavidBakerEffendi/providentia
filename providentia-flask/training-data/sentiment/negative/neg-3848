I would give them a zero if I could. One star is an compliment based on their service. We ordered four dishes at 7pm then an hour later we found out that the dishes we ordered are not in the system. They insisted us to stay without any apology. The manager was extremely rude and impatient . The stuff act the same. 
There are better restaurants in Mississauga . Stay away as you don't want to experience the event I did.
