Stayed at Bellagio at least 10 times in the last 6 years. Been to the Bellagio Buffet once 6 years ago and just went yesterday on our most recent stay. Nothing has changed. Same mediocre tasting buffet food, not many options, nothing creative in terms of food options and creativity. Bland, simple, flavorless. Lots of greasy pasta options to fill up customers. Cannot compare to Baccanal at Caesar's or even the Buffet at Wynn.
