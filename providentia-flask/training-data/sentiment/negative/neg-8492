We were 2 people 'walk- in' Saturday night 8:30pm. While there were open tables - at least 15 seats open, we were told that we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. I asked why we cannot sit in one of those & by the time the 'reso's' arrived the 45 minute tables would open up. Seems more than common sense to me (especially considering I own my own restaurant & have worked in nothing else for more than 20 years) 
The hostess told us that is their 'reservation section' and this their 'walk-in section'... in my head I am wondering why one of the most important positions in the restaurant is occupied by an inexperienced pie/eyed dimwit; but instead I said "obviously you don't own this restaurant' as we, and several others walked out the door. I will NEVER go back, nor will my dinner partner.  Clearly they don't need or want our business. Went down the street to 7 Numbers, were sat, given drinks and had our 1st dish I front of us in 5 minutes - also had a packed Saturday night crowd. Now THATS how you run a restaurant.
