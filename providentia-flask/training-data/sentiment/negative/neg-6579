What the heck is wrong with people? The food is pretty good at AZ Kabob House, but the management/staff, not so much. 

My partner and I stopped by for lunch today (Sunday). We were ready to order, but the staff was too busy looking at something on a mobile phone in the back to take our order. When they finally noticed us they were cordial enough, but ignoring customers to surf the net on your phone is unacceptable.

Next, we're enjoying our Gyro platters (yes, the food is good) and another customer sits at the table next to us. He proceeds to put a football game on his mobile phone without using earbuds. So, the whole restaurant gets to listen to the game he's watching. What an inconsiderate boor. Of course the restaurant staff said nothing. 

Even though we enjoyed the food, the experience left a lot to be desired. And people, get some earbuds! I don't want to listen to your Facetime, Music, Game, TV Show, Netflix, etc. Just because you enjoy it doesn't mean I will. Even if you repeatedly lose them, Amazon has a four-star rated pair for $5.99 each with Prime delivery. Buy them, put them in your ears and save us all from your boorish behavior.
