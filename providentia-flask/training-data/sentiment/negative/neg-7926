Just visited today 05/31/14. The business has changed owners. The service is substandard. The staff is not friendly and they are not familiar with coney dogs at all.

The staff are the kids of the owner and it shows. They sigh if you ask for refills, sigh when you as for the bill and are not even familiar with their revised menu.

I will NOT be returning there anymore. If you are the owner reading this, you have lost my business.
