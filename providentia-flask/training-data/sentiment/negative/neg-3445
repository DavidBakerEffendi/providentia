Let me start by saying I wish that I can put -5 stars
My wife and I went to celebrate our anniversary, so we both ordered the shrimp feast.  The waiter was very very rude even though we told him it's our anniversary.
We are still waiter provide us with his recommendations, his response was you have five choices pick any two.
Few minutes after he came by and asked us to pick one choice, so we picked one choice each. He came by again and asked us for one more choice, we picked another.
Again he came by and asked if we have another choice, we told the guy that sits for us.
Few seconds after I found that he brought the cheque book without asking us if we would like desserts or at least because we are celebrating our anniversary to promote something else. I got upset so I pulled my credit card and I put it on the top of the cheque book. He brought the credit card machine and did the transaction again without asking us if we would like dessert or coffee.
I finish the transaction and I gave the guy 20% tip.
In my way out I told him that he should have asked us if we would like desserts or coffee and his response was oh and I forgot to ask you.
From this experience I will never go again to Red Lobster, this is really upsetting.
