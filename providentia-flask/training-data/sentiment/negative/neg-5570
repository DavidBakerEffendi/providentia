Okay you guys.   This is gross.  Went for dinner on 12/30, did the buffet for two and unlimited drinks. Just under $100 tab.  If you like buffets that have cold tasteless food this buffet is for you!  The "crab" is gray in color (couldn't bring myself to try it) there was a stench from all the sea food that made it hard to eat anything else honestly.   I didn't find one thing that I wanted more of.  The deserts looked great, tastes like cardboard. The drinks were okay, at least they were strong so I could easily forget how hungry I still was after my "dinner". Don't do it. Don't do it. PSA: Boyfriend had terrible gas all night long from this toxic slop.
