I don't get the lemming effect of this place. 

People seem to flock here (follow the leader) because the place is busy - it's all open and can be seen and heard (with the ridiculously loud music) from five stores away in any direction. 

That would be great. IF THE FOOD WAS GOOD. It's below average quality.

The two times I went the hostess had the nastiest attitude too. No time for that with much better food within a hop, skip or jump. 

It's nice to see restaurants busy at Kierland, especially when some, like Ra, are moving. 

But it would be better if they were of higher quality, (clientele and quality of food).

Any restaurant that does not take reservations attracts a trashy crowd. Sadly, 95% or more of the crowd at Postino is trash.
