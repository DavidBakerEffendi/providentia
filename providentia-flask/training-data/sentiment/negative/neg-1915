Being convenient to Encanto this was a after golf lunch stop for me and my buddies. Yesterday I ordered unlimited salad bar for close to $6 which is more than most burger entries.  What a limited, sad assortment of limp offerings with everything having traces of it's neighbor as if there was a food fight.  With the dim lighting and greasy plastic sneeze guard it gave the veggies Gaussian blur I imagine you get just before you croak. If the bar in Star Wars had a salad bar this would be it complete with interesting and diverse looking patrons.  After lunch over our empty paper plates, plastic utensils and round aluminum pizza tins we made a vow to never return.  Black tee shirts for the staff, dim lighting and grease everywhere brought on thoughts of a prison mess hall during a black out. With all the choices in Phoenix we will have our lunch in a cheerful environment with personable servers and fresh food
