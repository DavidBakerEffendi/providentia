Wow this place is terrible. To start things off drive-through older woman that took care of us was absolutely horrible. Apparently she couldn't hear me and had me come to the window and then asked me what do you want. Really!  Not very friendly at all. In fact pretty darn right rude.  When I asked her about the fish she said well we are Pete's Fish and chips assuming that they were probably good I ordered a five piece fish and chips that by the way does not come with tartar sauce. That is extra ( and definitely not very good ). I also ordered a two piece fish and chips and a five piece scallops and chips. Final cost $24 and some change. Oh my God I think I've been robbed. Started on the drive home and decided to eat my scallops and my boyfriend was eating his fish well after laughing at him profusely about how they were just fish sticks or fish patties. Same thing only bigger you just know they came out of a box terrible terrible tasting. I bit into my extremely raw  scallop. Oh how I wanted to go back I was just so angry. Everyone of my five scallops were raw. Wonder if the health department would want to know about that. Well I hope that many people read this and know not to eat at Pete's I know the sign says eat at Pete's trust me just don't. Save your money.  


Today is December 20 I just wanted to add to My review   Ate there yesterday December 19, wasn't feeling very good after I ate that raw scallop. And still not feeling well today. Thinking about calling and talking to management shouldn't have to be going through this upset stomach. Constant bathroom breaks at work somethings not right. I did not eat anywhere else except for there yesterday. Please be careful folks.
