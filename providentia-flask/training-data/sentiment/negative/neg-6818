I lived in Pittsburgh in the 90s. It being home base for the purveyors of the Smiley Face â„¢ cookie, I'm very familiar with Eat'n Park. If you live in or around the 'burgh, or really anywhere in PA within 100 miles of PGH, you eat at Eat 'n Park. But especially if you live in the city or one of its near suburbs. It's pretty much the hometown branded Denny's, but as a chain, it's better than Denny's. You may not go often, or you may go once a week, or you may go every time you go out or work late -- but you go. It's part of living in southwestern PA.

So, in my time, I've eaten at a lot of Eat'n Parks. It's easy to do, because they're everywhere, kind of like how Starbucks is to coffee. Also, you can always count on an affordable and decent-if-unexciting meal when you order their signature endless soup-and-salad bar. It features a wide selection of greens, toppings and fixings, a rotating daily soup special, and always chili. It's nothing to write home about, but it'll get you through.

That's the general gist, and I'd give Eat'n Park a 3-star rating overall. But not all Eat'n Parks are created equal. And of the at least 20 that I've been to, three stand out as being duds. Sadly, this is one of them. Maybe because it's an over-the-border outlet and HQ isn't as concerned with consistency outside of PA, but this place doesn't measure up. Don't let this sub-par branch tarnish your overall impression -- if you're in PA and need to stop for a simple meal, you can do way worse than Eat'n Park. But if you're in or around Cuyahoga Falls, you won't miss anything by skipping this one.
