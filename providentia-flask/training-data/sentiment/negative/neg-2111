This was terrible I had it delivered from Postmates and I wish they had a way to return it because I would return all but two bites of it it was disgusting I will never order from here again... I got the honey walnut shrimp and it was terrible the walnuts tasted old there wasn't hardly any sauce on it and the shrimp was awful do not order from here
