I've been coming to this restaurant off and on for a while, and although service has always been mediocre at best, I didn't care. It was part of the unspoken agreement: you sell me decent salmon nigiri for $1.50 a plate, and I overlook the fact that the male servers always make me feel like I'm inconveniencing them by trying to eat here and that half the things I order never actually make it to my table. But it turns out there is a limit to what I'll endure for cheap and fast sushi after all. 

I arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday night and was largely ignored, which was pretty much par for the course. What irritated me this time in particular was that about 15 minutes in, I finally had to get up and get an order sheet for myself because the servers were painstakingly avoiding eye contact with the customers at all costs. To add insult to injury, they started clearing tables. I had to I guess we looked like we weren't going to use any? I assumed they were about to close, but then discovered that they were in fact open until 10:30.

Long story short, if you really like California rolls and don't mind being treated like crap, this is probably an excellent restaurant for a casual dinner with people you don't mind sitting around, not eating with.
