What a disappointment! I'm not feeling well and was craving some Phó. My lovely significant other ordered us some Phó through UberEats. After waiting close to 50 minutes it arrives! Yay...waiting with anticipation! Was very much looking forward to having it. Opened the bag...the disappointment begins! There was not much meat. The soup was barely hot. Barely much  vegetables with it and they charge you for it...granted it's only a $1 but the fact that they charge you for it, they shouldn't stinged you with sides! I specifically notated on the note that I want 3 hoisin packages because I love them along with some schrricha sauce...instead they gave me 1 pack of mixed hoisin and schriccha....it wasn't even full it was a smidgen mixed of the sauce is all they could spare me! Seriously?! Did you guys run out too? I wouldn't have bothered notating how much I love both hoisin & schrricha sauce if I had some at my house to spare! Nevertheless it was a very disappointing dinner.
