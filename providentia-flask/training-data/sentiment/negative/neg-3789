Angelina Pizzas place:835 Seven Hills Dr, Henderson, NV 89052

Worst experience ever. I do not recommend going to the Seven Hills location. The workers all have attitudes and are too stressed out to help. Who rolls there eyes at you? When you want to order dinner and gettting catering of $500. 

So instead I went to Josh one person working happy as can be at Mama Del Palma: 9845 S Maryland Pkwy D, Las Vegas, NV 89183
not onlt us the food great the service was great. Ge even offered me a free fountain drink and was very professional and friendly. Where has customer service gone?
