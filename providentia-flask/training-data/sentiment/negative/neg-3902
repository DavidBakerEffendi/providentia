I've been meaning to write this review for a few weeks now and the fact that I'm still mad and specifically came on Yelp just to write this review should show you how mad I am with this place! I placed my order a little before 10pm after I had gotten off work. Waited about 45min to an hour then called to find out what was going on, they said driver just left, I said cool and hung up. About 15min later I still hadn't received my pizza and wings so I give them a call back and they inform me my pizza had been delivered. I'm sitting here with no pizza, why would I be calling you back if it had been delivered! The guy on the phone didn't apologize or anything, rudely asked if I still wanted my order and I said YES! that's my dinner! I ask about how long and he said he wasn't sure. I didn't get a discount, apology, nothing! By the time the driver finally got here I'm hangry and tired (again, just got off work). The driver didn't even have change so I was then forced to tip him! The food was cold too! How is that even possible! All I can say is I hope this place closes soon from extreme lack of business! I'm originally from N.Y. and I'll go to Papa John's before I even think of ordering from this place again.
