This is a very rare occasion for me being that I've never done an official yelp review before and I rarely complain when I go out to eat. I'm that person that will still eat a burger with mustard on it even if I asked for the burger with out. I've been here many times in the past and LOVE the taste of the pizza and the Joe's sauce. The only issue that I had was that the customer service that I got was the worst ever. 

We got in there and the cashier said hello and stood there as if we were expected to know exactly what we wanting. Being that it's been awhile sense I've eaten there I totally forgot about their single slice pizzas so I asked visually how big their 14' pizzas were (at this point I felt so rushed to order that I didn't see the pan sizes above her head). She continued to look at me with this blank face as if I was the dumbest person on the planet for about 5 seconds without saying anything (and yes sometimes I do dumb things, but dont we all every once and awhile?) Then she said in a rude voice, "well they're right there." At this point the way she acted made me come very close to saying "never mind I don't want to buy food from you," and leaving (which I've never done before). But I decided to stay b/c my fiance has never eaten there. 

I was so mad and felt so mistreated that I truly didn't want to eat there and I KNOW I never will again. There's so many other good pizza places out there I won't be at a loss not eating here again. It was obvious that this cashier was being rude and condescending. It was also obvious that she didn't care about the way she acted to the customers. She seemed like she may have been the manager as well but I'm not sure (I heard her talking about potential future advertising plans for the store). I hope this review helps people in the future so they don't have to deal with having some rude cashier throwing negativity into their lives. lol
