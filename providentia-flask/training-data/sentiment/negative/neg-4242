Super disappointed tonight. Call ahead seating for 4. When we arrived, the hostess had our name wrong and then told us that it would be 5-10 mins. We waited at the bar literally 30 mins. When I went to the front to ask about the delay, I was told that they page us but had accidently registered two pagers and would seat us right away. We are taken to our table and its dirty and full of dishes. We said we were fine with sitting in the bar and rceicwd prompt service, however the food was awful. All 4 steaks were cold and my steak was MD. Rare when asked for MD well. The baked potatoes were overcooked and dry. Finally the end is near and we received our check. We asked to have the check split and our server messed up running the entire check on one card. She voided the transaction, but the pending charge will take 24 hours to drop off. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. Happy Birthday, sorry the restaurant screwed up royally.
