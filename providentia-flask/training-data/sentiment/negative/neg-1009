Was not a good experience, quite frankly I was scared of our server and didn't want to complain.  I felt like I had to sit there and just eat what she suggested the way she wanted it cooked.  She was not engaging at all and seemed annoyed to be helping us.  Recommend the duck medium rare and I asked for it to be well done and what do you know it was definitely on the rare side...I over paid for a meal I did not enjoy at all.  To the point I never write review and three days after my experience I am still thinking about it and would never go back there.
