The only good thing about this place is the service and everyone that works here is very nice to you when you walk in. Other than that,  all the Chinese food was cold when we took it to our table. Everything tasted bland to me. Honestly the best thing here is their pizza and the ice cream. Oh and the sushi was pretty good too. But probably won't ever come here again.
