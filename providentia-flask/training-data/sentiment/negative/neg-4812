Every single time I go to this location they are SOOOO far from friendly!!! I always forget until I go again and then I'm reminded of their costumer service. This definitely must not be emphasized in their training. I probably will never give my money there again even though we live down the road. Not to mention the quality of the shakes or smoothies we've had aren't very good either.
