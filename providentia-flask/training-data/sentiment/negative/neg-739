I have gone here a few times and for the most part the food is decent for fast food Chinese and service was decent not good BUT decent. BUT tonight, the service SUCKED!!!! There was a girl named Traci and WOW she was horrible!!!!  The way she took the order and couldn't understand simple English kinda makes wonder if she was dropped on her head a lot as a kid!  

Couldn't understand my order and charged me for something I didn't order!  Wow! If I was the manager she would be gone gone gone! 

If I see her again I'll walk out.  The food is not worth her attitude and stupidity.
