Me and my 4 year old son plus my fiance and daughter ate at this restaurant. My son didn't want the egg on his sandwich so I ate it. Me and my son both ended up getting food poisoning. Four days later he's staying in the hospital with a fever of 102 degrees and he's lost 4 pounds in a day of water weight. I contacted the McDonalds and they didn't show that they cared at all.
