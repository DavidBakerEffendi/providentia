Did not get to dine in because of lack of supply of food got disappointed as we came all the way from Mississauga and went into an hour and 30 mins of travel time . Suggestion to the management is to anticipate people traffic since they have a viral video and a lot of people are very eager to try their menu and this is a great time to boost their clientele.I would return to taste their famous delicacies and hopefully it won't disappoint me this time.
