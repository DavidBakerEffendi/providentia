This place is a shame. Service is the worst I have ever seen. One waiter was very disrespectful once I asked if I can change the table. "I just asked!" I didn't push it or insist. He replied "no need to change the table." There was plenty of empty tables. I told him my two year old was in the middle of the way and people were pumping on him even when it is not even crowded. Then, I noticed him throwing the cups on a table next to me in hurry manner and staring at us. I don't want to come to a conclusion that this is an act of racism or fatigue but even when I told the cashier about him she said sorry and asked for the money of the buffet, though I didn't finish my half-filled plate. Worst place ever.
