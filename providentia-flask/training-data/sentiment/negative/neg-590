Wow. How disappointed am I. I placed a takeout order via grub hub, they said it would be ready at 7:15. It is now 7:45 and my food is still not ready. I arrived at 7:10, stood by the bar for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged my presence. The owner finally acknowledged me, and proceeded to blame grub hub. He never even apologized. I definitely won't be back. Jewel of the Crown is just as good, and at least they aren't rude.
