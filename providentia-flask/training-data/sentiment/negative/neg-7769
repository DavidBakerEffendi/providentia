Eastern and pebble. Every single time I go there and get my exact same drink. It tastes different every time and the price is never the same as the last time. The staff seems like they have no idea how to prepare coffee or take an order and make the right drink. My boyfriend and I always have a terrible experience when we go there. We always swear we are done and won't go again but we always give it another shot. If the staff knew what they were doing and didn't take a million years to prepare 2 drinks. I'm sure they would get better reviews. Very Inconsistant.
