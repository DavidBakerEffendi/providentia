Today we visited this Egg & I for the second time and was very disappointed.  Our first visit last week was great, no issues.  This time was a different story.  While the food was good, both of our portion size was about half the size as before.  Last time the breakfast meals was served on a normal sized breakfast platter.  This time both of our breakfasts were served on a small round saucer plate.  We asked our server about the smaller portion and plate size and was told that it is up to which ever cook served up our meal.  While we were discussing this with our server we noticed that all other customers meals were coming from the kitchen with full large plates.  We pointed that out to her and she said that there was nothing that could done since that is the way that the cook plated it up.  We told her that we were extremely disappointed and her only response was sorry, then she handed us our bill.  We ask her if this happens regularly and she said yes from time to time depending on the cook.  There seems to be no consistancy here and no one seems to care.   Very disappointing because is pretty good but we are not going to take the chance to pay for a full size meal and get half of what we ordered.  Lost our business forever.  And we will certainly tell everyone we know about this experince...
