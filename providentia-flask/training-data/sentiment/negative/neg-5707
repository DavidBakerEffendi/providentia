I cant even begin to explain how angry and upset I am right now. I have been going to this location for a year and I always order extra onions on my chicken sandwich. when ever  there is a new employee making my sandwich they always snide and snicker and makes jokes about the onions. Usually I just ask them if I am paying for comedy and judgement with my food and they never make the jokes again. this has happened several times. My husband went into the subway location and the GM was there along with an employee who recognized my husband and has made our food before and was aware of how much I hate the onion jokes. My husband comes home and on my sandwich is ONION SANDWICH WITH A SMILEY FACE. I am now livid. I called and the GM answered and immediately he denied everything and said he was unaware of it, that he didnt know, that he didnt do it. He became argumentative. I was in tears. Right now I am pregnant and I am extremely emotional. I told him I was calling corporate. I call and customer service and a man named chris answered. He was aggressive, condescending, rude, and hostile. He asked me what I wanted them to do about it. I was in shock and said thats not my job. He then informed me he would have the owner call me. He became more and more angry, and at the end of the call I asked for his supervisor. He said WHY? I said because I asked. He then started yelling at me, saying he had done everything he was suppose to. I then said again I want a supervisor. He said there wasnt one. I said you cant be the only person there. and he claimed he was, that there was no supervisor, said he no employee # or way to identify himself, and then he hung up on me,  I am so angry, and upset how horribly I have been treated today.
