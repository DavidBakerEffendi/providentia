I generally order from this place and it is pretty decent but had a horrible experience today. I was ordering 4 dishes and asked to get one container of hot sauce for each dish. The person at delivery told me I am only allowed to get one small container for all four dishes because it is one delivery! She then goes on
 to say if you ordered four pizzas would they give you 4 dipping sauces and I responded YES!!! Again I said to her if I was eating at the restaurant the hot sauce would be free and even though it is one delivery I am ordering four dishes for four people and we can't share one tiny sauce. Somehow this logic escapes her. I then ask to speak to a manager and was told no, I asked to speak to owner and was told no.  She basically gave up a $40 order because she didn't want to give us hot sauce!!! Horrible customer service and I will now never order from here again.
