Terrible. Use their online order pickup, food wasn't ready. They then made me wait while they handled two people that walked in after me because I went to the pick up area while they got in line right away. I told them that it was an internet order and they told me they never got it. So then I go to the front of the line after those other two people have gone through, they "magically" find the order receipt.
So then after they prep the food, they tried to make me pay again. Effing ridiculous. Not so much as an apology.
