I don't know if Chili's has gone down hill or just this location.  We were excited to go, but were pretty disappointed in the food.  Their queso looks and tastes disgusting.  They put re-fried beans in it, yuck.

Their fajitas came with a weird not traditional side display.  The sour cream was the consistency of ranch dressing and I got 17 shreds of cheese.

I just don't know how you can mess up queso and fajitas.

The service was great, but the kitchen/menu isn't.
