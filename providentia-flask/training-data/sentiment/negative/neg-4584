Moved to Arizona 8 months ago- found this spot and fell in love with their Parmesan chicken breast among other food items! I will (would) make it for my husband once a week! The past few times have been different- I think they changed the recipe:(and the service/morale has been horrible! The employee who worked at the meat counter ignored me for at least 5 min because he was wrapping all the meats in the display- at 7pm?! And was so rude/pissed! I spent 17$ on two chicken breast! The people at Fry's and Trader Joe's are so helpful, friendly, and CONSISTENT! Won't be going back to AJ's.
