Came here for Father's Day. What a major mistake. Do not come here unless you enjoy burnt burgers & burnt steaks. Waitress brought food I asked if the burgers & steaks are suppose to be burnt she said that when you flame grill them they get burnt. What a joke. They did comp the steak & burger, but when you go to place named Texas Roadhouse & they have a sign that says handcut steaks you think they would know how to cook a medium steak & a burger. My daughters did enjoy the ribs.
