The very worst nachos I have EVER HAD! It was my first time visiting Tijuana Flats this afternoon. I was in the mood for nachos and figured I would give them a shot. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Nachos. The amount of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes on top was FOOLISH. There was half a head of lettuce on my nachos. They were cold and I barely had the equivalent of a tablespoon of guacamole. There was probably a half a cup of chicken on the nachos. A very poor food experience to say the least. Definitely wont be going back.
