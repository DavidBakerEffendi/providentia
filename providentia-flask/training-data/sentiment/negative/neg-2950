I ordered a epic carne asada burrito from this location and what I got was more like an extra large bean and rice burrito that i paid $7.there was a teaspoon a literal teaspoon of guacamole in my burrito and it was all the way at the bottom there was like 5 pieces of steak in the burrito barely any pico de gallo I am very unsatisfied with the service, I would not recommend this location at all. they really need to work on their burrito making skills honestly I just want a refund for my wasted time and money I'm never going to eat this location again.
