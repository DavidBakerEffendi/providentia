Kinda awkward giving them a one star but I don't know what else to give since we didn't receive any service. We came in at 11 pm, sat down at a booth, and then, nothing. Garth, the bartender, went about his business, not a word with us. There was a woman in a mr G shirt who walked to the other side of the bar when she looked at my wife, not sure if she was the server, in any case, nobody cared to mention if there was any service to the tables or not. 

I'm not mad at Mr. G or anything, but I can't give you anything if I didn't get anything.
