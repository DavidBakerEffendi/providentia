And the winner for the worst Ethical Business practices in Arizona Award goes to.. Drum role please.. Sabroso!! Remember that scene in Ace Ventura when Jim Carey was in the fetal position in the shower while The Crying Game song was playing by Boy George in the background.. That felt like the restaurant rape I had today.. You see.. I goto this place probably about once a week.. Its in the hood, tastes pretty darn good, and its a great value for the buck.. I'd say without exageration I've been been there probably 250 times over the last 10 years.. Everytime I've been in there I tip a buck on my card.. Come to find out.. The staff doesn;t get the tips on the cresit cards, they go to the owners.. Stay classy there Sabrosos.. BTW I would like the additional 250USD you have stolen from me over the years..I hope you know there is absolutely no justification or argument you will be able to present .. I really don't wish ill fate on any restaurant, but this is the worst practice, and you are really misleading your customers...
