This store was disgusting when I was in ages but I gave them another shot this past week.  I ordered and pulled up to the window. While sitting there with the drive thru window wide open I see a guy come out if the kitchen with a little cigarette in his mouth talking about how he dropped his phone in the fryer.  I'm pretty much done with this location entirety and this company all together. I've never been in a Popeyes and thought to myself they really take care of their locations. They seem to hire crew and managers who other restaurants deem undesirable.
