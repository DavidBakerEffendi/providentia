Do not recommend, and do not plan on returning.  I am not sure if the staff who are there are not able to help the waitress.  Waited a long time to be seated, when we walked in a lady setting tables saw us, kept setting tables and continued to ignore us.  We were finally seated and waited a good while before we received menus, waited another while before the waitress said she would come back. Kept waiting, she offered to take our drinks but not our order.  The whole experience was slow.  It wasn't very busy when we arrived and other tables seated after us received faster service than us.  We ended up having to take our food to go because of the time.
