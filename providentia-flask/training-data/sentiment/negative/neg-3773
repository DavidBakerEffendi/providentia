Crap, crap, and major crap!  How this place is still in business puzzles me.  I live in SoCal so we know how the original Sam Woo taste like.

Always crowded here.  I don't know why but it is.  Probably because they think Sam Woo is the best bet for Chinese food.  WRONG.  Hostess has a nasty attitude with an ugly smug that I would like to wipe off.

Food is extremely short of bad.  C'mon! They give you all the reject meat for full price.  Shady.

Service is laughable! So stupid.  How can they expect good tips with an attitude like that?

The last straw was when we went up to pay the bill and the girl said we could leave the tip with her.  My mom tipped only $2 because they didn't do s**t ( I didn't think they deserved a dime) and that b**** had the nerve to sneer "that's not even 15%!" and gave us a nasty look.  She's lucky I let her have her hair still intact the way she was treating us.  I would have loved to give her a good beat down.

0 stars! Why can't I give this place 0 stars?! I hope this place burns down to the ground.
