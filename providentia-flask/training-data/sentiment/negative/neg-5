Service was very slow.. Server didn't write our orders down, and came back and asked again and it still came out wrong.  Got the soft shell crab salad, the crab was good, the salad was just some leaves drenched with olive oil on it with a few grape tomatoes.  My husband got the Ribeye steak which said it came with cornbread and he chose coleslaw as his side.  It came out with fries and no cornbread.  I asked the server for the cornbread and he brought put a few slices of baguette with olive oil on it.  When I said I thought it came with cornbread he just said we don't have cornbread.  Steak was OK but not worth the $42 price.  We ordered Jameson on the rocks, the server said they don't carry it and offered scotch instead which was $24 when we got the bill.  The other members of our party ordered the burger which was just OK, the veggie burger was dry and bland, the meat platter which had good lamb but the sausage was dry and the ribs were not good.  The truffle fries tasted like feet.  It was also quite hot and smokey in the restaurant and it took forever to get the bill.  Better choices out there.  Oh yeah, as we were walking out unimpressed, the owner said he would give us a "free appetizer" coupon for next time to make up for it.. when we were not interested, he screamed that we were rude.. in front of all his customers..
