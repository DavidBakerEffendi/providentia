This has to be a big day for all businesses in the mall.  You would think they expected this.  However, the restaurant didn't have "Red Sauce" to make a burrito.  Instead of suggesting another item, I was told "Sorry.  Have a nice day." and dismissed.

This is the first and last time I will attempt to eat at this restaurant.  There are too many other choices.
