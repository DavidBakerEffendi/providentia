This place is awful! When my boyfriend and I  sat down it took our server 15 mins just to greet us(meanwhile we were sitting right in front of the kitchen and could see that she was just taking her sweet time) then took another 15 mins just to get salad and breadsticks on our table. Our server never came and checked on us to see how we were doing once we got our food (our food wasn't very good) or if we needed anything! I had to be the one to flag her down and get something. I also heard her talking to her manager and she only had 2 tables!!! Us and the table next to us and basically ignored us the whole time. I don't know if she was busy or stressed but if that was the case she shouldn't be working there! I will never be back to this location! So sad!
