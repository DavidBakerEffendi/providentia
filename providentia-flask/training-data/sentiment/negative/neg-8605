This was the worst customer service I have ever had. I ordered wings and pizza for my boyfriends birthday and the pizza toppings were wrong and I got saugy wings that are in a puddle of grease. This was the worst dominos experience I have ever had and an even worse experience with customer service. After reading comments I can now see this is an ongoing problem that desperately needs to be fixed.
