Felt very disgraced and put down the bouncer would not let me and a girlfriend in due to the fact we could not answer the name of the team on his hat. It had nothing to do with an Arizona team which is the state we live in nor were we intoxicated. I felt it was a sexist statement and derogatory question. I hope this review helps other women avoid this bar and helps the management better equip its staff for future visits.
