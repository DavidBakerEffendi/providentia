There was a party of 6, we were well accommodated with plenty of space. 

The food wasn't hot. I like my breakfast food to be hot. I ordered french toast, and I definitely had better. I also ordered tea, and the water was luke warm. I did ask for another, and that came out hot. 

The server was not generally responsive to us, and overall the food was sub par. Skid this location.
