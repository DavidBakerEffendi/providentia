Worst Arby's EVER!!! Live less than a mile away so they are a convenient choice. Except EVERY ORDER has been wrong!!! I'm amazed that they can be this bad at anything!! 

Over the last six months we have gone there 16 times. 8 visits for food and then the rest were return trips to get our orders fixed! 

This is beyond ridiculous and it's becoming apparent that even the managers don't know what they are doing! 

It's fast food... How hard is it to place a sandwich in a bag?! My God. The world is without hope of these are the morons we can expect to be running things in the future!
