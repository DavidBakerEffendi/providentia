Cannot ever go near this place again! The manager Ashley should be out of a job. The way she treats employees and bad mouths these hard working individuals to paying customers is disgusting. I've been er seen anything like it!! We watched her complain to a customer about a worker for over 10 minutes. Very rude very condescending. Paid our drink bill and walked out without even ordering dinner, vowing to NEVER return again!! I cannot spend hard earned money on any establishment that mistreats their workers. She needs some serious anger management and classes in professionalism!!
