I'm updating my review. It pains me to have to do this because it was my favorite Pho for years. They are now under new management and the menu has changed and the the recipes are different. They eliminated our favorite appetizer where you build your own spring rolls and the replacement was tasteless and suburban tasting.

I ordered my usual (P1 - Pho Bo) and yesterday it was not rich and savory. It was thinned down and the beef had no taste to it. I hate to say it but even the suburban pho restaurants have better food now. Pho & Rice in coventry for example which I wouldn't even put in my top 10 Pho restaurants...

However, at least they got rid of the pine sol smell...
