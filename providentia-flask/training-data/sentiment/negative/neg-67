Parking 1/5 big parking lot but no spaces

Environment 3/5 place is very nice and open washroom is very clean. 

Food 2/5 sushi rolls were great. Beef Tataki & Creamy Udon was made to look and taste like Shibuya's recipe but didn't not taste as good. Beef Tataki lacked the shredded radish. Creamy udon was bland. 

Service 1/5 we were told to pre order food when we made a reservation so we pre ordered, but when we came nine of the food was ready. Came here at 7:30 was told we had 2 hours to eat , the food showed up as 1 plate with 6 pieces every 15 mins. Had to ask for the manager at 830 to voice concerns and then food started coming out. Only after voicing my concerns did the management take out tables orders and put them through. 

Unfortunately I came all the way to the south to try this out based on good reviews but unfortunately I will not be back. I don't mind paying for quality food and service.
