Disgusting disgusting disgusting! I just left this place with my grandparents about 5 minutes ago and it's by far the worst Korean food I've ever had! 

-Slow service and there were only 5 other tables 5:30-7:00pm on a Saturday

- my first plate they brought out was dirty 

- we order combo B, $59.99 consists of chadol, pork belly, steak, raw meat wrapped with veggies (eaten raw),  bean soup, and steamed egg + soju. We didn't want the soju so we omitted it, but they forgot the bean paste soup and steamed egg! 

- also ordered al jigae (pollack roe soup) and it was super salty!!!!

- they brought out chikkae ( Korean sweet rice drink). My cup had lip stick print and they were so embarrassed! 

- overall the meat quality was merely ok. My grandma and sister stopped eating after the first bite of the gumulok (steak marinated with sesame oil) it was so chewy and had a weird distinct taste they stopped eating that.

ugh this place is so gross!!!!! Enough said!!!! I saw Kenny Lee the owner and I wanted to let him know how disgusting everything was.... Dirty, poor quality of meat (btw the raw meat that was supposed to be eaten raw was NOT good!!! The rim of the meat was dis colored and it was no different that the regular brisket cut that is supposed to be eaten cooked. If it was Yoo-ke.... High quality Korean raw meat with sesame oil it would be one thing but the Pyeon Chae (raw meat carpaccio) was so gross and chewy!!!!
