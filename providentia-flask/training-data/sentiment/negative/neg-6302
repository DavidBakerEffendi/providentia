Went here on a repeat visit after an ok visit last time. We were seated in an empty room in he back. The staff was back there in a meeting. We waited a while for service and while the room was set. Menus were food stained. We. Waited another few minutes without service and decided to leave. Ending it before it totally tanked. Can't review he food here but what a bummer.
