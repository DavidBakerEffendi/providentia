I used to go to the old location and was really looking forward to some Pad Thai, but the take out we got tonight was appalling. I could have made better at home.

2 whole shrimp! Over cooked at that. The chicken was dry and there was no sauce or heat to speak of. I'm angry we paid for it and I'm angry I was hungry enough to finish it.  Obviously, this was the last time we'll be going here. There's so much better Thai in the city, don't waste your time going here.
