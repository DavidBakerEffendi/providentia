Worse place ever! Called and ordered 2 Shrimp Lo mein  large. The order that came was chicken. I called to let them know and the women confirmed she will send someone with the correct order. 

The food arrives they ask us to give them the previous order for the new one. We gave it to them and the man asks for 1.60 difference. Mind you I gave a 4 dollar tip. He then yells at us because the previous food feels light and that we changed our order. 

Normally I don't like to complain but this was stupid service. In fact I thinks it silly when people do sometime. This time it's important to do so. 

The shrimp lo mein that arrived at shrimp that clearly is old and has gone bad. Now I don't have any food and they won't return my money. 

Basically don't order from this place. Rude,old food and on top of that no shame in yelling at you when you accommodate the poor service.

P.S. They say they record you. You will not be told you are being recorded and that is illegal in the state of Arizona. 

This place should not be in business.
