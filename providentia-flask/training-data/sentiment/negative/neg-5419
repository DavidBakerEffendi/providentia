Wanted to see what all of the hype was about so I ordered online for pick up.  Arrived to an unorganized place with staff not very engaged in what they were doing after waiting for eye contact at the pickup counter, it was learned that my order was lost and so I got to wait 20 minutes for my order.  Staff unapologetic and really just slinging overpriced burgers. Got 3 burgers and 3 fries was about $35.  Burgers were okay not great kind of thin, in and Out and Carls Jr better for sure.  I will not be back.
