Service was horrible, we had 3 different people that came to us and weren't attentive as they only showed up once. We asked for bread but the waiter did not return, after paying and giving an undeserved tip, waitress threw the receipt on the table and stormed off without saying anything! You're welcome! 

Food was extremely salty and oily and our table was still hungry afterwards. Was excited to try this place in yorkville but we would never come back here again. Could have gotten better food and service at Tim Hortons.
