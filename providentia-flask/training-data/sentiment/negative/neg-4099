Horrible service! I came in with my coupon I got from my email for a free bday smoothie. I had cut the coupon out and he had the nerve to keep arguing with me saying it was a copy. It was not a copy the printer I had used was running out of ink so it looked slightly distorted but you could still read all the information. I even opted to show him my email and told him if it really was a problem I would show up with a new printed one if it was that much of an issue and that I would email corporate sometime to just to prove my point that it is still valid. I don't know if this older ignorant man was the owner or manager but wow what a jerk off. I normal am not a confrontational person but this guys ignorance was just irritating and I hate when people assume things when they have no idea what they are talking about. In the end I got my free birthday smoothie...luckily the younger girl who works there was a lot more polite and I tipped her since she was the one who made the smoothie for me an apologized for her ignoranant manager she even had tried explaining to him that this was still good it just looked like that because it started to get low on ink.
