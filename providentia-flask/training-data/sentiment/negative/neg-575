Everytime I go to pepe's I always spend $40+ this time I went there my all meat burrito was COLD! it was terrible! This happens more than once! Did I just pay for cold food?? Paid for guacamole and they forgot to add that in also in one of the burritos. The only thing that was hot was the fries but the meat cold!! So annoyed of their lazy service!
