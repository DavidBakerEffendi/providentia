Some of the best food in the valley, I've eaten here many times. Recently I have noticed extremely poor service and it has continued after several other visits their. The quality of service is one aspect of running a restaurant and reflects upon the business. There are many restaurants in the valley that will treat you well. I have hopes that a realistic review will return the restaurant to a wonderful place to dine. Rather than a negative review.
