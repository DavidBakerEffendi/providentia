I will never go here again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. I asked the lady who took our order for taqitos and pointed to the picture and my boyfriend ordered a carne asada burrito.  She repeated my the order back to me but somehow she got it wrong.  It came out as tacos. My boyfriend took it back and told her i didn't order tacos and she argued with him that I did. Instead of taking the tacos back and giving me my original order she made him pay for a new order of taqitos. I was pissed. Still being nice I ate the taqitos and the were dry as hell. I couldn't even swallow the meat without chocking. The taco and burrito meat was dry too. The worst service and experience ever!
