Hi all - let me preface this with i'm a pretty reasonable customer. I'm okay with waiting, but this was ridiculous. Worst service that you'll get your life.

My girlfriend and I came in for our anniversary dinner and piece of advice please NEVER EVER GO HERE IN YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

We ordered our food at 9:20 and by 10:40 we did not receive anything past one of our appetisers. After we complained to the waiter and then the manager we got a cocky answer along the lines of "don't worry about it please leave".

One of my most disappointing meals in Toronto, I would rather eat at Ali Baba's where at least the service is mildly consumer friendly.
