My family has ordered several times and had no problems until today.  The delivery time varies depending on how busy they are.  Today, the delivery only took 20 minutes.  I have worked in food service and I understand that in the course of preparation there is a chance that hair may get into the food.  However, it's another thing to find several hairs.  I picked one out of the coleslaw and decided not to eat it.  When I went to eat a shrimp, the hair was embedded into the batter because I couldn't even pull it off.  

I called the store and I explained to the gentleman that answered that I would like them to pick up their food and issue a refund because I found hair.  His response:  "what kind of hair because we don't have women working in the store?" I told him that was irrelevant.  He told me that they would not come and pick up the food and hung up.  I called back and said, you hung up on me... I would like a refund.  He asked me to hold and again hung up!  

I live five minutes away and showed up at their counter in ten.  The guy answering the phone was at the counter.  When he said hello, I recognized his voice.  I said hey, I'm the lady you hung up on twice... where's your manager?  He tells me there is no manager.  I ask for the person in charge of everyone working.  An older gentleman comes up and I explain the situation.  To save you from reading a novel, he issued me a refund of $20 but my order was $25.44.  I show him the receipt on my phone, he again compares it to his store receipt and gives me the difference.   I will never order from them again.
