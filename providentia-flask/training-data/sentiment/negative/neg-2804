I usually don't want to give restaurants a 1 star but I have to and this is purely based on the food. The customer service was good but unfortunately it did not compensate the quality of the food. I have to say, this must be the first bad quality Vietnamese restaurant I've been to and it's really disappointing. 

My husband and I saw the Yelp ratings and it was averaged to be 3 stars so figured it can't be that bad and decided to give it a try. I ordered a bun rieu and my husband ordered a Pho. He said it felt like the Pho noodles was refrigerated and it wasn't fresh. But I didn't try his Pho so let's talk about my bun rieu. It was soooooooooo sour and everything in that dish tasted old from the tofu to the shrimp and I felt like I was eating food poisoning! I really hope I won't eat sick from this cuz I'm actually scared that I will..never again will I even consider trying this place out again.
