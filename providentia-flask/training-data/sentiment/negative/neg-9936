Ummmmm....yuck.  Just "yuck".

I mean, seriously?  I give it one star because the waitress was nice and we got good service.

We were here last week.  Wife got her birthday "grand slam".  OMG...I don't know what they did but it was disgusting.  The pancakes tasted heavy and fat and, well, just "yucky".  They should have been "light and fluffy", as most breakfast places will make them.  Eggs weren't a lot better.  I wouldn't be surprised if eating that shaved a year or two off her life.  It was free for her birthday, and I still think we got ripped off on that one!

I had a burger and fries.  Well...they were better than McDonald's.  Can't say they were bad.  But definitely nothing special.  You could make a better one in your own kitchen in about 10 minutes for a fraction of the cost.  If you want a decent burger try Fuddruckers or Red Robin or someplace like that.  For the price, Denny's burger was definitely not worth it.

I don't care if it's free on your birthday, it's not worth it.  Don't come here.
