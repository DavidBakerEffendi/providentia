Wasn't too impressed first time around, thought I'd give it a second chance. I'm writing this review from my toilet, I know not too classy, oh well, trying to get the message across. I ate dinner there just about an hour ago, five minutes ago I was doubled over with the worst stomach cramps that I can remember. The food was subpar, oily, low quality Mexican, yuck. I will never go back! Eat there at your own risk!
