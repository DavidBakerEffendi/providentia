My pregnant wife and I visited this restaurant on our last night in AZ. We wanted great authentic Mexican food. What I got for $70.00, would have equaled $8.00 at a local Taco Bell. Taco Bell is also better than this restaurant. Besides the guacamole, everything was as bland as could be. I'm not sure they even own spices. I hope Michael J Fox picks me up in his time machine so we could do this decision over again. Not only did the food suck for my wife and I, my unborn daughter was also disappointed.
