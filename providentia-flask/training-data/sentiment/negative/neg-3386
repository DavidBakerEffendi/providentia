In Pittsburgh from out of town. Menu is here in the hotel lobby, so we call and order. Menu says open till 11 and they deliver 7 days a week. Woman on the phone says they are doing pick up only "and actually we're closing in 10 minutes (which would be 9).

Maybe update your printer menus and your online information then.

Sad, this guy who is here with his family just wasted 20 min getting orders for a place that won't oblige. See photo.
