Lie! They said that's open 24h. We come after a long day visiting Vegas, and the only thing that we wanted was a convenience to have a meal in a hotel and get rest. It was about midnight and the employees was eating, they tell us that it was closed and will open in an hour. 
What a shame, that's worst service in McDonald's in a world! Disgrace.
