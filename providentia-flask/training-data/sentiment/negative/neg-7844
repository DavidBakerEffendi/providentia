Unprofessional!!! I booked a room for the Venetian because it is a very nice hotel and I was told that hotel guests get into Tao nightclub for free. Long story short.... We called front desk and confirmed our reservation to the club for free. When we got to the line, a guy with a beard denied Us Entry. We showed him our key cards and everything. I asked to speak to the guy in charge and he told me that Tao does not work with the Venetian. Even tho we had 4 girls and two guys, we still had to pay.... This  blew my mind. I'm not booking a room here again.
