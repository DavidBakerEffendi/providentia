I will never come back.  The food is good, but my God the smoke is horrific.  The bar area is glassed off, but does nothing to shield the smoke in the dining room.  My eyes were burning and I felt like our drinks and everything were tainted.  I felt bad that I was exposing my daughter to it.  We ate super quick and will not return.
