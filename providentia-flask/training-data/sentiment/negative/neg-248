Do you want to be ignored for an hour or so while you over pay for whatever you order? Then this place is perfect! I would seriously give this place zero stars however the food was OK, so I wanted to give the chef some credit because the food was average.

For anyone interested in a authentic "Asian Salad", this place isn't so perfect. However if instead of "Asian greens" you would like some "shredded iceberg lettuce", and instead of "crispy asian noodles" you would like "dry roasted peanuts from CVS", then this Asian Salad is a real winner! My fiance and I unfortunately wanted the actual Asian Salad so the iceberg lettuce w/ dry roasted peanuts didn't really hit the spot.

I had a BBQ Chicken sandwich and that was ok, probably the highlight of the meal. With regard to the service, it went from bad, to worse, to embarrassingly bad, to literally the worst experience we've ever had in Las Vegas. For example when we were ordering drinks there was probably a 3-4 second pause while deciding, and the waitress barked, "so have you made up your mind or do you just want water?!!!". There were also numerous other comments at the various stages of the meal that were just not what we're accustom to when we go out to dinner. How about a "please", a "thank you",  an "is everything ok?", or a "do you guys need anything?", etc, etc. We received none of this,even the check just came flying from out of the corner of my eye as she bolted by before I could order another beer, or we could order dessert!

 It felt like this poor girl was a displaced worker of the night who was really just wasn't happy in the service industry....I mean the "food service" industry. Anyway there are 100000001 places to eat in Vegas where you can get a good meal, good drinks, and good service at a good price, no need to go here unless you are too happy and want to get a little depressed over dinner.
