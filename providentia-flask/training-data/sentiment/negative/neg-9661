While the building d√©cor is nice and the food is decent, the staff is neither. We weren't greeted when we walked in the door. Our waitress was curt, impatient and I had to flag her down even to get a refill on my drink. The other staff saw that we needed something and also chose to ignore us as we waited. It took so long to get our bill that my companion went outside. The waitress finally came over and asked if I wanted dessert. I said no, my companion left and I just need the bill. As I walked out after paying, none of the staff said a goodbye or thank you. Even a patron pushed by me, storming out of the restaurant. I'm guessing he received the same kind of service that we did. I'm not going back there, not ever. I felt like we were invisible and unimportant. Highly disappointing.
