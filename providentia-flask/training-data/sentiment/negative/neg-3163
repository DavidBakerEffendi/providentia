My experience at this restaurant was poor... Very poor. But you may have a different hopefully better experience while visiting.

We sat in the bar area since its self seating and after being there for a while a server finally runs by and says I'll be with you shortly to run to help a huge party who down after us. So we switched to the dining room. 

We told our server about this experience and she told the manager who came and apologized which was great. Then the bar area server comes in w/ a defensive I'm sorry but ... Using but while saying sorry is never a good thing #TotallyAwkward

Then we are able to order and this server did a much better job and was nice. I ordered a salad asking for no carrots because I am incredibly allergic and the salad came with carrots. Honesty, complaining would have been pointless.

Our fajitas came delivered by a man who said nothing and awkwardly shoved them on the table. The fajitas weren't even sizzling! The server came and we told her so she brought them out sizzling. At this point we were tired and over it and just wanted to leave.

This place seems a little under staffed and I was not very impressed. I will not be back.
