Went here on a Saturday afternoon and there were 3 of us. I don't really care for Buffet food at Indian restaurants, so we had take out. The place looks good enough from the inside, but i was extremely disappointed by the food. All of the naan were burnt on the underside. The kofta curry had coconut in it, which is kind of odd. Not to mention all of us had stomach problems the very next day. Now if it was just one person, then I can understand. But as all three of us felt sick, I have no doubt in my mind that it was their food. Will never try this place again.
