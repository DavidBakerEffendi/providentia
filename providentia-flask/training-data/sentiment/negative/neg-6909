Purchased a Groupon for a special to Margaritas in a souvenir cup so when I got there to get the margaritas I was told that they had no more souvenir cups and they wouldn't get any in for a few days considering I was on vacation and will be leaving the next day when to sit down at one of the tables and noticed several of the souvenir cups above on a shelf in their kitchen when I brought it to their attention I was told they were for display only I don't see how something with 12 cups or more can be for a display they did everything to try and convince me to get something more expensive why would I do that when I purchase the Groupon special I'm from California and some of these places in Las Vegas are Crooks I know they wanted me to buy something more expensive but why lie about it so at the end I ended up not purchasing anything why put yourself on Groupon if you're not going to honor anything you put as an advertisement I will pass this along I have friends that live in Las Vegas and I will make sure that they know not to patronize this establishment . Why promote their products on Groupon if they're not going to honor any of there's specials the one girl that was there happened to be a supervisor she was rude and arrogant. Ended up going home not using the Groupon getting my money back and no souvenir cup tacos and Rita is a business you shouldn't patronize!
