As locals i Love Buffets
Came here with a large Group of ppl on a sat Morning (12 of us ) 1 Noir Member 2 plat Members

We didnt came Together so the First Group was seated & we 2 Joined them. After 3 min our waiter came & Asked us to Pay 18% gratuity because we are more then 6 or 8? Don t know it any more. 
We told her that the First Group already Paied the 18%. 
She insisted & wanted us to Pay it now. 
So we told her over And over to Check it again. Then the supervisor came & told us the Same story again. 
Instead of checking the check Before asking us !!!!they let us Look like we Where lying. Come on that was so embarassing. 

Will Not go back.
