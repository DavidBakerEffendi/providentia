The only reason I go to this one is because it's the closest to my house. 


Every time I go through the drive through there and get food the complete order is never there!! It's annoying. If it happened once or twice, no big deal, because everyone makes mistakes, but come on! I just want to get off work, pick up the kid and go through the drive through and grab food without having to go back up there because heaven forbid anyone up there actually answer the damn phone! 

When you order 2 tacos, 2 burritos, and 2 quesadillas with some chips and cheese you would think it would be fairly straight forward.........

Nope, I get home and the burritos are missing and that is what the kid wanted ‍ and she can't have chips and cheese for dinner. By the way , the cheese in the container - can you guys at least fill it up and not more towards the empty side ‍

Sincerely, 
The frustrated mom that now has to get in the car and drive back up there after digging through the trash for my receipt because your employees fail to do their job correctly time and time again
