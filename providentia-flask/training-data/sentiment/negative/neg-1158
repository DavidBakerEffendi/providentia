I love to come here for the scallop and amaebi sashimi it is always fresh. The hot items and everything else on the menu has good flavours but only when you get it on a fresh day.

Wondering why I have posted 1 star though? Well due to countless ( over 20) of service issues. 

 Been coming here for over 5years with family and friends. Really the quality and service has dropped substantially. 

I can only really count on the sashimi being fresh. 

The wait staff here have mastered the art of gossip, and ignoring ! I am really disappointed with that. For some reason Chinese people love to gossip about their customers/ laugh at them while they are eating. Not right and down right disgusting behavior. Especially since this is supposed to be an good time!

And they don't like people to waste a bite, Yes I know it's horrible to waste food, however we all been in the over ordering boat at AYCE sushi ! And sometimes even receiving other people's orders! 

But seriously GET OVER IT MATSUDA! People will have 1 bad piece here and there and ya damn right if items we ordered are not cooked we will let you know ! 
This is the 2nd problem we have with Matsuda over the past 20 times coming here. When things were undercooked or not ours they have a big angry gossip fest for the next 2 hours as if we personally attacked them! Next thing to ensue is slamming all the upcoming dishes on the table or dropping it / squashing it "accidentally" on top of other plates....

List goes on, I would be here till he'll freezes over about the petty attitude of their many servers. 

Anyhow if you can stand being treated like shit for fresh sashimi. By all means go ! But that is all you will get that's good!
