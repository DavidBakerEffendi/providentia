Had lunch here with a group of 10. The food was terrible. The service was worse. No plates or glasses were cleared during our meal, no refills of water or pop offered. We were also charged an automatic 15% gratuity for a large group. Perhaps that's why the server didn't do anything, he knew he was making money regardless of how he treated us! 

Do not eat here. Save your money. Go to the food court.
