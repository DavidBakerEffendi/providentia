Ok first I wouldn't consider this place a diner, it probably seats 180+, it's a restaurant. Just wanted a simple diner breakfast, eggs,HB,sausage biscuits and gravy. I received my order in about 2 minutes probably because it was already made. It was lukewarm and mostly bland. There just wasn't anything that would make me want to return.
