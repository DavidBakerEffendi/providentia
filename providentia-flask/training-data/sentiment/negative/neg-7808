Not the best shawarma place ever. The staff don't even welcome you properly inside, they just give you the menu and sit at the front doing nothing. The food was not as good, there was something hard in my food which could have broken my tooth had I not know. The salad is also not fresh and taste different. The chicken also, not as good. I would not recommend this place at all..first time trying and will not go here again! The place needs renovations, looks old and feels dark and gloomy! Staff doesn't even make you feel welcomed or anything, and just sit around on their phone. Worst place ever...
