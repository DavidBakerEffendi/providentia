1 star bc I couldn't give none. Whatever my waitress' is, she was rude. Took 15 mins for me to get a menu and 30 mins for my friend to get a refill. Her service was horrible. We'd have to stop her in passing. When I placed my order, she sighed as if I was bothering her. Loaded fries are good but Definitely not coming back!
