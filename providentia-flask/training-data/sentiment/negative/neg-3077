So I have to agree with a lot of the reviews on here; this food court establishment attached to a casino floor is putting out sub par, bland, inauthentic Mexican "fast food" at best. 

We ordered three enchiladas (extremely overpriced for what it is-but that's Vegas!) and they were "made to order" with a small amount of salsa, cheese, and choice of protein. Then they were wrapped up with a dash more salsa and put through an oven salamander (like at Quiznos to warm a sandwich) for a couple minutes and call it enchiladas; they were flavorless, the tortillas were dry and mostly unsauced by the salsa. Nothing resembling true enchilada flavors or actual enchilada sauce. The beans and rice were cooked well, but also very bland. 

The giant overpriced drinks came in three flavors and were an even bigger waste, even with a discount voucher; they were artificial, cloyingly sweet and didn't have even the slightest trace of booze or a balanced margarita. There are sooooo many other options for giant souvenir drinks on the strip- pick one of those over this place at all costs! They will put a quality drink from a better selection in your take home vessel. 

Accompanied by the very inauthentic drinks and food is disinterested and borderline rude service. I was snapped at by more than one employee, during ordering and check out. With the abundance of Mexican options and drinks at every turn anywhere on the strip, let's be real- I would still pick the Taco Bell Cantina down the street over this place as a last resort for half the price, and be much more in the true vibe of the Strip!
