Food was average at best. Took close to two hours for delivery on a Wednesday night and then they forgot to include the soda I paid for. Guy on the phone stated he would have to contact the app I ordered through (yelp) for the refund. Yet to receive the refund or hear back from Yelp. I sent them a message as well. Food arrived lukewarm to cold. Customer service sucks and food is not great. Don't waste your money. Lesson learned about this place. Sucks because I prefer to patronize locally owned business because chain pizza usually sucks. Don't get lured in by free delivery...you end up paying one way or another
