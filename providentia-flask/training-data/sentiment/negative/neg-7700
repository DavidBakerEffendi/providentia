Sad! The door says healthy food but once you get inside do be fooled! The DK wrap for example is marked as a healthy wrap. Yet its loaded with fries fried in fat instead of baking like lyfe kitchen or protein house. I though i hd found another healthy place but i guess not. A real dissapointment. #FedUp i put them in with mcdonalds for blatantly lying and failing to complete a nutritional menu which would prove its not healthy
