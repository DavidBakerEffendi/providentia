I was excited to see the sign go up for this place right near my house!  Read about it online and saw a huge selection of craft tap beer (awesome) and we love a great bar burger.  Again the location is great for me, but after one experience we will never be going back!  We went on a Friday evening, about 8:30pm and grabbed a table.  After staring at the wall of beers on tap and feeling a bit overwhelmed, I asked our waitress about a few that I'd never seen (namely Goose Island's Ten Hills), to which she replied "I really don't know anything about that beer".  No biggie, so I tried another, same response,  Usually at a bar in Wisconsin, they generously offer a sample to you...not her.  Just stared blank faced...awesome start!  So I asked for a sample of the Goose Island, which she brought.  I liked it and ordered a full size glass....which came and was not even the same beer.  Luckily I still had the sampler at the table, which was a slightly cloudy pale ale, and my new beer was a rich toned amber.  She insisted they were the same...again, ridiculous from a beer bar.

My husband, being a dark beer lover, ordered an oatmeal stout.  The glass came and was literally over 50% foam....the worst beer pour ever, none the less from a "brews" bars.  Laughable, he took it up to the bar and the other waitress shook her head (clearly realizing the issue) and poured him a new one.  He re-ordered the same beer and again, a cup-o-foam was brought to the table.  

On a tip from the neighboring table, we didn't order food!  

There are PLENTY of fantastic local pubs nearby....drive past this place and go to the Village Green or Free House Pub in Middleton!!!!!!!!!
