The place was empty aside from 1 person ahead of me. After waiting 15minutes I got up to check on my sandwich and they just started it. Get your thumbs out your asses. That's the second time (and last) I've waited way too long to get a sandwich here. The manager was even in there with the guy cooling. She was rude and didn't even apologize when I asked for my money back. Skip this place
