This was my first Vegas buffet. My boyfriend got food poisoning from this buffet. The selection was small and it was often difficult to get at the food because it was not set up in the tradition buffet style. It was more like a cafeteria. The pasta section had a chef that would make you whatever you ordered. I ordered some pasta which ended up tasting like the pan he cooked it in. I didn't eat more than a couple of bites before I was completely disgusted. Everything else didn't taste good either. This was a terrible buffet. The dessert selection was good, but I don't go to buffets for the dessert. One star for crappy food!!!
