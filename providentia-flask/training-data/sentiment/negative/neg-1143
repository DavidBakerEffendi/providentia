The  waitstaff was alsome, the food was absolutely horrible and believe the waitstaff knows it, because they don't ask you how the food was when you leave your plate full of food, we order the steam buns (15 min cook time), just give me a spoon full of sugar, the buns were sweet and the sauce was sweeter, the pork was sweet and burnt tasting, the vegetables on the bun also sweet, did not learn flavor profile in school, let's​ talk about the pork chop, look at the picture,(25min cook time)Burt on one side and barley​  grilled on the other side, it was tasteless and the sauce was even worse, it was like a paste, not demi, apple butter, no just sugar again, no taste of apple,  fingerling potatoes also sweet and over boiled, the spinach tasted like sweet mowed grass, maybe pastry degrees from JW, but not in hot food preparation, so with a open kitchen  you as chef should not be twerking, inappropriate behavior for a chef,  instead concentrate on the food and timeing
