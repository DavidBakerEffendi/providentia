I ate at this place expecting a great experience... Totally not the case.. The food was decent but the veal sandwich was super thin. I've had many veal sandwiches and this one was like eating a bread sandwich .. Thin slices of meat breaded and placed in an over sized bun.. The rice ball  was good but a Similar experience to another reviewer left me with having to choose what the server told me they had. When I asked for one of the choices on the menu I was Rudely told they did not have that choice available and then asked "do you want it or not?" Bottom line.. I don't think the food was worth coming back to deal with the poor service and knowing that I have had better elsewhere I can say I won't miss this place or remember it.
