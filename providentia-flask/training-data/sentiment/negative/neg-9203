What a load of old bollocks, the most schizophrenic place, menu and staff I have experienced since living in Canada, the portions are overpriced and underweight and most of the tweeky numpties working there don't know their elbows from their arseholes.

I walk in and order, then get told to walk to the back, which resembles a waiting room for the imminently underwhelmed.  The woman behind the counter calls my name, so im thinking 'nice one this is quick', only for her to tell me they've run out of half my stuff, I try to pick an alternative only to be told my choice has to be the same or similar to what I had ordered.  So I stand there and give her a verbal dressing down about customer service and learning her trade and all that, and she gets all twatty and then decides to back down.  I get my order, and the sandwich is half the size of a slider and consists mainly of soggy tomato and crippled lettuce, there's some sort of protein in there, but it looks like something dragged out of a gladiatorial arena after a days savagery, so no joy there.  The salad I had was boredom in physical form and no drink included, that's another $400 or something.

This place is really really really really really really crap, soup/salad/sandwich places generally are, but this pace wins the Oscar for lead performer in a pooh sandwich role, just awful.
