Wish I could give this place zero stars. Ordered a pizza with the crushed tomato sauce on it and cheessticks and went to pick it up. Horrible customer service, nobody at the front. I had to call the front for the employees from the back to come assist me. When I got home my fiance and I noticed that not only was the food cold it had NO PIZZA SAUCE ON IT!!!! Yes that's right, a pizza with no sauce......and breadsticks instead of cheese sticks!!!
