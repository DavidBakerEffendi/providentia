I went here thinking I'd enjoy a nice stir fry. It's a nice location and almost a whole in the wall. The reason why I give it a 1 star is because I found black hair in my food. That ruined it for me and for that reason I wouldn't return here or recommend it. The place wasn't busy during lunch our either, outside of us there was one other family there. There's no excuse for it.
