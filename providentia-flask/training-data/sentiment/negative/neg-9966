They burned the espresso beans in my cappuccino. It's a coffee shop right? They should make good coffee and espresso drinks. If you can't do a cappuccino right you have no business being in the coffee business. In addition, it took forever to get my bagel and cream cheese(over 15min). A wednesday at 10am is hardly an overly busy time. Am I wrong to expect prompt efficient and quality service from a coffee house. I had three sips of the cappuccino and pitched it. The bagel was fine, but its not as though they are baking them in the back. Save your money and go to lux or even starbucks for that matter.
