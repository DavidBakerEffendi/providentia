C'mon yelpers! This place is horrible, can't even finish my lunch. This kung pao chicken is garbage. They use the cheapest, most disgusting part of the chicken to make this meal! The meat is dark, fatty, and doesn't even taste like chicken. Plus the portion is tiny. I should have known walking into this dump. If you want REAL asian food that would blow your mind and make you never ever ever come back to this dump, go to T&J Asian Cuisine on 107th ave and Olive. You can thank me later.
