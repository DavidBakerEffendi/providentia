This is the Chipotle I run to from time to time when I am at work, and can I just say I hate every second of it. More often than not I am ordering burritos for the whole company so it's always an extremely stressful experience. Usually I order everything online and show up at the pick-up time only to discover they haven't even began to put the order together.

Another time when I didn't order online I was yelled at and heckled by fellow customers for ordering more than one burrito and wasting time. Not only did I get little to no support from the workers, they gave me serious attitude and made me feel extremely unwelcome.

On more than one occasion have the workers been incredibly unfriendly and rude, and because of that this particular Chipotle is my modern day hell.
