I wanted to love this place but I couldn't. I have had Peruvian food across the US and I have to say that this one falls towards the bottom of my list. It is a cute spot with great service. However, the food is definitely not what it should be for the prices you pay. I ordered a bowl of the Aguadito soup, it was barely warm and tasted bland. Then comes the Chaufa de Mariscos (Fried rice cooked with soy sauce, shrimp, mussels, octopus, calamari and scallops). I was horrified, the seafood was NOT fresh, it was by far the worst I've ever had and not to mention that the scallops were nowhere to be found! All that seafood must of came straight from the freezer and onto my plate! And the calamari, let's talk about that. My rice was full of it, I think there was more calamari then rice itself, not exaggerating. I was starving so I had to put myself through eating this so that I don't waste all the $$ this costs, and then I bite into a rock. I told the waiter and he brings someone out and he didn't even say who he was and said, it's from the mussels, they are smooth but sometimes we miss a spot. At this point, I was already mad so I ignored it. I mean I could've cracked my teeth and that's all you can say? I stopped eating and gave in. Then at the end, they gave me complimentary flan, which is a nice gesture but even that didn't taste good! It looked and tasted like it had been around for a while. I am so mad that I spent all that money on terrible dish! My Husband had the Lomo Saltado and he said it was good, but with this experience, I can't say that we will be back! Don't waste your $ on this place.
