I don't understand why this place has good reviews.  I usually trust YELP but this place was horrible.  The food was very blan and overcooked.  I had a tamale and chili relleno combo with rice and beans.  There was no texture to the food and everything had the same taste.  I would head to Frank and Lupes for some decent Mexican food.  I will not be going back to Los Olivos.
