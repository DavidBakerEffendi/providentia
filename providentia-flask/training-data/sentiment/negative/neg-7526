I wish I could give this place a zero! It was super loud and had to ask for the music to be turned down (off because it's either off/on). Waited 10 mins to order a drink. Had to ask for refills! Waited 45 mins for food and only got it after asking for it. Had to get our own silverware & napkins. Poor service!!! Waiter had major attitude! Manager was accomadating but doesn't make up for poor service.
