I had made several trips back to this restaurant and found the food quality was slipping each time. I finally stopped having dinners here and switched to appetizers when I dropped in.

I also noticed that the wait staff had become more and more arrogant over time. 

Apparently poor service, bad attitude and declining food quality along with high prices finally nailed them. THEY ARE CLOSED!
