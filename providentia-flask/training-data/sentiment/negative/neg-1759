And it keeps getting worse. Still not impressed with Texas Roadhouse. Food was not cooked correctly again. And the service was simply awful. Again I asked for a medium steak and it came out completely rare. Not one ounce was pink, instead it was bright red and clearly not cooked to a medium preference. I had to search for our server after 15 minutes post food not checking in to send it back. When they brought it out, it wasn't hot but warm but at least it was cooked. Service and food seem to be going down hill hopefully it will get better soon. Until then, I don't plan on visiting for awhile...
