Try harding at it's best. 17th ave (and Calgary on the whole) is being flooded with "monkey see monkey do" restaurants. This one is not an exception. Great location, great space...except for the fact that there is ALWAYS a lineup for the washroom. 

Staff there (this summer - July) did not know the menu, and two of the pizza's we ordered were EXACTLY THE SAME LESS 1 INGREDIENT. I think that's a little weak for a new menu.....

Anyway. They tried to fix the situation, which was nice. 

For eating in a parking lot surrounded by boards off of 17th ave..ambience outside get's a 3/10..the rest.....just not original or well executed. 

Disappointed because it looked to have potential.
