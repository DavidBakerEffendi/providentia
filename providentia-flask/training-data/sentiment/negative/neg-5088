Unbelievable wait time. I just walked in and walked right out. The line is at least 50 people deep winding around the entire length of the restaurant. The food is ok but this speaks to the employees who are slower than slow and totally inefficient. Not to mention they rip you on their portions compared to other chipotles. It would have taken 40 minutes to wait in their line for undersized burritos. I only now go here if the line is 10 or less which is almost never. Hey chipotle. What ever happened to hiring competent people.????  These kids in here are clueless and slow.  Not to mention taking care of online orders before actual customers standing right in front of them. Sad. Fire them all!!
