This restaurant is hidden in an industrial area. If no one told me about this place, I will probably never come here. My colleague drove me here for lunch. Surprisingly, the line was out of the door. I assumed this place is got to be good. We had waited for almost 25 mins to get our orders. Before I share the review of my order, I have to highlight on the hygiene of the place. While we were waiting in line, I saw a cockroach running on the counter. At a glance, I thought it was just a bug. However, after it was quickly crawling on the surface of the counter for roughly 5 sec, I am certain that it was a big roach. 

The servers know my colleague since he has been here for several times. However, my colleague told me that their attitude today was off and it was short staffed. After I told him about the roach, he was shocked. Interestingly, he used to come with another co-worker together, and he said he spotted a bug another day in the restaurant. Because the bug was crawling fast and the server picked it up quickly, he couldn't identify the type of the bug. Therefore, today's incident was not rare. 

Anyway, I was brave and strong enough to try my chicken breast plate. It tastes good but it is not gonna overcome the issue of the cockroaches.
