NEVER COME TO THIS TERRIBLE PLACE!! BAD FOOD, TERRIBLE SERVICE! RUDE PEOPLE!! 黑店！

I had the worst experience ever in this place. I went to Vegas for the holiday trip with my family. We stopped by the china town and found this place serve noodles, so we went in. Man, I should have checked the yelp review before I went!!! This place is terrible. Their food doesn't taste good at all, yet they are VERY EXPENSIVE!! Well, this is not the worst part yet.  When we had the lunch there yesterday, it was not full at all during the peak lunch time, yet they were very slow to deliver the dishes.  We complained to them that they were too slow, we were almost done with our noodles but they hadn't delivered the other fried vegetables yet. You know what, I just complained about they were too slow, the lady (probably the owner) was very rude to me saying that they were busy, shouted at me that we should just wait for them!! 

Of course I was very unhappy for that. They didn't feel sorry about that at all but being rude to me. When the bill came, they just forced to charge me 15% for the tips.  Well, I was never poor at giving tips. But their service was so bad that I didn't want to pay for that much tip, especially "forced" to pay that much. So I asked whether I could pay less.  Their owner came to ask me why, I explained how I felt I was treated rudely. They didn't say sorry again, but shouted and threatened us with punching the menu on the table ... 

what can I say with this place .. I won't go there again anytime I visit Vegas again, and please avoid this place if you can ...
