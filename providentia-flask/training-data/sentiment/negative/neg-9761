If I could give negative stars I would, they committed credit card fraud and then wouldn't own up to it. They changed my tip amount to more than twice what I wrote down and when I called to talk to them they adjusted it and then told me I must be wrong or my bank got it wrong. I get emails for every transaction and can see the old transaction record and the new one that went in right before they called me back. I can forgive a mistake but outright dishonesty is completely unacceptable.
