Never again!  This place was disgusting. I specifically stopped by here to get fresh and healthy food. By was I wrong because there is nothing fresh about this place. We ordered a chicken salad wrap, gyro wrap, falafel wrap, and hummus. All the meats and falafel a were pulled out of a freezer and cooked frozen. Was disgusting. Never going back. How do u advertise a place as fresh food when everything comes from a freezer I can make my own frozen food don't wanna pay for it
