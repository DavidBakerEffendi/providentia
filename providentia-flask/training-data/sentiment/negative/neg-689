Wrong and bad - sometimes when you say that about a burrito you mean that in a good way. This is not one of those times. They shouldn't even be allowed to call what's served here a burrito because that implies delicious eats - they should be forced to call it Bland Tasteless Crap.

Even by airport food standards, 360 is able to achieve remarkable new lows. It's expensive as all get out and you may as well be eating a picture of a burrito for all the flavor the food has. Even with the addition of jalepenos (extra charge, of course!) and two containers of hot salsa my chicken burrito tasted of...not much.

I wish I could tell you that you can do better, but honestly you probably can't.
