STAY AWAY from this place. We went here for a friend's going-away party and ordered drinks/food consistently over the course of a few hours. Our server, Kristin G, was less-than-helpful and continually "forgot" our orders and we were required to get another server's attention or simply wait for 30 minutes until she showed up again. After closing out our purchase, she came back to complain to MY HUSBAND IN FRONT OF ALL OUR FRIENDS about the tip she was given for her service. My husband gave her extra cash on top of her tip and we left. Now my credit card statement is showing an UNAUTHORIZED charge in addition to the original charge from Angry Ales. The restaurant manager had a terrible attitude when I called to complain and told me this "happens more often than you think". He was angry and defensive when I questioned the unauthorized charge on my credit card. Too bad for them, I actually saved my receipts!  We will never be back here and neither will any of our friends!
