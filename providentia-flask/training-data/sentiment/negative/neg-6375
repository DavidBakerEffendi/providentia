This place was not very good at all. Maybe it was the fact that the oven was broken on 11/15/2013, a little detail the server neglected to tell us until after our drinks arrived. So we couldn't order from half the menu. Dishes run $16-$22, which I thought was a little pricey, especially considering we didn't get anything with our entrees; no bread, no soup, no salad.  

The lobster ravioli was just okay. There was some lobster, but mostly just a mix of some seafood/krab salad  made with mayonnaise stuck in a ravioli shell covered with some orange sauce. I was expecting much more. Didn't come close to the Lobster ravioli at macaroni grill. 

The Mediterranean pizza was a little better, included all the right elements, but just lacked any sort of spark to set it apart. And we both got heartburn after dinner, not sure if that was from pseudo seafood or garlic on the pizza. 

The bill for two people was around $60, not including the tip. The servers seemed understaffed, there wasn't any bussers to clean tables, so servers had to do it all. 

We wanted to support small business, but I felt like I got ripped off for what we paid. 

The competition from Red White and Brew is going to be tough to beat if this business expects to stay in business with the poor menu selection and bland flavors that we experienced. 

We won't be returning.
