Absolutely will not go back to this location . Wife took the kids here and bought 1/2 dozen with two milks and went home . We live 12 miles a way. She went to go take a drink of milk and it's SOUR the date on the container was 3 days past . She checked the kids milk with a date of 08/02 and it's bad as well . The managers rudely worded  reply was just to come back in. With kids in tow that's not always easy I attempted to see if we could get a voucher but was cut short ......Never going to this location again
