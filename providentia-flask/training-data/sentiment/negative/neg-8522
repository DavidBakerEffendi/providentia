Made reservations and visited tonight with a group of 14, not 1 enjoyed their meal. After ordering we waiting 1 hour and 50 minutes for our food. What we got was an assortment of over cooked meals. When I say over cooked I mean the pork was jerky status!! Others had the steak which looked at though it had been microwaved and tasted freezer burned. The salad was drowned in vinegar and the clams were cold with a gelatine like sauce over them. All of our complaints were dismissed with apologies from the inattentive waitress . Needless to say I confident that no one from our group will be giving this place a 2nd chance.
