I used to eat here a lot until I checked their Maricopa County health inspection reports.  After reading that they were cited for storing rice milk in a laundry detergent container, storing food on the ground, improper sanitation practices, etc., I decided not to take my chances anymore.  For what it's worth, the food is pretty good.
