Update... After one year of not coming to this location, today 11/13/2016 I decided to give them another try and I placed an order and wow what a mistake that was! First things first when I go to pay for my order 30 telling me I can't use my gift card because I never registered to use a gift card with that location but you don't have to register a gift card nor do you have to register with a certain location.. I finally convinced them to swipe the damn card and lo and behold it worked so the guy at the register hands me my food 1 large pizza with pepperoni and double feta cheese and the Order of parmesan bites the large order. My pizza had no feta cheese, horribly undercooked and the parmesan bites or burnt and hard as a rock. It's been a year since I went to this location and as of today I can finally say without a shadow of a doubt never again. I'd like to apologize for my spelling and punctuation as I'm in the car and using voice to text and as we all know voice to text is very inaccurate and I'm so angry I'm not even going to proofread it
