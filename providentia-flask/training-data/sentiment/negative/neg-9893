How do you screw up a friggen burger? Ate here while attending a work conference, so we ate here for lunch. Here I'm thinking.... Order a burger. That's safe... 

Survey says.... BUZZZZZZZZZZ

Horribly dry and flavorless. Bun was made of depleted uranium. 

If you ever attend this hotel....SKIP THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!
