After reading the reviews below, I guess I went on an off day. Bun not fully steamed, hot dog warm, McCain frozen fries.......really? Montreal steamed hot dogs? Um, not in a million years!
I miss Lafleurs, La Belle Province, Montreal pool Room and the hundreds of others who always serve fresh made (never frozen) fries, whose steamed dogs are always HOT and of course a fresh steamed white bread bun!

There used to be a place in Toronto called Steamies a few years ago who were almost an exact replica of the Montreal experience but sadly they no longer exist.

Save your hot dog money for a trip to Montreal for the real thing
