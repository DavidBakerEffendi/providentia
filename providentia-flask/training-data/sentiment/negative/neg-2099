After dropping my wife to work, I came to the Westgate to collect some money from one of my winning sports bet tickets i made a week earlier. I was hungry and decided to eat breakfast here. First off, I thought the entrance looked nice and so did the tables. Now, when I went to the buffet, it looked very ordinary and unfortunately not very clean. The spread had your typlcal eggs, rice, sausage, bread, and fruit. The only things I saw unique were the lox and bagels. There are 3 main reasons I gave this place one star. 1) They don't have a cook-to-order omelette station. 2) My pet peeve for buffets is never serve cereal. And guess what? Remember those small boxes of cereal that you used to buy in an 8 or 10 pack (i.e. frosted flakes, cheerios, rice krispies, etc.) Yea, they got it. 3) It is NOT WORTH $19 and some change! You can go to Main street station in downtown and pay $8.64 for a better breakfast...AND they got an cook-to-order omelette station!
