When we saw the menu, we were thrilled at their vegan selections, and couldn't wait to try some.  

We tried their grilled romaine Caesar.  It was awful.  The seasoning was overpowered with so much oregano that we couldn't taste anything else.  We also tried their vegan burger.  It was dry, and bland.  The bread was stale.  It came with a side of beans with black olives that had yet again, too much oregano.  Perhaps the chef's favorite spice?   

The children's items we ordered were almost worse.  The chicken fingers were so tough that I couldn't cut them up with a steak knife.  I'm surprised that no one choked.  The child's cheeseburger was $14.  Even though the menu read $9, the server assured me that it was really $14 because the 6 greasy, undercooked fries that came with it were $5 extra.  (She never informed me beforehand.). My child then asked if his drink was supposed to be so gross- so I tasted his Shirley temple.  It was soda water with maybe a splash of grenadine.  

How dare I ask for olive oil with the bread, because the server informed me they don't have olive oil!   I said- you don't have any Olive oil? Oh ok. Then she said she did- but it didn't have seasoning in it.  I explained that I just wanted plain olive oil.  She brought that over promptly, and I must say that I am not  an olive oil expert by any means, but it was very obvious she brought me vegetable oil. 

This place only needs one word for me to describe it. AWFUL.
