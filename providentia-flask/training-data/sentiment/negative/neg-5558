Good food nasty attitude by hostesses . One person doesn't communicate what the other is doing . Upon arriving on a Saturday pm we were told 15-20 minute Wait. Then someone else told us we are being seated now only to be told by hostess 3 there is a 45  minute wait. These girls are possibly movie stars in dumb and dumber. We ordered a round of drinks only to be told we can't sit On the bench in the bar because that bench is reserved. The people next to us didn't have this issue. I read the hostess the riot act and called over the manager who was apologetic for the rude treatment  although our drinks and appetizer were given to us no charge and the waitress bringing our meal delivered good service . This is not the place to go because of a captive audience and non caring attitude .
