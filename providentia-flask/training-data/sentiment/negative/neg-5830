I would give the food four stars but a guy in front of me ordered the "hezbollah special" and the guy at the counter was like yeah I got you. I take that personally, I have served several tours in the Middle East and understand hezbollah as the terrorist organization that it is, I refuse to patronize any business that humors hezbollah and the terror it supports.
