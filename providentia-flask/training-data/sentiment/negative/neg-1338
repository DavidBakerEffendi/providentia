After waiting over 25 min for two sandwiches, I walked out.  I've been coming here for a couple years but I think I've finally had enough. I doubt I'll return.  The food isn't great, isn't horrible but it's close to home.  The staff isn't very swift and gets my order wrong as often as right. I've had enough and will go somewhere else. As for the Bobby sandwich that I've heard so much about.... It's bad. Gummy stuffing, bland turkey and bad cranberry sauce. Only someone who's never had a good turkey dinner would think it in any way resembles Thanksgiving dinner.
