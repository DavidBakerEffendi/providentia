Everyone at work raves about this place. Very busy at lunch time, I assume 95% of their business is between 12-2 pm as there is not many good options in the area within walking distance of all the companies. Jessie's totally takes advantage of this, as a burger and fries cost $13.50. Why is a caf√©/diner charging $3.99 for fries and $8.87 for a burger. Odd! They had roast beef with salad for $15.60 as a lunch special. The burger was nothing special, they do make them to your liking, however I asked for tomato lettuce and mayo and got onions tomato lettuce ketsup and mustard. Yuck! I hate mustard. So not only did it seem overpriced to me, I got a burger I tossed half way through because I personally do not like mustard. Fries are salted and vinegary which were ok. I gave one star because you can not give 0.

Very disappointed, they are charging prices like the keg milestones and Kelsey's at lunch, for take out? Still: odd experience to me. 

*** Since someone messaged and said I don't know what I'm talking about and hardly go out: The Keg, Milestones and Kelsey's all have lunch menus that all their burgers are under $20, so I will stand by my statement and say for a cafe to serve a burger at $13.50 is just plain silly and a mega rip - ps see my review on the keg mansion and keg Montreal. ***

You can get a cookie for $2.49. Rice and salad for $10. What an odd combination lol

Anyway if u like paying too much for your lunch, go here.
