One star? How about NO STARS because we didn't get serviced at all.

Although we were promptly shown to a table , we sat there for 25 minutes without so much as someone asking us for a drink order. NOTHING.

We watched as at least 3 parties were helped while we sat there without a waitress or waiter. It was around 11 on Monday so they weren't full or that busy.

Now I hate being rude to service workers so I didn't want to ask a random waitress if she could help us because I know they're busy.

But we were so hungry and no one even looked at us. 

Needless to say after around 30 minutes of waiting we left. No one even offered to ask why or say goodbye. 

Instead we went to IHOP and are currently having MUCH better service and food. Considering we couldn't even eat at the good egg. 

Good egg? More like never-eating-here-again egg. Even though I DIDNT GET FOOD TO BEGIN WITH.
