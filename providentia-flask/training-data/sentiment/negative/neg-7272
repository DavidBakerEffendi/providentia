My husband's birthday was on Thursday so I got him two $25 gift cert. for this place, we went to a game last month and he mentioned he would like to try it out some time. Well, last night we drove down from Glendale to finally try it out. The website says they are open Mon.-Sat. until 10pm, we park in the cityscape garage and walk over to find that the place...is closed for the night?? 

My husband knocks on the door as we watch a little cook cleaning the cooking area while a tall,slender young man with light brown/blondish hair is just kind of standing and talking to him. 

He finally opens the door to my husband and tells him "yeah we're closed". When my husband told him wow really but the website says 10, and he says "yeah well the websites wrong, manager keeps forgetting to change it, we close at 9 now" and shuts the door...nice attitude right? and not to mention it was 8:07pm?!

 Horrible staff, I really hope Jeff Ward is informed of the lack of consideration his employees have to potential customers and the owner knows he is losing money because of them. Anyone interested in buying two $25 gift cert let me know, $40 for both because we have no desire to visit this place now when it is actually open....
