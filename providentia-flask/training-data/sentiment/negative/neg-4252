What a terrible place. We ordered the honey walnut shrimp and it came with shredded lettuce not broccoli and it wasn't even in any sauce. It was basically just bland soggy fried shrimp with some walnuts that weren't really even candied. They scrimped on all ingredients. Okay next we ordered the wor wonton soup and the dumplings were of poor quality, there were no noodles, I mean this place seriously tries to cut costs at every corner. I will NEVER order from
Here again. There are other Chinese restaurants that are actually great quality.
