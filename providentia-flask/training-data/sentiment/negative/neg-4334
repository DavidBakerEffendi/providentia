I just left the centennial location and got a Makai bowl for the first time. And my normal Hula bowl... but I was questioning if the Makai bowl usually comes this empty. Check out the comparison in both bowls. My Hula was equally leveled but the Makai bowl was not full at all! What a disappointment.
