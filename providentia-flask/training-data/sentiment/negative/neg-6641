Very upsetting!  Park 51 cafe is under new management.  Some of the new staff not near as friendly.  Norman, who has been there over 20 years is gone.  He was always quick to fill tea and bring out food if the waitresses were busy.  My husband and I started coming here when we were dating.  Now we need to find another breakfast place.
