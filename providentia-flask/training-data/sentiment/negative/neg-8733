My daughter's birthday dinner was a disappointment. She requested going here because she remembered that when you order a cheesecake they write Happy Birthday and light a candle. I even checked on their website that they will do this. When we arrived I informed the hostess that it was my daughter's birthday. The server even said the birthday girl can order first. Everyone did enjoy the food even though it was way too much to eat. When the cheesecake arrived nothing was written on it and no candle! I quickly asked if they could write Happy Birthday and put candle on it. Then our server came back with the cheesecake and said "Did you think I forgot about you?!" Yes you did and she just stood there while we sang which was annoying. I then witnessed a young lady get a cake with writing and a candle plus several servers were singing?! I asked my husband to address the issue with the manager. The manager didn't seem to care. He was only concerned about us paying and leaving. Not good customer service at all!
