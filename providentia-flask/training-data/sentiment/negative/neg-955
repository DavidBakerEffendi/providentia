Very disappointing establishment. 
The decor is supposed to be cute and charming, but the chair I sat in felt like it was going to break when I leaned back slightly. The white cushions, chairs and floor had hair from past customers. Not a good impression from the get-go.

The hazelnut milk tea was full of sugar. The brick toast with red beans and matcha had WAY too much whipped-cream, and barely any red beans.  The three-layered toast is made to impress in photos and not the taste buds. 
 
Finally, the prices are skyrocket high for what you get.
