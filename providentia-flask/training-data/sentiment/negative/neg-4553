Thursday night @ 6 pm. Terribly slow service. We were just forgotten. With a small hungry child I had to go chasing down a piece of bread. The food was so, so and only served after an interminable long wait. In all, a most unsatisfactory evening. We will never go again. (We have been here before, not better then.)

All you shoppers - go elsewhere.
