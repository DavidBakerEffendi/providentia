Ate at 808 Tapas tonight....What a sad disappointment. 

The Ahi Tuna Poke was very good. (how can you screw that up really I mean anyone with a cable channel can make that)

The Wagu Beef Sliders (yea right) were served well done.  May as well have went to McDonald's for better quality beef.  (so bad....so pathetic) 

The fish tacos seemed frozen. When I asked where the fish was from I was given a species that doesn't exist. I then asked which water are they from - Pacific or Atlantic they asked "what do you mean" 

The Pork Belly and Garlic dish....(whew roll the dice fellas) You don't want to know.   Yeah you do - Imagine huge chunks of large asparagus with little tiny bits of what you hope is pork belly smothered in a brown garlic sauce.  bad really bad. 

THEN......They front of the house manager brought out the mop bucket and began to mop around our table. 

Employees like to laugh and carry on without regard to their surroundings.  Poorly managed and overall poor food.
