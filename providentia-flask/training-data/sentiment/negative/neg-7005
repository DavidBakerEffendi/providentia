This is my first time back at this restaurant and my wife's first visit. 
The special vodka sauce and penne pasta with prosciutto look like it was served in pink dishwater. The place was full of drunks. 
NEVER COME HERE!
You will get better Italian food at the spaghetti warehouse for a fraction of the price.
