Stopped by with Geri and Chuck to have a couple of beverages and appetizers and the food was ok but the service stunk!  Sat at the bar which is normally good service but of course our bartender does not understand, "Customer Service"!  Ordered and asked for chips and salsa and I had to get up and go to the front door to get them delivered.  Smallest appetizers that I have ever seen at a TGI Fridays.

I am very pleased to say that I won't come back to this location!!  Good luck in keeping your clients.
