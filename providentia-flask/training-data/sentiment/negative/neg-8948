First of all, I would like to state that I did not eat here. 

I was interested in trying this place because of their claim of having a stuffed pizza. Being a Chicago native, I wanted to see if it stood up to a Chicago-style stuffed pizza. When I arrived, at 6:00 PM on a Saturday night, it was closed. There was a sign on the door stating they were having problems with the kitchen and that service should resume on June 30th. Today is September 13th!!!

Seriously, a note on Frunchroom's website, Facebook page or Twitter saying "hey, we are closed until further notice" would have been nice. Instead, I spent 30 minutes walking in a cold downpour just to find out they were closed. A little common courtesy, as well as a little common sense, goes a long way.
