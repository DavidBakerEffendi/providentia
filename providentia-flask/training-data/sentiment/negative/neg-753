Was looking for a brunch spot to bring some friends from out of town. From the reviews, seemed like a great place. Food was extremely mediocre. Felt like a Denny's with a trendy name and a few additional "healthy" options. 

I ordered the Ncounter omelette. The chicken wasn't seasoned, and added a bland flavor to the dish. I figured their signature omelette would be tasty, but no.

French toast was okay, but syrup was of poor quality. For the price we expected much more.

To top it off, they lost our friends order, so after 30 minutes we approached the counter about it and 12 minutes later it was served.... but by that time we were ready to go. Will never be back, it's nothing special. :/ boo, wanted a fun brunch.
