WORST Indian Food!!!!!! Sadly I had been to New India Bazar as my colleague wanted Indian Sweets and we decided to try out the lunch. Firstly, lady who got us lunch had a bad attitude. She was pretending as if we are eating lunch for free. They didn't have plates to start with and food was empty in the buffet counter. For $10 they just had very few options and out of that most of the things were already finished. Chicken curry just had gravy and no chicken. Chicken Tandori was cold and chicken tasted very bad. And above all the lady was scolding people for not completing the food. I have had lot of indian food as i was raised in India and sadly this restaurant is setting a bad example for how indian food taste.
