Literally one of the worst meals of my life. $75 for a plate of crudo that was the quality/quantity you'd see at a mid-range sushi joint for $40. Mushy warm olives. $46 Alaskan king crab ravioli that was chewy and filled with (could it possibly have been canned??) dry, stringy seafood.

The sad thing is, I have always loved Buca. My team has held events at their other locations and I've had good meals at this one twice. They still have an excellent wine list, but we didn't even eat half our food. It was just terrible.
