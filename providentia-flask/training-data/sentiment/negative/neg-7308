If you read all the previous revues you will get a generally accurate picture of this place and an idea of why I will think twice before returning.
I've have eaten here a few times and am no stranger to good food having managed a restaurant in Manhattan and had numerous meals while working in France and Italy. The food here never has fallen below good and I am sure is the best Italian in Lorain County, although as we know that is not saying much.
Some things are quite good as was my entree enjoyed during my last visit.
It was a seafood pasta comprised of a talapia filet and a variety of shellfish in a wine sauce and was a special that day. It was very tasty. It was not 36 dollars tasty. I would not be too surprised if I was back in Manhattan but I was sitting in a typically decorated  shoebox of a space in a strip of stores in Avon Lake. It is not the high rent district.
Always,always ask the price of the specials at this place because the owner has an inflated idea of what their food is worth. Twenty six dollars ,twenty eight, maybe thirty
during the Gulf oil spill. Wait until you are in Cleveland and get equally good food for less.
Unfortunately that was not the end of the bill that insults your intelligence. I had ordered the soup of the day which was a step above average but nothing more. The menu stated six bucks for soup of the day. On the bill it became eight which was also the price of the glass of house wine I had. The prices have always been high at Aroma and good food costs money of course but I don't like getting ripped off.
The service was good until it got busy and then they ignored us in their rush.
I still left a good tip ,a few extra bucks isn't going to kill me but it will be a long time if I ever go back.
