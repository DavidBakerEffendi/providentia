My mother came here with her friends on labour day weekend and there was a cockroach in their vermicelli dish! They took the dish away and replaced it with a new one and didn't even take it off the bill. Awful service AND ROACHES. Be warned.

Not sure how the taste of the food actually was but cockroaches make this establishment unrateable.
