Ordered from here the first time today.. My coworker and I decided this was a good choice for lunch but man did I think wrong... The sub was good that I ordered..up until half way through I noticed a black hair poking out in between the salami and bread! What?!?! Well that obviously ruined my lunch.. I picked the potato salad as a side and that was another mistake... Potatoes weren't even cooked well and and there was no flavor. They were super warm too. My coworker didn't like his salad much. Bland in flavor. The only good thing is the delivery. But what's the point of the food is terrible?
