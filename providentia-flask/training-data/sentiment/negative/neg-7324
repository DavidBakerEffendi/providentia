I called crooked river to place an order recently. The employee named Yolanda said that "we're closing in a half hour". The very first words that came out of her mouth. I asked if I could place an order to which she replied yes. I began the order and she said "we're out of practically everything." They clearly did not want by business and seemed like my call was a burden to them. I'd be surprised if this place makes it another year with this kind of customer dis-service.
