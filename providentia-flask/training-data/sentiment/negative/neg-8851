I didn't go to Toby Keith's expecting great food or ambiance, but I did hope that his selection of 'country cookin' would be better than average, what with his cowboy hat and all. We were seated quickly (I'll give 'em that), but the service was anemic at best.

The food arrived, and my girlfriend and I sat there munching stoically without comment for a few minutes. We were both hungry, and even though I had several comments, I kept them to myself for that initial interval. Finally, she broke down and said "Any good?"

I replied: "Well, it tastes like the boot, right after Toby Keith pulled it out of Al Qaeda's ass!" - and then I illustrated my point by taking a sharp bite with my canines and holding it down for ten seconds, and showing her that I hadn't made a dent in the meat!

Toby, a couple of suggestions for you:
1. Leave the jingoistic songs to someone who does *not* own a restaurant, and concentrate on upgrading your food from "horrible" to "barely passable" - this will be a huge step forward.
2. If you must involve yourself with patriotic activities, please wrap care packages of your food and drop it off between the Afghan/Pakistan border. After two days, I'm positive they'll surrender. Your menu selections will do more damage than the MOAB.

They do take plastic and the monorail will drop you off pretty close, but I'd recommend going elsewhere, even if you're on your last vestige of strength and absolutely must eat. This restaurant has probably lost Toby more fans than his singing ever will.
