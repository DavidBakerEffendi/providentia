Used to have great food and flavor. I've eaten there since they've opened. The past 6 months, though, I've gotten wrong items in my orders (my wife is allergic to shrimp yet she keeps finding shrimp in her orders!!) and the food has been bland bland bland. They don't follow the ingredients on their menu. Very friendly cashier, but their cooks preparing the meals either don't care or don't know what they're doing and I'm guessing no one has complained yet. Don't know if they're trying to cut costs or what. Will not go to Hunan in Medina either, after they insulted my dinner party asking us to leave because they had people waiting for a table when we hadn't even gotten the check yet! Time to look for another Chinese take out...
