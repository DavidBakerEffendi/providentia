The buffet is of a good size, and it does appear to be kept relatively fresh, but I'm going to have to say that the quality is... questionable.  I'm not trying to say that the food is undercooked or anything along those lines.  Just that when you bite into a piece of teriyaki chicken on a stick, it should generally taste like chicken (or at least a meat that tastes like chicken).

Doing so here tasted like, well, something else.  In fact, just about everything here tasted like something else.

Again, it wasn't that the food was bad or out-of-date or anything.  It is just that everything - meat, vegetables and even sauces - didn't taste quite right.  It's quite possible that the taste buds in my mouth were off or something, but a bite a short while later at the bakery was just fine.  So my money is on the Lotus Buffet.  You can draw your own conclusions.
