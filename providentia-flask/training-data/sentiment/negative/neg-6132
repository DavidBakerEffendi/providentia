This review is on the resturant only-
First of all, the location of the resturant being in the heart of downtown could have great potential. The only problem is the service.

I went there with my husband and daughter on a Friday night approx. 7pm. 
The "live band" that was suppose to be there from 6-8 cut out early. Okay I can deal with that. Now lets talk about the server. I watched this poor guy waiting tables, bartending, and helping the cooks!   He was the only server and bartender there on a Friday night!  It took over an hour to get our food. Of course people were complaining. 
The word was  that the manager at the Verrado location also manages Scottsdale, and she was up there.

How about a full time manager at Verrado!. If service were better, I'm sure they could afford to pay one.

Needless to say, I left the server a 20.00 tip because I truly felt bad for him. He was running his tail off!!
