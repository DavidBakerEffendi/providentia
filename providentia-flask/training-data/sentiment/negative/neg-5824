I'm writing this review because somehow my old review can't be found anymore but the experience was SO BAD even though it's been a couple of years I'd highly NOT recommend people to go here.

I was there with my husband and we were sitting on the tables outside of the window, with my view facing inside the pizzaria. As our pizzas were taking out of the oven I see the owner (white hair, oldish guy) drop the pizza on the ground pick it up and place it back onto the plate!!!! At the point I'm saying to my husband 'Omgosh he just drop the pizza and now he's literally bringing it out for us to eat!' When the pizza arrives half of the pizza is COMPLETELY MANGLED like the tops are all gone and unrecognizable, I say to him 'Ummm, I just saw you drop that pizza!' To which he said 'NO' and I responded with 'I saw it with my own two eyes you dropped it, pick it back up and brought it to us.' Then he retaliated saying he 'well I DIDNT are you calling me a liar....!!!! I was so angry at this point, why the f would anyone accuse someone of dropping a pizza and the worst part is he won't even own up to it... He just walks away. I go in and tell the waiter who's working behind the counter that were leaving cause he drop to pizza, he just nods because he saw it happen as well. 

WHAT the f kind of service is this. Never go here, if he can do this kind of dishonesty right before our eyes I can only imagine what goes on behind closed doors, recycled food, old stock? Maybe. I also read another poor review from someone else here on Yelp of this restaurant and the owner personally messaged her saying that she's never been there before...! Ummm he sounds kind of PYSCHO.
