Ew you get what you paid for I guess. They have these plates that are colored so you're either paying 1.00-2.00 per plate of sushi but who knows how long it's been rotating around other tables before it gets picked up by someone. Some pieces were good most were horrible. I also ended up very sick afterwards and spent most of the night in the restroom. If you do go take a sweater they keep that place freezing. I ordered the last couple of plates from a menu which those where better tasting. Cheap yes good no but that is my opinion and the place was packed the whole time we were there so they get plenty of business.
