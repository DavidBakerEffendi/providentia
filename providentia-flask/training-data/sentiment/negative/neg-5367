You know the ambiance is great ... They had good service...  But...  We ordered a dish without shrimp paste that they put shrimp in...  The menu didn't say it had shrimp. Scatterbrained. Fried rice had no flavor.... Very anemic. Overpriced Thai Teas.  Red Curry was good but portion size wasn't worth 14 bucks. They have to get a better menu. Thom Ka was was watered down and salty.
