Very disappointed with Panera.  The apple i got on the side with my salad was so bruised up I didn't want to eat it.  I've been trying to give them a chance since they bought Paradise Bakery.  Unfortunately almost every time we order lunch for work there is a problem with the order.  The soups are not as good anymore.
