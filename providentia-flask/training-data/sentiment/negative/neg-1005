I was really hankering for some Indian food. The reviews of this place were great, the people on the phone were awesome and the service was super. We got our food for our takeout order. It smelled great and the first few bites were incredible. The samosa was delicious. But the rest of the food was so salty I could barely taste anything else. They even salted the salad. The salad! Seriously? What's the point of that? I wanted so badly to love this place. I wanted to this to be our go to Indian place. Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen. Why is it that restaurants have to over salt their food like that? After spending over $50 for dinner I was exceptionally disappointed and had to throw out over half the food.
