I made reservations for a party of 9 for my parents anniversary.  I specifically asked for a table when i called, because my mother is handicapped and not able to sit on a high top.  After waiting for 1/2 hour past our reservation, I asked to speak to the manager (male salt/pepper hair).  He was visibly irritated, and incapable of holding back his frustration and emotions.  He went away, and came back in 5 minutes to rudely inform me that they had a high top available to seat us.  When I told him that we made the reservation specifically asking for a table because my mom was not not able to sit at a high top, he shrugged his shoulders and rudely told me to "take it or leave it".  I've booked their private room in the back of the restaurant twice before ( for large birthdays), but I'm not setting foot in that restaurant again, even though it's located 2 miles from my house.  

The owners & people running the restaurant need to understand that when someone is going pay $15-20 for a plate of Italian food they can cook themselves at home for under $3, they need to be EXTREMELY welcoming, put customer service at the forefront, and be INCREDIBLE hosts.  I always give restaurants a 2nd and 3rd chance when they have an off night (food or delays).  With that said, there's no excuse for a EXTREMELY bad attitude and showing disrespect towards your patrons.
