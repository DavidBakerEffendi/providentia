I wasn't sure how to rate this place based on our experience. We were the first people in the restaurant and by the time our food was ready, the entire restaurant was full and EVERY SINGLE PERSON had received their food prior to us. We asked if we could just pay for our appetizer and drinks and we would leave but our food had just finished so they made it to go and STILL charged us! Oh with a $7.00 discount haha! Not sure if it has anything to do with race but just gonna say that I am Hawaiian Japanese and my husband is black and we were the ONLY colored family in there and both military. It's unfortunate because I was really excited to finally try this place.
