This was not amazing like the review's said. Had high expectations going in after reading reviews on yelp. Do yourself a favour and drive 30 mins to Playa Cabana for a proper Mexican experience in Toronto. The tacos were nothing special, very small portions and overpriced. They messed up on the order the first time and had to remake the items. The brisket, carnitas and chorizo were dry. A Dos Equis bottle was $7. Home made sauces were okay.
