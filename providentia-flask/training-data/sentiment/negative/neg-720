The service here is the worst I've ever experienced.

My boyfriend and I went for all you can eat sushi. We were the only people in the restaurant, yet the waitress treated us like a huge inconvenience. We waited forever to order, the food took forever to come, and on top of that, she messed up our order. As we were ordering, we asked a couple of questions and tried to let her know about my boyfriend's food allergy and her response was an eye roll. 

The sushi itself was decent but was certainly not worth the wait and being treated so poorly.

At the end of the meal, the waitress brought us our bill and we asked to pay with debit. Again, another eye roll. It took her ten minutes to bring the debit machine and the place was completely empty aside from us. 

We decided we did not want to tip her since it was the poorest service we had ever had but the debit machine required we enter a tip. We entered the minimum possible (10 cents) and she openly scoffed and rolled her eyes when she saw the receipt. 

We will not be back.
