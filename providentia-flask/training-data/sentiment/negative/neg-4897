I'm going to make this short, because honestly this place isn't even worth the time I'm taking to write this review. Husband and I waited outside for 15 - 20 minutes and then seated in front. Awkward bench seating at two wobbly tables pushed together. Server was very friendly and coffee was great....that's about where our enjoyable experience ends. Waited quite a while for such a small place. Got the wild blueberry pancakes that had no flavor and were tough, over-mixed, and overcooked. Husband ordered the typical, nothing fancy breakfast - brown on the outside and way to soft on the inside scrambled eggs, way over peppered and tough sausage (they make it there, which would be great if they actually tasted good), home fries burnt and inedible. He couldn't stomach any of it and sent it back with another server and I ate one of the four pancakes. It was bad enough that the food was your typical over-hyped yupster garbage, but what really pissed me off was that our previously friendly server didn't even come to see us when the other server brought the food back and obviously informed her of our dissatisfaction. I still left her a tip because I'm not an asshole, but she did nothing to earn it. Needless to say, we won't be back and we'll make sure to tell our friends.
