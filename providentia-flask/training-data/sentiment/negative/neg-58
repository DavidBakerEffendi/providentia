This review is written with the caveat that I have had multiple prior positive experiences with Pan Asian before tonight. And it is more a service-based one rather than one centered on the quality of the food.

Tonight, I ordered the boat noodles. As any boat noodle lover knows, the crispy pork skin is essential to the experience. It adds a sharp, textured contrast to the richness of the meat and the broth. 

I received my order to find the crispy pork skin missing. I inquired with the staff. Water, meet duck. They laughed it off stating that their supply was exhausted and they'd just give me "a little bit more" next time. What good does that do me, silly Pan? No explanation was given for why it wasn't brought to my attention when I initially placed my order.

For those who don't frequent Pan Asian, this was not a kitchen error left un-communicated to the front side of the restaurant. The cook is the owner and his wife interfaces between the front and the back, with another family member serving the tables.

Truly wouldn't have been an issue if they'd apologized right off the bat for a simple oversight. Instead, they dismissed it as a trivial matter and behaved as if they'd hoped I wouldn't notice the missing ingredient and ended up with their hands caught in the cookie jar. A disappointingly unprofessional experience all the way around. 

Pan Asian, I will miss your boat noodles, but time will bring us closure and soon you will be a distant memory of a good thing that was, but no longer is. Mistakes have been made, but you will learn and grow. It's a shame, really, but I wish you well.
