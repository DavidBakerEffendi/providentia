I've had dinner here a few times and it seems that food quality gets worse with each visit. Yesterday was definitely my last.  The sangria I ordered was made from wine made out of someone's garage. Poor garbage. Should be ashamed of yourself for serving this crap. The pizza was not cooked. The crust was raw. The calamari were recooked and nuked in the microwave. The service was slow. No bread was served or water. With service like this, it won't take long for people to stop dining here. If I could give no stars, I would.
