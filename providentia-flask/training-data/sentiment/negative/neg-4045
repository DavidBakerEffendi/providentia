What you are reading is right about the fly's. Its HORRIBLE. I mean like hundreds in the dining area and it is clear that everyone else who went there is having the same issue. I Love Avi L.'s review because it was so direct, to the point and honest, but I want to add to this if I may...

Don't know about the drive thru because I went inside. The front desk cashier lady is rude. She talks way too fast and when you ask to have her repeat what she said because it is impossible to understand her, she responds back with an attitude. He was right. She is rude as hell. 

It looks like the crew is all into themselves and they clearly don't care one bit about the place or the guests. 

What saddens me is I am usually a big Whataburger fan. Really am. I have been to several in Texas and the experience is always great. Staff who likes the people coming in. No flys. Fast service and clean. THIS place is like it is managed by a person who has a grudge on his shoulders about WhataBurger and is hell bent on ruining the franchise. 

We actually left mid-eating because we got way too tired pushing away the flys from our food and the B.S. excuse is it's hot outside and that's why there is so many flys is insulting everyone who knows that this is not the case anywhere else in Phoenix. 

SO IF YOU WANT A REAL HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND RUIN YOUR DESIRE FOREVER TO GO TO A WHATABURGER... just drop by here!
