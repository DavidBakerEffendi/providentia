The DJ made the Superbowl experience memorable because his commentary was so poor!!! This was a consensus of many, not just myself. He makes you miss all the great moments!!!!

The rest of the staff was great (Dave and the hostess, servers as well) and very attentive...the food was okay, except the ribeye and fried shrimp...worse than typical bar food!!! Not sure if this is the norm or perhaps too much food was being prepped all at once.

I won't avoid this place for a normal dining experience based on today, but I will pass when it comes to a sporting event that I really want hear.
