Jack of All Trades, Master of None

The service at shift change was actually rude. However, they made up for it by doing absolutely nothing. They were not busy enough to warrant that level of inattention. "Are you gonna want more iced tea." as she walked off. It wasn't a question; it was a statement. 

Time from seating to getting a menu - nine minutes. We were there in plenty of time to order brunch. However, this was denied since the service was pathetically slow. It was a solid 22 minutes before we received our beverages. 

...and OMG, I'm such an asshole for expecting to use the Yelp check in! No, you CANNOT TAKE MY UNLOCKED PHONE TO YOUR MANAGER! I know you're a waitress and not an IT Security Specialist, but it's not MY job to know what flipping Yelp deals your business is running. 

My Pickle Brined Nashville Hot Chicken was OK. It should be about $8 cheaper. The serving size of the $6 Fried Pickles was ridiculous. (Of course, perhaps this was the Yelp Special Size.) $18 for three average tacos?

Yup. 

MGM, if you're going to charge this much for this food, at least make sure the service is exceptionally good and not "marginally there". 

Overall, an extremely poor, yet expensive experience.
