While the cheap sushi may be tempting, the service is the worst, and the waitresses have far more attitude than the trade off for cheap sushi is worth.  We went in at lunch and asked to be seated at the bar where there were clearly 5 open areas that would have seated our party (of 4) but they refused to seat us unless we sat at a table because 'lunch is coming'.  Not seating us because our party (of ONLY 4) was too big was stupid and rude!!  We went elsewhere and won't be returning.
