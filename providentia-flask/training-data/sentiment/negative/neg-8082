We were very disappointed with the food here. If I can give zero stars I would. 

We ordered idli and dosa at 10am. It turns out it was just reheated food from yesterday as they hadn't gotten their delivery for the morning. 

I am not sure if the food will taste any better but we got stale and not so tasty food.
