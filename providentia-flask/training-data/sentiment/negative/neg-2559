I'm a regular at the Ajax location as it's close to home and I love the food there. Tried the seekh kabobs at the Scarborough location today and had to return them as they were completely dry. Got a takeout of the same order as I was running late only to realize later they were still pretty dry. Guys you need to add fat to ground meat before you cook it else the kabobs will be dry no matter how you cook them. Get your act together before you start losing customers and shut down forever.
