I will not eat here again and would not recommend it to anyone.  Overpriced for level of service and quality of food prep.  We sat at the table for almost 10 minutes before a server came to the table.  Our first round of drinks and the bread basket sat empty way to long.  They didn't time my prime rib with my wife's salmon well at all.  Her salmon had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for some time.  I'll pay the Vegas prices, but I had better get good food for it.
