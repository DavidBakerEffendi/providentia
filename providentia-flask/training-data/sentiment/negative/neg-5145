Came back from finishing my last final wanting to celebrate by ordering a steak from somewhere so I gave this place a try and ordered a well done steak. Upon getting back to my dorm I pull out my order to see it RARE... now me being in a dorm I don't have anything to cook it with so guess who just wasted $25 freaking dollars, THIS GUY. Pretty inconsiderate that this was NO WHERE CLOSE to being well done, sorry I'm not a vampire and don't want food poisoning... I'm aware restaurants usually give you the worst piece of steak when you order well done but this is unacceptable, guess who's never giving this place another dollar
