I dont know which address is the one at the Las Vegas Hilton off the strip, outside the convention center, thats the one I am reviewing.

One word: pukey
Cannot understand the rave about their hot dogs and "the snap" what snap? The one were your stomach tells you to stop putting this toxic dump of a dog inside it? 
First, no matter what item I get from here, its cold or lukewarm. Their dogs suck, I buy he-blew internationals that taste 1000 times better at costcos. Hell costcos dogs are as good, or bad.
I ordered crispy chicken sandwich to change things up a bit, my goodness it was worse than anything I have eaten, tempurate, quality, taste, and appearance wise
Sure their small wavy cut thumb fries look cute and are somewhat edible, but this whole establishment sucks ass.
When you are at a trade show and can't decide what to get from this mini-food court, do NOT get this crap, move 10 spaces to the left and get sbarros pizza (not that that will be getting a michelin star anytime soon but compared to this it's gourmet)
P.s. And shit aint cheap yet gross!!!!
