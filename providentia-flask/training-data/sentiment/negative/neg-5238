Feeling like some authentic Chinese food during my last trip to Vegas, we decided to head over to Chinatown and try out the food at Sam Woo.  My family had been here before and said that the food was good, especially their BBQ sausage.  Unfortunately, our expectations for good Chinese food were not met.

We ended up getting a variety of dishes- the BBQ sausage, wonton soup, the house special HK-style fried noodle, the rock cod with tomato sauce, the beef with satay sauce, the beef tripe with black bean sauce, the lemon chicken, and lastly, the deep-fried crispy intestine.  Yes, I know, I am a big fan of offal.  Too bad Sam Woo had some intestines that were deep-fried to the point of becoming intestine-flavored potato chips...sounds gross, tasted worse.  All the other dishes weren't anything special- the sauces just weren't very tasty, especially the tomato sauce and lemon sauce.  Both of these sauces were gloppy and too sweet.  The satay sauce barely tasted of any satay.  The BBQ sausage tasted more of salty kielbasa than any authentic Chiu Chow-style sausage.

Overall, a huge disappointment.  The food was not good and they charged too much for the quality and amount of food you receive.  Service was pretty bad, even considering Chinese restaurant standards.  I definitely won't be back, especially considering the cornucopia of culinary delights Vegas has to offer.  And what's up with the cash only policy?
