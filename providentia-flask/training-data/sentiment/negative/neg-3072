Today was an opportunity for Pizza Fire to shine or it would be our last visit. We had free pizza coupons due to lousy service on our last visit. Not much has changed except for the prices and the menu. Coupon stated unlimited toppings. I found out that fresh mozzarella was not a topping?  So I paid the extra $, scratching my head " if it's not a topping what could it be"? Hey, I was getting a free pizza so $ wasn't a big deal. If you like soggy pizza you would have loved this one. My husband always orders the unlimited or build your own pizza.  Nope, not any more it is off the menu. My husbands pizza was as soggy as mine. Ugh! They were a little more organized than past visits but the pizza needs to improve. Looks like Neapolitan Pizza in the strip mall in front of Costco gets my business with friendly organized staff and a nice crust.
