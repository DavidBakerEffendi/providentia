All and all, just meh. Tapas were undercooked, drinks resembled nothing that was on the menu, and entree's were anything but appetizing. I won't be surprised to find this restaurant on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares one day. Save yourself the time and disappointment, and walk a few steps over to Cheesecake Factory instead.
