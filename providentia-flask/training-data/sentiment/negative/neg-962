really disappointed with the service here. came here for dessert as the Keg didn't have what we wanted. We wanted a booth but because one wasn't available we were left at the high top tables - and we waited for about 40 minutes before someone even came back around even though we asked a few times (which included asking for water.) finally after being ready to walk out after seeing a booth was available we were seated. We asked the server to take our order right away as we've been waiting for a while but he still walked away and took his time coming back.

we placed our order as we already waited but decided never to come back to horrible service like this again.
