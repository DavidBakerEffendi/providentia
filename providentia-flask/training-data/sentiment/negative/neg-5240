Service is terrible and will not recommend this to friends or go back.  We waited 30mins to get a table and ordered brunch.  People who came after us were getting served food which we found odd so we waited another 30mins before finally asking the waiter what was going on with our order.  His response "well it takes a long time to make French Toast in the oven" - 3 tables seemed to get French Toast pretty quickly and 2 of them came in after we got seated.  
Worst service we've seen in a long time.
