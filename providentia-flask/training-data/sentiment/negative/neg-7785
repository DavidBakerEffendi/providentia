Always had neutral experiences here, food is whatever, service was friendly - but will not be going back to this place ever. 

When there is a sports game on, food takes long, I could have cared less about the hour wait, but when the waitress openly argues over what you ordered and then tries to charge you for it, well, that sums it up. Manager just said he knows she has an attitude...  way to be proactive 

Sad thing was, the girl she was training was great and was trying hard - won't ever be back
