I've been to other Sam woos. This probably the worst one out of all. 
The restaurant: filthy
Food: we ordered duck and pork and wonton noodle soup. Duck and pork were old and dried. I thought I was chewing on papers or rubbers. The ducks were hanging by the window looked like there were hung there, starved to their death for days. Wonton was not edible and the soup was cold probably from frozen wonton. Gross. 
Service: below par. 

Bottom line: we will never come back here again. If you don't believe me, try it and find out for yourself.
