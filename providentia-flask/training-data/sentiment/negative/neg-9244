I have tried this place a few times to be supportive of local businesses but it just doesn't cut it. The atmosphere is just plain boring and cheesy the yogurt and toppings are average. I also don't like places that take advantage of teenage employees..... Tips should go to the kids working there not the owners! That is just for starters...need I say more?
