Beware of this place the workers are rude and if you even question why 4 "bays" have been open for 30 minutes and you are quoted a 3 hour wait time, you are told "trust me I work here every day, some one is coming" I hope you never get this type of service. Poor customer service. Don't believe the hype, most of the people on here are probably paid to say good things...
