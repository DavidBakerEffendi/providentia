I went during the CIAA and I hated the food.  The staff was okay. I agree with one of the other post they are too busy trying to date the customers. The best thing about the place is the structure.  I give the layout 5/5 the rest of the place a zero but you would not let me rate it that low.  KEEP YOUR MONEY IN YOUR POCKET For this place.
