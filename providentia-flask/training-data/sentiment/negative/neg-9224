$110 worth of food poisoning! First off, the illness that came afterwards might have been less irritating if the food had been good. Both of us got sick but we ate different meals. One of us had the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and the other had the short rib. The mahi mahi was flavorless with poor texture and the asparagus that came with the fish was flavorless as well. Not even a hint of flavor from the sauce. Very disappointing. The short rib had flavor but it was no better than a pot roast that I can make in a crock pot for $10 for 4 meals. Both entrees were served at or below room temperature, which was surprising since the plates were scalding hot. We had an appetizer of ribs that had great flavor. We also shared some edamame and ended our meal with creme brulee. 30 minutes after eating while walking through a casino, we both became very ill. We ended up having to sit for about an hour while sipping on Sprite to calm our stomachs before we could even move without getting sick. We also had to have peppermint lifesavers to help our stomachs when we didn't have Sprite. The nausea would come and go for the next 3 or 4 hours and we were breaking a fever. We know that it had to be the food at Roy's because it was our first meal of the day. All in all, the food was overpriced and flavorless and to top it all off, we were very ill. We will never eat at another Roy's again and will be telling our friends not to go there...ever.
