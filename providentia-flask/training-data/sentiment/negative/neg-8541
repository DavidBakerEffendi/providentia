Now, I have finally had the worse Chinese food I've ever had. 

I normally will not come to Pei Wai for Chinese food. I happened to be in the area and didn't have anything for lunch. I was pretty hungry when I walked in. I was thinking ... It has been a while since I've been to Pei Wei. Let's see what has changed. 

Apparently they change from bad to worse. I ordered a beef dish with dynamite flavor. It "looks" good until I took a bite in my mouth. The beef was fried so much that there was hardly any meat in it. I felt like I was chewing on rubber. The flavor is so soar that I could hardly bite into it. You wouldnt think they could mess up the white rice right? Wrong. It was dry and cold. 

I couldn't believe what I just ate. Yelpers...if you want authentic Chinese food, please please go somewhere else. That isn't Chinese food...
