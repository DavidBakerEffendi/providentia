This happened yesterday, Thursday October 22nd 2015. My sister made a reservation for 8pm. My aunts and my cousin arrived at 7:55pm. The hostess, a petite young woman in a black pencil skirt and a lacy cropped tank top told them, "We're just waiting for a table to clear." There was a table nearby and no one was sitting there. It just hasn't been cleared or wiped yet. A few moments later, I arrive. My aunts tell me to ask the hostess what's going on. I approach her and she tells me, "We're just waiting for someone to clear the table." Two men arrive at the table and clear it. My sister arrives and we all sit in the waiting area, waiting to be seated. At this point, the table still hasn't been wiped and we haven't been seated. I look at my watch and its 8:14pm. What's the point of having a reservation if it's not going to be honored at its scheduled time? We approach the hostess and tell her we're leaving because we have been kept waiting too long. The hostess stares blankly and looks at the desk. She doesn't apologize. We're all pretty unimpressed by her behavior and leave.

I have worked in the food service industry for 14 years. Perhaps the hostess was having a bad day, is new or maybe she just didn't care. She's human, she's allowed to have weaknesses but then I beg the question, is that the kind of employee you want representing your restaurant? Your restaurant lost a bill for 5 people yesterday and I will tell everyone I know about my experience. Maybe that will inspire your employee to be a bit more empathetic and helpful to the next customers she serves. I hope no one else receives the lack of service we did last night.
