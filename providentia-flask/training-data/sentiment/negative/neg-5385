How this place has such good reviews is beyond me. Where to begin? 

The hollandaise on the eggs benedict tasted more like chicken soup than hollandaise sauce. The pancakes, which are comically large, are so sugary and mushy, adding even a little maple syrup nearly threw me in a diabetic coma (I'm not diabetic, either). 

And the place smells SO BAD. Obviously built sometime in the 70s, the owners opted for carpet. Carpet in a restaurant is always a terrible, terrible idea, as it soaks up everything, for all of time. 

I absolutely do not recommend Peppermill.
