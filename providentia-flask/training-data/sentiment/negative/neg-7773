For the reputation of the casino, this is a horrible place to eat! 
You will feel you are eating at a high school cafeteria! No variety and you can taste the bad quality right after you finished your lunch/dinner! 
They include free alcohol but that's bud lights or the cheapest wine you be ever had!!
Avoid it at any cost!
