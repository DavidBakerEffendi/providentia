Major disappointment.

After salivating for months waiting to try these crepes I finally got the chance about a week ago. We ordered to go
3 cheese crepes
1 Nutella crepe
2 chipotle beef paninis 

Cons
-We called ahead and still had to wait an extra 20
minutes for our order to be ready (even though there was no one else in the restaurant)
-our order was not correct when we finally did receive it
-the crepes were soggy and had no flavor 
-small portion sizes
-our total came to over $60  a ridiculous price for very little mediocre food and 
Pro
-the staff was very nice 

I wish I could give this place more stars, but it was terrible. Sadly we will not be returning.
