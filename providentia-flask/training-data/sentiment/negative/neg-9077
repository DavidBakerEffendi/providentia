Terrible customer service! I made reservations for 12 people and when I arrived, they said that they gave away the table because they didn't see my name on the list. When I questioned them, It turns out that they looked at the wrong day. Instead of trying to accommodate my request, they said that I would have to wait for an hour for the next available table. They didn't call back until 2 1/2 hours later...

I would not recommend this place. It is too crowded, disorganized and they do not value their customers.
