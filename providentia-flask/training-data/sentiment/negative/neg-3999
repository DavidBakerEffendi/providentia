Food is good here.  However you will wait 30 minutes minimum if you order carry out when you get there.   It wasn't until I asked for a refund at 30 minutes that they offered me some soup.

Also check your order because they gave me the wrong order and I had to drive back.  It would be another 5 to 10 to fix my order.  That's when I just asked for a refund, got it and left.
