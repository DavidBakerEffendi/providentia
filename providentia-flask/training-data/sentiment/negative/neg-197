As a father of three baseball players, I remember how excited the city was when Big League Dreams took over the old Freedom Park area near downtown.  

Since then, we've played their hundreds of times and the novelty has worn off.  They don't provide temporary fences for youth teams, so little 9 yr olds play with the same 300+ foot fences.  

Families are forced to spend hundreds of dollars in gate fee and overpriced concessions.   

Poorly supervised beer sales leads to people drinking at 10am youth baseball games and being belligerent and drunk by noon.  I've witnessed babies crawling around next to half full pitchers of beer on the ground.  

Today was the kicker.  We had the first baseball game of the day and the place was empty.  We talked to the staff and told them that the local Vegas Little League team would be playing on ABC.  The staff said they would turn it on for us. 

Suddenly in the last inning, they turned the channel.  They were turning channels and left it on the TV Guide.  When the whole place asked for the game back on, the lady said somebody had requested the football game.   The preseason football game?!?

We asked the few tables around us but all wanted the Little League World Series.  The staff would not change it back.  

Wow!!  The kids on the Little League World Series team all play at BLD.  A little support for the home town team on national TV would've been nice.
