Really wanted to like this place.. tried this place 4 times and 2 different location. Always slow and where ever I go,  I always ask for "super well done crispy fries". (Dont know how to be any clearer) comes out regular.  Burger taste like its been "sandbaged" (cooked ahead of time to help them serve faster) Just not my spot.. but the chicken club was very tasty.  The only place I've found close to Chick-fil-a ....fresh chicken sandwich
