I used to love tsuki since it had great food but the service was always iffy. What happened tonight though pretty much ended it for me. 

My friend booked a table for 16 people two weeks in advanced and received electronic confirmation for it right away. However when I came in tonight to find them, I saw another group sitting where we were supposed to. The whole group ended up getting shafted to a few booths on side and these booths clearly weren't meant to seat this many people.

Turns out they "lost" the reservation so no arrangements were ever made. A few of us were still standing, with nowhere to sit and growing hungrier by the minute. The waitress came back and offered to seat some of us on the other side of the restaurant. Obviously we wouldn't want to be split up all around the restaurant so we ended up going to 3 Brewers instead.

It may not have been the waitresses fault or w.e But whoever was in charge of the reservation needs to fix themselves. The staff here is clearly very disorganized. Sadly I won't be coming back here until I start hearing better things about their service.
