I hope my bad experience will give insight on why not to go to this thai location! Out of , around 5 thai cuisines, unfortunately we chose this one and we totally regret it. We are first among 10 other groups who took a seat and was last to receive food, after several times probing them, for which they answered with one word: "first-come-first-serve". We were never approached until we received food (which felt hours!) and finally we were charged with a flat 20% gratuity (we are a party of 4!). We asked them why and they responded with what we call "text-book definition of racism". The answer being: "we added the gratuity because we thought that a person, who was here before did not tip us, happen to look like you" and the bad part is the woman still argues about it! The way they answered our questions and the way behaved is in-explicable, and totally spoiled our mood! I am attaching the bill here for you to have a look! Don't get fooled with all positive reviews, there are many genuinely great thai cuisines around to try!
