This place is a disgrace on the original panera or paradise cafe. I know airport food is insipid and service is bad but never knew it was rude too. I was boarding a late flight with only this place open. I went and saw their menu to be pretty similar to panera and she told me they have a partnership with panera. My mom wanted something fruity so she said the strawberry smoothie is good. After discussion that it is from a mix and not fresh strawberries, i still ordered to realize they didnt have enough to make one. Why promise if you cant deliver?

Next i ordered a mac and cheese (i ordered full, she rang me for half). Then later i stoof for 15 min waiting for it. Saw a man come in who's sandwich they had forgotten. I reminded them twice about my mac and cheese. She went to the freezer, got a packages bag, heated it and gave it to me in a small. I was skeptical if it was full but thats ok. On tasting it was sooooper cold. I went back to the cashier and she took it back and blamed me for not having the receipt to process a refund as they didnot have another mac and cheese. I said i ordered full when i came to know they DIDNO HAVE full and gave me half. Again, why promsie if you cant deliver?

The staff is pretty rude and comical. A disgrace on the otherwise ok restaurant.
