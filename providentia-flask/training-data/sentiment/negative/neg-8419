As we walked in, I witnessed an awkward encounter where they had charged  someone for something they didn't pay for and contemplated whether to tell them or not. After five minutes I finally got to order. I'm a simple girl and I only like ketchup mustard and cheese on my burger. Of course there is pickles and no ketchup so I had to go back tell them and  wait another five minutes for a burger. My S.O. had to wait so we can eat together and his burger bun was completely stale ...gross.  Maybe there is some new staff but it's kind of annoying when they ask you the same thing five times.
