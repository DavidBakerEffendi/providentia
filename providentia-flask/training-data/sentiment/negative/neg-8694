I only shop this Smiths when I need to pick up something quickly. I purchased a small container of Waldorf salad at the deli. Took it home and gave it to a family member. They took one bite of it and spit it out. It had been sitting in the deli case too long, the fruit went bad and wreaked of alcohol. I returned it to the store and got my money back. I told the attendant it was really old. He threw it away and refunded my money. I would suggest the deli be notified so this doesn't happen to anyone else. I'll never buy anything from that particular deli again. Normally I shop at the S. Buffalo store. I will drive the extra few miles there from now on 
knowing I will get fresh food and good customer service.
