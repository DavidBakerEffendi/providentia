College students work here and it makes one wonder who's promoting the high ratings?  Was there the other night and was highly disappointed with the Pizza and the service.  The large pizza had maybe three small pieces of sausage and way too many grilled onions.  There was a 40 min. wait so they told us to wait at their bar next door.  It was happy hour and the menu said white wines for $5, so I ordered the house chardonnay.  When I got my bill it was $28 for two chardonnay's.  When I inquired about the price I was told that the Chardonnay was not on Happy Hour and even though the menu listed Chardonnay's from $8 to $14 they only stocked one wine which cost $14/glass.  What trickery to make money.  They should have told me that the wines listed on their menu were not stocked.  Fraudulent practice.
