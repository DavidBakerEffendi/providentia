We found this place in our hotel book. Thankfully we decided to drive to the restaurant instead of ordering takeout. We went to sit down and my mom noticed a huge cockroach under the table. The refrigerator had no door. And there were boxes stacked up on tables and all over up against the walls in the restaurant. Needless to say we got out quick!! Glad we saw the condition of the place before we ordered any food. This place should be closed down. Feel so sorry for all the people ordering takeout but have no idea where their food is coming from.
