What can I say? Yes, one star. That's because the waiter runs out the door after taking my order. A new guy comes on and doesn't even offer me a glass of water with piping hot food. Every time I go here it's another disappointment. Bottom line is that the service is terrible, the food is mediocre and the prices are high. And to top it all off, a few things were on my check that I never received.  At this point, I didn't even want the food anymore. I just told the cashier and she deducted it from the bill. Sam Woo and I will probably never meet again. Ill go to the $14 buffet first instead of dealing with this place again. Three strikes and your out.
