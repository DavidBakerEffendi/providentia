Let me add to the chorus of bad reviews as I eat my pad thai. Stopped in for late lunch as I was starving and wanted a fast thai fix.

Pad thai was barely passable, lacks any colour or vegetables aside from bean sprouts (menu board pic has peas... no peas given) entire plate of food just drenched in sauce. On the plus side there was an acceptable amount of chicken compared to other reviews.

As another review noted the self serve sauces were a sad sight. Bottles filthy and mostly empty... probably the same way since last reviewer's comments! The fountain pop was out of order.

Lone staff member looks ready to end it all. I get it that this isn't a dream job but at least pretend to be interested in the food you're serving me. Large TV screen mounted on wall, plastic still on it, coldy turned off, no entertainment or news while you eat your food in this depressing, spacious, dead dining room.

Everything about this place screams disappointment.
