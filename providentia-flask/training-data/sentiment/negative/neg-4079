This is one of our family's favorite Tuesday night value menu splurges. Tonight, however, the experience was HORRIFIC! 
There were a pair of young women vaping, clouds of vape, in the restaurant... and instead of addressing it, the employees either ignored it or socialized with the girls. When I came to the counter, I was told "I know, they've been here a long time, maybe they'll be done soon."

MANAGEMENT: Please have employees keep the dining facility a clean healthy enjoyable place to eat!
