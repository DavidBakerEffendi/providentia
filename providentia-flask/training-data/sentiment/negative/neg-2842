Not even 'okay' food. I would not eat here again.

My sliders consisted of: hard bread, thin burger meat, a pickle in the burger and a pickle on top of the burger. So strange. McDonalds would have tasted better.
I also ordered the Cesar. It tasted bitter with too much added kale, and they didn't even mix the dressing into the salad. 
We  had to wait 30 minutes+ for our food on a day they weren't busy.

There are so many options on the strip. I would not recommend this place.
