I was so excited about this place opening and went there and they couldn't understand that I wanted my chai tea iced . Gave me the chai tea warm and a cup of ice . Any other place I go I can get it large and with ice . The staff isn't friendly either . They seem as if they don't want to be there and I'm bugging them coming in and ordering what I want . I will not be going back to this location . Very sad since it's right by my house . :(
