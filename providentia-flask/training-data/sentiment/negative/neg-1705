I finally tried the new concept Field Kitchen for lunch today. I will miss eating at Sweet Tomatoes. What an utter failure of a concept. The decor and uniforms were an improvement. The cleanliness was improved. On to the food. The lettuce was wilted and soft. There were hard pieces of core and rib in the lettuce. The veggies had no flavor. The once flavorful brocolli salad was gross. The soup was the same. The dressing on the side let me avoid the swirling tossed salad thing. The girls working the beverage station were blank faced and bored. The bread was dry and stale. The music was loud and the light bulbs on the tables seared your eyes with a photgraphic effect meaning you just had to stare down at your plate. The chocolate frozen yogurt was SO bitter that we threw it away immediately. What an complete miss. Sweet Tomatoes has erred with this concept. It will NOT succeed unless they find a completely different clientelle. When I checked out, the card was still full from a previous users order. Five girls standing in the front and not one said goodbye or thanks. No one asked us how anything was. The food had no flavor whatsoever. Piles of salt didn't even help. Methinks they eliminated the MSG they swore they never used. DO NO bother even going to this new Field Kitchen if you are looking for the Sweet Tomatoes experience. The managers stand around looking useless and don't even pretend to offer customer service. The female hispanic manager is the worst cust. service provider I have ever met. They kept the creepy back of the house worker that is interested ONLY in staring at women and making us uncomfortable. Arrowhead will miss having a salad bar. I will not return to this terrible, terrible excuse for its former self. Sweet Tomatoes should fire whoever designed this debachle.
