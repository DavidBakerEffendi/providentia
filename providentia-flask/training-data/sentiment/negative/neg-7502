Came at 12:15 for lunch.  No steak.  My husband doesn't eat any of their meats except the steak.  We were told we could wait twenty minutes for them to make more.  There was enough "left" to make one scrawny taco that cost five dollars for steak, cheese, and sour cream.  Unacceptable.  We won't be back unless something seriously improves.
