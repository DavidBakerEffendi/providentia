Not sure why everyone is so in love with this. The price is steep (at least $40), most of the seafood they have is available on the finer buffets in town (Bellagio, Wynn) with the exception of lobster. The other buffets have wider variety and higher quality food, and I won't be coming back to the Village Seafood Buffet.

Everyone needs to know that buffet lobster isn't all that special. It sits in a steam tray, it's overcooked and is so disappointing that you risk falling out of love with Lobster.
