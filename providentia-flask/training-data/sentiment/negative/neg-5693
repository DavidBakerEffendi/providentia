Do NOT eat here.  It made mt wife sick!

Service was OK... but what do you expect when the place is mostly empty.  Went here due to Chantal's rave review of the place and we were left wondering if she actually went here, or if it was somewhere else.  The prices were OK... beer was OK... Wings were not great, I've had worse, I've had better.  My wife had the Caesar Chicken wrap from which she had to remove the "chicken" because in her words "it doesn't feel or taste like real chicken.  It seems synthetic - like Tofu."  She was sick to her stomach later.

Just to take it a step further - other than having a green theme in the decor, I couldn't figure out what was Irish about the place.  There were only 2 Irish beers on tap - The standard Guiness & Harp - the rest was mostly Molson's crap.  There was nothing on the "menu", a laminated sheet of paper printed in green, that would indicate anything Irish.  Not even an Irish stew.

Like I said... don't go here. :-(
