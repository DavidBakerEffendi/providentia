My husband and I were so disappointed in this restaurant! We had made a reservation for Thanksgiving dinner. The first table the hostess attempted to seat us at was crammed in the bar right on top of the adjoining table. We asked for something different and we were rudely forced to wait. Once we were finally seated, we were ignored by the wait staff for 15 minutes before someone stopped to ask if we wanted a beverage, but we had no beverage menu. I guess we were supposed to just guess at what was available. Again, we were ignored by the wait staff over and over and over again while they hustled around to the surrounding tables. When our waiter finally realized we had been there over 30 minutes without so much as a greeting, he did apologize but he continued to pay extra attention to every other table but ours. The meal was buffet, and every time we went in for a serving - the dishes were cold and empty! We waited time and time again for more dishes to be brought out but almost everything was cold in the serving trays. Oh, and the prime rib was RAW! I love Rare prime rib - but this was RAW! Save your money! We $150 for 2 people and it was not worth the money! If you were looking for very subpar food and service - by all means enjoy. My husband will not be returning. Ever.
