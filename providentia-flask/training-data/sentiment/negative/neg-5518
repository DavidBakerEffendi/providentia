It always seems to amaze me coming to this location! 
I love filibertos and this location is around the corner from where I live however it offers the slowest service ever! On average when I go through the drive thru it takes  anywhere from 10-20 minutes absolutely unacceptable. At times there is only 2 cars in front of me or less and the wait is horrible. I really do not recommend this location at all. I order bean and cheese burritos and I swear every time I get them they get smaller and smaller for a 5 year old child. The tortilla is crunchy or burnt half the time but I give the the opportunity to prove me wrong and some times they do a great job but most of the time they fail!
