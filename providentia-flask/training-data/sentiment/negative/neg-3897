Stopped here because a friend was really excited to experience it. 

Strike one: the waitress led us to a table that was being reserved by another waitress. They had a hissed exchange, while my party hovered near a bridal party. Awkward. 

Strike two: we had to share menus. The restaurant was not packed, and yet we were told there was a "menu shortage." Annoying. 

Strike three: we had to wait a really long time between ordering drinks and ordering food. Since we ordered one of the goblet drinks, with our water, we started getting sick to our stomachs before our food came. 

Strike four: the food came at different times. One of us ate and finished the soup portion of a soup & salad before the rest of us got anything. Once that first got her entree salad, the steak was not as she ordered it (medium rare vs bleeding) and had to be sent back. So she didn't eat until the rest of us were finished.

I was staring at the man who appeared to be the manager and hoped he stopped by to ask us about our visit. The man who cleared our plates and refilled our drinks was really sweet though. I'm not sure if this place is used to dealing with inebriated folks who think it okay to wait a half hour for a tuna melt, or if the wait staff only cares when there is a celebrity present. But I would skip it if I were you.
