I have been coming to this breakfast place for years and today I experienced the worst service I have received in quite some time at a restaurant. My girlfriend and I waited almost 30 minutes for a take out order. We quietly stood by the pickup counter patiently waiting and there were three associates that would periodically look over at us but didn't even bother to ask what we were waiting on. After 30 minutes go by I finally ask if our order is done and its over on the other side of the counter just waiting to be bagged up. Working in the kitchen I know it doesn't take thirty minutes to make eggs and the associates should have been courteous and asked what we had been waiting on. They bagged our food and handed it over to us with no sorry  or apologies . I am never coming back to this restaurant unfortunately and I will be sure to tell my friends. I hope that the manager reflects on this from a customer perspective.
