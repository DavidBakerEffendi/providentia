NEVER book a booth here!!

I came here for a friend's birthday. We booked a booth for this occasion. While I enjoyed their company the whole booth experience was absolutely unsatisfactory.

The booth was uncomfortable and too tiny for us. Menu had a $50 mix and match 3-course meal and you have to order the whole thing. Food quality was mediocre at best (see attached pics) and surely not worth the money. Steak was dry and tasted like it was microwaved. Chicken wings tasted like KFC but without the herbs and spices. To make matters worse they made us pay cover charge for 2 people who did not show up even though the booth was barely fitting us and if those 2 people showed up they would have had no place to sit!

I absolutely do not recommend that you book a booth at this lounge. Just drink and dance.
