Horrible service! Won't ever be coming back to this location our waitress (Amy) took forever to take my family's order and took forever to bring out the check also forgot to bring out a whole flavor of wings and she even wrote down the order. Like how did you forget? She didn't even ask if we wanted refills and our cups were obviously empty. Also told her I wanted my appetizer with the rest of my food and my loaded fries were cold, horrible experience!!!
