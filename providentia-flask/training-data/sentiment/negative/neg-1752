Went for a wedding as a guest, bought 8-10 drinks for myself (vodka and cranberries) felt little to no buzz. Either very weak drinks or watered down liquor. Very unhappy with that. The food was good but the chicken seemed a little undercooked (I wasn't the only one to notice this..). The owner went up to the bride during the reception and told her the balance, I don't believe that was the right thing to do either. Way to be all about money.
