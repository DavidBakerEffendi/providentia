Arrived at 11am and our room reservation could not be found using our conformation code. Waited to determine the issue and continued to wait amongst others while people passed by. They eventually switched us to palazzo when we were originally booked at the Venetian. Once we were at palazzo some of our room keys didn't work this happened not once not twice but three times. Walking back and forth from the hotel room back to the lobby..... I was even more unhappy because the palazzo is more of a walk to the center of the strip. I enjoy staying in Vegas throughout my summer vacation, but I will not ever be staying at Venetian/Palazzo or do I recommend my friends to book their rooms here. I prefer Cosmo or Caesars. At least they don't lose my reservation.. Or do I have to wait an hour just to check into my room.
