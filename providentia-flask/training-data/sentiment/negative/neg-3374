Take out shouldn't be that hard. But "you always get screwed at the drive through" applies here. Yeah I walked in to get it, but the result is the same. 

Order brown rice to go with the Szechuan dish - NOT in the bag. Really? It's part of the order - not in addition to - PART of the order. 

Want some soy sauce - NOT in the bag 

The Szechuan chicken - so-so and cold 

I'm home - not driving back 

Dine in I guess - so you can hold them accountable for what you've ordered.
