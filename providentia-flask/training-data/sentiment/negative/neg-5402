To start, I love CPK. I have been to multiple locations and the food is always great, same with service. This location? Not so much. We waited 15-20 mins just to get bread and finally our drinks, then took about another 15 for anyone to come and take our actual order. I am actually still sitting here waiting for our order and even asked for more bread and nobody has yet to be here. I am extremely disappointed at this location and the service here. 

To sum it all up, DO NOT waste your time going here. Go elsewhere at the Biltmore (cheesecake factory, etc), this location is absolutely dreadful.
