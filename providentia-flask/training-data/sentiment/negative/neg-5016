If I could leave a comment without a star I would. Dr. Su offers numbing gel for a cleaning so that she can use a drill for cleaning instead of a ultrasonic tool. The dentist cleans teeth instead of a licensed hygienist like most ethical practices and digs into your mouth like she is digging for gold. I was in pain for 3-5 days after my cleaning. I received a call 24 hours prior to my appointment to confirm the appointment for the following day and I cancelled the appointment and informed them I will not be returning due to unethical practices and they still sent me a $25 missed appointment fee when I had already cancelled the appointment 24-hours prior! I have reported her offices to the Nevada Board of Dental Examiner and the Southern Nevada Dental Association.
