two of the eight reviews here so far are shills... can you figure them out? 

to one... you've only been there four times? I'm sure you've picked up more shifts than that. to the other... contrary to your multiple experiences, i didn't feel so clean inside, especially after finding a rapanzuel-length hair in the cantaloupes. 


my 2 cents: run... don't walk and don't ever look back.


Update: shills are now being filtered, but not forgotten.
