We came to Jack's Deli on a busy weekend morning. Waits were long and service was really poor. 

Our server quickly took our order and left, came back with the food and disappeared. Well, disappeared is the wrong word, she seemed overly busy with several large tables and never once returned to ours. We waited several minutes and hoped that we could catch her eye, but instead just jumped up and started wandering around to other tables to ask if they were finished with their condiments.

For a breakfast place, you would there would be staples on all tables - silverware, ketchup, syrup, etc. Or that you'd be able to flag down a server in a reasonable amount of time to get what you needed. But I guess this places takes a DIY approach. I only mentioned this, because if you do come here, make sure to get up from your table immediately. Breakfast food gets cold fast and decreases in quality as it does.

Or maybe, just at this restaurant, because it is extremely drafty. We left our coats on, and so did most of the other patrons.

The food was decidedly "OK" and seemed to be cooked adequately. Portions are fairly big and the menu is expansive.

My other complaint is that  instead of having someone come clear a table and carry those dishes into the back room, they just push a cart filled with dirty dishes and food scraps around the dining room and clear off each table, sometimes right next to your table.Since the tables are so close, you can get a really good view of what menu items are popular based on what other patron's have left on their dirty plates.

Not recommended.
