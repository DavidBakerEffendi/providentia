I don't know where to start my review. Came with my husband for brunch and had to wait 20 min for a table. More than enough time to see how the kitchen runs. Service is slow and food didn't come at a regular pace.
The fridge at the back exposes a number of "no name" brand containers where allegedly dairy products are stored; from margarine to creams. I suspected those were used as containers. I was able to confirm it wasn't real dairy when my "buttermilk" pancakes arrived with some edible oil topping instead of butter. Couldn't taste the buttermilk flavor either and the blueberries weren't bleeding which made me think we're frozen no name brand blueberries.
I have to say this happened 50 min later because as I mentioned before service was very slow and mediocre not even asking how we liked our food. Hubby attempted to eat eggs with an "hollandaise" sauce that had a vinegary after taste. He then tried to eat the homemade fries, lukewarm and cooked only on one side with so called caramelized onions. 
Wanted to try a place with good reviews on this side of the city but this is not the place to go. In case my review isn't clear, I do not plan to come back to this place that cuts corners and their only good reviews are for the exposed brick wall.
