It was pretty dead in there. I ordered from a girl, she also cooked the food. I ordered penne pesto w chicken. For one I am not a health inspector but the hoods were filthy, that's dripping on your food, pizza ovens were dusty, the beer display under glass. was dirty.... some guy was just hanging out.... and some guy was snaking the drain walking in and out of the kitchen. And I noticed all of this because I waited for my food 20 minutes. Not what I was expecting. Who knows the pizza might be good. I don't think Ill find out for myself however.
