Another cheap Chinese food restaurant. Ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, doesn't come with anything but rice and chicken. Had to ask for vegetables which costed extra. My chicken was literally swimming in sauce with hardly any veggies and they forgot to give me my rice which is a huge part of the entree. There sauce wasn't very good either. I'm sorry but they get 1 Star from me.
