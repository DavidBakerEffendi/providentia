Absolutely ridiculous. We sat down and got drinks immediately. They didn't have brandy and then couldn't make daiquiris. So bummed. We sat and talked for about 25 min. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally the waiter came back and we asked for the check. Then he was MIA for another 25 min. 

We went up to the  bar and asked if we could pay there, and they said no!! He came hurrying over and grabbed my card and then..no joke.. disappeared again!! We found the manager and complained to him and then the waiter came hurrying out from behind the back again. 

I am in shock. This place has awesome atmosphere and delicious drinks. Hate go give it such a bad review but it truly ruined my night. At least there was good jazz music!
