Horrible service. Went in to buy a matcha iced tea and matcha smoothie for take out. We sat in a booth and waited for it arrive, and when it did, I was still on my phone and I told him I'll just be sitting for another minute, the one the staff rudely told me I could wait a minute by the door. Are you serious? Maybe if I didn't buy anything sure, but after spending $10 on drinks I think you could let me finish whatever I was doing on my phone. Their Ramen is mediocre at best as well. Do yourself a favour and go to Kinton Ramen down the road.
