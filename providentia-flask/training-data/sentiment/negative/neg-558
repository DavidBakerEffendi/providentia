The sushi and drinks were good but, I think the server gave us chicken based soup even after we made it clear we were vegan. Gave me cream based dipping sauce for hibachi. I looked up the soup I was given, the closest thing is chicken based. Very upset by that. To have a guest specifically ask about vegan food and bring non vegan is wrong. Probably will not be back.
