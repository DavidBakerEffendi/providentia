I wish I could give no stars to this restaurant. 

Me and my friend visited this restaurant for a Friday lunch. The moment we were seated, we were served with a bottle of water. 

And the gentleman who came to take the order didn't give us any menu but said stuffs in words. Just because we know what biryani means it doesn't mean we have come to eat only biryani. 

With out choice, We ordered chicken biryani and mutton biryani. It took almost 30 min to get the dish to our table. The moment I ate, I realised rice and meat were burnt and I could feel the sour salty taste. I thought it was bad only for couple of spoons. But, After having 3-4 spoons I was done. Food was edible enough to eat. 

I called him and explained it's burnt and the plate was left with 75% of food and taste is very bad. And not even close to eatable condition. He said it ll be corrected next time and went away. He didn't even offer to change to diff food or not to charge anything. 

My friend had chicken biryani, and we couldn't explain how you can open a restaurant this bad. We just paid the bill and moved out. 

I am sorry to say, but I don't see this restaurant survive for another month with this kind of service. 

I would never ever come back to this restaurant and I could still feel the sour taste even after a week. IF YOUR EVER THOUGHT ABOUT VISITING, FORGET IT.

Note : Don't build fake reviews just for the sake of luring customers.
