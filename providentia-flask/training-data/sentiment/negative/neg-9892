Chilis is going downhill with their choices. First they get rid of Caesar salads for the fresco salads, then they get rid of a rewards program that actually was good with a program that while adds more places (if you shop those places) but costs twice as much to get any rewards, and now they get rid of the 2 for $20. Instead of the 2 for $20 they have a new 3 for $10.99 which includes an app and a mini molten cake desert. While this is good for singles or good for couples that don't both want off the 2 for $20, this new program is far more expensive. Not only is it $1.98 more expensive off the bat, but under the apps it no longer allows chips and guacamole without a surcharge. It also costs a minimum $2 extra for the sirloin which used to fall under the 2 for $20. If a couple wants this deal, but only wants 1 app, you can't even combine to 2 apps to save the $2 guacamole charge even though they save an entire appetizer price. Also some entrees no longer come with all their sides that they use to (mango chili chicken no longer comes with rice). They do still have the 2 for $35 that covers the old 2 for $20 just with 2 margaritas  (if both are able to drink, ie not working later). Highly unlikely to return to chilis with how their decisions are going. Good budget dining this is not!
