Oh no! I loved Thai House so it sinks my heart to write this review. 

About a month ago we went for our usual. We ordered from the very stoic waitress (we usually have great service but she had the grating demeanor of an annoyed teenager). My husband decides to go to the bathroom only to be greeted by a few cockroaches running around the stall.

Now, I have worked in restaurants, I know they aren't hermetically sealed and bugs get in. But even a few German cockroaches (the small reddish ones) are usually a sign of infestation. 

So he goes to the waitress and very quietly and politely (so other patrons are spooked) tells her that there are roaches in the bathroom and that management might want to know. Her response? "Why?" What? Why? What do you mean 'why'? Is this an existential question?

She calls management and they start arguing back and forth with my husband standing there. No one acknowledges him, apologizes, anything. So after a few minutes he just lets them know we are cancelling our order and leaving.

So, the possible infestation is a concern but I could always hope they would address it and I would return after a little while. They do have great food. Although, we felt that the way they treated it was not very professional and because of this, we will probably not be back.
