Five hours later, can I have my night back? It was like being trapped in a time warp. I was a prisoner of dinner. We arrived at 5:30p for what was supposed to be a 5 course Cajun dinner. The first course came out close to 7p followed by another course every 40 minutes. We left before the last course arrived because we got a baby sitter for dinner not infinity. We left at 10:30p because we couldn't stay any longer. The crawfish were boiled with zero seasoning and no corn on the cob only massive potatoes and not red skins. The whole ordeal cost us $60 a couple but I would've paid him $100 If I could've left by 8p What can only be described as the longest and simultaneously the worst dining experience I've ever been a part of. I really wish I could put into words how upsetting and ridiculous this dinner was. I'll never be back. I don't understand how they have a business. No paper towels in the bathroom. A patron got locked in the bathroom and they had to take the door handle off leaving a whole in the bathroom door. We asked for hot sauce, they had to check if they had any and brought out a small souffl√© with some Tabasco sauce in it... Cajun? Nah, CAGED IN! Just don't.
