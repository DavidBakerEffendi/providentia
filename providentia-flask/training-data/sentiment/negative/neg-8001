** Warning Warning**
They came in to clean our hoods and did a terrible job. Then 3 days later a $1000 motor burnt up due to them flooding the motor and using a chemical that ate through the bearing. They refused to fix it. What kind of terrible business practice is this. You have been warned to stay away !!
