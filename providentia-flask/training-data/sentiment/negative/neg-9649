Let me start off by saying that my review is based on the experience I received with a group of my friends..we all had the WORST experience at this food truck a few nights back. The man was so rude and unprofessional. Waited over an hour for our food, the food was cold, the frys tasted like fish (cooking oil had clearly not beem changed), and he "forgot" to bring out the other half of our group's order, he said it was ready and would bring it right in..25 minutes later, we go outside to see what's going on, and he yelled and cussed is out, slammed the window closed in our face (mid sentence). I did not wait this long, pay so much (including a tip that I wished I didn't give), to be treated the way we did. To sum it up, he only refunded half our money (stating that "our f*cking money won't make his night), we never got the rest of our food, and ended up throwing away the food we did get. I don't know how much more unprofessional you can get. Terrible experience..buyers beware.
