The food is disgusting and the owner and staff are soooooo RUDE! 

I order the the lox $8.75 the salmon was translucent, oily, stale and inedible  don't even want to know how old it was.

I also ordered the early bird sandwich $5 which included a microwaved square of pre frozen eggbeaters, 1 small piece of microwaved bacon, a soggy tomato, topped w a scoop of brown avocado squished between two tiny pieces of old bread. 

The staff is extremely unorganized, the kitchen is dirty and the food is awful. Will NEVER return!
