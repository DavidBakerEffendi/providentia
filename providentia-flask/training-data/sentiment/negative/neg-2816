Yo, I never have complaints with no body no how, but I went into this little ceasers last night. I know they were about five min from close, i asked for. Peproni pizza. Some curly headed Richard face told me they couldnt becuase it was too close to close. First of all i work in food. That doesn't matter. Second I let that go because I clear wasn't gunna get my delicious extra peproni, wings, and Italian cheese bread. So i just took the boring ass plain cheese and stale bread sticks. Then I try to pay with a gift card, my mother brought it for me, so I knkw it has money on it. I mean its my mother a sweet old lady, but anyways it wasnt working in the card reader said it was an error. I asked him to enter it manualy, this mother freaker told me there was no way possible to do that and walked away. I shall not return to this location, which sucks cuz I walk there quite often, until that curly headed butt wipe no longer works there. Thank you.
