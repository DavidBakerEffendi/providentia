This review is actually for the location on 44th street and Thomas Road in Phoenix. For some it doesn't show up on the map when I search it. Anywho, I've had more than one occasion where I've ordered online for "freaky fast delivery" and have waited over an hour to receive my sandwich. Sadly I will starve before ordering from that location again.
