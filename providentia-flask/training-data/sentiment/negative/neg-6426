Awful service. Took over 30 mins for drinks. Another 30 for food (that was cold). Server never checked on the food or asked us if we wanted another drink. We sat for 10 mins with completely empty plates and drinks. Server literally walked by, saw our table and said "oh krap" AND still didn't come back for 5 mins to clean our plates. For someone who worked at earls for almost 2 years and know why is expected, this did not live up to expectations at all. One more thing, managers were wandering around chatting the entire time and walked by our table numerous times without checking in or helping. Tisk tisk earls.
