Cold food, half the normal portions, and my wife's burrito bowl had no steak meat...just a giant wad of fat. Called to complain and was told that I could come back and they would remake it for me. Yeah...like I'm going to drive back to you. How about remake it and have it delivered to me??? Never eating at this location again. This is the second time I've been burned by this location in the last month. Pull your heads out, chipotle.
