I patronized this place after a year of reprieve. I was disappointed in the changes and service. We had a table with a cocktail  waitress who never showed up. After hunting her down and giving $40 for a 60 bill, she pocketed the cash charged the full amount on the 1 cc given. When questioned she acted like She had no idea of her mistake. The male manager was cocky and unprepared for a professional encounter. Did the owner hire his neighbor??? Locals, don't come here... It's not the same
