I used to love Maize's. Five dollar burger Monday, balsamic French fries, their selection of pizzas and great service. But I went with friends a week ago for the first time since the menu changed and we were all very disappointed. No more balsamic fries, and most of the new menu items sounded awful. I had the chartrucerie appetizer plate and someone else ordered the wings. The were both okay, nothing special.
Our service was awful. We arrived about 15 minutes before happy hour ended but by the time our server came to get our drink order, it was 3 minutes past hh time and we had to pay full price for our beer. Not a big deal, but annoying. Our server was inattentive the rest of the meal.
With so many great places to eat in the Central  Corridor, Our former neighborhood favorite is off our dining list.
