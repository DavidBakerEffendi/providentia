No no I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are plenty of korean dessert cafes with better tasting menus. Their bubble tea or other drink menus taste like poorly made home made style, bingsoo menus are loaded with junky toppings(syrups, bad quality whipped cream, cereal?!!)  And their bar smells like rotted milk..... So... Ya. I would not recommend this place if anyone is looking for a korean dessert in yonge and finch area.
