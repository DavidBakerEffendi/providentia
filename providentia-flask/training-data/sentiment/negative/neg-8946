I used to go to Donna's every now and then and have always had great tasting food.  Yesterday something was off.  When you walk into a bakery the only thing you should expect to smell is the baked goods.  The wonderful smells of the cakes, cupcakes and pastry goods.  That was not what attacked my nose.  I don't know what it was but it smelled like strong perfume.  It ranked up as one of the worst smells I have ever encountered in a restaurant.

Against better judgement I bought something to eat.  I'm blaming the stress from work and the craving to have an Asian pastry as to why I did it.  

As I bit into the pastry all I could think about was the smell and whatever that smell was on the pastry and now I'm eating it.  I couldn't finish it and tossed it.  

Sadly I doubt I will ever return.  Which is a shame because I want to go back and get those steamed buns.
