I honestly loved the feel walking into this diner. They took the time to make it look like you stepped into the past. Really cute. 
That's where it ends with the experience here. It took about an hour for the food to come out. This is after the waitress came back to tell me what I wanted was no longer available. Which honestly cool, but it shouldn't have taken 20 minutes to tell me this. Took 4 whole years for us to get the food when it came out it was flavorless and belly irritating (could be the grease excess). I ordered the eggplant wrap which I thought would be safe but just look at the pictures and tell me what you think. Overall, never will go there even if they are giving away their food. Not being mean just very honest. Tip: bring a strainer to drain your food from the grease before eating.
