You get what you pay for, and $6.99 for a large pizza should have been a sign... but it was after school, kids were hungry, hubby working late, I was doing billing and needed to get a quick fix and not waste the evening in the kitchen...

A frozen pizza would have been better than the flat, greasy, flavorless piece of cardboard I rec'd.  Domino's is right across the street and has deals for $7 that has flavor, or Fresh and Easy practically next door that has decent ones to bake. 

I wish I could give a better review, but wish I had read an honest review first and am giving a heads up to all who are considering it (I didn't check for one first... sorry my fellow yelpers... so I deserved it) 

I love to support the little guys, so trust me, Jesse's Pizza, this hurts me more than it hurts you to say such things :(

FYI the members of our family like everything from 2 crust meaty pizza pie all the way to thin crust veggie... it just has to be worth chewing & swallowing.
