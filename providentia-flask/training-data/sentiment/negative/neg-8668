This review is not specific to this Panda store. It is Panda in general. Do you think we do not realize you just changed take out containers and we are now paying the same price for less food. It is at least a quarter less. The new containers DO NOT stay closed and they leak all over in the bag on the way home. We are going to be done getting Panda take out. I cannot have food leaked all over in my car. It is bad enough that you are trying to cheat by making the container smaller and thinking the pay public is too stupid to notice.
