New owners? Lazy staff? I love Capriotti's cheesesteaks, I order them for the fam on nights we don't have time to cook. The last three times I've ordered through Postmates the order has been cancelled because the merchant is "too busy". The last time this happened my husband drove to the shop and not only were they not busy, they were rude, and messed up our order. 

As a former restaurant owner, and especially in this neighborhood, you should be saying yes to all the business... how long does it take to make a sandwich? Even if it's delayed, there's really no excuse for it to be cancelled, over and over again. After yet another cancelled order, I had Postmates go to a Capriotti's on Sunset and guess what? They were able to complete my order. 

Get your act together, or you'll be another east side business gone by the wayside.
