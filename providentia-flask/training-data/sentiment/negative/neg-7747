Have tried twice to have breakfast here and both times the wait was prohibitive.  Gave up both times and will not try again.  What can one do to eggs to make people want to wait on long lines to eat?

Don't know if this place deserves four or five stars, but not having eaten there, I can only give a one star rating because when you're hungry you should be able to eat.
