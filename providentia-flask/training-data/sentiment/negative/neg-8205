It's a shame about the experience I had this last time.

We wanted to go here after our hike, because we were pretty impressed by some of the food we had on our previous experiences here. They had a pot de creme was that was heavenly and a slider that was on point.

Since we had our dog with us, we decided to call and see if they let dogs eat on the patio.

Me: "Excuse me, do you guys allow small dogs on your patio?"
Sammy's Employee: "Yes! Of course, it shouldn't be a problem."

Well it was a problem.

We arrived and was greeted not by someone asking if they could help us, but someone who wanted to tell us our dog was not allowed. And rather than having it be a conversation to get clarity on their policy (because after all we just called) -- he said that "Sammy's was a restaurant and dogs weren't allowed to eat on the patio because it was a health violation."

Hmmm...

Well how does Lazy Dog Restaurant in Summerlin stay compliant? I saw enough dogs on their patio to merit a shelter.

Thanks, Sammy -- but no thanks. Am totally willing to abide by your policy (whatever you decide that it is) but not willing to be treated rudely or have wanting to get some food from your place be entirely inconvenient.
