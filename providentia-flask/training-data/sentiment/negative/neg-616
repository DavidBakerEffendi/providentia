This cafe rio is a complete mess. This is a franchise, yet their standards are so low. All the workers slowly walk around the back and have no urgency. I waited around 20 minutes for my food, while about 3 workers mindlessly waked around the back. The last time I was here, they were out of pork. This time, I waited a long amount of time for them to make pico de gallo. While this was supposed to be happening, I saw several workers snacking on chips in the back. Currently, I'm standing here waiting for my chips to be done. If I ever eat Caf√© Rio again, I will definitely not be coming back to this location. It is absolutely disgusting to see the workers snacking on the food that they are serving and preparing. It is also insanely unprofessional.
