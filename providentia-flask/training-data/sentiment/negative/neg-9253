I hate to do this, 32 Shea has been a favorite of mine for a long time, but our last two visits have been a total disappointment.  I get when a restaurant doesn't choose to offer gluten free options, it's extra work for the kitchen and it's more expensive and that's fine.  But when gluten free options are offered, the kitchen needs to get it right.  Too much is riding on it.  32 Shea started offering gluten free bread for its sandwiches about a year ago and at first it was great!  The staff was careful and my beloved stacked turkey was fabulous!  Lately though, the bread has been burnt or so cold it's obvious my sandwich was made first and left to sit while the rest of the order was assembled.  The sandwich has been missing avocado or had lettuce I had requested left off.  Today was a deal breaker.  The kid at the cash register couldn't have been out of high school and although I asked him to repeat my order, it came out on regular bread (45 minutes after I ordered it!).  The person who brought it to me told me that the gluten free bread wasn't on the order, but she did take it back.  My husband was done with his sandwich, his muffin, and his coffee by the time my order finally came back...with no avocado and with lettuce I had specifically asked left off.  Look, I know I'm picky, I really have to be, but I try hard to be nice about it and I tip well!  Come on, 32 Shea!  I don't want to give up on you!
