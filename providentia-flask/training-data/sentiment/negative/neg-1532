1) Dining room is so loud, it's roaring.
2) It's too crowded and cramped. 

What happened?  When did Olive Garden turn into Golden Corral?  Went next door to Longhorn and had a meal with my wife in peace. 

To be clear:  I did not try the food or even experience the service. The environment was way too poor to stay.
