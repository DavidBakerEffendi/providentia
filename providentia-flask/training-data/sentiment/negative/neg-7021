We experienced the most obnoxious waiter I've ever had. So horrible that we got up and left the empty outdoor seating area when he walked inside. 

Why was he so bad? He first insisted we couldn't order a drink only and had to eat. Then he told us we could sit down but kept telling us we needed to look at the menu. He said they had Sancerre wine but returned with a bottle of Chablis saying we'd like it just as much. Earlier he said they had no Sauv Blanc but when we refused the bottle of Chablis, they suddenly had SV by the glass!! He quoted prices at "about XX dollars" and we felt we were about to be cheated. 

When he offered regular water, he returned with a glass bottle then told us it didn't matter. I assume he meant the price shouldn't bother us. 

We literally ran away!
