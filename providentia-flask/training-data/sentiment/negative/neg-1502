Pretty sad. Showed up 20 min before closing and planned on getting the food to go. Good thing because they gave us 0 say in the matter. Nachos had movie theatre style cheese on them and a spoon full of retried beans. Terrible. All the carne was burnt (3 vampiros, 4 Street tacos), the burrito was cold and stuffed with sour cream and refried beans. When we could find a piece of carne it was burnt. Pretty bad experience and kind of upset I blew $22 here especially after seeing the 4.5 star total.
