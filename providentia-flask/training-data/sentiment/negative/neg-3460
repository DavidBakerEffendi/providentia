Before you eat here, know that there's a Starbucks just up the way, and a Sbarro just across from it. Both are better options, kids. 

I was attracted to the idea of freshness, but that's not at all what I got. My turkey and pesto panini was salty, and although they had grilled it it was still cold. Very unappealing and gross. For an $8 sandwich, I expected a lot more. 

There are very few food options in this terminal, but believe me when I say you're better off eating at any other than Fresh Attractions.
