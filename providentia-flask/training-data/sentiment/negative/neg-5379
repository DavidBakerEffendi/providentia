We have visited this restaurant many times and have always enjoyed it. Also have been in large groups and never had a problem being served. This the first time we have gone since they enlarged and maybe they bit off more than they can chew. We arrived for a 5:30 reservation and were promptly seated, brought menus, and order the $49 per person Valentine's day special. They brought our drinks and a little plate with condiments .... and then we sat and sat and sat. People near us who came after us were served. 45 minutes went by and my husband said something to the server and she apologized - we waited 10 more minutes and again complained to the server. She brought the manager who apologized, offered to comp us and said they had been slammed by take-out orders. Nice to know take-out comes before actual diners. They then brought the food which was all lukewarm so we asked it to be bagged up -- we then received a bill for $40 which we paid with a $10 tip -- yes we were comped some of it but it was a horrible dining experience and we will not be back and we will let our friends of which there are many that go there about our experience as well. There are plenty of other Indian restaurants to take our business to.
