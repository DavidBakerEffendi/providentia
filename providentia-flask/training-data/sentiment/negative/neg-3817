The service here is pretty bad. Our waitress was friendly, but I guess she got off work halfway through because she disappeared. It's also very loud in here and hard to talk. 

I ordered the Korean BBQ skewers and my boyfriend got the New York Steak Frites. We also got some wings with the sauce on the side. The skewers were too spicy and had a strange flavor, the steak was alright, and the fries were probably the best thing we had. The wings tasted pretty bad. Also, about 5 minutes into eating after being served, a waitress came and took the plate I was eating on... didn't even ask if I wanted it gone (which I obviously didn't since my food was on it??) and said "I'll take this out of your way". LOL. 

I'm sure other locations are nice, but this one just seems a bit off. Wouldn't recommend coming to this one.
