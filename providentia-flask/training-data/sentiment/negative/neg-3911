How many restaurants will have to take over this location before somebody gets it right? We tried the new take over of this building,  so hoping we would have a great place to go close to home, only to be disappointed yet again. It wouldn't even have to be great, just a decent reliable place to go.  My husband ordered the burger and said it was actually one of the worst burgers he has ever had, including fast food places.  I had the fish and chips and struggled to find any fish amongst  the dried out batter that was honestly to difficult to cut with a steak knife. The third person in our party order the oriental salad which she commented " hard to wreck a salad".  To end the night my husband went to the washroom in the basement to discover what seemed to be a bit coin mining operation from behind closed doors.   No restaurant that is interested in providing good food uses a room full of racks and rack or computers.
