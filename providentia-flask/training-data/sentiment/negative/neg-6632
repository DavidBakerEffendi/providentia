So I came across this place via Groupon.  I check reviews before I purchase on groupon and it had a decent rating and some great suggestions.  Upon arrival, I noticed a sign in the front that said Attn: Groupon users, Groupon not eligible on Happy Hour Rolls/Specialty Rolls.  I ordered a 3 rolls which I only received 1 roll, hamachi Kama, and the udon tempura. The female manager came up and apologized for the wait in the rolls and than apologized that I never received the 2 other rolls.  The sushi chefs seemed to be drinking sake bomb after sake bomb and slacking on the rolling!  

Also, their marketing gimmick is 50% rolls (Normal avg. price $15) then they give rolls for $7.50 but do give small portions.  

The food that did come was ok at best.  Staff definitely needs to improve on their customer service and get those rolls on the table.  
 
BTW, this is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant.
