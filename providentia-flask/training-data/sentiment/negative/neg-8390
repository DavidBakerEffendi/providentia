Worst place ever to stay. The manager is ignorant. The stairways have tons of garbage in them and stinks like a garbage dump.   Falsely accused us of smoking weed in room and kicked us out AND the room across from us.  Then charged us $250. We are going to spend $500 n get a polygraph and prove we didn't smoke in room.  We they will be filing a small claims lawsuit.  I notice the rates have doubled and I believe this is a con that kicks people out who have cheap weekly rates when the price goes up....  plus the housekeeper actually went down to the front desk and told them she had no problem with us and didn't smell anything!!   This bitch picked the wrong person to fuck with,, I have more money then brains and will prove he is in the wrong without the consideration of how much it will cost.   He also accused us of smoking cigs, we don't smoke.  Stay tuned. Updates coming
