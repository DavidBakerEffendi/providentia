Food was incredibly disappointing and when we sent a dish back, the manager came to our table and accused us!!!! Unbelievable! We were so mad that we left right away  even though we hardly ate at all and was still hungry. Portions are tiny and ordering a sushi roll + an appetizer and a beer cost us $40! 

We had ordered SASA Fire roll, which was good, and then Salt and pepper Mackerel which came out lukewarm and shrimp Yaki-udon was terrible! First of all, the portion size was incredibly small. We were surprised as this was a main course. The dish was extremely salty as the noodles were soaked in sauce, which is not how a stir-fry noodle dish should be. When we sent it back to the kitchen and wanted to order something else instead, manager came to our table and first thing she said that because we had ate half the plate, she was going to charge us for it. Absolutely ridiculous! Portions are so small that even the manager though we had ate half of it! Hah! We had only tasted it and we immediately sent it back. Next she told us that the dish had too much sauce because we wanted to change the shrimp (food allergy) to chicken. That makes no sense, the problem was simply the dish was too salty because there was way too much sauce! She continued to imply it was our fault and she would have to inform the chef and "see what can be done about it" instead of apologizing for the terrible food. 

We will never be back again. A restaurant should know how important good service is, and the way SASA's manager handled the situation tonight was just incredibly rude. I will not recommend anyone to come here for the mediocre food.
