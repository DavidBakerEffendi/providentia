Don't ever order from this place. I have a injured back and can't walk and placed a order through uber eats with instructions requesting cutlery and hot sauce on the side. When the order arrived. There  was neither. I called them and the lady I spoke to told me to eat with my hands and that they couldn't do nothing about the missing items, I told them I would've come picked up the food myself if I hadn't hurt my back, I was shocked at the ladies response. I hope people never go to this business. Worst customer service ever.
