I read all the good reviews of this place, so I made a special trip after work to visit.

First of all, the service is poor. No one greet me when I walked in the shop. The owner (the lady) passed by me as if didn't see me. Fine, she may be busy with other things. Then the only server came out from kitchen to greet me after a few minutes.

There are not many pastry left. I picked the almond croissant which is highly recommended. I specially asked the server if the croissant is freshly made in store and what time. He told me they are baked twice daily at 7am and 2nish in the afternoon. I have a high expectation because it costs me $3.6! It is pretty pricy and better be good. 

I had a bite and it was hard as a rock. I can't believe it is bake in the same day or it must be baked with poor ingredients. It is much worse then those chained bakery. Moreover, The almond filling is too sweet. 

I know my money is wasted.
