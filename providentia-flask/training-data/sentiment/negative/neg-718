Seriously irritated..  it's 7:45 in the evening and this Subway sandwich shop is out of wheat bread?  Last week they were out of American cheese? It's a sandwich shop for Pete's sakes. I could see being out of a specialty item...But wheat bread? Never again at this location. They jacked up a tuna sandwich last week and were out of unsweetened tea... It's on a MAIN street in Vegas people!
