If you are close enough to a Dave & Buster, go there instead. 

The games are mostly broken. We had our bag of purchased items from Sea Life stolen here while we were playing with our backs turned for a moment. Not that it surprised me since there was a pack of teenagers running around the place bumping into people. They had a security guard, but he must have been asleep on the job.

I spent 200 on points. Usually by the end of an arcade trip that would get my niece and nephew about 4000 tickets combined to spend on the little prizes at Dave & Buster. Nope. Here they barely got 1000 combined and the prize costs were so high, they didnt get much.

There were no employees around when games broke or took your points and didn't work. They did have some good retro games upstairs, but i would still rather do Dave & Busters anytime.
