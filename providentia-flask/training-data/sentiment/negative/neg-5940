Had a great time until one of the dancers charged my roommate for twice as many dances as he received. my phone also came up missing and when I brought this up to the owner he was unhelpful. Most likely my phone was stolen by one of the employees. the manager actually said to me.. "You shouldn't lose your phone." we were the only two customers there.
