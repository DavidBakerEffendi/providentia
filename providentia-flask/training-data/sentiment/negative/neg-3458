Ok this is the reason I am giving them one star. We are not from Las Vegas, we're from the Bay Area, CA. We regularly go to Vegas and frequent this place. 

The place is called DJ "BIBINGKAHAN", but where is the motha-f-ing BIBINGKA? 

We went here 3 times in a span of 1 year and half. EACH AND EVERY TIME, they did not have BIBINGKA. We even mentioned that we were in town for a few days and would like to order one. They could not accommodate that request. This recent 3rd trip here, they still did not have the very product their place is named after. We told the person up front, in TAGALOG even, that you should change the name of the place.

Sorry, but after 3 times, and 500+ mile drive back and forth, I have a reason to complain.
