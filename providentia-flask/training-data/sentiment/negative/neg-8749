You know, the only complaint that I have here is that the person whom I dealt with at the cashier counter had a terrible attitude towards me and caused me to feel extremely uncomfortable for even being there. I asked a couple of questions and that must have bothered her, because she would not even look at me when she was handing my card back. If you don't want me to ask about which flavors of shmearfuls you have, then list them on the menu. When someone orders a lox sandwich, ask them what kind of bagel they would like. Don't pick one and then get an attitude with the customer, because they ask for something different. I would put this person on blast, but she does not have a nametag on. Just goes to show that if you can't even show up to work with the proper uniform on, then why would you treat the clientele properly. In this town service is everything and this service was terrible. I will never go back to this location again.
