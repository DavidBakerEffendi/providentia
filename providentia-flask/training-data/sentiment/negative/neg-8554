Booo Cafe Tranquilo.... We have ordered from them through postmates previously (there aren't a lot of good Mexican options on the app, and the food is decent but not amazing). 

This Sunday after a day of drinking poolside at home, we decided to order from them again. They twice accepted our order and then later canceled our order with the message "we are too busy."

I guess you have as many customers as you need already, so you won't miss our occasional order.
