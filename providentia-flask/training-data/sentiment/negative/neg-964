I would have given a negative zero however, that was not an option.  I walked into this location last night and ordered a double chicken salad. well, the tall young  cashier was........CLUELESS!  He did not know the prices of individual chicken pieces he quoted me $1.20 initially for a chicken thigh then it doubled within seconds of standing in front of him. (You all know that you need a magnifying glass to see those chicken pieces-right?  At any rate, the cook prepared my salad, and then placed it out for the cashier to place a lid on it and bag it. Well, he was so lame that the cook had to call his attention to the order. Before he could place a lid on it and bag it, another female employee took it and put it in a bag. She walked toward the container where the tortillas were while pulling her pants above her ass crack. Real nice!  I told the cashier that I was waiting for someone in there to wash their hands, which he had no response and looked at me dumb-founded. That same female employee handed me the food and thanked me with a thousand "Ma'ams, and then went about her business.  I threw the food away, completed the survey and will be contacting their corporate office and if they fail to address this issue regarding unsanitary conditions at this location, I will be calling the Maricopa County Department of Health for investigation.
