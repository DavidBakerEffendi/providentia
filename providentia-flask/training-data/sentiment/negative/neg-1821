While I would normally rate this restaurant with five stars, this week's experience was so disappointing that I writing to warn other patrons.  I had surgery Monday and was in pretty poor shape.  The following day friends offered to bring me dinner and the thing I craved more than anything else was an Oregano's Favorite Salad.  

My friends ordered take out and brought dinner to my home.  Much to my disappointment, instead of the amazing salad I usually enjoy when eating at the restaurant, I got a container of iceberg lettuce with a smaller container of shredded chicken.  NONE of the normal ingredients (other that then iceberg and the chicken) were on the salad.  It was awful, if the iceberg had been missing literally nothing else would have been in the container.  

Needless to say we were all very disgruntled, but given my post-surgery state, no one was able or wanted to drive all the way back to the location to get them replaced.  We all ordered the same salad and all received the same lackluster container of lettuce.  Sooooo disappointing - I will never again order take out from this restaurant.
