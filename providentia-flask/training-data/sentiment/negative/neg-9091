Dear Jessica L. or Jessica R. of the BUFFET at BELLAGIO, 

While I appreciate your sincere corporate cut and paste apology,  I cant help but feel quite the opposite of your intention. 

It doesn't  really matter (to me) that you will take any of my comments into consideration when making improvements cause let's face it, I STILL paid an ADULT price for a finicky 6 year old ( who barely eats) to dine at your establishment which wasn't exactly cheap for sub-par food. Your sincere apology doesn't reverse the time or effort wasted on my search for the best buffet for my birthday trip to Vegas nor does it really do anything but cover your corporate end of accountability. 

For future reference and "improvements" try making up for the fumble as opposed to an "I'm sorry we sucked but oh well for you, at least our future patrons will be happy" apology "letter." 

I can't help but feel like my short end of the stick got just a little bit shorter after reading your sincere apology.
