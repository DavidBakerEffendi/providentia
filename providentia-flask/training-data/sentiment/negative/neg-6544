Horrible customer service. This place used to be great, but all the good employees are gone. Staff is lazy. They use scoopers now and they barely fill them when making
the sandwiches. I had to ask for a full scoop and the employee gave me an attitude. I used to be a regular, but I will take my money else where where it is appreciated. I advise you to do the same.
