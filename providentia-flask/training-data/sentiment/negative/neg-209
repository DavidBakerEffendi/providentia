This specific review in in regards to their catering services & not the truck or the owner (Izzy) himself but his rude a** assistant. 

I am having a wedding reception at a local park shelter house where there is no kitchen & thought a food truck would be a fun & smart alternative. So I contacted StrEat Bistro to discuss their catering services. I'll admit, the owner , Izzy) responded quickly & was incredibly enthusiastic about his menu. But since they were opening a restaurant that same night, he didn't have time to go over details & was going to have his assistant contact me. 

Well, to put this simply- she's a greedy, arrogant, rushed A**!  Jamie (I think was her name?) was abrupt from the get go. I clearly stated that my fiance & I were not looking for anything special to be made but had gone over the menu they provide on their site & had picked selected items we would like to taste.  Since neither of us have ever visited their food truck, would it be possible to do so. She never answered that question but skipped right over it & instantly tried to push items that were not on their main menu ( & I'm assuming more costly) on me. 
Now, I'm pretty open to suggestions & understand the process of up-saling, etc but the way in which she conducted herself was very rushed & pushy. Once we got to talking about ME for a change & not what SHE felt should be done, the subject quickly changed to budget.
 Through out this entire process, their were too many long & awkward pauses. She then became a bit snippy as if our conversation was a huge inconvenience to her & she had better things to do. I felt unwelcome and stupid :/ When I was finally explaining  that my budget per person was roughly $10.95 to $14.00 (which I don't think is bad. After all it's a food truck where most of their items are under $10.00) she got even weirder on me. Again with the long silence, her response was very similar to this " Eeeeerrrrr....uuuummmm....yeah. *enter long pause*  I don't know, um..... you're budgets too small... *enter another long pause*I can come up with another menu and call you on Monday or Tues of next week". Of course, I knew she was NEVER going to call back just by her attitude & I was right! 

On what planet does not putting yourself in debt over catering a sin? I don't think my budget was too difficult to work with (again, most items under $10.00 off of their menu). especially because they majority of guest are small children & are not going to be eating $14.00 plus in food. Seriously- a complete b**ch!  I will never seek out their truck nor their restaurant unless it's to punch her in the face!
