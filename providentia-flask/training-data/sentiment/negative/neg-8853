The hostess was extremely rude when our group walked in. She exclaimed a profanity upon seeing our group and said "oh great, 10 people that are going to just go straight to the bar". We feel sorry for her and her opportunities in life with such a poor attitude. The fact that there was only 5 other people in the bar, you'd think they would be happy to see new people walking in...we do not recommend this business.
