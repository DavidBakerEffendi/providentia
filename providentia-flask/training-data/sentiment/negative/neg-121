I literally despise this place. 
I'm a vegetarian and each time I come with my partner (who loves carb-y Italian goodness) I think I'll have a better experience... but it always gets progressively worse.

The last time I went to Ciao my purse was stolen. The staff were completely unappreciative, unwilling to help, and said they "can't do anything about it." The manager advised he would call me the next morning... but he didn't. Of course.

DO NOT GO HERE.
