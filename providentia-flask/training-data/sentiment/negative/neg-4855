This place is horrible. I went in to purchase a meal for a homeless man that was hungry and the clerk at the counter proceeded to be loud and very rude. She was causing a scene by saying he can't be here. Yet I was the one purchasing the meal for the man. Let's remember people that they are human beings just like us in a terrible situation that we have no clue how they got there.
