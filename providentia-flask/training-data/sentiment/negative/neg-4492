The first two times I went to Landmark, I actually enjoyed it. But the last few times, it was icky and the service was horrible. I ordered a cheeseburger and my husband ordered chicken fingers. How can you mess up a simple cheeseburger and chicken finger? The burger was dry and overcooked, and it was topped with a icky slice of fake cheese. I was disappointed to say the least. The only think I liked was the tuxedo cake. That's always good. But Landmark needs to step it up.
