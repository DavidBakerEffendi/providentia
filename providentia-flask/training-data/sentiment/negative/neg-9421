Vegas buffets! When you go to Vegas you have to visit at least one. However, I was very disappointed by the Bellagio buffet. It is very very expensive and I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth. Most of the food was just OK and the prime rib was dry and chewy. I guess I was expecting it to be better than the run of the mill buffets but it was just like any buffet with mass produced food sitting under heat lamps. For the price I would never go back.
