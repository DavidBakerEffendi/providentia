Went there tonight. Had the worst service actually ever had. There were 16 of us (understand big party). None of us in a rush, most people ended up just getting drinks as waitress made ordering as difficult as possible. We took our seats, no one helped us out as seat yourself, but as soon as we do, complain to us about taking up too much room??. Place was empty except 2 people at bar when we got there at 6:30.  Waitress came by, no hello or anything, "Anyone ordering food?". I said yes, but menu please. She pointed to the other end of the table and said, "IT" (i.e. the one menu for 16 people) "is over there". What a Jerk!

And, here it comes, after waiting about 30 minutes after being served and no refills, someone asked for check, she starts in "Umm, I hope you guys don't think I'm going to break this up!?".  I turned my chair around and said, "Why are you so upset at us... why are you screaming at us?".  Suddenly the attitude stopped and she seemed nervous.   Really strange.  So the bill was a big mess, but we all figured it out.

The food, what she actually let us order, was fantastic.  IF YOU HAVE A GROUP OVER 4 PEOPLE I WOULD NEVER EVER GO HERE!!

I guess they were having a bad night or they don't like big parties, but man, she did not like us. BTW, 2 waitress that night, there was a pretty young brunette, and she was nice enough, started serving our table in the beginning, then just left.  It was all very twilight zone. Really hate giving bad reviews to small business.
