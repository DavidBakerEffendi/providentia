Was expecting something remotely resembling fish n chips...I have traveled to many coastal places in my childhood and past and remember the exquisiteness of real flaky cod filets and hearty potatoes. Run from the weird square "fish" chunks and less than sub-par not even fit for grocery store shelves "chips"!
