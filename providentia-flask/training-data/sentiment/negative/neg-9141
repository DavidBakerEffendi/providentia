This KFC is consistently bad ... after boycotting the restaurant for a year I decided to give is another try. The restaurant is still shabby ... I drove through the drive through. Employee was barely audible... he never gave me my total for order. Brought food home and discovered they messed up my order. Proceeded to eat meal and found the chicken to be soggy. That was definitely the last time I ever eat at KFC in Sun Prairie
