Go next door to shake shack! We were told it would be 10 minutes for a table. We were a larger group so we were ok with waiting. It took 30 minutes to sit down in an empty restaurant. It took another hour to get out food. Again... an empty restaurant. Then a meal didn't come for 1 person in the party and a burger was undercooked for another. Our drinks were left at the bar to the point we had to get up and get them ourselves. Still no real apology from anyone.
