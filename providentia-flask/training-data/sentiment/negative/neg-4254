Very disappointing. Please do not get the pork bone soup. It's advertised that it came with potato, but it was not in the soup. When we asked about the potato's, the waitress said, "so sorry" and said the potatoes would come out in 5 minutes. 10 minutes later, our potato cake out. The food was not that great. Very disappointed.

Update: just tried the potato, it's actually a TARO!!
