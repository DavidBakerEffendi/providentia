In today's society people are prone to sensationalism or embellishing stories to provoke a response. I promise you that this is not one of those occasions whatsoever, when I say that this place was THE SINGLE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. The food was HORRIBLE. The price was RIDICULOUS. The waiter kept coming to my table asking if I wanted any more, but I just sat there trying my damnest not to give him back the food that I'd just eaten (aka trying not to puke). Again this is not an exaggeration. This is real. Save your money & your digestive system by skipping this place altogether. Warning comes before projectile vomiting & stomach cramps.
