The worst service ever! I would give 0 stars if it was an option we went in with just over an hour before closing The lady was so rude and rushed us the entire time asked to sit at the bar and she said no because They just  cleaned it! Regardless they would have to clean wherever we sat we weren't ordering fast enough apparently and this even worse lady came from the back to rush us as well for our order we ordered 3 rolls for two of us we were in and out in 30 minutes she didn't need to be so rude I won't ever be going back which is unfortunate because it's so close to my house
