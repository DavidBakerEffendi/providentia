Terrible food. Had the huevos Benedict and they were awful. only the spice of Chile made it tolerable and compensated for the lack of real taste. waited twenty minutes for the waitress to even take our order. mind you she was delightful afterwards, which I'm thankful for. the outside looks good to sit in but the cushions are sullied with every past meal. come here to drink and people watch. go to Denny's for a better meal. oh and the hashed browns have no potato... they are all cheese.
