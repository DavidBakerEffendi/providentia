We ate at Manzetti's last Friday and were very disappointed.  We were greeted at the door by scantily dressed cocktail waitresses.  I don't have a problem with bars and clubs who have servers wearing teensy-weensie halter tops but its not what you expect at an upscale restaurant.  We sat at the bar and were surprised by the limited selection of beers on tap. They ought to give up the "tavern" part of their name.  Then when we were seated our waitress could not have been ruder.  Very unfriendly and obviously not in the mood to be waiting the table.  The food is mediocre at best and overpriced for what you get.  We had 6 people in our party and no one was impressed.
