Got the short rib benny. Note : the eggs are not poached. when I complained about the eggs not being runny, the waiter said he would  bring a poached egg. then the manager comes over to explain that "they do it different here" and they cook them just right at X degrees. anyhow just disappointed I didn't and couldn't get a runny egg. the manager said " we would have to boil water " wtf anyhow everyone was nice. except the manager who basically told me to go pound sand. who orders a Benedict and expects not to get a runny egg. lame
