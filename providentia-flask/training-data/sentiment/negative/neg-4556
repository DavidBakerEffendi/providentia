I wish I could give them negative stars because they suck badly. The food is really bad, I mean you smell it and you want to throw up. My sister ordered some plum wine and the glass had lipstick on it, so he brings out a different glass with probably the same wine and it also had finger prints. My sister ordered the dynamite sushi bowl and right away it smelled so fishy that I asked her to move it away from me. I was sitting outside and the wind was blowing the fishy smell towards me. The guy said he wouldn't charge her for it.  Also you are supposed to get miso soup with all of your meals but we never got it. The worst part is my girlfriend and her son got sick. All they got was a chicken teriyaki bowl and her son was pooping green. I guess that would be mild food poisoning. It's funny but I think that they changed their name to KB sushi grill. The service was so crappy, we had to stand up in order to signal that we wanted our check.
