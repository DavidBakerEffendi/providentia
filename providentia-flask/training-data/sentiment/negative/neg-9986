Their quality started to decline about a year ago, every time it is worse than before. Yesterday we ordered delivery, not only it took more than an hour, but the food was a real disappointment. We got chicken sishkebob with their Israeli salad (cubed tomatoes and cucumbers with house dressing) and the combo of 4 Israeli favorites: baba ganoush, fried eggplants, humus and pickled mushrooms. Out of all that only the kebob was edible. The rice was too dry, they completely screwed up the salad dressing, it was ultra lemony and runny, Israeli combo was tasteless, baba ganoush was plain old. Finally lesson learned: never again!
