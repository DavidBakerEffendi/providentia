The service is so bad as is the food.  The Manager could care less.  The waitress lost our credit card but delivered the check and never told us.

It took 28 mins to get check and we were late for event.  The food is so bad, the last 2 times I chose to not eat at the Restaurant as the concession food is better at a High School football game.

Avoid!!!!!
