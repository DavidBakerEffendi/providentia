We booked 2 rooms online for 2 days and received the confirmation number. After we drove 400 miles to check into this hotel, the front desk refused to accept the confirmation number. He said our server has been down yesterday and your confirmation number  can't be found on the system!
This was their mistake but unfortunately they didn't want to take care of it. 
We had to look and find another hotel. 
We will never stay at this place again. 
I'm so sorry to say that the manager, Mr. Thomas Lambert talked in a very rude and impolite way. 
Poor management...
