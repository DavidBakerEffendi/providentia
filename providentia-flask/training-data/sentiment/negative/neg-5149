Definitely NOT fast food. I came here on my lunch break today. I ordered my food in the drive thru (which I thought was fast) at 12:05pm.  There were two cars ahead of me, after a few minutes,  to my horror another car pulled up behind me so I cant even back out now.  We were all "parked" for 10 minutes before we could finally pull up, only to park again, while they killed the cow evidently! I didn't make it to the window to pay, until 12:32!! I just kept on driving bc at this point I wasn't giving them 1 dime.  I will never be back to this location, from most of the reviews here they are EXTREMELY slow, it maybe ok to come here if you don't have any plans for the day.
