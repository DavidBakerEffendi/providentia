BAD SERVICE. Is it possible to give negative stars? My family and I came in for lunch and the owner was very rude. When I asked a question about the menu, he had a bad attitude. He raised his voice at me when I told him I didnt receive the plate of rice I ordered. The food was not good We ordered pizza, kabobs, salad, chicken tikka masala. And another chicken dish. No one like their food. I would never come back here again and hope I  can save someone  from a horrible experience. Go somewhere else!
