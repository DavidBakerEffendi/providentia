No ramen here, don't even know what to call their noodle soup. Looks like ramen but tastes like nothing. 

Service: didn't even notice our arrival after a few minutes. Another customer had to advise the waitress. 

Value wise it's terrible. I would consider paying $4.99 for what I had but got charged &10.99.

Has a strange/oily odor upon entering, could be residual smell from previous operation. Nonetheless, it's mildly repulsive.
