Recently, I've been trying to find a friendly and relaxed coffee spot where you can go in, get coffee in an actual mug, sit down, and read or chat.  Maybe it's the burgeoning hippie in me or something, but I'm sick of paper cups for coffee, and sometimes I just don't want to make it myself. This search has taken me to local shops, which has been pretty cool. Unfortunately, this place was below the bar for my group.  Nevermind the paper cups - it wasn't a huge deal.  Nope, this review is entirely for the service.

The service was dismissive and rude.  It seemed like an inconvenience for her that she had customers to tend to. We were the only people inside and one car came up to the drive thru a few minutes later, so this was hardly like Starbucks on a Monday morning... Although the plan had been to sit in and enjoy our coffee there, after being smacked with that unfriendly vibe, we took it all to go.
