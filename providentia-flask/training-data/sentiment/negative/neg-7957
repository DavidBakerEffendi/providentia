Absolutely the worst service I have ever experienced. It took over 30 minutes to receive our salads from the time of ordering, if you can call what we received a salad. It was a half a head of lettuce with a drizzle of dressing, that's it! The lettuce was not even chopped up, I mean really how much more effort would it have taken the cook to cut up the lettuce. 

After another 25 minutes we received our steaks, it was a small piece of over cooked beef in a plate with 4 string beans and the fries were served separately, very disappointing and very expensive for a meal that was unappetizing. 

Needless to say I will never go back to this place. I felt like the whole idea of this restaurant was to give as little as possible and charge as much as possible. I'm amazed they are still in business.
