Went here on my lunch. Ordered Singapore noodles. They usually come with pork and shrimp but I had them sub the pork for chicken. When I went to pick up my ordered I asked if there was chicken and shrimp. They said there was. Drove all the way back to work. What I got were not Singapore noodles...no curry and no shrimp. So what I got is plain noodles with no sauce. I called them and they stated I had to bring the food back otherwise they couldn't do anything. I told them I had driven all the way back to work and only had a 45 lunch. They didn't care. They said they couldn't do anything unless I brought the food back. The manager refused to talk to me. I took the food back and told them I wanted a refund and my correct food due to the hassle and inconvenience of having to drive back. The manager still refused to talk to me in person. They refused to give me another order. The worst customer service ever. Save yourself the trouble. Even if it's their mistake, they don't try to make to make it right. The owner is extremely rude and just kept yelling at the woman helping me that he would not do anything.
