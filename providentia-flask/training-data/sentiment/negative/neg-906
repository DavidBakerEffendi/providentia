first off, i ordered a cheese enchilada and these werent melted all the way on the inside nor the outside. i couldnt even stomach eating the rest. second, the wait took waaaay too long for the small order we had and it being 12 AM. i wont go here again. making sure the cheese is melted on enchilada isnt hard....
