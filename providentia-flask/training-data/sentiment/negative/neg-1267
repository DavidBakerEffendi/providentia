Thanks for shutting down early tonight.   We made the drive over to your location,  only to find the doors locked at 9:55pm.

Why post store hours if you're not going to adhere to it? 

Don't get me wrong, I would have understood if you let me in and said, this is all we have left.   But instead,  you opted to give a friendly wave turn away business.  Guess what...There's plenty of other options out there.   

Thanks again...not only did i lose out tonight,  but so did corporate and the store owner who pay the salaries.
