Horrible service!!!! I don't even think they deserve 1 star.. Waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table, 20 minutes for drinks, 45 minutes for just an appetizer... Then another 30 minutes for my food, when they finally brought out the food you could tell that the food had been sitting under a heater or as the manager called it a "hot line." The there was hair in my food and all the manager did was say sorry. Said he would take care of it. Serious lack of communication because my server comes back and says oh did you still want that bread bowl!? Really?? Horrible
