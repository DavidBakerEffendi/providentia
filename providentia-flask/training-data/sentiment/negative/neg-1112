I would give it less than this as they never responded to my letter or emails. It was our anniversary and my lobster was horrible it tasted and smelled like ammonia. I did not eat it but did not want to make a big deal in front of customers or dining companions. So I wrote a Letter when I returned home. No response so I emailed sent another letter. We went there a lot. Never again. If they do not care about their customers there are plenty of restaurants that do. Highly disappointed.
