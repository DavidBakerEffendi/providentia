I really wanted to like this place. I really REALLY had high hopes. With great yelp reviews, I was sure it would be delicious. Came with a group of 10 girls for brunch. It took an hour and a half for us to get our food. We noticed a large group (who came say after us) get their food about 15-20 min earlier than us. Called over the manager named Julian, and with a big forced smile ear to ear, he went to check on the food. It came out about 10 mins later and with the same smile, as though he was lacking the empathy emotion, said because we had dishes that required meat to be fully cooked, it took longer! (We had two dishes with small diced steak tacos). Either way, he started arguing about how that other large group must have put their order in right before ours, how the restaurant was busy(not at all) and how, again with this ridiculous, inappropriate smile suggesting all was honker dory, that they wanted to bring all the food out together. Someone ended up not getting their drink and they brought out someone else's brunch way later than everyone else's 

Food was okay. Pancakes were Cold. Not worth the pricey menu price. 6 oz of bottled OJ with ice in the cup will run you $6 bucks! 

Will be emailing the GM to share my experience. Was told I could only email him. Left my contact info, was told they weren't sure he would get the complaint. 

Work on management and staff efficiency.
