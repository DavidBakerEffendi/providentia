Went the first time and they gave me the wrong order.. No chocolate EVER.. Moved down here almost a year ago and after the South Durango store closed I went to this store.. And they still get orders wrong and again... NO CHOCOLATE STILL.. Travel the extra time to a better DQ cause you won't get soft served chocolate..
