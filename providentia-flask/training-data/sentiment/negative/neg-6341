I don't normally spend the time to write reviews even if I had a bad experience. So to leave a negative review must mean it was REALLY bad. 

I came here for lunch with my coworkers. I waited a long, long time for my order to come, the lunch pasta special. People ordered their food, ate it, and left before I even received my food (and they were the same order). When I spoke to the cashier, she had the audacity to condescendingly say, "Maybe you didn't hear it." I didn't hear my order called out, nor did my coworkers who were right beside me, waiting for their orders as well. My order number was 71. The manager said, "Well, there was an order 81, maybe they got mixed up?" I told him it is your responsibility that the right order goes to the right person. "Well, it's coming," he said. No "sorry". No apology.

And that is my biggest gripe. I worked at a restaurant. I get it. When there's a rush of people, mistakes can happen. But you do not ever, EVER, blame the customer for your mistakes.

Suffice to say I will never, ever, order food from here again. 

Oh and the pasta was okay, nothing special and a bit too salty for me. My friend said his sandwich was also too salty.
