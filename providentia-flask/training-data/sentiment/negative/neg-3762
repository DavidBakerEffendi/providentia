Super bummed!! My hubby and I came here today for an impromptu date and we didn't even stay. When we walked in they were on a 20 - 25 minute wait. We gave our name but only waited about 10 minutes! I guess they failed to mention the rest of your wait time is at the table! We sat, and, sat, and sat, aaaaaaand sat! 2, 3, 4 different people walked right by our table and not one person even acknowledged we were there. The kicker...there was a table eating directly behind us and their server was present!! Why couldn't that person have said hi, or taken drinks etc. Nope, nothing, from anyone!! We sat long enough to eat the basket of rolls and decided to leave. I mentioned it to what appeared to be the manager on our way out bit he could have cared less. He offered to "get us sat" and I let him know again, we WERE sat, for 12 minutes!  We had zero service. Too bad, we won't be back.
