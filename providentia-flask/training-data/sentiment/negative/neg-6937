Good pasta. Terrible service. We got seated at 11:50am. The waiter didn't come take order for more than 5 min. When asked one waiter to get our order, he brushed me off telling me to wait. I waited a few min but nobody took order, and i could not get a hold of a waiter.  After a few more min, I had to shout to finally get a waiter to take a order from me and my family. As we ordered we aske that the food arrive asap and don't want it to be held off for other foods that are not ready. 

Then it took 10 min for the bread to arrive, but they gave us butter with it. I like it with vinegar and oil, so when i asked for it they gave me the vinegar and oil but no plates to poor them on. What kind of an italian place give you butter with bread, then don't give you plates when you ask for vinegar and oil to eat with bread?

Remeber how I asked for the food to come as they get ready? Well it took them 30min to get us food and the reason is because they were holding the food to serve them together!

The food was alright. A bit salty though so we drank a lot of water. Even after 3 of our glasses were empty they did not refill the water for more than 10min until i had to call for them. 

Lastly, i was super pissed and did not want to leave any tip. But guess what? They charged a gruitity charge for our group of six. 

For those who might be thinking that the restaurant may have been busy... There were four tables besides us and they were all tables of two or three and there were three waiters.
