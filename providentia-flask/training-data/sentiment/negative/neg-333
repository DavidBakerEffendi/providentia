Unfortunately this could be one of the most disappointing lunch experiences I have had in Uptown.  Being Catholic, and Lent, I was thinking about a slice of cheese pizza, no meat, but didn't want an entire pie. So, after hearing Fuel sold pizza by the slice I called and confirmed, as well as found out they serve side salads.  I headed over around 11:30 to miss any lunch crowd, with having to get back to the office.  I decided to go with the spinach and tomato slice, side salad and 2 garlic knots. First, let me say they put the slice of pizza straight in a brown bag, not horizontal.  So, needless to say when I got back to the office the toppings had literally slid off, the slice was soggy and the bag was covered in grease, ugh! As for the salad, the onions were brown, and I mean bad brown, plus the lettuce was brown and wilted as well.  So, I slid all the toppings off the pizza, ate the dough and ate the garlic knots, after having tried to pick through the lettuce and onions for something fresh, NO.
I should have known this would have been a bad experience when the guy at the counter was rude and things moved very slowly with only three people in the restaurant.  I absolutely will not be back anytime soon.
