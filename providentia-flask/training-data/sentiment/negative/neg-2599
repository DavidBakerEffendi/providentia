Reservations for 6:30pm. Owner left closed sign on door saying closed for work function. Reservations were made only a week prior. No calls, no communication. Owner said call Groupon. $30 taxi from the strip to be stuck without dinner before 11pm flight departure out of Las Vegas. Thanks Bertolucci. Classy
