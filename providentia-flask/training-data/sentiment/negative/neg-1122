WARNING - Not fit for human consumption!!! 

Wholly shitz what a disappointment. My UK friend and I decided to go there for lunch to check it out.  Neither one of us held our breath very much for it but never the less... We did not expect bland frozen square fish product patties with equally nasty previously frozen tasteless fires. Yes, they are not chips per say, just yeacky french fries. 
1st stop as we got back to the office was bathroom and even now my stomach unhappily rumbles under the desk. Down boy, down! It will pass with time. 

Disgusting all around. Possibly even insulting. 

PS: And WTF is up with not taking credit cards? Scamming "The man"?
