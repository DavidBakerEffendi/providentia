Extremely rude waitress. Artificial fragrance air freshener overwhelms the restaurant and bathrooms. Subpar food. Bright Lime Green walls gives off a cheap feel. 

The owner did not smile once. She demanded we sit in the corner under the TV. We instead walked over to another table. She then rudely told us we cannot sit there "in case a big group comes in". No group ever came. 

The pad woon sen was really bad, tasted of toasted sesame and did not have any oyster or fish sauce. Not authentic. 

The only positive things were that they used filtered water, which is rare at a restaurant in Arizona, and the place was very clean. 

Prices: $11 to $18. Overpriced for what you get, like most Thai restaurants in AZ. 

The curry was ok, nothing spectacular but a decent serving size. Even Mild was way too spicy for me. 

Due to the extreme rudeness of the owner (Asian lady), and the ridiculous air freshener smell, we will not return and DO NOT recommended at all. 

There are so many better Thai options in the East Valley. For example: in Tempe, Thai Basil, Tasty Thai, and Smile Lao Thai are way way better. In East Mesa: Thai Plates Cuisine.
