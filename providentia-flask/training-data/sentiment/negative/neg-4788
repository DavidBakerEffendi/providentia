My family and I decided to have Father's Day brunch here and I must say it was the worst experience I have ever had. Our waitress Gabriella could not have been any less friendly. We ordered our drinks which took about 15 to get each time. The restaurant was half empty since we got there at 10:30 before the rush just avoid a situation like that.  When it came to order our food we placed our order with Gabriella doesn't ask of we need anything and scatters off. Doesn't even return for about another 15 min. She returns 15 min after that with our drinks so we ask about our food since it was going on about 45 min now and she says it's coming.  So we wait. I must say that everyone's food food looked really good except for the fact that my son's French toast was missing the icing and I have to say that my omelette was horrible. I've had better omeletts at IHOP and half the price. Couldn't send it back since our waitress never came back but when it was time for the check.  She handed us our bill which just mine was $102 not to include my sister's  bill for around $60 and that was the first time we saw a smile. Hmmmm  I then proceeded to ask if she was bringing out the cotton candy since we had sat there for 2 hrs and my boys got excited when they heard the other waitress' saying it was on the house. We'll my not so friendly waitress says oh no we don't do that for everyone and we aren't doing it today. I said really everyone around us has been getting them. So after we went back and forth she brought it out.  I feel that we spent about $160 the free cotton candy isn't going to kill her. Or that might just show she's nice and that's prob not what she's used to.  I will prob not return again and if so I'll make sure she does not wait on us and I will not order an omelette.
