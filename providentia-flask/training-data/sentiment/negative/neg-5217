So my wife and I show up on a weekend afternoon for our first visit to this location.  We were excited to find a new spot to try.  They have a small out door patio area and we like the fact that they do not allow smoking.  We enjoy gaming and know the "rules of engagement" for complimentary beverages; minimum buy in of $20, max coin bet along with continuous play.  We settled in and ordered two appetizers off the menu to share which we both enjoyed.  As the day shift bartender was getting off shift we settled up for our food order and tipped her out before she left.  We continued to play awhile longer on the swing shift.  When we were done playing we got up to leave and the new bartender on shift points out that we have a tab for our beverages.  I have to tell you I was speechless.  We were not ordering doubles, top shelf liquor or team gambling.  My wife had three well cocktails and I had two due to the fact that I was driving.  Granted, I do not consider ourselves to be big time players by any means, but I know we played a hundred dollars between the two of us.  I paid our liquor tab and left not happy about the way I was treated.  I felt as though we had been "handled" like some bait and switch scheme between the day and swing bartenders.  We will not be coming back.  Pity really, but there you have it.
