I don't know why we keep coming back. We live up the street and when everything else is crowded in cave creek we end up here because it never is. And every time we swear we will never be back. The food is ok but the service is terrible. We have been there when our server is literally sitting at the next table to us on the patio, smoking cigarettes and playing on his phone while we are trying to get another round of drinks. I have never been somewhere where customer service is this awful. Food takes forever, drinks take forever and all the staff is annoyed to be there. I felt we were bothering them. It seems when mark is not there babysitting this staff they take full advantage of being lazy and not working. Do not waste your time or money here!!!!
