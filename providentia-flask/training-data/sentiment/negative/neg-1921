Been here a couple of times and every time, our servers somehow disappear. 

Came here tonight for a late meal. Food was ok. Service was absolutely terrible. Our server was Kara. She left our table for like 20 minutes. No refills. No check ins. And comes back and doesn't really seem like she wants to serve us. Continuously cutting us short and walking away. Dishes sat on the table for a good 15-20 mins without being taken away even after we got our food packed up. Won't be back to this location. 

If you want to sit at a dirty table with no service, this spot is definitely for you
