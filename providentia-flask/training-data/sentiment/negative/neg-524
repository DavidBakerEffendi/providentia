This place is a dump, The food is terrible, there is no consistency.. The service is also horrible, even during peak hours they have very few people working. If you visit this place on a Saturday it will take at least an hour for your food to arrive. They haven't spent any money on the decor since a long time, it has red wallpaper and dim lights so that they can hide the mess. I can't believe this place is still in business.
