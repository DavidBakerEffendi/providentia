I love love love rotis!  So I've been wanting to check The Jerk Spot out for  awhile as it's in my 'hood.

I had lunch there today.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the strong smell of bleach.

I ordered a boneless chicken roti made with breast meat rather than from the leg (it costs extra) along with a can of Diet Coke and ate it there.

There were a couple chunks of chicken breast, a couple chunks of potatoes, flakes of nonbreast chicken, lots and lots of sauce (it's quite spicy), chicken skin (maybe from the jerk chicken?) and small bones.

Yes, chicken skin and small bones!!!  Appalling considering I ordered a BONELESS chicken roti.  I've posted pictures.

The quality isn't very good and I couldn't finish it.

I definitely won't be back.
