If I could give them less then this I would. So it's lunch time and on there menu and Facebook it says open from 8 to 10 or something like that and I called to place a lunch order for pickup at 1pm. The prep cook answers the phone & tells me that the cooks don't come in until 3 so I have to call back then. I only gave this place a 2nd chance because there are no other food places like this in the area smh.
