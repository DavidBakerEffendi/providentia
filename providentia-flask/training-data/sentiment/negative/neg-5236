First & last time trying this place!! We've been to so many sushi spots here in Vegas & this is the worst spot! Take your money elsewhere even I live near here, I wouldn't step a foot in this joint again. Came in around 630 pm, not much people so we figure service would b great but we had to ask for refills ..at first the rolls wasn't too bad but super white was disgusting as it was rolled in hot rice! What type of sushi is that? It cooks the fish & it's mushy all around.. halfway thru our orders, we noticed more rice than fish ..we couldn't take much of that hot rice, so I left ONE rolled rice and Kelly charged me $2!! Really u wanna go there, 1st service sucks, 2nd rice was hot & no never coming back!! Go to other places where sushi tastes more fresh..$26 pp, I rather spend it elsewhere..trust me!!
