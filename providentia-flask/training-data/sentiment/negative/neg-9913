Worst firehouse I have ever been to! I called ahead and was placed on hold for 6 minutes, then was taken off hold to place my order. During the time I was saying my order the rude lady put me back on hold mid sentence. I was on hold for over 9 minutes and still on hold when I walked in. There was NO ONE in line when I arrived. The rude lady while I was standing in front of her, before even saying anything to me, mumbled to her self oh gosh I wonder if I hung up. I then responded NOPE, I'm standing in front of you. She then took the phone off hold said hello which came through to my phone. No apology or anything just oh what did you want. Really!!! So so rude! I have been to multiple firehouses and never have there been someone this rude and disrespected. I will NEVER come back to this one. It's not worth it even if they are closest to me. The employees there need to learn respect for customers that ultimately pay there wages.
