Awful service.  Went here around 3 pm on a weekday, wasn't busy at all with maybe 15% of the tables being used.  Was sat down quickly and given a drinks menu but not a food menu.

I waited 5 minutes while employee after employee walked by, doing other things.  Even met eyes with some of them.  Nobody offered me a drink or a menu.  Ok, fuck you then.  I won't be going back.
