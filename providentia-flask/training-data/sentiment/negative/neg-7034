Very disappointed today!  This restaurant was always one of our favorites, however today my family of 5 had to walk out because the TVs were so loud we could not even talk to one another.  It was a Saturday evening at 7:30, they had all the TVs on for the college football games.  I could obviously understand if this were a sports bar, but it is not.  I hope that the owners of this place get a clue, because I'm pretty sure most people will not come back here.
