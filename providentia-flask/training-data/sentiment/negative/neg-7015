Use to love this place and visit at least twice per week... it's severely declined downhill and the quality of service and food shows it. I am guessing the ac doesn't work since they installed a "Big Ass" fan, which IMO, is not fun explaining to my child who is asking why it says ass... very inappropriate. but it gets so humid. I see servers standing and chatting while using menus to fan themselves looking unhappy. And a happy staff equals happy customers... 

Oh, and poker nights? Really??
