I've waited longer for my food at this place than I ever have at a restaurant. I watched two people get there food before me that ordered after I did. 
The cashier, which I think is the manager Zach? Was wearing a villa pizza T-shirt while not helping the cook who was by himself besides the other guy standing watching everyone.
