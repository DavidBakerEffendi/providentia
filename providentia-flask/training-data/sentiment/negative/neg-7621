The sole waiter in the restaurant was too aggressive and pushed us to eat way more than we possibly consume, without having a chance to review the menu.  
We ordered a mild Chicken Tikka.  It came way too spicy.  We told the waiter, who told the mother of the owner that we were sending the dish back.  She complete lost it with us, went totally crazy and said we've been here for 34 years.  When we explained that we ordered mild not spicy she gave us the "talk to the hand" signal and began to rant at us.
The waiter brought the dish back and said you might as well eat it because you're paying for it.
I don't think so!
I can't imagine how they have remained in business for so long.  The other dish was moderately OK, and we asked for a little salad, but he made a giant salad and charged an entire price.
The food was NOT good and the attitude was completely unacceptable.
