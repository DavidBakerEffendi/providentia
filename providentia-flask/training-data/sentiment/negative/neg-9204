Don't go to this place. There are a ton of barbecue places in the Charlotte area that are great, but this is not even remotely close to it. They use cheap ingredients and the food tastes terrible. The service was atrocious and I believe I would have been better off served by the vermin living there instead. Please take your business elsewhere.
