We thought we would give it a try. Really enjoy the meat mountain and the chicken pizza. 
So we ordered three pizzas. Wings  bread sticks and salad. I large order for 9 people.  
So no guarantee on delivery it's busy I get it but 90mins and still no food. About to call and check when the order arrives. Driver was polite and apologized for delay very nice young man. So here is where to problem starts. Food is cold. Cheese is barely melted.
Crust is like cardboard like it failed to rise.
Salad was wilted and only half full. 
Concidering  the long wait and  the poor quality I called to complain. After a 5 min wait on the phone the manager offers to remake the order and send it as a rush. 
I agree . Freshh hot food . We wait . And wait . And wait. 
Again 90 mins and the driver arrives . 
No food . Different driver but he comes empty handed with a message. 
We will not be replacing your order ......and get this for an excuse......we do not have the ingredients. 
I am offered a credit on my next order. 
The pizza business is tough . If you want to stay afloat this is not how to keep customers. 
Want a really good pizza try Naples, Aurora pizzaville, or even toppers in Newmarket but as for toppers Aurora don't waste your time . ,
