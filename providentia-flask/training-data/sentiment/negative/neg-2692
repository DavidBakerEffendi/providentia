Worst burger I have ever eaten. Went here on a groupon and would never go back. The burger on the overall just tasted bad/funny. I think it was the sauce and lettuce. I deconstructed the burger and still only ate half of it. The meat really had no taste. Sucks to say but on my burger journey this place was rock bottom. 

The only redeeming quality for this place was the maple bacon shake. Now this was tasty. Don't see myself going out of the way for it. 

Definitely a skip over this place for me.
