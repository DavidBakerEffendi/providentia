Highly disappointing front of house.

As a large group of eight, we knew that the wait for a table on a Saturday would not be brief, but we decide that we would put our name down anyway after being told by the staff at the door that the wait would be about an hour.

After an hour and a half, we went back to check on the status. No table. At this point, we discussed with the staff at the entrance and decided that it would be alright if we were split into two separate groups of four.

Tick, tock, tick, tock. Another hour and a half passes and we still had not heard back from them, so we went to check again. This time, a different (and quite rude) lady at the front told us that we were queued as a group of eight and that we should continue to wait. We informed her that we had discussed with the previous staff that we would split into two groups of four. She responded that she would not split our group into four since we were already queued as eight, and informed us that they do not seat groups of this size on weekends (contrary to just being told that we should continue to wait).

This is highly disappointing since this wasted three hours of time, where we could have been elsewhere, in lieu of waiting on false hope generated by the staff of Snakes & Lattes.
