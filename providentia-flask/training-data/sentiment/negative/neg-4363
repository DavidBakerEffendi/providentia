I just tried to order a pizza for delivery and got a phone call from the general manager saying that they don't deliver to where I live in DeForest.  Except they delivered to my house within the last two weeks!  The manager argued with me saying they never have and told me they don't have record of any orders from my phone number, which I updated when I last ordered online and on their delivery map my address is included.  He basically called me a liar to my face, even though the pizza box from their last delivery to my house is still in the garage waiting to go out with the recycling.  If you changed your coverage area fine, but don't be a jerk to a customer and call them a liar.  I have a medical degree and am not some confused idiot.  Then I got an email saying that my order was being made.  The manager said that they don't deal with online stuff in their store.  Someone needs to get on the same page and be consistent.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've experienced in years!  I will never order from this franchise nor any other in the area and will be sure to pass along to my friends how they treat customers.  I was so excited to find out they delivered here only to be disappointed.  It's a shame too, because their gluten free pizza was pretty good.  Save yourself the grief and go to Salvatore's Tomato Pie's instead.  Way better pizza and way nicer people!!!
