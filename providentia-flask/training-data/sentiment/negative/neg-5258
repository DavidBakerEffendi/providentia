We always pick OTBorder for Mother's Day and Father's Day....guess where I'm not going for Father's Day. It's really sad how far this place has slipped since the last time we visited, and this is not just a one time fluke. You can tell they have made choices as a company to go with cheaper ingredients among other strategies to pinch on profits. The salsa definitely changed for the worse, chicken dishes seemed more "prepared" or packaged. Even the salad I had was just really bad, it's lettuce with taco stuff = hard to make that bad I would think. We had fajitas with uncooked (literally cold) peppers and onions to the point where you could hold the fajita pan when served. We had a hair in the food. And to top it off, my Mom ordered a side salad she was told would be .99 extra that never showed up on the table but did show up on the bill for $4.99. When told, the waitress said, "oh yeah, I couldn't get it to ring up at .99 and my Mgr. told me we would comp something later." They ended up taking $3 off the cost of the salad (that never came) so we paid $1.99 for the salad.....that never came. LOL
