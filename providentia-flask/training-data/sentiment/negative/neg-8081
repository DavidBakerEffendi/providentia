This business is extremely unprofessional! I purchased three dozen cupcakes for my daughter in laws baby shower. Paid for my order on May 7th the party was May 14th when I arrived to pick up my order. The business was closed with a notice stating the locks were changed for non payment of back rent. Needless to say I was extremely upset because this establishment was locked out two days after I paid for my order. I did not receive a phone call, text or email. That they would not be able to fulfill my order. Proceed with caution if you are going to work with this bakery.
