Rediculous! My husband after working a 10 hour day on Valentine's Day stoped by to pick up a call in order I did after waiting in line for 20 min they said something must of happen and they did not get my phone in order.  Then said let me call my manger after 10 more min about an hour total from when it's supposed to be done with myself and two hungry children at home waiting he was told to leave his name and number so the manager can call him later tonight.  It completely just blows my mind, at very minimum they should have said lets knock your order out and get you and your family fed and deal with the rest of it later. But nope no food an hour lost and charged my cc... lost my business forever
