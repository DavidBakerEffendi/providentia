The Groupon brought me to Bertolucci. The other bad reviews are completely accurate, unfortunately. Understaffed. Spotty service. Room temperature salad bar. Empty pan of dried up mashed potatoes on hot bar. Overcooked meat. Very disappointing. Spend the extra money, go to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil.
