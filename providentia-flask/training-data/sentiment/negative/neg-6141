Although we had a delicious cheese and mushroom appetizer, we experienced poor customer service. One person in our party did not enjoy their meal and one waitress basically ridiculed us for not liking the salad since it was explained on the menu. They would not remove the money from our bill and were extremely rude. I will never go back.
