Ordered 2 portions of the $50 Australia- grown wagyu and this meat came out...
Was told that it's the striploin. Asked what grade it was and they couldn't tell me. Then I was told that this delivery of the meat is much leaner than what they usually get. No offer to even make a partial refund. Tastes just like any boiled beef. Tasted just like the beef they sell at $25 in the same store. 

Very disappointing given that fact that the store appears to be run by a Japanese staff that should know better than to treat their customers like this.
