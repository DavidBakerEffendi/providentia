By far the Worst pho I've ever had in 4 years of living in Arizona. I got the Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) and the broth had zero flavor which is disappointing because Pho is all about the broth, the chicken was cooked well but also had no flavor. I'm not sure if this place is new but they need to reconsider their career because this place and food isn't it. 

Extra note - take out containers are also pretty cheap mostly all Pho places had their broths wrapped in a plastic bag and then put it in another plastic bag with the rest of the fixings but not Pho KC. 

To sum it all up - Terrible takeout experience, flavorless broth this place deserve zero stars and for the people who gave all the 5 star reviews you should really check out any other pho place in the valley I guarantee you'll forget about this place.
