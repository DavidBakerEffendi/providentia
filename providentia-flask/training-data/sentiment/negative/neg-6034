Went here for the first time. They had Gourmet Dinner for 49.99. Was very disappointed.  No flavor on the food. So ended up skipping food and went to deserts. Saw they had my favorite desert "napoleon ", not great either. They are better in bakery next to my house. 

The only thing I liked was a strawberry shortcake cup desert. That was good. But it's not worth 49.99.  

Been twice to Wicked Spoon (wich I GREAt), but was told this one was really good too, was not the case. Will not go here again. Will stick to what I already know is great.
