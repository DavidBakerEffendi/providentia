I'm very sad to be writing this review, but it seems necessary. I've been going to Vermont Sandwich Company for a long time as it used to be my absolute favorite sandwich place. However, after today's visit I'm sad to say I won't ever return. My boyfriend, his daughter and I went there for lunch and were all very excited about it. Once we got our sandwiches we were very disappointed. My boyfriend always gets the meatloaf, so needless to say that's what he ordered. His daughter loves their egg salad so that's what she got. I tried something new and got their vegetarian sandwich. The meatloaf was a very thinly sliced piece (not what it used to be) which was almost nonexistent; therefore, he felt as if he was eating two slices of bread with some flavor on it. My avocados were brown in color and barely anything else was on my sandwich. His daughter barely even ate her sandwich since she said it didn't taste good (which is pretty crazy since she's the one who was begging to go there for her favorite sandwich).

Needless to say, within two hours, both her and I were getting very sick. I won't go into further details since its unnecessary, but obviously something was wrong with the food today. From portion sizes to the quality and freshness of the ingredients, this place has changed. I'd like to say I'd return, but when I get that sick off of certain foods I won't ever be able to stomach them again.

As a message to Vermont Sandwich Company, please accept this review as constructive feedback and change your establishment back from what it is now to what it used to be. 

Sincerely,
Sad and disappointed customer
