I've eaten here several times in the years we lived in AZ and we used to really like it.  BUT...

What happened?  The prices went through the roof!!  A two taco meal with rice and beans for $10.???  Burritos were $13.???  This is Mexican food folks and in an old dive building...where are the profits going?

On this visit (after the Barrett Jackson auto auction so we were starved) we ordered some basics.  The queso ($6. wow) was almost solid...more like cut a slice out of it.  The Tacos had very little meat (can you stuff more lettuce in that shell?).  The rice and beans were find, but nothing great.

There are too many great Mexican food joints in AZ...don't waste your money on this one anymore.  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
