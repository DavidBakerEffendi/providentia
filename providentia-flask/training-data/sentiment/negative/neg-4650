Horrible Customer Service. I usually love this location but my recent visit was awful. The cashier seem like she was paying no attention because she kept repeating my order wrong and when she repeated it back right she still gave it to me wrong. I said vanilla shake 3 times and she still gave me a strawberry shake. I also ordered fruit side and my grapes had mildew. Disgusting!!! I spent about 45$ and the manager only offered to give me the 3$ back from my fruit. On top of all that the food wasn't enough good. Couldn't enough finish eating it.
