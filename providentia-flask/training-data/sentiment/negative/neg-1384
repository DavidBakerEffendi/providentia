I was nearby getting my eyebrows done and the owner suggested trying boba from tasty crepes. I will admit that I didn't try a crepe here but I ordered 4 boba teas and a mango sticky rice  which came out to $32. Sort of pricey. The worst part was the boba. I live for boba and I like to try it everywhere and this was the worst boba I have ever had. 

I started to sip my tea which had a decent flavor and then I sucked up a boba. The boba was pure mush. There was no chewiness at all. It was so bad that after my sister agreed, we went back in the store and told them that the boba was mushy and asked if they had issues making their batch of boba. The female employee first said "well we have other boba but it would be too chewy and hard." Who says that? Boba is supposed to be chewy. 

Well, then the owner came out and kindly said he would replace the boba in our drinks. He took our same drinks and poured them over the "new" batch of boba. Then he returned our drinks and stated "sorry we were trying to use up the rest of the old boba before we took out the fresh boba. We probably shouldn't have used it"

So if you want leftover boba and then to be told that boba isn't supposed to be chewy, then go here. Otherwise, STAY Away. I'm not even willing to try a crepe based on my experience. I would actually give no stars for knowingly giving their customers "old" boba! At least he replaced it...
