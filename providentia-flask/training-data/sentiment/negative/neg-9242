Wow, was I disappointed by this place. It was both my first time in Vegas and my fifth anniversary, so I wanted it to be special. It was special, but the room had nothing to do with it. 
To start with, the bed, although it had the greatest comforter, had ripped sheets on it. Housekeeping changed them, still ripped, just in a different place. Every time housekeeping was in the room they left something. A rag one day, a bottle of cleaning solution another one. They didn't clean the bathroom very well either. My hair goes everywhere when I dry it and by the fifth day when we left, there was a lovely collection all over the bathroom. 
The place seems to operate on an ignore guests policy. The casino wait staff are rude and to be honest, this was the worst experience I've ever had in a hotel. There's not enough space here to list every reason. I swear thought, I'm not the complaining type, and I didn't here. I just let it suck and counted the days until I could leave this hotel.
I would never ever even consider for a minute staying here again.
