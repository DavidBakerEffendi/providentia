Walked in this morning for breakfast and couldn't bring ourselves to stay. Felt like a barnyard meets trailer park. Hostess and waitstaff covered in tattoos and greasy hair highlighted every color of the rainbow. Sat at a freezing cold table in the middle of this mess and when asked for a booth, was told it was all they had (I counted 3 empty booths). Really??? Then the hostess said "pretty much". Yeah, I don't think so. Decided we wanted a better dining experience, so we left. Not paying for dirty chaos. Sorry. 

Came to the Cracked Egg a very short distance down the road and VERY happy with the service and ambiance.
