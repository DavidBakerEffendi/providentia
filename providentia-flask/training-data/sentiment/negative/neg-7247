This is the worst tapas restaurant I ever been in my entire life. I am an auditor and I travel a lot and it includes a twice a year trip to Barcelona. In addition, I am Latin and I live in Philadelphia where are very good tapas restaurant such as Amada and Tinto (Chef Jose Garces). So, I eat tapas quite often.

I was in town for business and I made the mistake to visit this place. I started with the "Manchego Cheese", "Serrano Ham", and "Chorizo". I use the " " because they gave us a cheese that tasted like mozzarella (or the cheapest manchego cheese), prosciutto and just regular sausage. Horrible!!!

The papas bravas tasted like regular Taco Bell nachos with cheese, the albondigas (lamb meatballs) tasted like school cafeteria meatballs. The gambas alajillo tasted like the chef just fished them from the river. 

We got a meat that was ok. For dessert, they do not even have "crema catalana" !!!!!. 

I think the chef has never been outside Charlotte at all.

HORRIBLE!!!!!
