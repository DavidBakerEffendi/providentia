We went here for dinner on Mothers Day and I was extremely disappointed!  We had a reservation, but had to wait nearly 20 min for a table.  Everyone that walked in was told the party before them was finishing up and their table would be ready soon.  We sat down and the restaurant was very loud.  I ordered the lobster bisque to start and it was really bad.  I typically never send food back, but this honestly tasted like it was bad.  My dad ordered the swordfish, it came with a sauce on top that was cold, and appeared to be separating.  I ordered the king crab legs, they appeared to be snow crab legs.  I had to request a dish of butter to dip them in, and when they brought it the butter was cold and thick.  They lit a candle under it, but that didn't do much.  I've never ordered crab legs that didn't come with butter, and they didn't bring a side plate to put the shells on.  The service was terrible as well.  We asked for refills on coffee, they never came.  I'd recommend walking across the parking lot to Roy's, not wasting your evening and money here.
