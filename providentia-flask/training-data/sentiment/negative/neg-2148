Worst place i have ever been in my life. I came here for lunch on my birthday. I had a stomach virus the night before and was throwing up, couldnt eat. So i was STARVING when i got to this place.  We got the guac appetizer and we specifically asked the waitress if it was going to be enough guac for us 3 girls, she said yes plenty of guac. When we got it, it was so tiny and definitely not enough guac. It was also $15. There was probably half of an avocado of guac in the bowl. Crazy ridiculously expensive and it wasnt even good!!! It didnt taste fresh. It was DEFINITELY pre-made! 

Then i asked the older blonde waitress lady if i should get the shrimp salad or the shrimp tacos, and told her that i was starving. She said the shrimp tacos are more hearty and filling. So i got them. (i dont eat meat or chicken so the shrimp dishes were my only option on the lunch menu)

there were 2 tacos and they were SOOOOOO FREAKING TINY!!!!! Holy shit 
i thought she was joking when she brought it out. It didnt even have any sides that came with it. The diameter of the opened taco was 3 inches. With 3 little tiny baby shrimps in it. Thats it. I asked them to put the slaw on the side that came on the tacos and the habanero sauce on the side, this came with no sides. I finished eating within 90 seconds of receiving my meal. I left starving and hungrier than when i got there!!!! The tacos were $20 btw. So expensive for NOTHING!!!! 

The restaurant was empty the entire time we were there. So overpriced and ridiculously small portions, i would never go back even if they paid me or fed me for free. Ill never forget how disappointed i was
