This place closes between 3 to 5:30pm everyday! They are so lazy, they don't even bother to turn the OPEN sign off. Really, is this such a high-end restaurant that we aren't worthy of getting served outside core meal times? This place just opened up, so if the management running the place had half a brain, they wouldn't turn away customers so that their lazy cooks and servers can take their afternoon nap.
