No way to give no stars. I was served raw chicken. I only caught it with the flash from my phone because lighting was so dim. I told the waiter who said he would tell the chef. No one came to apologize by the time I left. I stopped by a pharmacy on the way home for stomach relief medicine in anticipation of a very long night spent next to the porceline bowl...  :-(
