Manager was incredibly rude and gave us terrible service.

We came in at 10pm when they close at 12 and the server informed us she was the manager. We ordered a few appetizers and she commented that we ordered too much. 

No water refills, extremely rude,and as we left she screamed at us that we needed to bring her the bill even though we left cash on the table....
