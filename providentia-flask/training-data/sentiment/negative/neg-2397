Came in here for the first time and was disappointed.  I ordered a simple pour over drip coffee and picked 12 oz size, since this place looks fancy I thought they will do drip coffee fresh for me, but I saw them went to the back, and just pour in the left over coffee they've made (not sure how long ago) into my cup, when I received the cup it feels light, so I opened it and notice it's not even 75% full, so I asked the barista nicely if he can please refill it for me since I paid for 12 oz and NOT less than 8 oz, he went back and brew me some more fresh one....but my goodness, how lazy can you be? I'm very disappointed and will not ever come back.
