There is quite literally, no reason to consider staying here. The price is on the low end of average, but you can stay at so many better spots that actually have:
* clean rooms (housekeeping at the Serene is spotty at best, carpets are filthy, curtains are shabby, some days you don't even get clean towels)
* comfortable bed (Serene beds are old, uneven and lumpy)
* functional internet (the Serene wifi coverage is terrible. Maybe 6 rooms in the entire hotel have a decent connection, most won't even let you check email)
* air conditioning (our group had 3 rooms with no air conditioning the entire week, and no one ever came to fix it!) 
* breakfast that doesn't come out of a plastic wrapper

When you are trying to so Vegas on the cheap, look for deals anywhere but here. This hotel will leave you feeling anything but Serene
