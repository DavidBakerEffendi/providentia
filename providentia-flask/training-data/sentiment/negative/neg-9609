NO. Don't go. I thought it was a great concept but their implementation of the Mexican/Asian idea was far from meeting any kind of expectations. I wanted to be able to come in and look at a menu and order easily and quickly. Instead, the girl said not to look at their menu up on the wall because it wasn't the real one. HUH???? Instead we should look at this laminated picture thingy she held out to us that explained the various plates and sides, etc. and told us we needed to sample each little dish before deciding. I had no time to do any such silly thing! 

I lost my patience so I just ordered a quesadilla and then sat down to wait for Eric to finish his order. He ordered some weird combo dish for himself that actually wasn't too bad. The place itself was a little strange. It was almost as though they had very first opened their doors hastily without finishing the details... the "fake" misleading menu, for one; and the lack of decor, for two. A few objects here and there suggested it was a mix of Hispanic and Asian, but it just felt empty and had no character or enthusiasm. Especially in the folks taking orders.
