We went here 5 months ago or so and they were OK.  Not great but not horrible if you had the 2-for-1 coupon.  They were very busy with most tables full and the food was pretty fresh for a buffet.  We went back today and boy had they gone downhill.  There were only about 10 tables in use with only 2 waitresses for the whole restaurant, not a good sign.  The food was old and dried out, the sushi was horrible, the desserts were pathetic, and the quality was totally gone.  Even with the 2-for-1 coupon we felt ripped off paying only $10 each.  I don't know what happened, but we won't ever go back again unless they make drastic changes.  The way it looked today I would be surprised if they even stay in business much longer!
