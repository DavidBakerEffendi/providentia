Let me fist say that I do like On The Border. I have had good meals at two other occasions  and everything was great. 
Not the case here. The waiter in the bar was a minimalist which is not good when your in the service industry. I'm not sure he's aware what industry he's in. 
Food was not good. Black beans tasted like they were poured from a can to my bowl. Barely any chicken in the tacos. 
Has to ask my waiter for water and he still couldn't complete the task. Ugh.
