I was very disappointed in my visit today. From looking at other's reviews, it seems like Archi's takeout service is horrible. I can definitely agree. When I called this afternoon, no one picked up the phone. I called again and placed my order at 1:17. The lady said she will "see me in 25 minutes." We got there at 1:44. The food should have been ready by then, right? We waiting until almost 2:15 to get our food.. I placed my order almost an hour ago. My boyfriend had to wave down a server 3-4 times. I ordered spicy level 4 and 5 on my dishes and they were not spicy at all. Portions were lacking for paying over 10 dollars for 1 pad thai dish. I've dined in here before and it actually replaced Thai Style Noodle House for a while. Don't think I will be coming back though.
