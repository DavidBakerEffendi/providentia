Smallest sandwich ever and very expensive by the way! I'm so disappointed! I paid $10.89 for a tiny sandwich with only veggies and 2 extra thin slices of avocado. I was asking questions to the cashier (by the way she didn't smile at all), she had to ask a question to the manager. The manager was super rude! I can't believe they treat customers like that! The cashier said my sandwich was going to take 10 minutes. Guess what?! It took longer cause they made a mistake with my order. The cashier brought me the sandwich when it was ready. She didn't say thank you. They don't know anything about customer service! My fries were very salty! 

I have been here twice and have had very bad impression about their service both times!
