Valentine's Day. Came to this restaurant with girlfriend and friends. After a DJ playing all types of music, I decide to play $5 of music from the jukebox. After 2 songs, the volume level was noticeably turned down. I walk up to the owner, Peter Young drinking in the back of the bar, and ask him what gives. He says to me "you can't play that type of music in here." To add insult to injury,  he condescendingly peels off $10 and tells me "here's your money back and buy a shot on me." After spending $55 in his bar, the last thing I wanted was a shot. I asked simply for my money back. He doesn't take his money back and tells me if "I don't like it the get the F out." On Valentine's Day, in front of my friends. I walked out and that place will never get another cent from me.
