Horrible experience coming here yesterday. I received a 10% discount coupon, ordered 2 large platters, worth over $100. I timed my day accordingly so i am back home in time before my guests arrives. I had to go pick up other hot food trays from other restaurants first. Went to Ai to pick up my order last before heading home. I presented the 10% discount coupon i had, the cashier tells me it is only 10% discount if paid by cash. I emphasized that nowhere on the 10% discount card does it say 'cash only'. The cashier then tells me i can pay by credit card and not have 10% discount applied, or go to the bank and get the discount.  I didn't want to have hot foods in my car get cold so i paid by credit card and not get the discount.
The 10% discount coupon is very misleading. Can't believe they let me leave with a horrible experience like that. I won't be returning.
