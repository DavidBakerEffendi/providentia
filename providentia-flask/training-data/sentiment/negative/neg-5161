One star for the waitress for being nice. I ordered the chicken and the lamb shawarma plates for dinner since I saw the 4 1/2 star review on yelp. The waitress recommended that these plates are their most popular dishes people order. We took a few bites of the meats and my husband asked me what meat is this? The chicken and lamb was tasteless and way too salty. We had to throw it in the trash and make an omelette for dinner instead.

Maybe we are used to California and New York Mediterranean restaurant..stupid husband make me move to the epicurean wasteland.
