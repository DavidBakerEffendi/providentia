Played this course with my daughter and I   was mortified at the condition of this course...it was like an abandoned course that someone was collecting fees for!!  The range is in such disrepair it made me sick!  Had I NOT promised my daughter we would go out and play....I would have never stayed....btw did I mention this fiasco of a course cost $40 for a 10yr old and myself.  GROSSLY disappointed!!!!
