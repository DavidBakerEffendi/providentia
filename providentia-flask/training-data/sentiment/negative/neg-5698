FOOD: had the caccio e pepe which was very good. Pizza was average. 

PRICE: believe it was $24 for a plate of entree sized pasta which is expensive in my book. Even Eataly doesn't charge this much and we're not talking about the Batali's, Camellini's or Michael White's of the world. 

FAKE: however, the restaurant pretends to have Aesop hand soaps in the bathroom. But in reality, they bought 1 bottle and then refilled it with cheap pink commercial soap. What a joke. Think people wouldn't know any better?

Can't support restaurants that act high end but are CHEAP and FAKE. 

Will stick with eating at high end Italian restaurants in NYC and making pasta while in Toronto.
