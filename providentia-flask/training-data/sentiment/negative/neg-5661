I just want to say straight of the bat this is the worst place to eat. We went here with family to have lunch, the service was ok.
We ordered cheese pizza for toddler from kids menu, and bourbon chicken and shrimp along with Shrimp stir fry vegetables.
All the food was tasteless and it felt like none of the ingredients used were fresh, especially the cheese on the pizza was horrible. None of us could even finish half of the food, it was that bad.
After leaving we all felt like puking..I would never go there again to eat..
