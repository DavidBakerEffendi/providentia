Take Home Message: Terrible quality, Terrible value for money.
If you really crave good Indian, try going to Tamarind, Prince of India, or All India (all places are less than 1-2 miles from Yuva India, much cheaper and authentic).

Long Rant Follows:

This place continuously disappoints me (and it is the opinion of my non-yelper Indian friends too). It serves the most pricey and "fraud Indian" cuisine I have ever had. Having spent more than 20 years in India, I can say this with authority. Here are some instances when I felt like walking out of this place
1. Masala Chai: The chai served here is without milk. Any Indian can tell you that this is just plain wrong.
2. Pav Bhaji: I was served pav bhaji with a Naan instead of an American sandwich-bread, as is the dish all over India. It is hard to imagine that in the USA it was tough to get this ingredient.
3. Tadka Daal: I get the most bland daal I have had in my life. Obviously, there is no tadka at all.

At all occassions I have informed the management only to get replies like "We alter the menu to better serve American tastes". Don't get me wrong, I agree that one can change spices/recipes etc. However, all the above instances are outrageous. To those who cannot relate - it is like being served Falafel with a burger bread, without any warning.

And of course, the price here doesn't justify there quality of service or dishes. This is the priciest Indian restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh.
In my opinion, going to "Taste of India" in the CMU campus is a much better deal. Taste of India in the campus is much cheaper, authentic but serves a repetitive menu.
