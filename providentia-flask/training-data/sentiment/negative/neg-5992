NASTY, UNCLEAN ROOMS. Crawled into bed next to a nightstand covered in someone's trimmed finger nails. Couldn't call down to the front desk because both the phone's in my room were broken so I sat on hold on my cell phone for ten minutes. Got an apology and was offered to switch rooms or someone to come and disinfect it. I'm in bed in my PJ's, fully unpacked and not about to switch rooms at 11:30 pm at night. We were told someone would be up in a minute and now it's ten minutes later and no one is here yet. I have to up at 6 am for a conference and I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs waiting for someone to come and disinfect my night night stand.

When I pay $350 a night to be here, I'm abhorred at their level of customer service. How about giving me back $300 since a $50 hotel room would be cleaner than this one?? There is a serious lack of attention to detail in this resort and the manager was clearly sick of dealing with people like me so she didn't even try to make up for how disgusting it was for me to crawl into bed next to someone's disgusting fingernails. Oh... and there were some nails on the floor too. Great. Won't be staying here again.
