Came in On A Sunday before the church crowd 11:30, service was terrible  and slow. Guy only had 3 tables. His greeting was, are you ready to order?  We asked for salad, dressing on the side. He came back and said, i forgot to ask if you want soup or salad. Salad then took forever. Food came slow and was cold. This just affirmed my decision to stop eating out.
