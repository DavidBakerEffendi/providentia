We came at night. The place was about 90% full. The service was horrible. I tried to give them a chance by thinking maybe theyre just short staffed but after watching the servers just stand around I changed my mind.

I got the brownie with ice cream. The brownie tasted old and store bought. I had it with strawberry ice cream but the ice cream didnt taste good either. When they had brought my order they forgot utensils. I had to ask twice for utensils. By the time i got it, my ice cream was about half melted.

You're better off going to Demetres.
