I was told by my roommate that this was a great spot around the corner from our house.... I was extremely disappointed. Never seen so many people on such a short cooking line take 30 minutes to make a scrabble and a waffle with only 1 order for a party of 5 ahead of us... multi tasking is not this staffs strong point. My biggest issue was the only flavors I could describe was burnt sausage and bacon. I would go into further details but not really into writing a book so I will just end with finding any other option would be the best alternative... Carl's Jr. Across the street perhaps.
