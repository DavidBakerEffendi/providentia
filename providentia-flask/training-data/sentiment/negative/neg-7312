It went downhill. 
It was breakfast but all the free alcohol can't make this better. They cut down on the service and made it all self serve ( drinks).

Our waitress came back with some paper napkins saying something about  how she found them and was sharing the loot with us. Aren't you supposed to know where the napkins are kept?
