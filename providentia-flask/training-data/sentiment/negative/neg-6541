Terrible service. They can only serve bottles of beer and bar rail shots. No creativity or skill with cocktails. And everything is watered down. Food is typical fried crap, but they will only make it if 'they have time'. Deplorable. The woman who owns the place, 'Angie' is rude and apparently overcharges customers on a regular basis. Beware!
