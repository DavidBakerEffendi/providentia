I honestly can't comprehend how this establishment managed to rack up 3 stars. The service was absolutely horrid. It took nearly 30 minutes for us to get our water. Actually, let me rewind.

We walked in, and had to wait 10 minutes to be seated even though there were several open tables available. We ordered the Zataar with cheese, but did not receive the Zataar until the cheese had gotten cold (about a 20 minute gap). We also got a salad with falafels. The falafels arrived roughly 10 minutes after the salad. 

Both main courses arrived after about a 30 minute wait during which time we were forced to nibble on the complimentary pita (which, thankfully was warm). The management at this joint needs to rethink what on earth its doing having one server wait on 9 tables. 

If the food had come warm and on time I guess it would have been passable, but it gets 1 star for the complimentary pita.
