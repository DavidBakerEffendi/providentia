Avoid this restaurant!!!

In the biggest hotel in the world with 39 restaurants, this should be your last choice.
The ambient is terrible: really bright lights, a high ceiling and a really open space reminds me of a mess hall from a outpost. The windows are really big and the restaurant partially open, which makes you feel like in a shop window and exposed. The noise from the Cassino mixes up with the noise from the kitchen.

The menu is out of laminated paper: compared to leather covers from the other 29 restaurants, it looks cheap.

The service is friendly but does not talk fluent English. The food gets thrown to your table in less than 5 min after ordering: it was pre-cooked!

The taste of the food is terrible. A lot of grease, duck with feathers yet and no spices at all on the food. Did I mentioned greasy??

The value for money is absence, since I can get a great spaghetti with sea food for the same price in at least three other restaurants in the resort.

One star for the friendly service and for the food not making me sick!
