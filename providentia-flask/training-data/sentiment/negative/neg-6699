I've been here and never had a problem until last night. A sign that stated 2 for 1 pastor tacos sat in front of the registar pretty good sized sign. My boyfriend ordered 3 pastor tacos, so I asked what was your total he said 8 something at that point I knew he was over charged. I got the attention of the lady at the registar and brought it to her attention and asked her would she prefer to do a refund or just give us another taco. She stated she needed to ask the other lady who put the sign out when we drove up. She spoke with the woman and the woman said "oh when you order you have to tell us" At that point I have to get out of character at what point do I have to tell you how to do your damn job with the sign you placed out I shouldn't have went there in the first place they have a fucking B Grade (BBBB Grade). I could understand if there was a language barrier but my boyfriend is Cuban and speaks perfect Spanish and spoke with the woman in such language so to say there just some no good scammers who don't honor there signs they put out. I'll just go that extra mile to my friends on Bonanza and Las Vegas Blvd and there tacos are .50 cheaper.
