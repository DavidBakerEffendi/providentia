I went to Grazie with my family, visiting from out of town. It was cold out that eve so I requested the front door be closed. The waitress told me, "We are supposed to keep it open." Not a very accommodating voice or comment. I looked around and the only reason I could see for this was that the woodfired oven is in the direct path of the air from the front door. GOD FORBID THE COOK GET HOT while he is making our pizza. We, and the other patrons ate pizza with our COATS ON. Really? The pizza isn't as good as it used to be. And the service BLOWS.
