horrible service.. walked in with my daughter..There were 3 other tables being served and 1 server..The server was extremely slow.I had to ask for both regular menu and the kids menu.I had to even ask for the crayons...I had to even call her over to take my order after 10 minutes of waiting... we wanted Turkey bacon and she said they ran out...I walked out...after the terrible service, her saying she doesn't have what we want I didn't feel like giving them my service.
