TL;DR (points 1-4 are explained below) I even made a Yelp account to make this review.
1. Server gave me attitude when I asked where my food was after 40 minutes
2. Sashimi/sushi wasn't the best, everything lacked variety 
3. Green tea actually costed money (like a 3-4 dollars/each) in a Japanese restaurant. Lol. 
4. They make the machines automatic tip to be 18%, 25%, other. Some older folks have no idea how to use the credit card machines and set it to another %age. The audacity to even go to 18% when their food and service is shit amazes me.

This is the most ridiculous place I've ever been to. You'd think that in a high end shopping mall, they would have good service. This is the second time I've come here, and they absolutely did not redeem themselves whatsoever. Second time is going to be described here: 

1. The server was atrocious. She's this middle-aged lady with short hair and clips on her fringe (not hating on short hair and clips, just trying to describe her so that you can identify her in the future). We waited 40 minutes for 3 orders (2 chirashi + 1 ginzo?ginko?) because the people beside us ordered a lot. Here was the dialogue: 

Me: *No attitude, I even smiled*  Excuse me miss, I was just wondering where our order is. We waited for a while now and just wanted to know what's the status. 

Her: *Frowned + lots of attitude* So just wait 10 more minutes. They have a big order and you can wait. 

Me: Okay. Thanks.

Excuse me what? If within the 40 minutes, someone had walked up to me and said "Hey guys, sorry for the wait! The other table has a big order and yours will be coming in the next 20 minutes." I'd have nothing to say. Reasonable. But this lady gave me attitude for asking where my food was and it left me fuming. I was bringing my parents out for a nice dinner and the mood was totally ruined. 

Also, this is a personal thought (+ I have never worked in the food industry so I have no idea if this thought is reasonable or not), if the other table has 10 orders and we had 3, isn't it possible to give them a few orders first (3-5), work on ours while they eat, serve us ours and then work on theirs? Whatever, I wouldn't know. All my knowledge about serving is from Flo's diner and some other apps. 

2. The food was underwhelming. The chirashi was actually just 3/5 rice, 1/5 vegetables, 1/5 actual sashimi. There was so much rice that even if I ordered another side of sashimi, I'd still have rice left over. There were 2 avocados, 2 cucumbers, a whole bunch of tasteless white shredded carrots, leaves and a daffodil. Then for the sashimi, it was just chewy octopus (bad), one salmon, eel (unagi), 2 other sashimi I don't recall and 2 eggs (tamago). It looks good trust me, but it tasted unsatisfying. Plus it wasn't sashimi soy sauce lol. So that means that the soy sauce is super salty just like me. 

3. Why would you charge for green tea?? I don't understand. I go to these quaint little Japanese restaurants and they give green tea for free. I don't remember how much it was ($3.99 or less??) but still! I don't remember because one of the girls actually saw how poor the server's manners was and quickly came over to say that the tea was on the house. So that's why there's one star. If not, I would've found a way to code into the Yelp system a 0/5 star. 

4. The tip machine % option makes it so that you give 18%/25%/other. I'm sure some older/not tech-savvy folks have fallen for this because they don't know how to change the options. This is fricken ridiculous. 18%??? Are you FRIED. They have the audacity to charge this much tip with these servers + food quality? Hell no. 


Thanks for listening, don't go to this place - you'd be better off to go to Loblaws and go get a green dragon roll for $8.99. 

*Also side note, at Donburi, a big bowl of salad, green tea, and miso soup are complementary. Everything here was tiny - small ass cube (literally a cube bowl), with 1 inch deep of soup + 2 strands of noodles - i shit you not. Then miso soup was $4 and green tea was $3 or something.
