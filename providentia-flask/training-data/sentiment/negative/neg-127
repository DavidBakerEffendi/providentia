I ate at BLD tonight, which was the first time in awhile to eat there and I know it's going to be a long while until I eat there again! The WORSE service I have ever had!!!!!!!! Not only was the table I was at getting bad service I noticed the four other tables in the restaurant were getting just as neglected. Our waitress seemed too busy making herself a cappuccino and leaning against the bar to talk to the bar guest than it was to refill myself and guests drink for 45 minutes. We had empty drinks throughout the whole dinner up until we left because she would not refill them. She never came by to quality check the food either or even just a walk by. I heard another table complaining about the service as well. She concluded the dinner by slamming the check down on the table and continue walking. There was no manager in sight for us to talk to. Overall, it was the worse dining experience ever. The food is good but that does not outweigh the horrible service. I recommend going somewhere else with the whole package.
