Oh my goodness! This place has the worst service of any place I have ever been. They ignore you. And it is a very small place. There were only five people in the whole interior of the building. We are literally less than six feet away and yet they acted like we were invisible. Yet we left him a nice tip. I'm not sure why? I guess it was because we wanted to show them that we were better people than they were.
