What a sh*tty place... It says "Restaurant & Cafe" but don't expect to find any food here! I walked in and asked for a menu to see what they have, the guy looked at me like I was ridiculous for even asking and said "uhhh we don't have food it's like... a shisha bar" and raised his eyebrows at me, giving me a look as if to say "are you stupid or something?". Suffice it to say, he was EXTREMELY rude! If the establishment calls itself a "Restaurant & Cafe, you'd think they would expect to have people asking for FOOD! Ridiculous. And despite the Drake shout-outs, the place isn't all that! I've seen way better hookah joints!
