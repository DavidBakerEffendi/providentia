I had just finished shopping at the dispensary next door when I saw the window ads outside that caught my eye, I couldn't resist and decided let's try this place out. 
I ordered a honeydew and pineapple smoothie and let's just say it was AWFUL. At first I regretted my smoothie combination but I soon realized that it was just WAY TOO SWEET. I also order a club sandwich on white bread... I threw that out too... I spent $11 and left still thirsty and twice as hungry.
