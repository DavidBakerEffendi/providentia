After placing an order, one single solitary plate of sushi arrived shortly. Then... We waited... We waited some more... And finally after waiting for 20 minutes for the rest of the food, our server came back to ask if we needed anything else or if we wanted the check... (What check? We only had one plate arrive. We've been waiting on the rest of the food.... my girlfriend does not eat raw fish and the only plate that arrived was nigiri that I ordered. 

What I found particularly annoying after the wait was that the server never apologized, never said sorry once. Instead, she proceeded to explain that in this type of situation, this is never the servers fault it's the kitchen's. I don't care whose fault it is, she should have apologized on their behalf, even if it's not her fault. 

I'm not the type of person to ask for it, but nothing was taken off the bill.
