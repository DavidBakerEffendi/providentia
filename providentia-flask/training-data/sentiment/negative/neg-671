Emeril has nothing to worry about.  I've never tasted burnt water before, but now I have.  Too bad my husband ordered it thinking he was getting seafood gumbo.  But wait!  There's More!  Ever had etouffe?  Not like this you haven't.  Imagine Campbell's Tomato Soup (with added cornstarch) poured over poor unsuspecting shrimp.  Yes, shrimp, even though I had ordered Crawfish toffe.  The shrimp tails were no clue to the waitress that she had the order wrong.  I don't even want to go into the sad excuse for a salad with Too Much Mustard, Too Much Basalmic Dressing.  Those of you who visit Las Vegas will probably not run into this off the Strip restaurant and now all Yelpers can avoid it, too.
