The Venetian is already beginning to show its age. The room decor is stuffy and old looking, the furniture is scuffed up and scratched and few rooms have good views, instead just seeming to look out on the casino's roof. The casino itself is maddeningly confusing and impossible to navigate, more so than a normal Vegas Casino. The staff is snooty and often makes promises they can't deliver on. Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for anything. The food in the casino area is overpriced and greasy.  For the price, you could choose any number of much better suites in other hotels.
