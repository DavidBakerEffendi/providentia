spent $100 last night with $15 tip on top of that for the WORST food and customer service.

ordered lollipop chicken, masala fries, haleem, fish curry, chicken curry, garlic naan, butter naan.  Everything but the lollipop chicken were fresh and worth eating.

It was my first time and LAST time.  the owner with trimmed beard all the way to serving staff is full of attitude.  We had number of issues with the order and they won't even look at us.  We had been waiting for water, no water came.  we had issue with the plates and glasses, UNCLEANED and they never apologized.

I hope the management reads this message and learn from other successful restaurants.
