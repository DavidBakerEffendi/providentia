I rarely leave reviews but after my recent (first and last) experience, I felt compelled.

We went in on a Sunday around 9pm to get some takeout and waited by the counter for at least 15 minutes before anyone took our order. Multiple staff members walked by us and it was pretty clear they noticed us waiting, but still nothing. The guy who finally took our order stood chatting / joking around with a table for at least ten minutes before acknowledging us.

I looked back and noticed that the couple who had come in just after us were standing waiting to be seated for 15 minutes as well. There were tons of open tables and tons of waiters waking around doing nothing, but the couple was completely ignored. They looked pissed and finally left.

After they finally took our order, we waited for 30 minutes for our food. I noticed the chefs in the kitchen joking around. One was just standing there the entire time talking to the other chefs.

We finally got our food after one hour total in that place. We also ordered a large milkshake but they gave us a small. We were not willing to wait for another milkshake because it took them a long time just to get the original milkshake, so we left without telling them.

In terms of the food itself, the fries were pretty good (it's hard to mess up fries). The burgers were extremely plain tasting and dry. So not worth the wait.
