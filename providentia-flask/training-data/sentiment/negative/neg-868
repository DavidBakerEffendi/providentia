I have been to Duckworths 5-6 times and I can say that it has gotten progressively worse each time I've gone back. The food is SUPER average and the only thing that happens consistently here is that the service is horrible. Last nights server decided it was more important to hang out in the bar and flirt with coworkers than it was to come and take our order. Food arrived, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap. No buffalo sauce to be found and when I asked the server about it his reply was "it's a buffalo chicken wrap for sure but there just isn't much buffalo sauce". So instead of fixing it, he went back to the bar to hang out with coworkers. And if anyone ever tells you that their BBQ is good, they're lying. We orders the BBQ and it came out looking like mushy slop. And it tasted a little suspect. I'm pretty sure that it was frozen and then thawed and served. Completely bush league. The only reason that I have this place even 1 star was because of the beer selection. On a contrast, the location in Ballantyne does a great job! But this place? Stay away
