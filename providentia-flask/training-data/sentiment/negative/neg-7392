I have had this store lose my order, take three hours to deliver one pizza and if you call to order within an hour of them closing, they will literally hang up on you half of the time. I love pizza hut but i can't stand having to deal with this store. I wish there was another one I could order from but everywhere I call says I have to order from this one because it's closest to me. So I guess I just can't order pizza hut anymore.
