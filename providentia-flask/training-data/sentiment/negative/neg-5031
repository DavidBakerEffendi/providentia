Well, my first time was typical mediocre KFC. An inoffensive, pressure-fried chicken meal.  Then I made the bold, yet stupid decision to dine here again. The results of my second experience can only be described as gastric distress probably due to the unsanitary conditions another reviewer mentioned. So, yeah, never again. Not this location. Because if I give them three strikes, it might end up in a stomach pumping.
