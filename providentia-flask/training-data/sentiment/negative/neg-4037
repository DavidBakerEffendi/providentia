worst restaurant experience this year.    The food is bland, frozen pizza crust,  barely edible.   The salmon sandwich was sickeningly sweet; who marinates salmon in sugar??   There is no rhyme or reason to entering this place and figuring out where you're supposed to go and where you're supposed to order.   I'm sure it would be fine for just a coffee or beer, but I highly discourage ordering food.    To make matters worse,  I asked the cashier how long my food would take when I ordered, she said 7-10 minutes- it took 30.  No apologies other than "sorry we're real behind."   
I am not outrageously picky,  but the three things we ordered were all unappealing. I like supporting local biz, but come on people. 
oh,  and coffee sucked.   The end.
