Wow what a total bs ....
We went last night .. we sat at the bar like always But it was so different  did not  feel well come at all after waiting  for a bit the pretty blonde ask the other female  bartender  to teke our order but she got her own stuff to do finally she talked to work order very simple couple appetizers to start a beer and drink for my wife
She pour the beer and she told me well your wife drink take long time you going to have to wait..........
Wash glassware  first ..
Fix her hair a couple  times .....

Even fixing her shirt in.. well putting her hand on her ass....
Greeting the new party of six the sat .... $$$$$$$$$$ autograt. Gratuity include  on that party I presumed..u
Well finally she make my wifes drink seems like it was the first time it was making a drink at the bar no wonder she stays with the long time the drink didn't taste right we told her and we just get a beer for my wife that will be quick and she is still charging me for the drink......
Totally a bad experience 
She is not a bartender  just a pretty  blonde  may I add ...
The other bartender  well I been there before  and always nice and efficient..
Please train or put people there they know how to do their jobs... 
Yeah i'll return but I see her a walk the fuck out .
