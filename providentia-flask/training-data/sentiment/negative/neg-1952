As other reviewers have mentioned, the food court has really taken a big dive in quality and taste. I usually eat here every time I shop for my basic korean supplies.
Most of the dishes I ordered were tasteless and old. Even my old standby, fried korean dumplings was tasteless and greasy. Also the personal hygiene of the front cashier/food handler was outrageous. She was coughing and sneezing into her hand and not washing. Just could not take it! Won't be coming back again.
