it was restaurant week. we read over the menu & loved it. i called & left a message for a reservation. No one returned my call by the next afternoon, so i called again. i spoke with a man that said he was so sorry, but they had had a gas leak & ended up closed for a few days. we made reservations for tues., the 23rd at 6pm. he had my name  & #.
we live in the s. hills, they're in etna. tom left work early so he could come home & shower. we left & fought through rush hour traffic in 2 directions. we pulled up across the street from it, trying to find it. finally, we saw it, dark! dark, dark, dark!!! my hubby went to the door. there was a note saying, sorry, we're closed still from a gas leak & frozen pipes! WHAT??? we just drove all the way over here, for nothing?! they didn't even have the decency to call us! 
NOT a good thing at all! i didn't want to give them any stars, but i had to, so they just get 1.
