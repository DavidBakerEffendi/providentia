Went again last night at 7 pm with four other people, spent $270 total. Went out to eat with others less than 4 hours later because we were all hungry. I get they are small servings, and I understand the concept of a tapas restaurant. But let's be clear: The cheeseboard with 3 small dapples each the size of dice for $12 is an inside joke on the customer. 

I appreciate Great restaurants, but will go to La toile or Harvest or Tornado from now on, or buy $200 of the finest items at Whole Foods. This was disappointing, and a feeling we left with before...all but the first time we went when portions were small, but not minuscule. 

Won't be here again, after 5 tries.
