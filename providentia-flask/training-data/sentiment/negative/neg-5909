5 of us.  Bill $101 (tip not included).  BELOW average diner food.  WAY, way below average.  Arrived Friday morning at 11am.  30 minute wait.  Super busy.  Neon everywhere.  Cool exterior, we were pumped and ready to eat!  service was efficient.  Most of us got breakfast, and only one got a sandwich.  All the breakfast food (hashbrowns, omelettes, chicken friend steak) was just blah blah blah.  Sure, larger portions, but NOTHING was amazing or above average.  I can't stress enough how BELOW average their food was.  Not worth the wait.  Not worth the energy.  Staff even got mad for two of our group smoking in the "fire lane" -- they were standing NOT in a car.  WEIRD.  where are you supposed to smoke during a 30 minute wait?  will never be back.  why is this place soooooo popular I'll never understand.
