Food is not good. Wings were dry and they serve them in a pool of fatty sauce. The beer selection is alright, but it wasn't very cold. Ordered chicken nachos, they put beef based chili on them and it didn't appear to state that on the menu. There are better choices but all in all the place is a big disappointment. I don't think you should have to ask if they are going to put beef, on chicken nachos and when I questioned the waitress she said that all nachos have chili on them, like I was from Mars. We will not go back.
