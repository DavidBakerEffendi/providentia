I ordered here and the pizza tracker said my order arrived in 20 minutes. 15 minutes later I call the store because it still wasn't here. They said delivery left 15 minutes early and it should be here any second. An hour after ordering it still wasn't here. I called the manager who wasn't willing to offer any help or assistance or even give an update on what was going on with the delivery then hung up on me. I will not ever use this Dominos again. Pizza finally arrived and they already had my credit card. I guess I'm the sucker.
