Went there tonight for the happy hour, excited because it was nearby and looking for another cool wine bar. Asked a number of times about the happy hour and they didn't seem too clear. I tried to confirm a number of times that I wanted happy hour price and looked at the flyer posted on the wall that said five dollar wine until eight. Asked again for happy hour and ordered a drink. When we got our bill each of our glasses were $11 and not five dollars. They said they could take one dollar off each class. That is ridiculous!  I won't be back, bummer. We were talking about having events there with the new area they were opening but I think I will pass.
