I had heard such great things about this place and I was excited to try it, but I was quickly disappointed. First, the people working the counter took a while to acknowledge me and then seemed confused when I asked for a doughnut and also annoyed that I took a minute to look for what I wanted. Then, as I was eating the doughnut I found some blue dots on the bottom that I can only assume were mold.

So, if you want rude people feeding you expired food, this is your spot.
