It is amazing how inefficiently run this establishment is. I honestly believe the reason why this place has an extensive wait is because they do not know how to function efficiently. Sure, the food is good, and their menu has something for everyone, but that won't keep people coming back when their service is so terribly slow and poorly run. 

Tonight was just a night to come in a get a slice of to-go cheesecake. Not a sit down meal, but just a cheesecake slice from the counter, boxed up to enjoy at home (as they were on a three hour wait at 8pm). I was able to walk up, choose my two slices from the counter and pay in record time, and was informed it would be about five minutes. Well, fast forward 40, that's right FORTY, minutes, I was still standing there, waiting for my to-go cheesecake. There were at least 6 employees behind the counter, but maybe 3 doing work. When my name was finally called, I gladly accepted my order, then stepped away to check it. Well, one of my cheesecakes was wrong, so back to the counter I went, where I was informed, rather rudely, that it would be about 20 minutes for my correct slice....that I could still see, sitting in the case. Rather than waiting, I just took the cheesecakes and left. 

I'm not sure the deliciousness of the cheesecakes can counter the amazingly poor experience I just went through.
