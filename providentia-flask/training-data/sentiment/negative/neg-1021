Nasty. First time I've ever felt DIZZY from eating something. I discovered that the crab rangoon was acceptable, and the red-bean filled donuts were actually kinda good. Otherwise, nothing else even tastes much like food. And that's my opinion after trying one plate of the least unappetizing things I saw. Both my partner and I had seriously uncomfortable stomachs afterwards.
If I had to go here again, I'd just eat a million red bean donuts. But I'm pretty sure we won't have the misfortune of being invited here by someone again.
