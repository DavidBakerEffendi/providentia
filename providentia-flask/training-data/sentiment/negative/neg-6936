One star for service only- very friendly and welcoming. And we move on. Chips & salsa (red finely blended & green avocadoey/tomatillo- better of the 2) were bland which should have been a sign of what was coming. Nothing with red sauce anywhere on the menu. Ordered chimichanga & beef fajita stuffed avocado.  Chimichanga came smothered in what can best be described as watered down canned Campbell's nacho cheese soup. Refried beans also appeared to be canned as they turned white as they sat on the plate. Stuffed avocado was crunchy and hard with chewy cheese inside. Tortilla soup was basic vegetable soup with tortilla strips & covered with a thick layer of onion soup cheese. Bland seems to be the going word here. Even the asked for Tapatio bottled sauce was bland. No spices. No jalapenos. Nothing TexMex about this place. Honestly this is what I would picture TexMex food would be like at either an Iowa preschool or senior center (where people require bland diets). Listening to other tables we heard "odd, strange and this is horrible" by people describing their meals and drinks. Sorry, won't be back.
