My husband and I wanted to have dinner here. I went to the bathroom while he put our name in. 

He texted me telling me a table for two would be 30-35 minutes. As I was walking to meet him , a gentleman walked up and was told he could be sat right away for a table for two. 

The difference between the gentleman I saw and my husband ?

My husband is wearing a pressed $350 business suit and tie. The gentleman causal jeans and tee shirt. 

The major difference to the hostess ? My husband is pacific island. The gentleman was white.  

It gets better, I am pale redhead and I asked how long for a table for two? I am dressed formal also. She looks at me and tells me 5-10 minutes. 

Then as I was leaving , an African American gentleman walked in  and ask "hey how long for one of those tables outside? For two", the hostess reply "For you 30-35 minutes".  I have attached a photo of all the empty tables that were to good for someone of color to sit at in there photos. 

It shouldn't matter what we were wearing, this restaurant doesn't have a dress code. It shouldn't matter what color our skin is as our money spends as well as someone else. I encourage no one to spend their money here.
