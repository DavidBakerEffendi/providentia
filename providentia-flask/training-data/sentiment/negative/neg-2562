Let me start off saying that we want ALL Phoenix restaurants to thrive.

We popped in on Sunday late morning 3.1.15 all knowing that Gallo Blanco was no longer and wanted to have a nice experience at a former fave spot of ours. We were disappointed. I try not to write negative reviews but we left the restaurant upset and feeling was we just wasted our time and money....The food and service was terrible. 

-The bar was dirty and unkempt, terrible first impression.
-Staff stood at the bar while one pregnant server chatted about her personally aches and pains as we ate. Gross 
-That same staff proceeded to order her lunch in front of us for 10minutes, go to another register! 
-The menu is way overpriced 
-The tacos lacked flavor ie tasted like white grandma tacos from Minnesota where she found the recipe from a 1979 issue of sunset mag
- The presentation of the tacos- terrible. Just slapped down open face on a plate by that same grandma or from a prison kitchen 
- $8 mimosa on a Sunday, really?!
- No brunch specials or items of any kind 
- $5 small iced toddy- that price is ridiculous 
- Music was barley playing and what was heard was not impressive 
-We just left and walked by a group of staff and no, thank you, see you later etc. 

Understanding the concept had to transition quickly but there should be no excuse for bad service and dirtiness. I don't see how anyone would can't to come here until they dramatically change things and get their act together. 

- peace, love n tacos
