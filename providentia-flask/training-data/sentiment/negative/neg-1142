What happened!?! Every time we come the food is so good. Today was a major disappointment. 
Nachos were bland. Grilled chicken was rubbery. Chips weren't completely cooked. Soggy with oil. 
They gave my food to someone else that ordered food to go. Then we just watched everything go down hill from there. Orders were getting lost left and right. 
When I got my burro it was hot and tasty at least and the woman apologized. 
Young new girl taking the orders was mixing things up. Didn't know the menu or the food for that matter. Sadness.
