The only good thing is the service was decent. The food is way overpriced and the flavor is off. For someone who is counting calories, I chose BLD as my cheat meal. I'm so mad I wasted the calories & money. My chicken and waffles was bland, the chicken taste likes nothing, literally and the eggs are the same story. My husband's plate tasted like onions with some steak on the side (he hates onions and was not told it was on the fried steak). We both agreed McDonald's has better tasting food. The mimosa tastes like cheap champagne. I will not be back. A tip for the chefs at bld, don't try to recreate the wheel. At this rate you'll be wanting to sell square wheels, figuratively speaking. You're trying too hard to make your food look good, and it tastes pretty horrible.
