So disappointing. We were so excited to find a Broncos bar. We were off to a late start Sunday 9/13/15, arrived at about 1:15pm, so we knew it would be almost impossible to find a seat. We were right. Standing room only. But we noted how much room the patio had where at least 3 hightop tables could have fit to be more accommodating on busy days. We also noted that ZERO staff even spoke to us except the security guy checking IDs. The waitresses were busy, sure, we get that. But to completely ignore two people who were attempting to patronize this establishment (we would've come for every game, tip really well & write Yelp reviews) was plain rude. The waitresses all looked annoyed. We were never asked if we needed anything, never directed to an area of the overcrowded bar where we could order, never told when we could expect a table, never even saw a smile or eye contact. We left a little pissed & won't be returning.
