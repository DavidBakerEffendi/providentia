I ordered an Old West hamburger.  The hamburger was good but the onion rings and fries tasted as if they were cooked in old grease  I ate a few but couldn't stand the taste.  Later that evening I got sick from eating the few fries.  It is disappointing that Toby Keith has a restaurant that serves such terrible food that people are getting sick.  Not good!!!!!!
