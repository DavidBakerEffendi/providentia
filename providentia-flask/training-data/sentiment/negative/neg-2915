I've wanted to try this place for over two months and finally went last night...... I'm so disappointed. Yes, the decor is amazing but that's where it stops. We waited almost 5 minutes to be greeted by the hostess. We were sat at a lovely table outside, so that made up for the wait...well, not really. We waited another 10 minutes for a server to come and take our drink order. We placed our entire order at once because the poor server was the only person servicing the entire patio - which is a lot for one person on a Saturday night. Appetizer came before our drink order, which is always suspect, meaning it was all prepped and simply microwaved once the order hit the kitchen. Nuked mealballs never works, period. The bread served was quite dry and stale. I had the wild mushroom risotto, which was more like cafeteria food, not a dining experience.  My husband ordered braised beef, it was ok but again, had a cafeteria "buffet style" to it. Tasted like it rolled off the Sysco truck into the microwave, plopped onto a plate and served with a hefty price tag. The wine was good, the wine got me through. It's a shame because the space is beautifully appointed but unfortunately the kitchen doesn't execute and the staff appear over worked and just try to keep up. I won't return.
