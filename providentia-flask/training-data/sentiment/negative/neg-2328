Only reason this place is getting 1 star is because I cant give zero or negative stars. The "food" is terrible, had a couple bites then threw the rest out. I woulda gave it to my dog but he doesnt desrve that lind if punishment. If you want blan, soggy, and flavorless food that saltier than a Cowboys fan after a playoff loss, this is your place.
