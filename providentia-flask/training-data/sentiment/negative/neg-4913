Manager (owner?) came out and argued with me after her server kindly brought my order back for being overcooked.  I had ordered a slice of their prime rib (that night's special) medium-rare but the meat came out completely gray at all points and all the way through.  When she confronted us at the table I spoke kindly the entire time, not to make a scene, and just stuck to the facts pointing out the order was cooked well-done.  She insisted on telling us it simply can't be, that it was warmed up in hot au jus sauce for only a moment, and came off as if we didn't know the difference between medium-rare versus well-done.  I really wanted to tell her, "hello lady, take a look at the meat on the plate and tell me if you see any red or pink at all!" but I bit my tongue and let finish her rant before returning to the kitchen.  Our server (a nice guy we've always had wait on us) witnessed this and took care of us afterward and we rewarded him with a handsome tip accordingly.   But for the manager's attitude and comments we will not return and that means a downgrade from my last review to 1-star from us.

Besides, I've never heard of preparing prime rib by boiling it in au jus sauce as she stated they do.
