Didn't even get to have a good beer here.  Waited to catch a bartender at the bar although there was a lot of activity by at least 3 different people(?) behind the bar until someone finally asked us what we wanted. This place wasn't even half full on a Friday night at 8pm?  When we finally ordered from the menu posted on the chalkboard "Voodoo" we were told they were out.  Well "Hello" when your're out don't you typically erase it off the chalkboard?! We ended up leaving disappointed with the service and availability of the posted drink menu.
