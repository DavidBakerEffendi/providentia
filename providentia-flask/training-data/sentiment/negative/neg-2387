If I could give them 0 stars I would! You're probably thinking jeez it's that bad? 

UMMMM YES. ABSOLUTELY. 

Today, I ordered ahead of time so I could enjoy my food on my lunch break and get back to work on time. They said my order would be ready in 15 minutes. Great! That gives me time to finish some of my filing. I get there at the exact time they said my food would be ready 12:37. I walk up to the counter I asked for my order, the cashier says she doesn't have my order. I didn't even get a hi, not a warm welcome, NOTHING. So I say it's fine and I let her take my order. 

Error #1. My food was never even ready and my order was never even PLACED. 

 Error #2 I didn't even get a receipt !!!! 

So I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for 30 minutes!!! They're calling other people's orders and not mine. I get fed up and I walk up to the counter. This cashier ignores me completely! I then had to be stern and ask her if my food was even prepared!! She then proceeds to give me a bag of cold food and acts like it's my fault?? 

Now I'm late, I can't even have lunch, and the lunch I have is cold? Waste of money. 



Don't waste your time here. Just go to Roberto's.
