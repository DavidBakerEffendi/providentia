What a sad excuse for a chain that touts its football games and specials on Sunday. I walk into this place about 1:30pm on Sunday and the hostess has no idea who is playing or what is TV. The bar has one person and one table filled. Meanwhile, there are football banners and pennants everywhere promoting the NFL, but they apparently don't carry the NFL package because only the nationally televised game was on their five TV's. Even the staff is wearing football jersey's - well there was a reason it was empty right smack in the middle of an NFL Sunday. What a pretender.
