I took several of my Co workers here for some appetizers and a few drinks, with 6 of us... all laughing and having a great time. We had a total tab of $150. Including $60 of appetizers.... we had been there 55 minutes and the manager, a very young and inexperienced guy decided that he should cut us off, simply because we were being loud in the bar area.   We were not intoxicated, we were laughing and making jokes.  Of all the times I have been to a restaurant, and or bar. This was by far the worst call ever made by a manager on duty.   Luckily we were very close to a place called RTO Sullivan's.  We went there and had a great time.  BJ's ....You had an epic failure on Saturday night.
