My family and I frequently dine in at metro pizza. This review is solely based on the customer service we experienced while we dined in for lunch today. A young girl (not our waiter) dropped off our pizza to the table and before we could ask for plates she ran off. We sat there for a couple minutes trying to get the attention of someone who worked there. Finally we flagged down the hostess and asked for plates and a serving knife since it didn't have one and the pizza was really hot. Finally after about 10 mins we finally were able to start eating. Mid meal the waiter picks up my boyfriends drink I assumed to refill and after about 10 mins we look around and the waiter is behind the counter chatting with all of his co workers, completely forgot to bring back our drink. Again, we had to ask a busser near by to help us. On our way out we decided to get some dessert in the to go area. We ordered a piece of cake and a scoop of ice cream. After the girl took our money she said "ok have a great day!" I looked at her confused and said " can I have my dessert?" She laughed and gave my my cake and gave me a blank stare. My boyfriend had ordered a scoop of gelato and i said "I ordered and paid for gelato also" which threw me off because she had been the one to take the order. Overall bizarre and frustrating experience. These kids obviously don't really care for their jobs.
