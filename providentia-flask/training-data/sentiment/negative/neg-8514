$8.00 delivery fee on a $12.00 pizza?!?  I was ordering online - when I saw this, I cancelled my order - am 100% certain I did not confirm it.  Imagine my surprise when 20 mins later, I received a confirmation email that my pizza was on its way.  When I called back to cancel the order, I was told by Ms. Snippy Smartypants, who repeatedly placed me on hold, that I didn't have an order.   After more hold time, I was told that if my order came in, they would cancel.  I checked my bank statement, had charges pending.  Called back with my confirmation number - Ms. S. put me on with a managerial toned guy who told me quite nastily 1:  That there was nothing he could do, cancelled pizza was already on it's way.  Then, changed to 2:  Pizza would be cancelled, but I would pay a "convenience charge" (not so convenient).  Then, upon further discussion, 3:  Order cancelled, but "Don't ever call here again."  (Don't worry...). Shortly thereafter, nice Valentino's pizza delivery guy shows up in my driveway, stating he for a weird message to leave, and did I still want the pizza - I explained what happened, he refused my tip, left, and called back shortly to verify that he confirmed the order was cancelled, minus a $1.75 "transaction fee., sending apologies for terrible transaction.  Thanks, sweet pizza delivery guy - hope someday soon you find more professional, upstanding employers.  Pizza Valentino, we will never speak again, you A-hole you...
