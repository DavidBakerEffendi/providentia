Awful food.  They do not delivery so we called in to try their signature Chicago-style deep dish pizza and chicken tenders.  Meh.  Pizza had too much cheese and the sauce was On the bottom. Real Chicago deep dish pizza is sauce on top. Very unremarkable.  Pretty sure the chicken tenders came out of the frozen section at the grocery store.  The Pizza was maybe worst dish on the table; it was unsatisfactory. Our meal was $52 after tax and tip. Wasn't worth it.  

I'm surprised they are still in business, especially with so many other great options .  Maybe the Chicago-style pizza is worth it if you have the time.
