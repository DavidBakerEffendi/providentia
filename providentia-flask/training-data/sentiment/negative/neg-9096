Limited menu. Cold chicken and undercooked risotto does not make for a good Christmas celebration. 
First wine served was quickly changed into a cheaper quality once dinner came. 
Outdoor seating did not have proper heating. 
And the cats running around eating what's left was not a pleasant sight after dining.
