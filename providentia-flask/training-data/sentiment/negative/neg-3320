Wow squared' 
Been here a few times and have always advocated for the buffet and The Mirage over all. 

Just can't this time. 
5 1/2 hr drive from LA with TN ( 1st time) guest,  I was selling cravings big time. 

Arriving to the  pay  line at 3:05 we were charged for dinner VS lunch; but what was being served was lunch left overs! 

I called over the floor manager who called out the chef , who I told of my disappointment with the quality of food VS my prior times here-  telling him it was like being at 2 different restaurants. 

He quickly had the crew change out some of the entrees but it was to late - 2 hrs later and I conclude Cravings is no more the quality buffet it once was. 
Food lacked flavor. 
Trust me, I really wanted it to be good. 


I'm embarrassed I sold it so high to my guest.
