So me and  two other people came in to enjoy a meal I always liked Denny's never though bad thought of that establishment but I will never go to the surprise store EVER again while our server Ashley DeAnda was running around doing everything possible to make our experience memorable while her two bosses can see she coulda used a little help from them they sat back and watched her with out giving any assistance then instead of helping they sat outside smoking cigarettes. After we finished I paid the bill I asked Ashley are you going to ask if the food was good? Ashley replied with "I'm not allowed to ask the guests that cause her manager gets up set and takes it out in a negative on her if the guest don't like the food" I was like you got to be kidding me right... So I paid the the bill and walked outside, as I passed through the swinging doors the blonde with glasses gave me a dirty ass look rolling her eyes while the other did the same like me being there was an inconvenience as if they did anything to help her waitress satisfy the needs of the guest... I feel as a manager of a well know professional establishment to do what she does is unacceptable and I will never return to that restaurant again .... Ashley did all she could to be treated like this .... I will be taking my business to village inn where my feedback is appreciated..... If I feel this way how many other feel the same way????
