Let me begin with the food. HORRIBLE. My date asked the waiter to give her the most popular dish on the menu. He comes back with a Leg of Lamb. My date is 115 lbs. and the leg was the size of a basketball. Was he serious? I dont believe this big leg of lamb is the most popular dish for women. It tasted like a dead carcass. We took one bite of the leg and didn't eat it. They didn't bother to ask if anything was wrong or offered to take it off the bill. You can obviously tell my date is upset and yet they ignored her and sent us the check. The service here is atrocious. We took that leg and tried to feed it to my pitbull. She sniffed it a couple times and walked away. Goes to show their food can't even get a hungry dog to take a bite. Avoid this place like the plague.
