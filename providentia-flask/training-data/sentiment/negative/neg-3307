Came on May 4 2013 for the Yuk Yuk's comedy club. Did not try the food, so cannot say anything about it. 
THE WOMEN'S WASHROOM IS IN HORRIBLE CONDITION!!! Where is the management??? The ceiling and the bottom of the wall are gone and looks like you are in a dungeon. I wanted to take pictures just so they speak louder then words, but after opening the feminine product disposal unit, I ran out of the washroom like in a horror scene. It looked like it hasn't been cleaned in months and is filled with what I cannot even called water, since it looks like a butcher's garbage bin. And the smell could kill even a fly. WHERE IS THE HEALTH INSPECTOR!!! I asked to speak with a manager, who did not appear like the managerial type. He could see how shocked I am, and still just replied in a quick and couldn't-care-less "it will be fixed" comment.
