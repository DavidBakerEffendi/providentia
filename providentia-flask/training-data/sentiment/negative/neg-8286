Can't say much about the food because we didn't even get that far.  As a local we wanted check out the new eatery that took the place of PHX and before that fat slims?..menu seemed inviting some local options, got my paleo pallet smiling.  Decent decor, kinda. However, once inside welcome went cold quick. There were tables open but somehow a 20min wait. So to the wine bar we waited, and waited, and waited until I then asked for a menu. With no welcome or invite to be in the space and enjoy, or explain the concept of wine flowing out of electronic aireators on auto fill, what ever happened to the art of wine pouring?..are we that close to the robotic society? We'll finally we were asked, "so what can I get you", without even looking at me, no hi, hello, is this your first time to Chick?..we said we changed our mind decided to leave and went next door to The Grind. Warmed with an instant welcome and a seat, wonderful pour, crisp IPA served in a mason jar. 

Not to say that I don't appreciate fine dining but I'll take a mason jar beer anyday over a psuedo fine experience.

To Chick I say,look at who has come before you and look at who is waiting to take your place and make service be the forfront in your local eating place.
