Oops I did it again...but this time I took pictures!

I still can't believe what they charge for a stinkin' sandwich, which isn't even that big or tasty! But that is not what brought my update from a 2 start to a 1 star...it was the bathroom!!

Oh my goodness! Someone call the maid I think something has died in here (a few times)! Take a look at my pictures, there is rust all over the trash can, a grimmy 'weathered' look over all the appliances and floor, and look at the walls!! It looked like a mixture of orange mold and years of soap scum caked on. The faucet was hard to work, and look at the grim and moldy caulking...grossness....Beware....BEWARE!!!
