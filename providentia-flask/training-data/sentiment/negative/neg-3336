Do Not Eat Here !!! The waiter was soo rude to my son, he made him cry. My son moved his chair to sit closer to me and the waiter yelled at him to "sit down, stay  there, and be quiet and if you touch me again you are going to need your mommy!" my four year old was just trying to move closer to me because he hadn't seen me all day. We were appalled on how rude he was. Who says that to a child!
 I get it, it's not a kid place, we weren't looking for a kids menu and crayons but we did nothing to get treated like that. That is not how customers should ever be treated and we will never return with or without the kids
