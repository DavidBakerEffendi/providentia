Uhhh,  afraid not. Another pretender in the sandwich world. Should have realized something was up when guy with a neck tattoo is making sandwiches, but it's really about quality of ingredients as they say on their menu. 
Breaking down my $7.95 sandwich called "the Nectar"  we run into various issues.

- Turkey quality was slightly above Quizno's (they use Genoa). It was that gelatin style turkey. If you want to be called the best sandwich, use real turkey. Lady also claimed that they "maple glaze" it themselves. I would like to see that process because there was no hint of maple at all in the junky turkey.

- Well, maybe they will use some "Vermont" cheddar right? Nope. Saw a tiny piece of cheddar cheese that was already pre-sliced and of very low quality. What a fraud of a place calling itself Vermont.. They should be embarrassed about the cheese situation.

- "Best" sandwiches use homemade bread or at least some from a local bakery. This honey wheat bread came straight out of a bag.

- Free samples of items are nice, but at least use a small cup when you hand stuff to me. The lady sticks a fork in the stuff and I have to attempt to get it in my mouth before it falls on the floor (caught the mac salad sample in my hand)

- Macaroni Salad was good, fresh and homemade and was the highlight, but I wasn't here for the side dish, I was here for a good sandwich and that did not materialize. If this is what people eat in Vermont, I do feel sorry for them.

RESPONSE TO OWNER COMMENT:
- Well, the bread is still "off the shelf" and not baked in small batches
- Maple Flavor - not existent to any pallet. 
-  You use Deli meat to make a profit and that is why you can put extra meat on a sandwich. Classic case of sacrificing quality for cash in your pocket.
- Vermont is known for Cheddar and the only connection you have to Vermont is your from there?. Use Vermont products and it shouldn't matter if there is no mention that you use those products because Vermont is in your name. This was not an intelligent argument. 
- Sample cups are for samples - nobody has heard of sample forks
- Hiring guys with arm tats is fine these days, but neck tattoos indicate a a higher level of felon or thug - aka someone who has to work in a sandwich shop - and doesn't care about his job. It is not his fault, but it is just a bad image, unless all your employees have neck tats and ear rings.
- Nothing I said was lies, but you should rename your place "Arizona sandwiches by people from Vermont"
