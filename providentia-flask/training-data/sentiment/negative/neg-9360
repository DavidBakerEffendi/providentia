Took 35 minutes for 8 wings to go :(

Most expensive and worst wings I've ever had! Service was just as bad. Employees like to chitchat while you're standing there right in front of them waiting to place your order. You don't even get ranch with your wings that's extra. 
The girl taking my order was filling up dressing cups at the same time and acted like I was bothering her!! I should've walked out.
