Another tourist trap! Junky chips and guacamole that were so plain. Our kids fish and chips was mostly batter with tough chewy fish on a bed of smushed cold fries. They didn't bring our food and when we finally asked the waiter claimed are you ready for your second service? So after almost an hour you want to just now put in our order for our dinner??? Apparently he said this is how it is done in Montreal. It was not our experience anywhere else in Montreal but apparently in this place it is the case. We left tired, offended, having eaten a few fries and missed out on the old port activities with the time we wasted waiting for our food. To top it all off instead of an apology we get a backhanded comment that we'll just throw the food away. Staff is rude, food is like cheap, sub-par bar food, and wait and prices are ridiculous. 40 bucks for that nasty fish and chips and a plate of store bought chips with a small cup of guacamole. No thank you!
