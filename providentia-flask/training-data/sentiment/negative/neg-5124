Woahhhhhhh. Service needs some (LOADS) work. 
The food itself is pretty good considering its Vegas, the price is very reasonable for being Vegas. It is definitely the place to go. The location is bomb. Food is bomb (when you are slightly inebriated). Service has something to be desired. I realize that they have to deal with drunk people all day and night BUT I WAS SOBER. 

My problem is with the service. Not once did someone come to refill our waters. I happened to down my water in the first 5 minutes at the table. YES I was hungover. YES my mouth was like the Sahara desert. Everything was pretty do it ourselves including getting our bill. Had to flag down 2 different people just to get our ONE bill. 
This is the part that gets me. When the lady came by with our check she handed it to us then proceeded to STARE US DOWN AND BREATH ON US until we put a card in and returned it to her. UM.. can we please get a minute to ourselves since we had to give you 10 minutes to even get this to us? Life isn't always fair I guess. Then the lady returned WITHOUT the credit card we had put in it but with somebody else's signed receipt. The only thing that could make the service worse at this point was if she started eating off of our plates. 

I'm glad the service was nonexistent when we needed it but the minute we wanted to pay everyone was at our table, not always with the right checks but at our table nonetheless. That really sealed the deal. Glad you took the time out to make us so uncomfortable and unwanted so I could reflect it in your tip. 

BTW. I'M STILL WAITING FOR MY WATER TO BE REFILLED, even after you stood at our table for a full 5 minutes. Glad you wanted me to die from my MSG induced coma!
