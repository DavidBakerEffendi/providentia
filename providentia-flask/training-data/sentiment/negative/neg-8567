This place is not worth. I went here for lunch with some friends and it was $13.99 a person. Considering the price, we weren't expecting much but even for the price, the food did not meet any standard (not even my really really low standard). First, they were soooo slow. Literally sat there for an hour before the food came. Secondly, they put a limit on the short ribs (3 per person PER MEAL). Usually it's a limit per order to make sure you don't waste food but literally 3 a meal is absurd. Also, we ordered it 3 times and finally when we asked why the ribs weren't coming THEN they told us about the limit so we waited for nothing. 

There was a younger female server who was really nice. Other than her, the older servers were rude and tense. We got out "fill" on edamame and bean sprouts and skewered shrimps (pretty yummy BUT NOT WORTH FOR ANYTHING ELSE).
