Just stay away from this place. Awful rendition of Indian food. Horribly slow service and very rude staff. The order that we placed came 1.25 hrs later only to be greeted with "whose order is this? Please take it already". The samosas and chicken biryani is just not eatable. Not to mention the rude manager who says I know everything about India, don't teach me. Duh uhh. 
Please don't spoil your Vegas experience by visiting this place.
