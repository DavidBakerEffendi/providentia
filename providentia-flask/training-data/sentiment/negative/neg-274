Horrible! More often then not the temperature is awful and it feels like the A/C is broken. We have witnessed a staff fight every time we have gone in and usually with management involved. It is far too sad to watch and certainly ruins my meal. I hope they get help because its a great location, great decorating, even the food is pretty good once it actually shows up. I hate having to give a 1 star review, I really do! I just can't bring myself ever tell anyone to step foot in here or even support them by ordering food to go.
