This is a pretty uncomfortable review for me to write, because I really enjoy the winking lizard, the kids enjoy going there, and overall it's a really solid and decent place to grab a bite and a beer. However this night did nothing short of infuriate me and I'll tell you why. 

I arrived at the lizard with the kids while my wife is running about 10 minutes behind. Our server was very nice and relatively new by her own admission. I ordered a black and tan which everybody knows is Guinness mixed with another beer and that beer alternates regionally.  The beer came out in an imperial pint glass as Guinness should...but it was 2/3 full.  2/3!  I pointed this out to my relatively inexperienced to server, but she stated oh you have to give it time to settle and it will filll right back up. Now I've been drinking Guinness for quite some time, and it never did quite fill up. I ask the server to go and get the manager so he can correct the pour. The manager on duty did show up and proceeded to tell me that because it was a black and tan, they put it in an imperial glass although they do this so they do not have to wait for the head to settle. Now I am NOT saying the Customer is always right, but you do not serve a beer in a glass two thirds full.  And then proceeded to argue with a customer in front of his kids by telling him he is wrong and the restaurant is right and they're not going to change it.  

Naturally, this infuriated me and I asked the server to give me my bill as we're going to get out.  At this time the wife showed up and calmed me down...but now I can't enjoy a meal with an ahole know it  all "manager" who's only response to a complaint should have been "I'll fix that right away sir".

Piss off lizard.  There's plenty of other choices of places to eat in mentor.
