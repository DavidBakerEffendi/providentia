I'm reviewing this place as we are in the restaurant. Horrible service and the food was not edible. As soon as we entered, no one cared to seat us. As we were seated, it took a waitress 10 minutes before seeing us. The waitress was rude and careless. It took a long time before we got our food and the food was not even edible. The burger was tasteless and the chicken plate didn't look presentable. The only thing I would give them a high five on  is their cocktails. The cocktails were well made. Other than that, I'm never coming here again!
