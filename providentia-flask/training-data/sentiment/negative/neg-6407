Wow! I took my sister there because she heard so much about it, being from Kansas.... I'm her big brother and expected to treat her to whatever she wanted. We had fun, didnt get the hats we were expecting,  but still made the best of it and even ordered shots... When it came to the bill out server want happy with the Tip, even thought he messed up my beer order. He followed me out, questioning me about the tip amount... Then saying I'll take ur extra cup to compisdae  for ur lack of tip. I really didn't care seeing as his service was so bad, but I left with my little mug, and without him taking my big mug and our 3 diff shots we ordered.. We don't need the money let alone the food... We came for the entertainment
