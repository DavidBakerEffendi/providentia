I had a bit of a dreadful, awkward experience here.  I'd wanted to try this spot for awhile and when a Groupon popped up, I finally had my chance.

I went for dinner and we ordered the Macaroni el Forno (macaroni, bechamel and meat sauce), lobster bisque, and sweet potato fries.  Yes, random, I know.

Anyways, shortly after ordering, I noticed that the happy hour menu was still in effect.  I wanted to order a glass of wine and we asked the waiter/owner if we could order it since it was 5:58 (happy hour ended at six).  

Thus began the Bon Chef happy hour wine inquisition.  First, although we told the waiter it was 5:58, the waiter didn't believe us and then left the table to go confirm the time.  Okay, fine, whatever. Then, when he came back he told us, in a really rude way, that we couldn't order the wine because we had a Groupon.  

Considering we had already ordered MORE than the value of the Groupon, I found this excuse to be B.S.  But, it really wasn't worth it to get "into it" over a $3 glass of wine.  However, I would never, ever, EVER recommend this place for happy hour because they seemed determined to prevent people from ordering from that menu. 

From then on, we just wanted this whole experience to be over.

The food, unfortunately, did not make up for the awkward atmosphere.  The sweet potato fries were pretty limp and mushy.  The Macaroni el Forno, their "signature dish," was boring and tasted a bit like Hamburger Helper.

The most disappointing of all was the lobster bisque.  Maybe I'm spoiled from all the lobster bisques I've had on the East coast, but, wow, this was bad. One tiny, tiny piece of lobster, nothing else, and a weird flavor.  It was also the color of liquid garbage.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

Topping off this great meal, the waiter demanded to push the "redeemed" button on my Groupon phone app.  Jesus, do I look that untrustworthy/sketchy?  

Over it.
