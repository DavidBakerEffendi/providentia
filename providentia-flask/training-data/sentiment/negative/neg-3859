2 bad experiences here but most recently I ordered for delivery, food was supposed to be delivered at 8:11pm, an hour after the scheduled delivery time its not here. I called eat24 they called the restaurant and the owner answered. He says he doesn't know where the food is, the deliver guy left already and he tells the eat 24 rep she needs to call the restaurants 3rd party delivery guy. They were absolutely no help and hung up on the eat 24 rep. The delivery guy never answers the phone and my food never gets delivered. No customer service from this restaurant.
