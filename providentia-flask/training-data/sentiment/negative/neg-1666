My husband I should have known something was awry when we walked in the door on a Friday night and the place was deserted. It took a long time to be greeted and taken to our table. Then, we were only given one menu and one drink option-water. The waiter took a very long time to return. We ordered 2 chicken tikka masalas and one order of butter naan. The server seemed confused by this and I had to reiterate my order again and he repeated it to me. My husband asked for a Coke. After ten minutes the waiter returns and tells my husband they are out of Diet Coke. My husband reiterated that he wanted regular coke. We waited over 40 minutes for our food. I saw the only two other tables there receive he wrong items or have to get up and find their waiter to ask for something. Finally we receive our food and get two orders of burnt butter naan and one order of chicken tikka masala. Then the server leaves and didn't come back for 30 minutes so we never got our basmati rice that comes with the dish or the other order of chicken tikka masala so my husband and I had to share. When my husband was able to flag him down and he came back he didn't even apologize for forgetting the other order! It was the absolute worst service I've had in a while. The whole staff seems confused. The chicken tikka masala is actually pretty great. But I won't be back again.
