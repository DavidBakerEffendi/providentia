Rip off. The food was crap. Tasted like some kind of chain restaurant crap that I could have gotten at Olive Garden. For the price, I was VERY disappointed. This place is a must miss!
The chicken parm was just a piece of chicken with sauce and cheese slapped on it with a high price tag. Save your money and go elsewhere.
