I think Los Dos has the best Mexican food in the Valley, but I won't be returning to eat there after being a faithful customer since finding it in 2004.  For the third time in as many visits we waited over 20 minutes to have a waiter walk up, say HI and hand us menus.  While their chips and salsa were great as ever (thanks to the bus boy who was at least hustling), their service is becoming so abysmal to the point of entertainingly bad, that it is no longer worth the trip there if I'm going to walk out after a 20-30 minute wait for even a menu.   

It pains me to say this because I really love the food.
