We really wanted to love this new Mexican joint after hearing it came to town. Instead we found it appeared to replace an old dive bar interior. When we were seated we were promptly given some average chips in a plastic basket. When our sever came over and we asked for a drink menu he pointed to a poster on the wall advertising three brands of bottled beer. My friend asked about margarita flavors and the server said they had basic margaritas, which was surprising considering their name and online photos all show an array of colorful different drinks and margs. So we say we need a moment and walk up to look at the drinks at the actual bar bar and what do we see but maybe 6 or so beers on tap and what looks like a normal bar. When we sit back down I ask for a XX lager since I saw it on the tap and ask for it in draft. He says he doesn't think it's on draft. My friend in the meantime ran into another employee who gave her a real drink menu to look at--on his iPhone. They appeared to have no actual drink menus in the place. She ordered a speciality marg and I ordered my beer, which arrived in a bottle. She said her drink tasted odd and she only drank perhaps 1/4. Allow me to back up for a moment to describe the scene. The entire place smelled of cleaning product and there was a PowerPoint presentation playing photos of drinks on the wall. Now back to the order. We ordered some meals and when they came we had several issues. One, the beans tasted strange in flavor so we didn't eat them. The chicken was OK in our items but not good. The beef was insanely oniony and we didn't eat any of it. The steak in my friend's taco was the only good thing, but it was pretty medium rare, so for those who want it cooked more it might not work. Between the bad food, missing drink menus, dozens of children running around and crawling all over the place, I don't think we'll be back!
