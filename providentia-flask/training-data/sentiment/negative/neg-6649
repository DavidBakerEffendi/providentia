While this CPK is largely like the others, it does have one thing to distinguish it: really terrible service. 

I was here for lunch the other day and noticed they have lunch specials where you get a soup or salad and one of a selected number of small pizzas. I ordered one but asked if I could substitute the soup offered for another kind of soup that was on the menu. I told the waitress that I had noted that the soup I wished to substitute cost $0.50 more and that I would gladly pay the additional charge.

She said she could not do that. No substitutions.

So, I asked "why?" esp. as I was willing to pay the difference.

Her reply (it's a classic): I might tell other people.

Huh? What? I might tell other people I got what I wanted? That CPK allowed substitutions? That they, too, could get what they want at CPK?And does she really think I have long ranging discussions about my lunch soup choices?

I tried to argue my point, but, quickly, realized that there is no arguing with that sort of unassailable logic.

Yep, I might tell other people.
