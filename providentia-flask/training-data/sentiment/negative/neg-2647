The Italian beef is not Italian beef.  I noticed the beef was pulled from the fridge and reheated on the grill.  Didn't even notice if there was any juice to be had on my sandwich, certainly didn't appear to be any.

I decided to forgo the Mozzarella (who gets that in Chitown?) and that should have been my first sign that eating here was going to be nothing but a passing fancy.

I needed to kick it up a notch, so after some discussion, the giardiniera was said to be mild, not hot, so I added jalapenos (thank God I did)... because the giardiniera isn't even giardiniera.  It's cut up bell peppers with a bit of carrot thrown in.  [Where's the oil or the peppers you ask? I have no idea.  They're not here.]

For all those who are raving about the fries- frozen shoe-string fries aren't the pinnacle of fries for me by a long shot.  [If you're the same, avoid this place.]

There is one golden thread here- they have free tea and coffee for customers.  That's a nice change from the $1.50-$3.00 other places charge for heating up some water and putting a grocery-store-tea-bag in it.  So, kudos on the free tea.  I wish the food had been worth a second visit.
