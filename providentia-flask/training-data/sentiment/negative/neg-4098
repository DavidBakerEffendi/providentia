funny that he keeps deleting this particular post. the negative comments have nothing to do with his food but all about his customer service. I will keep posting it so that people can see. even if I have to do it under a different name. so I've been coming to the taco shop for quite some time now. I would always come into the store but I never tried anything. once I finally did I was HOOKED !! the carne Asada is my favorite. I've tried the al pastor, carnitas, and chicken as well as the mini tacos. none of which I would get again because there are better places in Las Vegas that serve this. although it may be good to some. it's just not for me. as much as I love Jefe's taco shop, I will NO LONGER be returning. Ben the manager/owner insulted my mother because I gave her honest opinion on the mini taco shells. in her opinion they are nasty. people in Las Vegas are used to white corn tortillas. that's all. what really got me is that he told me my mother does not know good food and she eats garbage and cardboard. I listen as he insults the competition around town which is fine but to insult ones mother and to think that it acceptable is NOT OKAY. EVEN when it's in a joking manor. the joked continues to go as I wouldn't allow "no bad cornbread" idk if I'm black so cornbread is associated with me. but I don't eat cornbread or soul food or fried chicken to add to the bunch. Already having mixed feelings about the taco shop because I could only go after his wife is no longer working considering she makes me uncomfortable with her level of rudeness. I will be telling everyone I know about my experience as I will not be returning after my mothers and my palette has been insulted.
