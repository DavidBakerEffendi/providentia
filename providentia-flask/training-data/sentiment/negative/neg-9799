I was Super excited to check this place out being that I'm from Nola! Our wasn't too friendly and our food was not so great. The seasoning was beyond salty, to the point where we couldn't eat it. Kinda bummed it wasn't what I expected. I'm a foodie fan so this place did not make it to my top list. So after speaking with a manager "Kim" I was promised a comp on the house for our next visit which would be our original order from our bad experience ; however the story changed once I called to place my order. This place is a joke how do promise to take care of the bill for bad service and not follow through. Complete disappointment.
