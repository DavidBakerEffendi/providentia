I like Panda Express once in a while, but this location... Oh my it is disgusting. A few bites and I almost got sick. It is far from the Panda Express were used to, not that PE is considered top Chinese food but even in PE standards this is the most disgusting thing I put in my mouth. 
Wish I had the audacity to ask for my money back.
