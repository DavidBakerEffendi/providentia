Let's see, sit me down. Don't give me a menu, sit 4 other families. Serve them and the bus boy points at us then he helps another family. So what do I do, I walk out. I take me and my family to another restaurant and I will post about the mess of an establishment. But really should have checked yelp prior because it had 2 stars already. I gotta use yelp 100 percent of the time.
