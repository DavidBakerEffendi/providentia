No - No - No - did I say NO?

I have only gone to one other Quaker Steak and Lube and this one certainly sealed the deal for me never going back.

The food was mediocre at best - the buffet - NO MEAT LOAF! The time it takes to get what you order was also a nightmare - chips and salsa - over 45 minutes? 

Cleanliness NOT next to godliness here by any means. The only good thing is price, but I don't necessarily chose my places based on price.

The manager attempted to please me, but false advertisement mixed with staff rudeness = 1 star - I wish there was a rating of 0 - though this place does deserve one star!
