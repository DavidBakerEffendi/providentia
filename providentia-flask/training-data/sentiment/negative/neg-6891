The food was alright,  I'd say even pretty good.   Tried the steak pie with a side of haggis.  The haggis was actually pretty good.  Good beer selection,  though I'm surprised they didn't grace guiness....How can a pub like this not have guiness?  

The server was so bloody rude that it ruins the whole experience though.   Who doesn't say sorry when they spill and splash something over their guests.   And who demands for, instead of apologizing and asking if it's ok to pay with credit because they ran out of change...

And she didn't even tell us it was last call. So when we tried to order dessert all she says is the kitchen's already closed.

Don't ruin your nice bar with such bad service......
