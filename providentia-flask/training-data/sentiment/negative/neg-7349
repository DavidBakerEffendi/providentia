Sadly, the food is really delicious at the Arrogant Butcher, but waiting 1.5+ hours for our meals THEN subsequently finding a hair on the plate was truly unacceptable.  You will not be seeing me again Arrogant Butcher. And I would not be able to recommend this place due to the fact that they only wanted to compensate us with a $6 dessert. Really? That's all you can do for a $100 dinner? Appalling. 

We waited over an hour an a half for a medium rare filet mignon, and a hamburger. THEN once we were eating there was a hair UNDER the creamed spinach on the filet mignon's plate. My hair is brown and curly and 6+ inches long. My companion's hair is blond and about 3+ inches long. The hair on the plate was black and thick and about 1.5inches long. Yet you refused to comp us anything but a $6 dessert? Really?? Really? Arrogant indeed
