Review is strictly on table service: we have been coming to this buffet for NYE for 3 years now and this was the worst service of all time. We did not receive silverware after being seated for 10 minutes so I had to go find a waiter and when I told him, he gave me a "I don't serve your table look" and barely brought them to us. Then our plates stayed piled up for quite some time, almost our entire dinner.
