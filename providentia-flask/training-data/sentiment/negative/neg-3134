We were there to celebrate a birthday. The food server was very service oriented. That was the only good thing about our experience. After 45 minutes, waiting for our meal the food server told us it would be up in a couple minutes. At an hour I asked where our meal was. An hour and 10 minutes after we arrived they finally brought the meal to the table. The bread was soggy from sitting on top of the warm pasta waiting for the rest of the order. We returned one meal to the kitchen. I was 24 hours recovering from whatever wasn't right in my meal. The manager did apologize for the delay in the meal. He told us the kitchen had been filling a catering order.  He offered to buy us dessert. Our birthday celebration had gone from a fun event to a disaster. He was offering use dessert, which cost him nothing. The right answer would have been to give us the meal for free to make up for the pathetic experience. You lost us as repeat customers
