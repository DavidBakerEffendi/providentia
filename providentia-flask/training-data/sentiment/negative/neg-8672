This place is a complete disaster service-wise (can't tell you about the food since I never got to try it). I waited 20 minutes to have my order taken and I was first in line! There had been many people ahead of me, but they took off after waiting for over 15 minutes to order. Once I made the order I was told to pay at the other end. So I go to pay and there was no one at the cash! So I waited another 10 minutes and then left. While waiting I was chatting with the herd of people waiting for their order and they told me that they had been waiting for their order for over 30 minutes. 

Train your people!
