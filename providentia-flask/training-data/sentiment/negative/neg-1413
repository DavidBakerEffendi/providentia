If you ENJOY this buffet you needa grow some tastebuds!!

REALLY?? REALLLLLY?!?! yelpers COME ON... i dont freakin understand

$45 for dinner @ the buffet here.. first off thats insane
but fine fine its supposedly OFF THE CHAIN delicious AMAZING seafood.....

are you kidding me?!??!?!

what the freak is there to eat here? i should have TOTALLY taken pictures.............

-pasta and seafood ceviche and etcetc was MEDIOCRE at best....
-the shrimp were decent shape and size..didnt eat one tho im not stupid i dont need to get foodpoisoning
-oysters...WTF happened to these OYSTERs???? some were MASSIVE others regular but wtf was wrong with it...they were yellowish and looked very unappetizing wow.... really disturbing
-the crab legs... i REALLY cannot understand if people are crazy or the dinner on saturday was horrible but those are NOT large legs OMG! they were SMALL you can get bigger fresher ones @ the Wynn buffet...seriously LARGE crab legs are the ones fromm Costco now those you can call large the ones at the rio buffet are shameful...
-crab CLAWs ok now those came from maybe a decent size crab i had one it was good i liked how meaty they were but what did the birthday girl proclaim when she ripped hers open "man these suckers look creamy"....CREAMY???? PEOPLE..PEOPLE!!!... PEOPLE!!!!!!!.....steamed crab legs should not look and taste CREAMY  & moooshy thats just offf....

they had fried shrimp, fried fish, salmon (very very lame), clam chowder & more..

the only thing i ate 20834328483 of? the red snapper sashimi with the sushi "chef" slicing away next to you. those were good, no funky smell, no sliminess BUT some were awfully tough to chew ...he has some horrible skills...he did NOT kno how to slice em i mean i think he got completely lazy at one point becuz i got some cubes, some stringy ones, some that were nearly the whole fish...blahhhh sloppiness....

to top it off?? that was the sorriest dessert bar EVER. yea the gelato looked great but not amazing like the wynn  so NOT amazing where i thot it was a waste to take a lactose pill for it...instead i grabbed a brownie which i couldnt even finish...a brownie CAROLYN cant finish is shit...blah!!!!!

waited 45minutes to throw $45 down the hole...down a dark fishy hole...how very very sad

btw if u wana come here for some freak reason go get urself a ballys ceasars rio players card and save ur ass $10 we signed up the next day...FML!
