So it's become something of a tradition for a friend and I to hit Scruffy Murphy's every few months and catch up over a plate of their glorious Mexican Fries. Our most recent trip, however, was so bad and so disappointing that I can't imagine we'll be returning any time soon.

We arrived on a Saturday night and the place was beginning to fill up. I ordered a pint and the aforementioned Mexican Fries. The pint arrived relatively quickly, and the fries soon followed.

The Mexican Fries, described in the menu as being topped with ground beef, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and cheese, used to come on a fairly big plate, which ingeniously ensured that every single fry was smothered in those toppings and the only "naked" fries were those around the edges. Honestly, it was perfect.

Sometime between my last visit and now, however, Scruffy's made the mind-bogglingly terrible decision to serve the fries in a shallow bowl. This ensures that there's a thin layer of toppings across the top but then a whole mess of "naked" fries near the bottom. I would guess that fries without toppings, in this new bowl, added up to more than half! This is completely unacceptable and what was once an absolutely scrumptious dish is now completely mediocre. The word "meh" was invented to describe this new iteration.

Adding insult to injury, I requested a second pint once the fries arrived and never got it. Out waitress disappeared to such an extent that I had to track her down and ask for the bill. I tipped her 15% but in retrospect even that was way too generous.

Ugh. What a frustrating night.
