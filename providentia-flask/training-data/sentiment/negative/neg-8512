Not a great experience. Waited 30 minutes after ordering for lunch. When I asked the staff when it might be up I was nonchalantly advised 'we're backed up '. There were 4 in our party and the orders did not arrive together. When the first one came out we asked again about the others and the server who by the look on her face had zero interest in being there said 'we're backed up'. When the rest of the orders finally arrived, 2 were incomplete. We asked Ms. Personality about it and she kind of rolled her eyes, sighed and walked back to the counter. She did eventually come back with the rest of the orders and pretty much dropped them on the table. I took this opportunity to ask her name to which she replied 'Lisette'...
I am very disappointed at the poor customer service and long wait at this location and won't be back.
