My wife and I were so excited to try this place. I have a gluten allergy and we saw on their main site that a gluten free bun was available. To make sure, I called before and was told yes, they have gf bun. When we got there we liked the 50's upbeat atmosphere and friendly employees. I mentioned that I wanted GF bun and was told they did not have it! UGH! SO my wife ordered her burger and I ordered mine without any bun and took it to go. We got home to find our orders completely reversed...complete incompetence! The employees were friendly, but they had that blank look on their face when asked questions about their product. Unacceptable! At this moment my wife is driving back to get the order corrected. It will be the last time we take our business there. Too many other options especially at that price!
