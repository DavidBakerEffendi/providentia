Terrible. Not worth the 1.5 hour wait for a burger. The owner is a total flake, and ignores you since she's running the place on her own. Here's an idea, hire another g*d d**n waitress so you'll give refills and take orders properly. I went to this place 3 times, and all 3 times I was waiting 30 minutes for drinks, and another 50 minutes for my food. I don't care how  good the burgers are here, they're over-priced, take forever to prepare, and the staff are generally rude and dismissive. Avoid.
