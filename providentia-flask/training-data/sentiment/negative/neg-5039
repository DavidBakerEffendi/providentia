Spent over $100 on breakfast and the service and the food were bad.  Food was bland and truly flavorless.  
Since we ordered to go we were instructed to order at the bar.  We get to the bar and the bartender wont take our orders even if we stand and not sit on the chairs as she required our ID's.  We hadn't thought to bring our ID's since we brought cash to pay for our food.  The bartender was abhorrent and disdainful, came off rude and unfriendly.  I will never return to this restaurant again because of the service she provided us.  
Experience was bad and the food was bland = look for a better place on the strip which you will find and spend your money there.
