Started out promising with the 6 beers for $12 and the 2 x 1 shrimp cocktail which were ok and the service was decent but the problems started when my brother got his camarón y pulpo cóctel, the pulpo looked and tasted a day old and my brother even threw up, we told the waitress and she was finding an excuse to say it was an allergic reaction which wasn't because he's not allergic to it, then she tried to say that my brother drank alcohol and that's why he got sick but he didn't drink anything but water, and to top it off we asked for the manager which greeted us when we first showed up but all of sudden vanished and no manager was around. I wasn't expecting high quality mariscos like in Mexico but If you want close to that I would go to Bajamar seafood and tacos was close to it and the food was better quality and a lot cleaner, So please be aware of this place, I don't want anybody else to get sick! Plus they don't care!
