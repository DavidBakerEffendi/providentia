Terrible customer service by waiter "Rosalba". I went in with my family for pollo a la brasa and wished we had gone somewhere else. First of all, Rosalba said they did not have pollo a la brasa and recommended that we try a different Peruvian restaurant. Huh? Why would you try to encourage your customers to go somewhere else? Obviously, Rosalba must not have felt like working. Every time we asked for something, she gave us an attitude. Very sad way to treat the customers.

Next, I asked for one of their domestic beers. Again, Rosalba said they did not have any domestic beers but "Cristal." So if you don't have pollo a la brasa or domestic beers, then don't put it on your menu!

We were very disappointed with the service so we decided we were not going to give a tip, little did we know Rosalba charged an 18% gratuity tip for a group of 5 adults. What?! Usually gratuity tips are for 6 or more. Rather than argue, we left and decided to never come back. Instead, I'm letting you know what to expect.

It's really such a shame for a restaurant to hire employees that make the restaurant look bad and discourage customers from wanting to come back. You have been warned.
