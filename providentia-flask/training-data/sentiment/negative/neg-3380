Where to begin? Arrived at around 9:30 after Bronco/Steeler game on a Sunday evening. Were seated promptly and our first waiter came right over and gave a detailed run down on the menu. We had to  flag down the manager to actually take our order after waiting over 20 min. We only ordered soup, salad, cheese and charcuterie plat as well as 2 desserts-nothing that required much prep time. We waited and waited and waited. Finally begged the manager to bring our food. All but the soups and salad arrived-a good hour after we were seated. The charcuterie and cheese plates were tiny (8 pieces of salami and a fatty piece of something the resembled uncooked bacon but was apparently duck) and a cheese plate with small chunks of cheese. When we again asked the manager where was our soup/salad he said he would comp our entire meal (hence the one star on the review). He also told us he made the salad himself! Not sure why, but our original waiter slid by our table several times never making eye contact or acknowledging us again. The dessert was good-bread pudding as was the  sonoma salad and the 2 soups. But we were treated shabbily-perhaps because we were not ordering full entrees? We had come to Pittsburgh for a family holiday celebration and this was certainly a low point!! We also complained to the hotel next door since they two are adjoining and this restaurant provides room service to the Courtyard hotel. I would not recommend this place to anyone!
