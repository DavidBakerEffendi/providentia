I had visited other Eggsmart locations in Downtown Toronto and liked them. My mother was curious after hearing about some of my positive lunch experiences, so we visited this particular branch one day to have a small lunch.

The store is quite big, and is well-maintained and clean. 

The food quality, however, leaves much to be desired.

We ordered a grilled chicken caesar with the intention of splitting it. The portion served, however, was not at all like the other locations I have been to: there was 1 piece of toast (cut in 2 halves) and approximately 1 piece of 'grilled' chicken cut into 5 thin strips.

The 'Texas toast' was very thin - not at all like what I thought was a Texas toast. It did not seem to be prepared in any way other than being heated in cooking oil until slightly burnt. 

The 'grilled' chicken didn't seem like it was actually grilled. It looked and tasted like chicken that has been pre-boiled in water and briefly re-heated on a grill - it was not well-boiled, even, as the texture was as rough and over-cooked as can be. 

There were also a few rotten leaves (or, at least, I hope they were rotten leaves - they were disturbingly squishy) amongst the lettuce. 

Even the 'ice water' we requested was subpar, as it was lukewarm and without ice :(
