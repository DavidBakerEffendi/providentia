I came here at the suggestion of a friend and it being down the street I figured why not, which was my first mistake. 

I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito - Care Asada, Potatoes and cheese. 

Cheese came out cold and unmelted in the burrito, meat wasn't that warm and potatoes tasted like they have been under a warmer for quite some time.

The salsa bar did not help much either, due to the salsa being semi warm (this is 9am mind you) the red wasn't too bad in flavor, but the green just did not have any redeeming qualities, so i ate maybe a 3rd of the burrito and trashed the rest.

Now the fun starts, I go to pick up my fiance from her massage down the street at 10am and it hits me like a ton of bricks.. Needless to say she gave me the "i told you so" and off i went to handle business. 

NEVER AGAIN.
