We've eaten here on several occasions and wasn't impressed one bit.  The food is the typical fast-food Salsarita's which is fine, but the staff are complete a-holes.  They're extremely arrogant, rude, and completely bothered that we were there to order food --this is a typical visit and not just on one occasion.  

There is plenty of seating indoor and some outside, easy parking and on/off main road access to the location.  If you feel like being treated like you shouldn't be somewhere, I highly recommend this spot.

Needless to say it's been a while since we've been there, and likely won't be heading back any time soon.
