I bought perogies to take out from Schnitzel Hub. Instead of giving me the potato and onion ones I ordered and paid for, they gave me cheddar. They admitted to the mix up but that's about it. I bought 3 orders of it that they messed up. They haven't replaced them. They have ignored my complaints and my complaint to the BBB. They don't care about their customers. STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!!
