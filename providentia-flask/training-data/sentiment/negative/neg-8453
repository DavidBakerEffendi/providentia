WOW, what a MASSIVE let down.  been going here for almost 20 years.  this place USED to be THE place for the wickedest mexican food, great service, and a total party..  Went the other friday, place was a ghost town (clue #1).  The guys hosting told us it would be 15 minutes (the place was only half full, clue #2), and THEN told us to wait outside in the heat!  I even asked if they even wanted us there and he flat out said "I don't care".  Considering the location and my past fondness, our party of 8 stayed... I had been talking this place up to my friends from Peru and Colombia.  Should have known from the start...the food ended up being lously...and not a little, 4 of us got no sleep from cramping.  I think they scraped the bottom of the barrel for our red sauce, it looked more like spicy red paste.

Sad to say this is the end of an era for me, I WILL NEVER go back.  This was the only restaurant I would welcome a 1 hour wait for a table at...no longer.  The sisters use to run it, one of them past a few years back, and now it looks like the boys are running...don't waste your time, the Los Dos Molinos of old that got all the great reviews is dead.
