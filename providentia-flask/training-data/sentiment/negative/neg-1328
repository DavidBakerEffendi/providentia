This was the worst experience of ever had a Jimmy John's I went through the drive-through and got an unwhich the lettuce was oldit was wrapped in properly I know it's hard to wrap the sandwich in lettuce but the one in Scottsdale's that's a perfect every time the sandwich was disgusting and it fell apart right when I opened it it was such a bad experience I immediately logged on to yelp 

The tomatoes were tiny and two of them were the end pieces 
The lettuce was old and super wet (0crunch)
Not much avocado spread
all the taste my Unwhich usually has did not exist on this sandwich everything was so old I felt I had been robbed 

And I usually love to treat my self to an Unwhich 
Clearly this isn't a good location and wasn't the quality I've come to expect from being spoiled from the one in Scottsdale
