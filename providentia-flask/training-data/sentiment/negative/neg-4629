This restaurant definitely caters to a specific demographic that doesn't consist of foodies, isn't diverse, and has a lot to love, if you know what I mean (which is why the reviews are so many and so high). Food was okay at best and portions were massive, with trashy looking decor. Leaving this review because I want people to know the reviews are biased.
