Do not eat here! I had an allergic reaction from what I assume is their new to go boxes and the GM Danielle only wanted to interrogate me and treated me like I was lying about my visit and reaction. I had zero issues the night we dined however when I ate my left overs bam! Instant swelling. I would question their sanitation and cleanliness if I were you!
