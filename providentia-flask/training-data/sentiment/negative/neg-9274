This food made me so sad, it was almost like someone with and Italian/Sri Lankan background was making the food. There were chunks of canned tomato in the biryani, butter chicken and Aloo gobi. Which makes me think Italian. The amount of seasoning in the biryani reminded me of the insanely over seasoned Sri Lankan food. The biryani was completely inedible, a complete assault. It was expensive and terrible, I will never eat there again.
