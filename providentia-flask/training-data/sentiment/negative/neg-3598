I don't typically write bad reviews but this place is pretty bad. It's got a decent atmosphere but it took over an hour to get our food. It took 20 mins just to get a refill on water. The food literally made me sick to my stomach. Probably because they were so behind on people's orders that they most likely skipped fulling cooking the food. Keep away if you can unless you just want to have a drink at the bar.
