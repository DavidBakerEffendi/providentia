Wow!!!! I can tell why there is a net 3 star review on this place. We were downstairs for dinner and decided to come upstairs for a drink.

It took about 10 minutes for any bartender to wait on me. Possibly because I don't weigh 90 pounds??? Because the girls that just sat down next to me just mentioned how nice the bartender was for calling their group "super beautiful"........ Now they're talking about "chubby chasers."

Also some douchey looking guy tried to get my boyfriend to leave our table? Also because he doesn't weigh 90 pounds. Great place if you're 85 pounds tops. Clearly against overweight people.
