This is a brand new establishment be as expected the crowd flood it at least for lunch. It was crowded. They have a number system that you place on your table and a server comes and delivers your food but you pay prior to like you would at a fast food place. The food is mediocre at best for Greek. The fries were over salted and the meat is not bursting with flavor. The value is not there for $11 my platter was not delicious me I would not count on coming back. Staff is friendly but seems overwhelmed.
