I walked in around 3:45 and the two employees sleemed pissed that I walked in. I ordered a slice of cheese it was cold soo I asked for it to be heated up and the girl smacked her lips. She turned on the oven didn't let the oven hear up before she put the pizza in. The HORRENDOUS service and the NEGATIVE attitudes are two of the many reasons this place is going down fast
