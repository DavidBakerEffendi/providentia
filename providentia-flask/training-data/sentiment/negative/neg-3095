I am disappointed in this place.  I ate there in person before and I ordered delivery through Grubuhub this time and the food was not good.  Beef with scrambled egg over rice is usually my go to Cantonese dish...it was bland and so full of rice.  The Singapore rice noodles...well they used the wrong noodles.  Instead of using the chewy thicker rice noodle, they used glass noodles.  The texture is just all wrong.  The Mongolian beef was pretty decent.  And they sent me the WRONG item.  They sent me bbq pork soup wonton noodles instead of bbq pork lo mein.  Very disappointing.  Of all the dishes, we only ate the Mongolian beef.  What a waste.
