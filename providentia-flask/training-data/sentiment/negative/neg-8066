Unfortunately, today I walked in for lunch and I was told that I have to wait 45min before I am able to get my order, because the cook was busy with a large placed order and the second cook did not showed up. This is bad for people that only have an hour for lunch, so we had no choice then to leave to go somewhere else. Are you like looking to better accommodate lunch time with a second cook so regular walking customers can enjoy their food?
