Came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. The place was busy but we were seated within an appropriate amount of time. I ordered avocado rolls, and the rice unfortunately did not taste good, and the avocados seemed old. Not really a place to go to for quality rolls. Great place if you are looking for a cheap meal.
