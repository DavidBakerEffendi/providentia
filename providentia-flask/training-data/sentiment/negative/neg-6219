Popped in here really quickly today (Monday, July 9, 2018) for a quick bite while I was in the area and came away severely disappointed. 

The staff member who served me was probably the rudest person in the service industry I have come across. Tip: if you don't like your job then leave. 

I made a quick order 'to go' and it was done relatively fast, but when I looked in the bag there were no napkins. It shouldn't be a big deal so when I asked for some I didn't think it would be a huge inconvenience. She rolled her eyes at me and had to walk and entire 12 inches to get me one and then she hands me 1 cheap dollar store napkin. Well, I am going to need more than one so I asked for a couple more and she whipped around and shoved them at me. 

Service makes or breaks a business and she broke it today. I won't be back.

Oh, and the spring rolls are obviously commercial bought.
