I walked up to the counter and both attendants are on the phone. Just stand there waiting feeling "who is the customer here?". Finally one of the attendants (Deryn) finally  gets of phone and harshly asks what I want and actually all I want is to go the sushi bar and then she gets another call and starts talking. Then I say who is the customer and she starts arguing with me. Then she said she would call security on me ! Neither I nor anyone needs this from a restaurant ! I just walked away. I don't need rude people I can take my good money elsewhere and recommend everyone else does the same . By the way I'm a platinum member for Venetian , I'm not anyone off the street to be treated like that. First time in my life anyone anywhere has said they will call security on me !
