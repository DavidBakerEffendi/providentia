If i could give 0 stars I would. Awful awful awful! What a waste of my time and money. Ordered the 4 piece shrimp and chips & 2 piece fish 7 shrimp, ended up with 3 pieces of fish and 9 shrimps that were so completely covered in their breaded stuff you couldn't even enjoy the shrimp. I will never go to this location again.
