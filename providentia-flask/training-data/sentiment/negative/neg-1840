I came with a group of 6 to Fred's Not Here for Summerlicious 2011. I had heard great things about it, but was very disappointed.

I ordered the lobster and crab soup appetizer, ribeye with mashed potato entree, and the chocolate mousse dessert. The appetizer was the only part of my meal that blew me away.. It looked and tasted amazing! The steak was tough and sub-par, and the dessert was CRAP. They ran out of chocolate mousse, so they gave us JUST CAKE. It tasted like day-old, dry, pre-made cake and they topped it with mint. I'm assuming a chef quit on them that night because it took forever to get dessert. 

My girlfriend got the cod curry (I think that's what it was) and it was delicious. Unfortunately she wasn't feeling well so she barely had any of it.. She doesn't know if it was from the appetizer, so I won't blame it directly on Fred's Not Here.

Overall, as I mentioned, we were all very disappointed and upset that we had to wait so long for our sub-par dishes. 1/5
