The worst McDonald ever!  I would rate it a ZERO if I could. Had MULTIPLE messed up orders.  The drive through is like waiting at a Clinic every time. Last time I stopped at the drive through to make an order, they asked to hold on a sec. But the sec turned into literally 5mins...I got fed up and just took off like the other person next to me did.  Another time I actually managed to make an order but the line barely moved in over 10 min so I took off without paying.  The workers there are very rude, unreliable, unprofessional, and incompetent. It's suppose to be a FAST FOOD people.  They lack management.  I've seen the manager dancing and rapping instead of making sure the workers are getting the correct orders in a timely fashion.  I vow never to go there ever again! Not worth your time and money.
