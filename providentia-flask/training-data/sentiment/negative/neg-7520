Atrocious. Absolutely terrible. Would never come back.The only things that were mildly ok were the drinks and the fact that no one was actively rude. We had to go get our own menus, the food took about an hour to come out once we had the opportunity to even order (our waitress would disappear for half hours at a time before we even ordered and that was even before we got drink orders in which also took forever to get to us even though we saw them sitting at the bar.) The food didn't come out as it was described on the menu at all: I ordered the Ruben eggs Benedict which sounded interesting and delicious. It came out as a poor excuse for a meal, missing cheese and having an anemic amount of substance. It was mostly large pieces of bread and one single slice of corned beef on each piece that they probably bought for 12Â¢ at giant eagle next door. The "dinner size" of the orange chicken was laughable and by laughable I mean sad. It was $17 for two tiny pieces of chicken tenders covered in sugar basically. I don't feel bad writing this review. We used to go to the one in mt Lebanon and it was pretty good. But this location was a poor excuse for a restaurant. And they certainly did NOT deserve the $47 we paid for the awful service and food. Sorry but this place sucks.
