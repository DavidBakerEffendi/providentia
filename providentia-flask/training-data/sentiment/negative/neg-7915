We made reservations for Saturday night to celebrate our birthdays. The entire meal was a huge disappointment...the waitress was noticeably inexperienced and the food sub par. Salad was a plate of unchilled greens with dressing on the side, not a tomato or cuke in sight! My husband ordered soup as an appetizer which eventually arrived after dinner when the plates were being cleared. We all ordered some type of steak as an entrée...I ordered the 16 oz.  bone in rib eye, medium rare...when served it didn't even slightly resemble the description on the menu...the steak was less than a half an inch thick, no bone, covered in sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, it was well done, tough and tasted like it was boiled in a pan of au jus.   Another dinner was the bacon wrapped filet...my husband said the texture was on the mushy side and not cooked to order. The filet medallions, topped with shrimp, crab and drizzled with béarnaise was anything but was depicted on the menu... the medallions were 3 chunks of fillet, the shrimp was of the canned salad variety baked in phyllo and served on the side, the crab wasn't obvious. The béarnaise was on the side and cold. A NY strip served to another diner in our party was also overcooked. Presentation was sloppy to say the least with every steak sitting on a pile of mashed potatoes making cutting the steak difficult on a crowded plate!  Additionally, every plate was served barely warm. If it were just I and my husband the dinners would have been returned to the kitchen...but we were dining with my elderly, in-laws and didn't want to make a fuss that would upset them since we were celebrating special birthdays. I saw rave reviews for their lunch menu and cocktails perhaps that should be their forte. This is definitely not a 3 or even a 2 star restaurant for the dinner crowd. We will not be coming back!!!
