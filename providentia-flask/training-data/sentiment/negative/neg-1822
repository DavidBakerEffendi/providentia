Not a fan. My husband and I were intrigued by this place a few weeks ago when we were on our way to Papa J's. We decided to order take out Saturday night and give it a try. When my husband picked up the order, the restaurant was dead. One table walked in as he was leaving. I ordered the grilled chicken salad and he got the pulled pork entree. My salad consisted of iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese, tomatoes, onions, chicken, fries and a piece of overcooked, inedible bacon casually thrown on top the salad. Was this supposed to be the real bacon bits as listed on the menu? The chicken was also barely edible due to being over cooked and extremely dry. On the plus side, the fries were fresh cut and would have been tasty if they weren't cold. My husband did enjoy his pulled pork but did not feel it was "award winning" as described in the menu. His greens and potato salad were barely edible. He took two bites and threw the rest away. Atypical behavior for the man I refer to as a "human garbage disposal". Maybe their speciality- wings, waffles and funnel cakes are better but, I'm not going to take the chance. Eat at your own risk.
