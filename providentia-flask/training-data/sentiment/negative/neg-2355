Today I tried the Baby Back Rib Thickburger.  I was disappointed.  The burger was not freshly cooked.  It was really dry.  Also the images in the ads are no where near accurate.  In the ads the ribs look like it is an inch thick and cover the burger.  Instead you get two small pieces of meat about 1/4" thick.  Look at this picture.  For $6.99 I expected more.  I'm also not impressed by the drink choices.  I'd like to see more variety.
