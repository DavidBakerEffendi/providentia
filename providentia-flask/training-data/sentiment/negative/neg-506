We walked up to the cashier at 9:05pm, and they were closed. Cashier was extremely rude about this, and said the hours were on the sign. Nope. Not on the sign. It's VEGAS and the buffet closes at 9? SMH. We weren't the only ones disappointed, there were a bunch of people riding up the escalator as we left.
