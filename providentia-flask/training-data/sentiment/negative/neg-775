I had a feeling the moment we sat down and were brought glasses of lukewarm water which did not contain ice it would not turn out too nice.  My gut feeling didn't disappoint.  The waiter brought menus w/the water,  but no bread. Tables to our left & right which arrived later received bread.   We ordered caesar salads,  which consisted of non crisp iceberg lettuce pieces with what appeared to be old croutons.  Our rigatoni w/meat sause dish was super salty.   The seafood pasta dish was the ordinary.  Our salads dishes were not cleared for at least 20 minutes after were done.   Waiter was very slow and non attentive. Of all the restaurants to choose,  we chose the worst @ Venetian.
