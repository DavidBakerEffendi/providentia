Total 5 stars for Server Ross who ran her butt off while everyone else was sleeping today but what was more offensive was the blaring country western music that was going nonstop from the time we arrived to the time we left... So Denny's the sixties style Diner has gone country or at least for today since their normal manager decided to go on vacation for the next couple days ...when the cat's away the mice will play country music all day...
