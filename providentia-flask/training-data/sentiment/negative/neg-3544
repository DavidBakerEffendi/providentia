I'm a regular here. I come before every Knights game. So disappointed in the service tonight. No happy hour due to March Madness, I get that. Milk the tourists for all you can, Lol. Ivan, our bartender, wasn't nice at all. Never cracked a smile or said thank you. I tipped him 15% but I usually tip 30%.
