The buffet at the Bellagio has gone downhill in a big way. Had the weekend brunch here and the selection was not all that great and what was there was often cold and bland. Service was also not very good. I remember this place being so much better years ago when I first came here. For $25/head ($30 if you want champagne), I expect a lot better selection and quality. Don't waste your money here.
