Went to this spot to order some takeout.  Ordered an Enchilada and Taco combo, both beef, along with other items for the family.  The taco, which normally has a crispy shell, was thrown into the enchilada sauce.  The person bringing us our order did not check to ensure order accuracy.  I was upset about the taco being soggy and gross, and went on to the enchilada, and it was chicken instead of beef.  Two strikes in one menu item.  The family got chimichangas, which were alright but were also sitting in a thick puddle of water.  

Their to go boxes are those that you would recieve an elementary school lunch in- styrofoam with segments.  The beans were thrown into one segment and the rice into another, allowing for cross contamination.  I'm pretty sure the beans should be in a separate container, at the very least.

Bottom line, don't order takeout from here.  They don't take the time to ensure order accuracy, and they are not equipped with the proper boxes to handle takeout to begin with.
