Never go to a place without Yelping! Ugh, our out of town friends were visiting and staying at TI. They saw the unlimited alcohol sign and went for it. 

No idea how some folks could give this place 5 stars. Must be Vegas buffet virgins that don't know any better. 

The food had been sitting there probably since lunch. Limp corn that tasted like it came from a frozen batch. 

What a waste of my money! Take your $31.95 and go have lunch buffet at Wicked Spoon! 

The one star is for the fabulous server who looked after us well.
