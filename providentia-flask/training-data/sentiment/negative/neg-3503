I sent back my sesame beef noodle dish as it tasted like fish only to receive a second noodle dish (they selected it for me without giving me a choice) that was equally dissatisfying (overly sweet chilli chicken udon). The staff was condescending and did not believe me that the first dish tasted off, even to the point where the staff member tasted my noodles in front of me to see if the fish flavour was really there!  I will never eat here again, lesson learned!
