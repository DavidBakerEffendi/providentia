Not coming back here. Went on a Friday afternoon, had their lunch special and it was awful. Presentation was bad, tasted cheap, price was expensive. I've had cheap buffet sushi before and that tasted better than this place. Don't waste your money here. Way too expensive for what it is..
It did seem clean, but our waitress wasn't knowledgeable about the menu at all. It seemed like this was her first job (probably was), but had no communication skills and didn't really pay attention. There were only 2 tables in the entire place including us and I over heard the other table get their order wrong.
Also, my boyfriend and I got sick after eating here. Not food poisoning sick just that the fish was definitely not fresh.
