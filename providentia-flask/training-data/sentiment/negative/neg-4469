This was definitely the most unpleasant meal we had while visiting Las Vegas. 

I could talk about the rude hostess, the long wait, or the vanishing server but I think I will focus on the food. 

The food itself is about the same quality as a Denny's. We started with a pizza as an appetizer, and it tasted like something purchased in the frozen food aisle and warmed up in a microwave. I expect food to be overpriced in Vegas, but at the very least it should taste good.

We should have known better after the pizza experience, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded to order the street tacos. They were miniature, cold, and barely edible. Quite honestly, these tacos were insulting to tacos everywhere.

After realizing how awful the food was, we went next door to Shake Shack. After our experience at Tom's Urban, Shake Shack tasted like heaven.

I have never felt the need to write a Yelp review until my meal at Tom's Urban. I'm trying really hard to think of one positive thing to say...but I am drawing a blank. If you want to stay open in a city with so many great restaurants, you'll have to do better.
