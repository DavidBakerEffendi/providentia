Its really hard to give this restaurant any stars. The food was terrible. When we complained to the management they said it was because the dishwasher broke. Not sure how that makes the food bad but that was the excuse. There was nobody serving at the roast beef station, the chicken teriyaki was so salty and the sushi looked like I made it and Ive never made sushi in my life. Ruined my daughters birthday! We left and told them we couldnt justify spending that kind of money on garbage!
