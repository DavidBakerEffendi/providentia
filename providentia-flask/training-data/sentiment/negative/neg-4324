Can't give no stars or I would.  Hadn't been for quite awhile.  Went 3 weeks ago when advertised special for steak & lobster.  It was sooooo cold in there and I mentioned several times and waitress said nothing could be done.  Told her to the box food and I left.  Called manager who said to come back and  give another try -- they would comp.  Went tonight with my son -- we waited forever for the manager to come out.  He NEVER came but told waitress to comp my dinner.  I was paying for son's dinner.  BOTH our steaks were coated in red Fajita seasoning and spicy.  We never asked for spicy Fajita seasoning.  Asked for manager to come out and he said they ALWAYS put that on.   WTF?   Who automatically ruins a good steak with Fajita?  I'm at a steak house, not Mexican restaurant.  I couldn't eat it and will NOT EVER return if they truthfully ruin steaks with Fajita automatically.  What are they trying to cover up?????????
