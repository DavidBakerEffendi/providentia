Worst service I've ever had here tonight! And the sad part is that I love Happy Dog! It's usually a fun, relaxing atmosphere. The server was rude (maybe he just didn't like women), didn't want to take our questions (walked away while answering), and wasn't attentive enough to even ask if we wanted refills of drinks.
