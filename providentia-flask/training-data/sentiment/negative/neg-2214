Everything we ordered was completely disgusting. We ordered from the late night menu, I got the veggie fajitas beans and rice. They left out my tortillas in my Togo order the beans and rice were disgusting. My best friend ordered the fish tacos which ended up being some sort of strange shredded fish. My boyfriend got the salmon salad, which was ok but would've been better but the salmon was dry. They left out my garlic fries and on top of all of this disgusting food it was 91$!!! I will never eat here ever again
