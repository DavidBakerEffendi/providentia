Everyday 2 weeks on a Monday we have "family dinner" where we usually pick a different restaurant to meet to catch up with family over dinner, so this week on Monday we decided to try Fuego at Cityscape to find out that they were closed. It was only 7 pm! We were unhappy about this, so we ended up going next door to The Strand. There was nothing on the door or window stating why they were closed on Monday, however there were holiday hours but nothing about being closed on Monday. Kind of bad timing to be closed especially since there is ice skating going on at cityscape which was absolutely jam packed with people and I am pretty sure that they worked up an appetite and would have loved some good Mexican food after ice skating, oh well, Fuego's loss I guess.
