Updated reviewthis was some months ago now, was served raw chicken sandwich. Brought to their attention, wanted a refund.. first manager insisted it was cooked, walked away wouldn't deal with my objections. 2nd manager told me no food is actually made on property..it's all cooked elsewhere and only warmed there (interesting) so in that case they can not know for sure that it wasn't fully cooked. I left with receipt and food (,for photos,) and wrote to corporate. They sent back a pathetic generic letter telling me food is fine. Now, the best part is I ate there 4 to 5 times a week. That day, I had eaten breakfast there and gone back for lunch. And this is how they treat customers. Haven't been back since. I prefer kneaders now.
