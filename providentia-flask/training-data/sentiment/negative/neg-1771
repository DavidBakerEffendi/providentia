The hours say they're open until 10pm. The sign on the door says they're open until 10pm, yet when I showed up at 9:45 the doors were locked and the "open" sign was off. When I knocked on the door, out of the three employees inside, only one looked at me and only did so from behind the swinging doors with a smirky grin on his face that basically said, "yeah right, lady. I'm not opening the doors for you." Extremely disappointed, since this WAS one of my favorite places by my office for lunch.
