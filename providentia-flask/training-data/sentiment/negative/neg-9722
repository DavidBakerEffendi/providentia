All I wanted to order was a Veggie burrito ($5.86) with shredded chicken. Why did she say we have to get a Chicken burrito and add the veggies for $9  That makes NO DAMN SENSE. Then I told her another Filiberto's made the veggie with chicken and she said we could go to that one. Are you serious? Your customer service is TERRIBLE!!
