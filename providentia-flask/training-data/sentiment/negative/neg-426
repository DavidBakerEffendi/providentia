Dishonest and rude!!! The waiter lied to us about there being a booth available and made us wait 15 minutes!!! The place was busy and we (3ppl) asked if they had any booths but we were willing to take anything. There was one seat near the door for 4 and no booths. We said okay sure. Then a group of 3 behind us came in and she said oh there's a booth now, you're just gonna have to wait a couple of minutes til we clean up, we said sure. And she proceeded to give our table to the people who came in after us. Then we waited but 10 minutes later I got suspicious and walked by to see what room was available... turns out there was people in all of them!!!! I guess she had given a check and made the assumption they would leave right after! Then I talked to the waiter and said "hey, where is our booth? They all are full? Why did you lie to us?" And she said "ok excuse me" and proceeded to serve a customer. After that I was livid so I took my friends to Zuki instead. It was going to be there first time at Yuki. So they lost them as a customer and me. No apology or anything, just "excuse me". I used to come here quite frequently but not anymore.
