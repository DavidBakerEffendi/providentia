A glorified Filibertos. I was extremely disappointed in everything. I ordered the carne asada taco combo with rice. The tacos were freezing cold and the rice was bland (no flavor at all.) It was dinner time when we were there so it was busy but regardless they should have had someone out in the lobby cleaning tables as people left. There were no clean tables at all! People were huddled by the drink area waiting for their food so you couldn't even fill up your drink. The salsa bar area was a disgusting mess, there were receipt papers everywhere, and the food was terrible. I'll give a good review when I feel the place deserved it but Carolinas is not going to be one of those places. Awful.
