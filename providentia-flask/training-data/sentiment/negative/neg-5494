Holy cow. You Vegas folks have low standards.

We came in here and ordered wings, pizza, bulgogi and fries. 

The pizza was the most disgusting pizza I've EVER had. Not exaggerating. I took it back to my hotel thinking maybe I'd like it after I got drunk. Nahp :(, first time I threw away a whole pizza between 4 ppl. 

Wings were overwhelming, too much sauce that tasted like it was straight up out the bottle. It tasted like Chinese fast food orange chicken. 

Fries were bomb! It tasted really fresh, seasoned perfectly, with the perfect crunch. 

An hour into eating we check up on the bulgogi, turns out our waiter never put it in. We had to cancel since they were closing up, but they gave us 4 free sodas. I thought that was a very nice gesture. 

All the homies from Cali, avoid this place. It's not like LA/OC/SF food, you will be disappointed.
