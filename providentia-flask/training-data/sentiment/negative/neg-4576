Since I already wasted my time eating here last night, I'm not going to waste any more time on a detailed review.  You don't need to know everything wrong, just run.  Let it just suffice to say that it was vial.  Not one edible item.  None of us could eat it.  Left it and went home hungry.  Worst Chinese food ever.  Oh well, I'll stick to Super Dragon, even if I have to drive further.
