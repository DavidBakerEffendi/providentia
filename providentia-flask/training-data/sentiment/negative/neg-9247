Wow. I don't see where the 5 star ratings are coming from. 3 of us came here for dinner on a Friday night. The atmosphere is great. They had a duet singing. We all shared the calamari appetizer. It was tender and served with 2 sauces, delicious. Crash and burn from there. All 3 of our entrees where BAD. We had 1 Ahi dinner, 1 chicken pasta dinner, and 1 short rib dinner. The chicken, ahi, and short ribs where all so dry we could barely swallow them. Won't be coming back.
