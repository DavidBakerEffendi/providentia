I love subway, just not this one. Missing some free fixins. Help is untrained and slow. Never been asked if I want lettuce in my salad.  Could be because they had very little in the containers. Most Subways have a hard time closing the lid on chopped salad because it is so full. Not this Subway ...  the point of going to a chain is consistency of product. These people need to go to training. The young man slicing bread was the only one with a clue. Cashier was pouty.
