I really dont understand the hype of this place. Went early on a Sat morning, about 30 minutes before opening time so I didn't have to wait long. Was actually first in line and ordered 4 breakfast sandwiches. Got mine and was excited to try it because of the rave reviews. Took one bite and asked my friend if my egg was supposed to be cooked well done. He said the yolk was supposed to be runny, which it definitely was not. The bread they use is also not ideal, wasn't amazing or anything. The chef made me a new sandwich, which tasted slightly better now that the yolk was runny, but overall, still did not get WOWed by this place. Would not come back. So many other delectable spots in vegas for breakfast food!
