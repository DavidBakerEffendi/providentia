again this is not a fair review but i need to speak up about this. 

i didn't stay here. BUT...

this place SMELLS SO BAD that i had to leave while friends of mine ate lunch in one of the cafes. 

it is the most awful smell and i couldn't figure out why nobody else was gagging and holding their nose - until i heard a little kid say "mommy... why does this place smell like soap?" 

i'm nauseous writing this... it smelled like air freshener from the dollar store... used in a trailer... filled with women who are sweating and wearing cheap perfume and lady products. 

SICK!
