I'm done with this place. I've been here before several times and many times when I have guest visit me, I'll take them here or recommend people here. Today I arrived with family who are visiting us and decided to grab a bite to eat. It was 4:40pm and as we arrived, this  man (later found out is a manager) approached us and with a stern voice told us " you have 5 min to order because the kitchen will close ". What kind of crap is that?! He was practically telling us to turn around and leave. Ive worked I this industry for many years and understand that the staff wants to go home, but you still should accommodate guests as best as you can. I've had way better customer service the times I've been here before. This town is growing, as far as places to eat. I'm taking my business elsewhere and will not recommend this place again. Like I said, many other places to go and eat.
