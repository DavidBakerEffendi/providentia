This used to me the go to buffet of Las Vegas where you can trust the quality of food whenever you come. Came for breakfast, there was no food quality management at all behind the food. Waffles, pancakes, French toast were stacked high and had over fifty pieces just laying around so all of it was hard and cold. This is just a sign that they don't care about controlling the flow of food and giving customers the best food possible. Toasts were the same. Hard, cold. It just looked like people were trying to avoid working so they cook massive all at the same time. Please hire quality control management that cares and knows about good food. 
Bellagio buffet went from go-to to no go.
