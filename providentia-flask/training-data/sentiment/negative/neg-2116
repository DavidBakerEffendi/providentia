Used to give them 4/5 stars, until they wouldn't let me use a coupon on my BIRTHDAY. Just wanted a quick bite to hold me over. My boyfriend was fully prepared to pay for his meal & my drink but they did not honor the coupon for one free entree. There are so many accommodating establishments on your birthday so I just walked on. Ridiculous and I could make it at home for 1/3 the price.
