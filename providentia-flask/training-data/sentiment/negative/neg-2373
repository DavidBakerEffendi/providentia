Unfortunately, I had to return to this dump. My neighbor is down for a few weeks after having had surgery and she called me on Saturday afternoon and asked if I could stop and pick up Chinese food for her. She said she would call and place the order. She texts me and tell me she ordered here. I was pissed!  I should have just asked what she wanted and stopped at one of the hundred Chinese spots along my route home. Of course, they are still nasty and rude (even while taking your money). I told my neighbor, only because you are sick did I stop at this restaurant. The place is dirty inside and they don't deserve to be in business. I don't understand how people patronize them simply because the food is cheap and tastes good. Check out Cottage, I think they are better.
