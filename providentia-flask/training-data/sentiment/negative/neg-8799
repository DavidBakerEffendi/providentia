When I order salmon I generally prefer that it not arrive with a long hair in it. There was a long strand of black hair wrapped around the salmon and laying across the plate and it was completely obvious - I showed the server before she even put the plate down. The response? "Oh, yeah, there is a hair." And she took it back. No apology, no offer to comp it and then it took another 20 minutes for a hair free replacement to be brought out....by which time my dinner companions had almost finished their meals after waiting till their food got stone cold waiting for my meal to be brought out.
