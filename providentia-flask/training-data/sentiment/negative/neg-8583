My boyfriend and I made a reservation three days in advance for our anniversary for 6:00 pm. Internet and sign on door say they open at 4. We show up at 5:50 and see two other couples waiting who say they aren't open. Don't know why. We waited around for half an hour before giving up and going to Fogo di Ch√£o. Seriously, don't give an unprofessional business like this your time or money. Go to an awesome place like Fogo instead!
