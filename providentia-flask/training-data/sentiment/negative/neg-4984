This place is the worst. Service is terrible. We sat at the bar for 20 minutes with no service. They were busy and the bartender was slammed. However, the manager walked the bar 3 times and didn't even ask if we needed drinks or wanted to order. Nothing! It's a joke. 


This chips are always stale and the service ALWAYS STINKS!

Great location, great job on the up-fitting of the building but not ever stepping foot in this place. 
Every time I give them another shot I'm disappointed! 

Big let down. 
Wish they were back on east when Eric worked the bar and Patrick was the manager. I went there like 3 times a week and ALways had excellent service regardless of how busy they were!
