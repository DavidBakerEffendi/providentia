Awful! This place use to be a mere 3 star at its best but man did tonight disappoint. At first I thought ok well I guess it's my fault for ordering Thai food at a Chinese place but then again even the Chinese food was horrible. I'm not sure what happen that made this place go from bad to worst but it did. 

I order the Thai Mint Chili thinking it was going to be the ground meat with mint stir fry. I was wrong. I order port with curry "Sauce" that should've been the first red flag and a big give away and the beef and broccoli. Then there was the combo app and they got the pot stickers wrong. How can you get pot stickers wrong! Ugh. I ended up throwing everything away. 

The egg rolls were super skinning with almost nothing in it but it had a decent Chinese five spice flavor to it. The pot stickers tasted stale like they have been microwaved too long and then deep fried if that. 

The pork with curry sauce was Chinese BBQ pork and some package curry sauce. What the heck why wasn't it regular pork. I never even imagine they would use that pork. But even if they did use regular pork it wouldn't have made up for the big let down. The Thai Chili woof I don't even know what that was. Weird favor and no mint in sight. 

The beef and broccoli....really it had the worst bitter taste to it and the meat had this weird tasted almost like propane and Oyster sauce only. My wife and I stop eating everything completely in fear of you no the F.P. Cross my fingers I'll be ok tonight! 

I guess there was a reason why we stopped coming to this place, I was getting burnt out with Rice and Noodle, dang it I should've stuck to what I know was good!
