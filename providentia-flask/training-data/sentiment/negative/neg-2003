This location was definitely not my cup of tea. This place was overcrowded and it was only a Thursday night. It was definitely quite difficult to get around from the bar, to finding a seat and squeezing through a tight space to the washroom. They have a dance floor where the DJ cannot transition from one song to another properly (the radio has better transitions). The DJ also mainly played a mix of a few old song with country. Have the people on the floor were making out and I believe 75%  of the people were either first or second year university students. Music is blasting and the floor as well as the table tops were sticky with spilt drinks everywhere. It is definitely to even reach the bar but I would have to admit that the only plus side is that the bartenders are all quite handsome, quick and still surprises me as to how they can hear our orders over the music. Overall, I would probably not return unless to this location. 
Ps, there is a $5 entry fee
