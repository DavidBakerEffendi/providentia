Mother's day 2013. I've been to the Mi Peru several times and the food has always been amazing. So I was looking forward to a great mother's day brunch. We were a party of 12 and immediately were approved by the server apologizing for being the only server on the floor because the  other server that was supposed to be on called in sick. This poor server was the only one on the floor, no busser, no manager and of course no owner. This poor girl was buried beyond belief. 
I've been in the restaurant business for years I felt incredibly sorry and helpless for the server, after 30 minutes sitting there and seeing what she was going through I thought the best thing for everyone including the server was for us to leave. When I told the server we were leaving tears weld up in her eyes, I gave her a fist full of cash and told her it wasn't her fault. 
I hope management commends the server for putting up with the utter incompetence of management and ownership of Mi Peru.
