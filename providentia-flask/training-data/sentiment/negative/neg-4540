Save yourself the trouble...DON'T go here! After being seated, it took over an hour to get our breakfast today. When it came out, our omelettes looked horrible. The cheese on mine wasn't even melted! Our food had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. The top portion of my omelette was so crusted and dried out. The hash browns were cold and my son's soup tasted like it was straight out of a can of Campbell's. He couldn't even eat it and I don't blame him. Our server, Steven, seemed very thorough at first. After he took our order, we never saw him again until after the manager brought out our food! After being asked 3 times for sugar-free syrup, we decided to take our pancakes home, as it never arrived to the table. It took forever to get to-go boxes and our checks. I should've gone to the back to grab them myself! 

The only one pleasant that we encountered that day was the girl who rang us out. She asked how our meal was and she had no idea what kind of answer we were about to give! She apologized profusely, but it wasn't her fault. It's the lack of self-motivation, on the server's part,  and lack of management at this location! We overheard more than one table complaining about more than one issue! I hope your corporate office evaluates these reviews to use them as an opportunity to coach their staff so they can improve their service for other patrons that may choose to dine here. I'll drive out of my way to go to the one on Alma School and Queen Creek before I'd go back to this location again!
