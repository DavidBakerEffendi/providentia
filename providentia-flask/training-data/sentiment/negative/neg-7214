Came in to a great hostess then it pretty much went downhill from there. Our waitress (she didn't introduce herself so I didn't catch her name) wasn't having a good day. No smile, no emotion, she just straight to the point - "Drinks?" and walked off while I held my food order in my head. She returns and I order, gives me the same cold emotionless attitude and walks off. We eat, the food is actually good but we quickly called for the check. The waitress asked "Now is there ANYTHING else you need?" I'm sitting here eating, I didn't ask you for an extra straw, an extra napkin or anything so why give me this attitude like I'm overworking you? Anyways she's the waitress with the "Lucky Leaf/ Four Leaf clover tattoo on her arm"

After the bill comes I'm overcharged and the manager explains I was charged a bill from a different table. I receive a refund but this isn't the type of experience I'd shoot to duplicate. I'm pretty much over this place now that it's become so cold and dead. The last time I came there was a drunk "air-humping" his girl/some chick the whole time while she played her video games. There were kids around and staff simply laughed while that woman was being sexually made fun of in public. Kudos.
