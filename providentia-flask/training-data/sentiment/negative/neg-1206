I didn't actually sit down for food at this cafe, because of a very rude staff member (who I assume was the owner from the other posts I've read).  Thinking it was a cafe with coffee and a washroom, I walked in and tried to use the restroom and planned to order a coffee to go. The blonde girl stopped me in my tracks and said "hi there" in the most unfriendly "what do you think you're doing" kind of tone. I said I was on my way to the washroom, which led to her tearing a strip off of me and asking me "where I came from"??? and about how the washroom was for paying customers only, etc... never even letting me speak, I felt so berated. 

I finally said I had planned to order something and she snarkily said I "never told her that but since I was going to order something I could use their washroom" YEAH RIGHT! It was embarrassing and she made me feel terrible - for trying to use her washroom! 

This kind of hostility would be more suited to a prison guard than owner of a place called "gratitude cafe". I didn't buy a coffee from her and I will never go back there again in my life.
