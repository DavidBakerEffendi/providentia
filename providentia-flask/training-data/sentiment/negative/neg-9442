WOW! Don't go here, long wait and my whole family felt ill after. The management is horrible and have no idea what customer service is! The food was less than what it should have been probably because half of it sat around while the other half was cooking! POOR MANAGEMENT and POOR food service all and all this is exactly why I dislike chain shacks that call themselves casual dining, this is slop and there is no dining about it!
