Extremely disappointed with this place. I've always dreamt of trying a Nathan's Famous hot dog after seeing the hot dog eating contest as a kid. First thing is the price is absurbly high. I understand it's on the strip in Vegas but compared to the original one in New York, its noticeably higher.

Also the worker here was extremely incompetent. I ordered a chili hot dog with a side of fries and for whatever reason the guy taking my order kept repeating chili cheese hot dog with chili fries. I had to constantly repeat my order to him (note I was very sober) but he kept adding on cheese to my hot dog and chili to my fries. I ultimately gave up and handed him my card. Somehow my hot dog came without cheese. 

The food itself was very average, but for the experience and service, I couldn't give this place above a 1 star.
