Terrible food. The day before we had buffet at the Caesar's and had amazing time with 5 star service.

Bellagio buffet is poorly designed and implemented. The food choice is limited with no hot food.. Well let me reiterate the "hot" food is only mildly warm, so do not let the steam trick you. The king crab legs are cold not like the Caesar's where the chef boils the crab and give them to you right on the spot.
 
The food tastes like cheap low class that you can find at local suburban casino. Close to frozen sushi (only 2-3 choices), smoked salmon?!! Which is not fresh yikes. The only thing We liked is the lamb.

Service is more like bus boys not much attention to patrons...
