First of all there's trash all over this place it's empty there's no customers zero and they don't even wipe their tables anyways I order two burritos, we waited over 20min to get them once they call my number the lady says ohh there's only one burrito cause that's all I charged you for , ok I thought you know accidents happen she didn't even bother asking me anything if I still wanted it or anything til right now I'm sitting here and she hasn't bother asking if everything is ok! Horrible customer service never coming back here again.
