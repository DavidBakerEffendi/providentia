Horrible service. The waitresses barely spoke english, and got upset when I asked them to repeat themselves. They were very cold and short tempered with me and my family. 

When I went to pay, the man behind the desk was texting or doing something on his phone, and did not immediately attend to our service. 

The food was cold, not kept warm and food all over the buffet, and is overly greasy, there are other ingredients other than oil.
