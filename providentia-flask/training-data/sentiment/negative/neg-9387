I spent 70.00 and I would have had more satisfaction setting it on fire. We had so many issues during this meal that I don't have enough time to type them all. It was HORRIBLE. We got an apology but we should have been comped. These restaurants don't seem to understand the power of Internet blogs and reviews. Only go to eat ere if you like to be frustrated, unsatisfied and at the end... F***ed with no lube.
