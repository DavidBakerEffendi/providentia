Beautiful casino, large guest rooms. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.   I am writing this complaint from a Venetian suite at approximately 4 am.  Why? Because I cannot sleep.  Why? Because my mattress is a sink hole.  Call the front desk you suggest? Been there and done that. I spoke to the night manager named Thomas who offered me his sincere condolences along with a promise to change the mattress in the morning.  So it seems I spent a fair amount of money to NOT sleep at a five star property that is nonchalant about providing the most basic comforts. Yes the casino is nice and the rooms are large but if the establishment is indifferent to it's customers....I'm not sure any of the rest matters.
