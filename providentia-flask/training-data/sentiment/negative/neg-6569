Food was great. Customer service was okay. Felt like we were being rushed and then we were amazed that after just 2 hours they "politely" said that they needed our table for another party and basically asked us to leave - after spending over $400! Please note that we are a group of mature women who were talking and catching up. We weren't loud or annoying. They just needed our table. Won't be back.
