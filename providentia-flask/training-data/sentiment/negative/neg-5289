So this rating is based on service and experience at my visit only as the food never came...  The place was not busy and we waited for about 30min for breakfast before deciding to walk out. We asked our server about 10 min before about our food and our response was 'yeah your food is coming...'  It seemed like a cute place at first but after sitting, I realized how filthy the place is. I've been here couple of times before but this place has definitely went down hill since my last visit. I yelped it after my visit and saw all the bad reviews. Not based on a food review but the only thing that's keeping this place going is the very limited breakfast omelette places in the area.
