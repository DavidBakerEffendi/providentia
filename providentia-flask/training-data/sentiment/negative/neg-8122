I was in that group that Edwin mentions in his review, and boy or boy did these guys screw up. I didn't have a big problem waiting for a seat since we were an unannounced group of 10 that showed up when they were busy, but saying that, they failed to mention how long the wait would be, and the entrance area was hot as hell, so not a comfortable waiting experience. 
And this waiting experience continued after we were ushered in to our seats, it took a good long time to get our orders, and the longest time I've had to wait for water to get to a table. And then with no warning they turn on all their lights in a very club-esque manner to indicate that it was time to get going. But wait....we had yet to receive our food/drinks! And then after a quick word with the servers and finding out that they had yet to even start on our orders (which were mainly drinks and the odd dessert item) after a solid 20 - 30 minutes after had given our orders in, it was a no brainer that the best course of action for us would be to leave. 

While I cannot comment on how good or bad their food is, prices here did seem to be a little higher than I would have liked to spend regardless, but from the few dishes the kitchen did send out in our hour there, it did seem like the portion sizes were pretty big. I can definitely say that I will not be coming here any time soon after the horrendous customer service they displayed.
