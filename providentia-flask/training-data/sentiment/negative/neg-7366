Drinks good , 

Security called my family member a "FAGGOT" when we left! Wtf! This is BULLSHIT!! 

I can't believe a country singer would approve of this type of conduct! 

I am so upset that my family member had to deal with this type of racism and had to be belittled like this!! We were in town for a wedding and they totally screwed up our weekend! All we heard about was this place and how fun it was!

Also my friends wife was told by security that if she showed her boobs she would be allowed in!! Wtf! 

You need to fire your security! That is unacceptable!! I hope you contact me about this! 

We asked for the manager 5 times and they said he was unreachable! Really!! 

I hope people boycott this place !! Apparently they are bigots and demean women!!
