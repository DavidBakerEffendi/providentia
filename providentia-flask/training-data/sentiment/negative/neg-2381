I wouldn't recommend this hotel even to my worst enemy. Stayed at the Venezia tower the first two nights and was woken up every morning at 5am from a door slamming. Our room was at the end of the hallway and the door that was being slammed I believe was a janitors closet or some kind of employee exit. The slamming wasn't just once but every 5-10 minutes. Come on people it's vegas people don't sleep until 5am. Called the front desk and they moved me rooms into the Venetian tower...... Glad that we were moved but there was a problem in that room as well. Us girls started to get ready for the night and as I was showering the water wasn't going down the drain. Called the front desk again they said they will have someone fix it. I told them we don't have time we need to get ready for the night. The lady then said call back after your done getting ready and we will send someone up. SERIOUSLY gross who wants to take a shower standing in water that isn't going down the drain after someone showers. Seriously lady. She finally said they will move us again for the second time. Moved into the new room and of course something else is wrong with it. The bathroom door doesn't close and the toilet doesn't flush right. For all this money we spent at this hotel I rather would have stayed at the Luxor and gotten a suit. The lady at the front desk was rude as well and didn't want to help out. The only reason I have one star was because I couldn't give a negative one. Never coming here again.
