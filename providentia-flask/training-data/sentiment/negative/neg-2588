Well the selections for our breakfast were great, our server was fast and friendly. And where else are you going to get a breakfast for $4.99. However, my husband and I both got salad's as well and half way through his salad, little bugs were coming out of his salad. I freaked out and asked one of the servers to take the plate, she said she would tell the manager, It took about 10 minutes for a manager to get to our table, and she says sorry can i make you another salad. Are you kidding me. Who wants to eat here when bugs are in your food. So disgusting. Due, to this we will not be back.  The reason they get one star is because of how long it took to respond to the situation, and the fact there were bugs in the food. YUCK
