Just moved to the area and since we hadn't really unpacked our kitchen or been grocery shopping yet we decided to get sandwiches here last night. Walk in about 7:30 and I'm told "just to let you know we're out of bread" oh ok. Well you should probably just close for the evening and put a sign on your door since no one wants a "sub in a tub"....as I'm walking out another couple goes to walk in and I warn them that they're out of bread....guy's response, no joke, "aw dammit, really? Oh well, isn't the first time..." YOU MAKE SANDWICHES. Walk over to Sprouts and buy some bread for f's sake.
