MUY TERRIBLE! 

We were looking for something to take to eat on the drive back, and though sandwiches was a good option. Sandwiches might have been a good idea, BUT not from Canter's! 

I ordered a pastrami sandwich and paid (approx.) $13 for two slices of bread with some pastrami thrown in there. 

DON'T COME HERE. You should go somewhere else - Subway is even better.
