I enjoyed them for Brunch on a couple of occasions; light, quick, and worth the money. But dinner last week was foul. The service was disappointing and the food, especially the seafood soup(???) was absolutely inedible. Server didn't take the dish off the bill and he also told us the wrong price on a terrible bottle of wine. We spent $150 for 3 people and hated everything. Never going back. Sad too, considering I raved about their brunch: but nothing will make up for our lousy dinner. Very disappointed.
