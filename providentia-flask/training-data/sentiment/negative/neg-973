We ordered delivery from them tonight and we are so disappointed ! 

Coconut soup is too creamy,the flavor is there but its texture is too thick for soup.

Pad thai noodles were mostly vegetables , and it's kinda bland, and there's baby corns. WHY is there baby corns in my pad thai !!?!? Ugh !!! I would make a wild assumption that their cook is not from Thailand because this is not how an authentic pad thai should taste like. 

Curry fried rice was also bland, luckily we have sriracha at home. Again the curry fried rice is not authentic neither.

We will not order from this place again, sorry.
For those of you looking for an authentic or even great taste thai food, this is NOT the place!
