Wow- not a very hard job to do, but somehow they are successful at screwing up my order every time-
Tonight was the final straw- 
Thanks for not paying any attention whatsoever and giving my order to the person I front of me without even asking what he had gotten-
Then on top of that, prior to my order being given away- we waited like 5 minutes while the shrimp and fish were both on the grill being cooked/heated up, but when the kid whom had ZERO attention to detail had to remake my order it only took 30 seconds............
So yay for ice cold fish and shrimp tacos!!!!!!!
