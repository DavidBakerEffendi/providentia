Food here is mediocre I think it is okay, my husband doesn't like it at all.  However do not bring your children here ever!  I was just here with my sister, she goes here 2 to 3 times a week, I go about every other week with people from work.  However now none of us will EVER go here again.  Apparently children that are noisy at all are not welcome the manager actually kicked us out because my sisters 1 year old was being too noisy.  She wasn't even crying she was just making baby noises loudly.  I just can't get over how rude these people are apparently our business was worth nothing to them.  So if your a pretentious jerk who can't stand children apparently this is your place!
