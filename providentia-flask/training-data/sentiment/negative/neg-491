The Good: Strawberry lemonades are the bomb! Still the same, they haven't skimped on this drink. Plain cheesecakes are still very good, even though the people working behind the counter can be pretty rude. Avocado eggrolls are amazing, they seem to be using the same original recipe. We always get the crab and artichoke dip, that's consistently good. Great ambiance, large glasses!

The Bad: Salad portions are wayyyyy down. The Santa Fe salad - used to be piled high, now they skimp on the beans and corn! My grandfather got this every time we visited. This last one he told the waiter how small the salad was and the waiter said "that's the way they come".

Cobb salad is not a traditional Cobb salad. CF's only has three thin slices of chicken about 3" long that looks like deli meat, 1 tbsp of blue cheese, one strip of crumbled bacon, about 1/4 of an egg white crumbled into teeny tiny pieces about 1 mm in diameter small pieces of diced tomato. Gone are the slices of hard boiled egg, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and chunks of chicken you'd expect. Complete waste of $15.

Some wait staff don't seem like they enjoy being there or enjoy you being there. Pretty consistently we've gotten one incorrect dish per table.

This restaurant used to be great with large portions at reasonable prices. Now it seems that to keep up their profits, they keep skimping on ingredients and portion sizes over the years. Too bad, we all used to like coming here, but we've decided our families won't be celebrating any more events there!
