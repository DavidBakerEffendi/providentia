Bad!!! 

I was a loyal Chicken Bonz customer at the original location on Sunset, then they became Chicken Shack. I was excited to see this Chicken Bonz because it is much closer to my House than the original, but I was sadly disappointed, The chicken is plain and the ranch is terrible! I now drive to Chicken Shack in Henderson to get my fix. Way better food!
