Tonight was my first visit to Cien Agaves. I met a group of people for happy hour. The decor is nice and the patio is awesome! they even have a fire pit. This however, is where the positives end. 

I arrived at 550. I finally was able to pin down a server at 615. I ordered a house margarita, a shrimp taco, and a chicken taco. At 645 other people who arrived after I placed my order receive their food. I said something to the person who brought their food about how long it was taking for my tacos and he respond in a rude tone "the kitchen is very busy". I explained that I had ordered 15 minutes before the food that had just arrived and he just walked away. A while later (655) my tacos came out and the ingredients inside the tortilla were cold. The margarita was watered down and the cold congealing tacos were mushy and salty. Very very disappointed.
