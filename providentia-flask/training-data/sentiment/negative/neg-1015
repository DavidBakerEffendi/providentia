Zero stars. After waiting in the ridiculously long line, I was then informed that they were out of gluten free crust (that they charge almost $2 extra for). We are attending a convention and had limited time to eat, so we were forced to find something else and barely had time to a scarf it down. Was anxious to try it but won't be back.
