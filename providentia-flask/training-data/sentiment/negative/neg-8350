Ordered a pizza, the location is literally in front of my apartment complex and my pizza was cold. Must have been sitting there for for almost an hour for as cold as it was, the drive from this location to my apartment door is all of anout five minutes. I ordered a soda and its
obvious it was never placed in a fridge. Cold pizza and warn soda. Horrible!
