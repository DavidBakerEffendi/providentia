We went to brunch on 8/26.    The service and the wait time for our food was awful It took one hour  to get our empanadas.  They were not great and half hour more for our entrees which were tasteless. The rice in our skillet tasted not fresh. Very disappointing experience. Would not be coming back!!!!
