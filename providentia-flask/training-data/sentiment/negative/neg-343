So I've been craving a cinnamon sugar bagel went to this location around 12 noon they had ran out of plain and cinnamon sugar which I believe they are open until 5pm so not sure why they wouldn't make more. A week later I call to make sure they had what I wanted before I got there. Big disappointment, the staff didn't even greet us he seriously looked bored and like he just hated being there. I had to approach him with a good morning. I bought a half dz, I really wanted my cinnamon sugar so I bought them even though they looked horrible. Big regret so disappointed. Bagels are suppose to be nice and round with a hole in the middle. What the heck are these?! Never going back. Customers have expectation and not even high ones but as a business you're suppose to make sure you meet them.
