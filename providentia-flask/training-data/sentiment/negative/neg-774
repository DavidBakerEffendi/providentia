I just ordered an order from uber eats I really love this place this was my 4th time ordering from this place since they have great vegan options by today will be THE LAST DAY. I ordered a vegan stuffed sweet potatoes I did receive this in time and the driver was great but the food it self had a plastic film in it I took two bites and there was a plastic film in my mouth it was so gross.....  definitely a let down this place was one of my favorites not anymore. 

NOT THANK YOU
