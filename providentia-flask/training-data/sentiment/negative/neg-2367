Big thanks to HQ pizzaville for helping me with nightmare.. Pizzaville is a 10 Star operator!! This location is not!

I usually order from my vaughan location. Was at friends place so ordered from here.

Online order "there at your door 40-50 minutes"
Ordered at 5
Called HQ @6 "store says food leaving now"
Called HQ @630 "food already left take 1/2 off" discount and apology offered right away.
Called HQ @645 "when it gets there tell them its free" - offered right away
Driver at 7PM "we dont give free. You pay 1/2 or i leave" was starving gave cash and called head office
Explained how food was cold, it only took 2 hours to get there and how driver held my food hostage...
HQ advised me that store won't bring me a new hot one and won't deliver to me anymore... 
Ended up getting full value of meal and $20 added to my account.. Which i will happily use at my local store....

Best customer service on the phone. Worst people woking at this store.
Love my vaughan location
