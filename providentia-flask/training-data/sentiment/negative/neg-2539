Went here yesterday April 18th nigh time. Fries were soggy with no salt and burger was burnt. So went again today April 19th night time and seriously had to write a review your staff are ffin incompetent. Behold my burger was burnt! BLACK BLACK BLACK. I couldn't even Finnish the first bite. And same thing fries had no salt what so ever. And ordered another burger as well that was missing even sauce. Will definitely never come back now.
