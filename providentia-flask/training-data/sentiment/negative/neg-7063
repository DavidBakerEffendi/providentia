Have ordered takeout here many times and never had an issue.  But my last experience is my last.   

Placed a takeout order on the way home as their location is about 15 minutes away with traffic.  Among other items ordered 2 orders of wings and asked for extra blue cheese.  Did not check the order before leaving, which I suppose is my mistake.  

When I got home and unpackaged my order they did not include any blue cheese, which pretty much makes wings pointless.  I called the restaurant and advised them of their mistake.  They offered for me to drive back to get the blue cheese.  Since this would mean eating at least 45-minute old wings, I declined.  They seem to be confused as to why I was frustrated.  The manager then said they work refund 50% of the wings back to our card for the troubles.  I accepted and gave the manager my receipt number.  

5 days later they still had yet to issue the refund so I called and asked to speak to a manager.  He advised that they would 1) go back and take care of the issue that day and 2) call me back to confirm.  No refund was issued and no call back happened.  

I have worked in the in industry and mistakes do happen.  It's how you respond to those mistakes is what matters.  Libretto's was given 2 strikes to fix this simple issue and they didn't.  They have lost my business due to apathy.  All over some blue cheese.
