The outside looks very nice and the banquet hall is freshly renovated.But omg how can people be so disorganized? They can't tell you their price (initially they said 85 per person, but when we came to our appointment they said the minimum price is around 115 per person), they can't communicate the time you have to be there, leaving only 15 minutes for your appointment..this is how they treat their potential customers?
