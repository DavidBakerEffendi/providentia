I cant say I was expecting a 5 star experience at Winchells. I only stopped in because its next to the brake place my car was dropped off at. Donuts are not very good here and neither was the coffee. 

The worker started cleaning the display case with glass cleaner while we were still eating, which made the entire dining room immediately smell like chemicals. I think the only reason I felt a certain way about the glass cleaner was because I had my 3 year old son with me.

I will have to bring my car in to the same brake place in a couple of months, but I definitely wont be coming back to Winchells
