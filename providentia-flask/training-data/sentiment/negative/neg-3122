There is nothing more frustrating than to have a host person tell you an expected wait time -- first 1 hour-- and then while having a drink at one of their bars -- to learn it was now going to be 2 hours.  They are clearly disorganized and the hype of a new place will soon pass. But they got $150 for two rounds of drinks for 6 people out of us! It is not worth the wait. We went down the street and had a great meal at nine 0n nine . We'll never go back because of the poor customer service .
