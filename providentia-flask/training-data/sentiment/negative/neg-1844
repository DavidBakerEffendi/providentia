I would give them 0 stars if it was available. This is the worst jimmy johns in the area. The manager has a bad attitude and makes you feel stupid. Let me tell you about the last time I was there a few weeks ago.

Granted it was about 1:30 an and was relatively busy.

I ordered a few club lulu sandwiches with cheese and a bag of BBQ chips. The sandwich was made by the time the cashier swiped my card.  We sat down near the soda machine and munched away on our sandwiches and talking about random events that took place during the nights adventures. As we finished up our sandwiches we decided to grab the BBQ chips on the way out because we got all fought up in conversation that I didn't get a chance to eat them. And yes I think the BBQ chips are there best option. 

K here's where the whole thing when down hill. As I started walking out I got grabbed and almost thrown down by one of the employees that was making the sandwiches. He grabbed the chips out of my hands and yelled "I Don't think so dude" and then he started telling people in the restaurant and the staff that I had already eaten my chips and that I was stealing another bag.! Are you freaking kidding?!! He assaulted me then embarrassed me in front of everybody because he thought I was stealing a freaking 1.50 bag of chips!!

I asked to speak to the manager, at this point I was furious. I explained to him and confirmed with the cashier that I paid for a bag of chips and the sandwiches. they were made so fast that we just sat down and ate the sandwiches and grabbed the chips on the way out. 

He said. " well that's bs, my employee says you already ate a bag of chips and I believe him over you so, unless you want to actually pay for something were done"

Just a bunch of poorly trained staff, who abide by there own set of rules. Poor poor jimmy johns. Actually disappointed they let this happen
