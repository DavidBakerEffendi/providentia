There is no more lunch buffet. They still serve the same food, but now you have to pick between two and three dishes, depending on which combo plate you pick. This means your variety is very much limited. What used to be a solid four-star buffet, is now a three-star Panda Express like experience. Sadly, I will not return. This was a very poor business decision.
