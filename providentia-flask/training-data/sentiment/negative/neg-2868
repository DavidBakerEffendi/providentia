HORRIBLE.
I had high hopes for this place because of what I have been hearing so I decided to try this place with my family.  The food looked appetizing, but don't be deceived, it was horrible.  Many of the food there was either dry, hard, or tasted weird.  The server was very nice and gave us quick service so I give this place a one star.  Other than that, stay away from this place!
