I'm not sure if this is my first 1-star...but I think it is!! :( A night that a few of us were stuck at work going through rush after rush at my shop, we decided to order take out. All of us ate none of it after taking a bite. The rice was salvageable, but everything else's flavor was so disappointing. Sorry guys :(
