I came here for wings on Monday April 13 around 8:30 p.m. 

This was the WORST resturaunt experience in my ENTIRE life. The reasons for this are:

1) The $3 lb of wings seems really appealing. Too bad it is EXTREMELY misleading. They give you 5 TINY wings and force you to order an (overpriced) drink with it. If you want to order another lb, you have to order ANOTHER drink. Your $3 lb turns into $18.

*Important to note: NO FREE REFILLS when a soft drink is $4. Ridiculous, right? 

2) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to go up FIVE seperate times to the bar.
The first time was to ask where our waitress was. The second was for napkins. Third was for the menu since their wing promotion was VERY disappointing. Fourth was for water. Fifth was to get our bill. 

*Note- you would think the waitress would come to your table since you asked for a menu which means you were contemplating ordering more food. Stupid.

*She also did not ask how anything was. 

3) They charge you an extra DOLLAR for dipping sauce.... when it should come with one. There is also no carrots or celery. 

4) Our server was too busy flirting with old men to give proper customer service.  

There were only two or three servers so Manager if your reading this you should probably try to go through your chits and see who ordered 2 lbs of BBQ wings, 1 Diet Coke and 1 Sprite, and see who the server was. I don't know her name because she did not have the decencey to even introduce herself.

I will NEVER come to this bar again. Neither should anyone reading this.
