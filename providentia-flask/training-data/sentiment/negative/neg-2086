This location has disappointed me yet again... I ordered a large hummus with 3 wheat pitas to go. I barely got any hummus, it looks like they took a small hummus and put it in a large container, I didn't get the extra pita I paid for and the pitas I did get were white not wheat and ice cold. What a rip off! I definitely won't be back to this location again.
