Was fooled by the signage. The face of the shop says wicked fast. They have a sign near the register that says how long the oven is taking to cook that day. Was in the shopping center at lunchtime & decided to give it a try. 
 What I didn't know was that they don't have pizza by the slice. They build, then bake a personal pizza on pre-made dough that's just sitting out when you order it. The time it takes to cook it wasn't that much faster than anywhere else. Ordered the mini, cause really just wanted a slice not a whole pizza. The mini is too small & the regular is too big for one person. (see photo) 
 It tasted fine but not any better than any other place. 
 There is no reason to go there again.
