THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MENU!!! I had to wait for the cashier to give me a pamphlet that was hidden to the side of the cashier. My food was undercooked and the service was disgusting. If only health and safety committees could inspect my mental safety this location would not be around, why? Because the staff drove me insane. As I called to complain and obtain contact of the owner the employees knew nothing. Also, they knew nothing about there own food. I would call this place terrible but it would be a compliment.
