During dinner a cockroach crawled up the wall right next to our table. The service was horrible! The bruschetta was bland and one of our pizzas were burnt and had to be sent back. The margarita pizza tasted like it had canned tomato sauce on it. At the end of dinner, I went to use the restroom and it looked as though it had not been clean in months. It's in a great location with great potential but the owner/manager is not doing their job. This place was a complete let down!
