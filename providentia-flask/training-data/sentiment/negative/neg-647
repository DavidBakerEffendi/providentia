This is probably one of the worst Chinese restaurants I have ever been to.

We tried ordering the classic salted fish eggplant dish and they told us it was not available, then we tried ordering the lamb stew hot pot, which is another classic Cantonese dish and they told us it will take 40min-1h.
We finally placed out order of Cantonese fried noodles, shrimp in lobster sauce and fish and tofu hot pot. The food arrived pretty fast but the service was terrible. Instead of placing the dish in the centre of a table for 2, they place it half on the corner and I had to make sure that the dish didn't fall on the floor as soon as it arrived.
The shrimps with lobster sauce was under seasoned, flavourless and under cooked. The tofu in the hot pot was good but the fish was way over salted. I don't even know where to begin with the Cantonese fried noodles... Way over sauced, noodles were mushy, and who puts celery in Cantonese fried noodles?!
Only good thing was that portions were ok...

Looking around me, the one table behind me left without eating half their food... Looked like Cantonese fried noodles and salt and pepper shrimps... The other table on the other side waited for their menu for 10mins and the finally went to get menus themselves (great service...)

I would definitely not recommend this place...
