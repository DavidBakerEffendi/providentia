Complete rip off. Paid a premium of 20.99 for lobster and jumbo shrimp linguine and what I got is nowhere near the price I paid for. Got couple bits and pieces of lobster like a dog chewed on it. Jumbo shrimps were just regular sized shrimp. The server was great tho but doesn't make up for the bad food.
