Great atmosphere! Crap service and management. 
Lets start  with our first impression. Show up and only a 15 minute wait with seats available at the bar on the corner. That's awesome for a  Saturday night! Told the hostesses we would be sitting on the corner of bar right by us ( 2 calls, apparently she can take a number but not notes) Not a hard position, my dear.

We order a couple margaritas from a friendly bartender. Drinks were good and his service was attentive. Your doing this restaurant a big favor.

That's when this review goes bad. We were then seated outside in beginning of March at 8p. Weather had changed to getting cool fast. Hello Mr or Ms Manager. When people have thier arms close to thier bodies and hands between thier legs, it should be a sign to stop standing around and start making sure paying guests are comfortable. Look around, be observant it's almost half the patio doing the same thing. Train your staff. Yes, I've managed for 15yrs and it's not rocket science. That's why your owner bought the outdoor heaters. 
Our waiter was overwhelmed. We saw him twice. Order was right except for the extras we order did not come. I informed him on my girls last couple bites. And then he wanted to go grab them, no thanks! Too late, you should check with your tables within the first few mins of thier food arrival. However, he wouldn't have known. He didn't even bring our food out , nor did he pick up our check. We checked ourselves out...and your lucky we are not thieves. 10+ min to pick up a cc is unacceptable after u drip it off. Btw, u are welcome for the tip ..you didn't deserve it.
Note to owner: if you need a consultant for you nice restaurant feel free to contact my company. Apparently your managers are failing you as this is our second bad experience, but food is good. I have people on my staff with 20+yrs of experience.
