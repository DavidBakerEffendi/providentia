Sadly I experienced the same lack of appreciation for business as others have noted.  Walked in and although there was a guy at the front he not only didn't he say hello or I will be right with you he failed to make any eye contact and walked away.  Others came in after me and the same lack of welcoming guests.  Waited a short time and departed to give our business to a place that appreciates it.  Sad because the food was good the previous times we ate there.  Management needs to step up and train their employees or this place will be out of business
