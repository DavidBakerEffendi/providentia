Customer service suck!!! Been seating for over 25 minutes. They didn't bother to give me hot tea or water. I got all my food, the serving was very little and the price is averaging $12-$16 per order. I was eating still hasn't give me MY water!!!! I had to asked them! My water run out, they just starring at my glass with ice. "I guess they're waiting till my ice melted down" ~__~ really unprofessional business. Overall to be honest I will not come back here. I check two restaurant next door and they were really busy and packed of customer then I just decided to go to empty one, but I didn't know the place was empty because they suck. ~__~ wasted about $46.00 meal. Ohh well I learn my lesson.
