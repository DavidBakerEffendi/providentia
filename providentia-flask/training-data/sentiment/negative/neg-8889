If I could I would go into the negative numbers. I wanted to take my wife out for a nice lunch, and she loves Crepes. Me, not such a fan, but she loves them. I thought I'd go for the Quiche. Nope they ran out of quiche. Ok, so I go for the turkey and Swiss. We also order two Lattes. I go to pay and give them a $100 bill. They can't change that. I'm ok with that, so I give two twenties. They can't change that either and the cashier starts asking the other staff if they have any dollars on them. Then I'm told their out of turkey. I'm done. Cancel my order. Now the cashier has to do some basic math to figure out how much she has to give me. OMG!!!!  So I go out and gets dog from Short Leash which is right across. BTW great dogs. I get my dog and go back to sit with my wife. She is still waiting, not even her coffee. So we wait. I eat my dog. Now I'm done. My wife is still waiting. Finally they bring the coffee. It's wrong. It's not done very well either. We wait longer and finally my wife has had it. We cancel our order, get our money back and leave. What was meant to be a pleasant afternoon lunch became one of the most aggravating dining experiences I can remember in a long time. This place should be ashamed and should reconsider being in the restaurant business. Avoid this place at all cost. There are so many good places to eat. And if you want crepes, just make them yourself. It isn't that hard.
