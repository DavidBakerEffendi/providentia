Owner is cheap and dishonest. 

We ordered a set for 10 people. The order is one of those dinner set for 10 people. it has 8 different dinner entrees and we added an additional one. The menu said there was fish, but the what we got was a cheap plate of vegetables stir fried with 4/5 slices of fish (that's not even enough for 10 people). Also 3 of the 10 dishes wee the same. All three had green peas, mushroom and stir fried the same way. One was served with cashew, one with peanuts, one with some kind of other stuff. My guest were like WTF? 3 of the same stuff? 

just wow!
also the tab didn't show the same price but a little higher. they overcharged the additional order that we put in. 

i say, go buffet for 7 bucks @ the South Point Hotel. Cheaper and better.
