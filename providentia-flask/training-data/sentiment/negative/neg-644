I had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time, seeing as though they have options for vegetarians like me. We get there and there are only about six people in the restaurant. Our waiter is attentive at first but things slowly grew worse and worse. This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I ordered the veggieball parmigiana , now here's the tricky part apparently. All I asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese. I wanted the  whole sandwich to be meat free and just have non vegan cheese. Simple enough right? Wrong, I thought the server's head was about to pop off. He simply could not grasp this simple order, the sandwich comes with a side so I ordered the salad. So time goes on and he brings out my order, ya not so much. He brings out veggieballs I will give him that, but it's an appetizer not the sandwich I ordered. So he takes it back and brings out my salad. Then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries. I didn't ask for fries I asked for the salad side. So now I'll be charged for a salad and fries. I'm with my boyfriend, who is not a vegetarian, and the server says that his order will be out in thirty seconds. TEN minutes go by and my food is getting cold because I would like to eat at the same time as my boyfriend. The server finally comes over and says it's going to be a little while because they made two veggie sandwiches. Why did they do this?! My boyfriend ordered a sausage sandwich! So now that's two food orders they have to throw out because the server is incompetent. Enough was enough. I gulped down my wine and asked for the check. I paid for my salad and my wine because that's all I ate. Nothing was comped and I spent ten bucks on a wilted salad and a glass of wine. Grossly inadequate and unacceptable. It wasn't a busy night and I was not being unreasonable. I will never be back here again.
