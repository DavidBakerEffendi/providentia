I have tried this place twice.  It is very popular, always crowded, and has a nice ambiance.  That being said, plain and simple- the food is bad.  The chicken marsala was the worst I have ever eaten and at $16, was not a good value.  I probably should have sent it back.  While their pizza is OK, at $12-15, I would rather go to a number of other places that are far superior such as Sauce, Fired Pizza, Pizza Me, Crust, or Grimaldi's.  It is always a puzzle to me why places that often have such mediocre food and prices can be so popular, but I would imagine it has to do mostly with the atmosphere.
