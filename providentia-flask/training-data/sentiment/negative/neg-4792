My family(15+ ppl) and I came yesterday to celebrate a baptism and my birthday. We got there and the reservation was under my uncles' name and they already choosed and paid for the dishes they selected for each table.  The waitress was badgering us appetizers/soups but we didn't know that it was extra.... most of it didn't taste really good especially the tripe/liver which made me gag.The basic Chinese food like the sizzling beef, mushrooms, chow mein was really good though. However, the lack of customer service pissed me off. My relative was going to pay but the amount of money they charged was crazy and they added dishes we didn't even have; the manager literally got up in my uncle's face yelling at him and his wife and made her cry by telling them that they're going to call the police. That is not how you treat a customer.  We are never going back because of how we were treated. Overall: the food gets a 3/5 and customer service gets -2/5. I hope they don't treat other customers like that.
