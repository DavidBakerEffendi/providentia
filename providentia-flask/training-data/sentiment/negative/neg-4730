I went for dinner on a Sunday night.  The atmosphere was great, the crowd was great, the tables were clean, and the food was good.  I had the mac and cheese burger and my companion had the Sun's Up burger (the one with the egg).  Our meals were quickly delivered to the table and delicious.  

The first impression of our server was that she was a nice person.  It was disturbing that we heard her address other patrons as sir and ma'am and used a formal and professional voice.  When she spoke at our table she changed her voice (tone and inflection) to sound more "black" and used popular slang terminology.  We were blatantly treated differently.  

I did not want to drink more than one beer and the server called me a wet rag, no fun, and rudely chided me for choosing to drink less.  My companion ordered a drink and was told "we kicked that off last night", we were unfamiliar with this term and the server rudely explained that it meant they were out, then said "no mas, do you understand when I say it like that?"  

The company webpage said all food was 10% off on Sundays, but that was not reflected on our bill.  

The food, cleanliness and atmosphere were stellar.  But our server really ruined the experience.
