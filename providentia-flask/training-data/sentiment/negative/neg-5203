Awful service and food.
We were a party of six and spent a $100 on pizza and salad.
sorry to say that the pizza was bland and salad was awful.
We asked for an extra scoop of dressing since what we got for the large salad for a 1 teaspoon of dressing. That included about ten pieces of lettuce and four shavings of vegetables.
I am not sure what the fuss is about this place Nellos beats this anytime.
Was so excited to go there too There was a guy wandering around asking the tables if everything was good but never approached us at all  not sure something to do with being the only ethnic people there.
The waitress never came to ask us if we needed anything but did make sure to ask us to leave cos a big party had reserved the table. However NO ONE was waiting outside at all to get in. Thanks!!!
