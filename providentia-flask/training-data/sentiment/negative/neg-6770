I am extremely appreciative of the way madhouse has handled my previous complaint. Management made sure to reach out and has completely made up for the incident that made me feel negative towards their business. They continue to brew the best cup of coffee in town (and the best chocolate croissants) and now that their staff has been adjusted I will continue to be a loyal customer. Major thumbs up to mad house for their customer service!
