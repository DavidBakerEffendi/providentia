Worst pizza I ever had . I was too hungry and had been there to eat pizza . I waited 15 minutes and the pizza come . I notice I would like to eat there but they gave me in Togo box . It's was over cooked . Too dark at back of pizza . I don't want to recomand anyone there to get pizza . Better go somewhere else . Waste of money and time   Worthless place ....
