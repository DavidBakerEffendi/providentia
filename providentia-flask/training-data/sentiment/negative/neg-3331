A group of us went thinking you could get breakfast lunch and dinner all day and night.  You can't we heard of the pot roast burrito it was just as great as everyone said.  A few weeks later we went back we could no longer get the burrito at the time we went. The service was slow and the food was cold. We complained waitress just said sorry then continued on her way she didn't offer to heat it up or replace it . This place went downhill so fast
