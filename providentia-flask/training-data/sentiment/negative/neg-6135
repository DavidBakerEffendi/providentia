I used to enjoy this place alot. It has been a while since I've returned. The staff and look has changed a bit since but they are still nice. Unfortunately far as service and quality I was a bit under satisfied. For 2 potatoe scrambles and a half waffle we waited nearly a half hour. The kitchen itself had more than 6 people in it, the establishment itself had 3 parties that came after us and that was it for patrons in the restaurant. We watched parties get served and finished there entire meal before we even got ours. I could totally understand if they were busy but to have that many staff In the kitchen and to have so many open tables and having patrons wait that long i can't understand. Unfortunately I will not be coming back. To add to it, we ordered take out, and on the bottom of all 3 of our to go boxes were all holes. Why do take out boxes have holes on the bottom???? My rating was at 5, now down to 1. Staff you were nice but unfortunately quality of service was just not what it used to be....
