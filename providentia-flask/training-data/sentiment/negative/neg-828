Waitress wasn't attentive, didn't refill coffee... ordered water never got it. Asked for chocolate milk, brought regular milk. These were just some of the minor "issues" I had this morning when I decided to dine at Coco's.

Note to Coco's manager & waitstaff, when I go out to restaurants I at least expect my order to be delivered correctly.
