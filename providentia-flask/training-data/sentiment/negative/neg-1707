Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.
I really hate to give 1 star. You know how BAD you have to be to get 1 star!! I don't throw 1 stars around at all. Let me explain. I SPECIFICALLY asked the waitress about the VEGGIE burger. I am a vegetarian. She told me if was really good, lots of customers order it. So, I did too. It comes to me and I take a bite and I start getting worried. The end is PINK, and I've NEVER EVER had a veggie burger PINK before. I am staring at it and I see red and green specks, so I ASSUME it's red and green peppers. I take another SMALL bite. It tastes like meat. I call waitress over and ask, is this the veggie burger?? She says yes. I said, I've never ever had a veggie burger that tasted so much like meat. She once again tells me, yes, it's a veggie burger. I am STARING at it. I can't eat it. Something is wrong and I know it. About 2 seconds later the manager comes over and says "I'm sorry. We made a mistake. That is a TURKEY burger. The waitress got confused. Lots of people order veggie burgers but they mean turkey burgers". I almost PUKED. I haven't eaten chicken or poultry in TWELVE years!!! It makes me SICK TO MY STOMACH. I would have rather them give me beef than turkey. The manager comped the whole meal and gave me a 50% off coupon to come back. YEAH FREAKIN RIGHT! They are lucky I dont sue them. I am NOT kidding when I say I suffered mental anguish. The thought of turkey in my mouth made me vomit. I puked several times that night. I went home and was SICK TO MY STOMACH. LITERALLY. It was the attic and the basement (I hope you know what I mean). This was truly traumatizing. I still shudder when I think about it. I will NEVER EVER recommend them. I have been told to sue them, and believe me I'VE CONSIDERED it. I was mouth r*ped by a turkey burger. (Sorry to be so graphic.) But it's true and how I feel. Please stay away from here. NEVER EVER go. It's a BAAAAAD BAAAAAD place.
