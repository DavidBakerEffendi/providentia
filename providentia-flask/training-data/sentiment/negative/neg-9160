Wow. Fail. We used to order food with them a lot, particularly because I have celiac and they're known to be celiac safe. 

Tonight we ordered - all from their specific Gluten Free Menu - gluten free chicken Parmesan, gluten free cheese ravioli, and a gluten free Caesar salad. Usually we get pizza. 

Upon opening our food containers, the ravioli were not great but decent (and I hadn't had ravioli in years!) and the gf chicken Parmesan came with spaghetti. My boyfriend and I shared both items. After we were halfway through both dishes, we took the salad from the bag and saw that it had giant croutons on it. I even gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought those might be gluten free - until we called. 

We were informed that they had messed up our order and the gf chicken Parmesan was supposed to come with gf ravioli; the spaghetti were never gluten free!! We were refunded but that doesn't make my stomach ache go away. 

Please don't trust them if you have celiac. I'm really sick now just because they can't read and/or process orders right.

Never again, Biaggio. I hope the owner reads this so he can understand how serious celiac is. I work in food service, and if I served gluten containing food to someone with celiac I would be fired before I can say celiac! Very, VERY upsetting. Please don't come here. These people do NOT care about their customers.
