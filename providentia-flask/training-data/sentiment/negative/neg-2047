Tried to call in an order for pick up ...no answer for 45 mins..went through uber eats ...only to get delivered the WRONG ORDER... show up to the EXPRESS where they attempt to correct just to get home and find out the order is still wrong. I have patronized this place for 7 years. Even after reaching out to the  owner and letting him know about the experience, he passed along to his brother who runs this location.  It's  been over 10 days with no response. No attempt to apologize or make right. I truly love supporting small businesses but this one just lost my loyalty.  My dollars may not run the place but my loyalty was there. I spent $ there, even held an event at a location,  recommended it to others and out of towners for hometown flavor.  Time to find a new place. So sad that a  little success makes you look beyond the "little people"
