Stingiest Chipotle in Vegas!!!
$6-8 for a small amount of food and the food is not fresh, they let it sit for a long time. (The employee said) The chipotles on the strip give more than this location and most the chipotles on the strip give a little amount with higher prices.
The people that work at this location are also very lazy, they only have one person working the front and the others talking in the back.
