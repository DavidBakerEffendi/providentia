Awful. My Eggs were over cooked, but the Bell peppers were raw.. And there was no way my omelette was 3 Eggs, it was so small. My toast was burned and and swimming in butter, my bacon was burned and the hash browns were undercooked. There was 5 of us in my party and ALL of our food was awful.. How in the world is this place getting good reviews?? Our server was a space cadet as well, she spilled the same cup of orange juice twice.
