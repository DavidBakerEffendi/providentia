I was at the grocery having coffee and Beignets at 11am and checked with the lady at the counter if there would be any issue getting in with 10 of us at 5pm for happy hour. She assured me that wouldn't be a problem as Thursday's are slow around 5pm. Not one mention that a reservation would be needed. 
Initially we arrive at 4:40 said we had 10 confirmed, 8 show up. The host said we could have the table for 10 until the 7 o'clock reservation. We agreed. When the server arrived he was rude from the get go! Pushing food and when we said we'd order after drinks he became quite short with us and rude. When 2 of the ladies ask for suggestions he walked away, then again he walks away when asked for the bill, said not right now. We had 8 people, drinking and ordered food. I spoke with the owner and basically  said there was nothing more he could do! The first 2 guest left not even paying there full bill with them putting everything together on one bill plus the 20% gratuity. When they left after the treatment we canceled the food. They made us move to the bar. Then left to sit there with no further service. We had to ask for our bill which included drinks and service that wasn't even ours. We certainly don't recommend this place after this sort of treatment. One server for entire place, while the owner seemed to enjoy just watching the chaos!
Obviously not a successful business! 
NOW OUT OF BUSINESS!
