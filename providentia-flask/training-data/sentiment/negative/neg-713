Came here because I thought that it would be similar to the ones in Atlanta.

The menu is the same; the service, however, is a lot different.

They are slow....as hell. As I'm sitting here with my stomach literally touching my spine (we've been sitting, at this point, for over 34 minutes waiting for our order), I'm starting to wonder if someone had to fly to Japan to get some fish out of their water to serve us in Charlotte.


Definitely don't come here if you're about to die from hunger because well, you just might.

PS: the bald guy (I'm assuming is the owner) literally forces a smile. Anyone who can't speak to a baby when a baby speaks is an assh*le off rip.

PS2: our waiter was nice and super cute. I want to put emphasis on this because he is not responsible for the kitchen's goings on and will be tipped accordingly.
