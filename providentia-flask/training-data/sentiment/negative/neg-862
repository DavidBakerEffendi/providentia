Wow, I just called them to ask one simple question about take outs and the girl who answered the phone was SO fucking rude and she hung up on me when I wasn't even done and she also had an attitude going on. The food may be good but if their staff has this kind of attitude, it's not worth going. It was a young girl I believe. So disrespectful.
